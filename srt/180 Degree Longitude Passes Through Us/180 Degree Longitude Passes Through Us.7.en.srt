1
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,844
"180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us"

2
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:06,400
(Previously)
- Honey, did you watch me on TV? - Yes, I did.

3
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:09,600
Is In there? Can I talk to him?

4
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:16,822
I know Dad wouldn't blame you
because he loved you.

5
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:22,555
I don't blame you because I love you.

6
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:50,733
In.

7
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,000
Say something. Please.

8
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:04,777
I don't know about you.

9
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,533
But for me,

10
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:19,666
my time here with you so far

11
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:25,577
has been one
of the greatest joys in my life.

12
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,240
I've been looking for this for all my life.

13
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:41,555
But if you want to cut it short,

14
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,200
if you insist you want to be alone,

15
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:57,355
then I won't bother you.

16
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,088
Please, Ma'am.

17
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,577
Thank you.

18
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,022
The two biggest awards
of the night are mine!

19
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,133
Honey, are you happy for me?

20
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,244
I am, even though
I knew you would get them.

21
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:55,266
Where is In?

22
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,311
Congratulations on your win, our talented director.

23
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,022
My gosh. In.

24
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,000
What happened to you?

25
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:08,711
It happened when I was inspecting the bridge.

26
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,911
It's either I miscalculated
something or I happened to gain weight.

27
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:15,400
Don't let people find out about this.

28
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,177
It'll ruin your reputation.

29
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:20,511
- I'll take your belongings inside.
- Thank you.

30
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,133
What did you bring?

31
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:26,488
I'm thinking of holding a party here.

32
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:28,222
Will you be okay, In?

33
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,511
I was going to ask for your permission.

34
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,666
Let's go inside.

35
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:36,355
Let me help.

36
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:44,555
I want to invite my friends
and the crew to a party here.

37
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:48,888
Can I hold a party here, In?

38
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,266
With pleasure. Do as you please.

39
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:54,066
Think of my house as your holiday home.

40
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,422
You can even invite them to say.

41
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,533
No, that'd be rude.
They can stay in the city.

42
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:01,244
They'll just be here for the party.

43
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:02,533
I told them about it.

44
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,733
They're waiting for your approval.
These people are always up for parties.

45
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,053
You can tell them I approve.

46
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:11,222
You're so nice, In.

47
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:12,377
Thank you so much.

48
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:15,488
I'll take a shower and get dressed.

49
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:17,287
Tonight, let's celebrate
just the three of us.

50
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:19,955
Good idea. Where should we
go then? To the city?

51
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,088
You can't go anywhere
with one healthy leg.

52
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:25,844
I doubt you if can move comfortably now.

53
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:27,511
What do you mean one healthy leg?

54
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:30,066
I have three legs now. With this.

55
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:33,022
What do you think, Wang?

56
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:36,044
I don't want to go out.
Let's celebrate here.

57
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:38,333
I can cook you my signature dish.

58
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:40,866
And what is your signature dish?

59
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:42,355
All-in noodles.

60
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:45,355
I'm not eating that.

61
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:48,888
In, he may call it all-in noodles.

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But the dish is actually just
everything in the fridge thrown in together.

63
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:54,955
You'd be lucky not to get diarrhea.

64
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,577
I made it for him.

65
00:05:56,644 --> 00:05:59,400
He said it was so good
he was afraid he'd like it too much.

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,088
All right. All right.

67
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:04,377
Let Sangkam handle the food.

68
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:06,155
What do you want me to handle, Sir?

69
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:09,244
The food tonight. We're celebrating
her success at the award show.

70
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:10,755
All right.

71
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,244
These people party like crazy.

72
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,644
What do you think I should major in?

73
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,488
You don't like your current major?

74
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,800
It's not something I'm passionate about.

75
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:42,377
Why are you asking me
this all of a sudden?

76
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:44,777
Does that mean
you want to study for real now?

77
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,244
It's because family is politics.

78
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:51,022
I get it.

79
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,244
What do you think?

80
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,644
What should I major in?

81
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,533
I don't have the right answer.

82
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:03,511
If you want a job
according to your talent,

83
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:07,177
I'd say tourism or geography.

84
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
What if I don't want to study for a job?

85
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
What should it be?

86
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,133
Then you should major
in your passion, philosophy.

87
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:17,644
How do you know me so well?

88
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:23,555
You don't want to travel for enjoyment.

89
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:26,688
You want to travel to look
for a certain meaning.

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,711
You know so much about geography
not because you want to make a map.

91
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:59,800
But because you want to look
for a place where something lies.

92
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,555
And what is that something?

93
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:06,288
You know what it is.

94
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:09,871
Yeah, but I'm asking,
do you know what it is?

95
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,244
It's the meaning of life.

96
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:17,902
And a place where your heart belongs.

97
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:24,288
What would you say if I were to transfer here?

98
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:31,311
What are you talking about?
You look so tense.

99
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:35,533
Can I join you?

100
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:52,488
And the whole thing ended, but I had to
be at the venue for another hour.

101
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:56,155
All the reporters wanted to
ask me questions and for photos.

102
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,711
You'd think I'm an actress.

103
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:01,111
All I had to do was
pose with my awards and smile.

104
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:05,977
I smiled to the left and right.

105
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,422
My face hurt so bad.

106
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:11,022
I couldn't let them know
I was tired or upset.

107
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:16,088
And all of a sudden,
this reporter came out of nowhere.

108
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,000
She held the mic
in front of me and asked,

109
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,488
"What do you think it means
for our country..."

110
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:32,066
"that your drama won
over the other four BL dramas?"

111
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,200
I was flabbergasted.

112
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,377
But even then, I didn't need her
to repeat the question.

113
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,266
I simply replied with a smile.

114
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:45,000
We're two different people.

115
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:49,933
Of course, we can look at the same incident and see two different things.

116
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,777
Tonight, I won an award.

117
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:55,844
It's natural that I think of my winning over
the other four nominees as an achievement.

118
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:58,955
Now let me ask you.

119
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:03,711
What do you think of my win tonight?

120
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:08,333
It was like she had been
waiting for that moment.

121
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:13,266
She said it so proudly.

122
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:17,244
“I think it means that this country
doesn't really care about LGBTQ+ people

123
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,155
and thinks of them as something
that exists for entertainment.”

124
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:24,800
“When it comes to rights
and equality, the silence is deafening.”

125
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:28,088
Oh my God. She got that
from me wining a award?

126
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:30,688
Obviously, she was trying to set me up.

127
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:34,311
She probably thought
I would fall for her trap and say,

128
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:36,466
“That's not the case here.”

129
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:40,640
“I won because my show ticked
all the boxes and was the better drama.”

130
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,000
Pa-lease! If I were to have said that,
the four other nominees would definitely turn on me.

131
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,555
So, what did you say to her?

132
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:52,666
I looked at her with my powerful eyes.

133
00:10:56,177 --> 00:11:02,133
And then... I smiled at camera one
and said it in the sweetest voice.

134
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:07,577
“I think me winning here tonight doesn't
reflect anything about our country.”

135
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:13,288
“That's not the job for our dramas.”

136
00:11:13,844 --> 00:11:19,488
“The committees picked me
because of my show.”

137
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:22,866
“They didn't pick me
because they support discrimination.”

138
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:27,533
“Don't look for a problem where there
isn't one. It's a waste of time for everyone.”

139
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,911
And then I smiled again at camera two.

140
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,733
Let's clap for her, shall we?

141
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,955
As exacted from your sharp mouth.

142
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,088
You know, Wang.

143
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:44,977
Your mom has always been quick on her feet.

144
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:48,146
You know nothing, In. Sometimes I intentionally
pretend not to notice a certain thing.

145
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:51,511
I did it just now by not acknowledging
Wang's claps as an act of sarcasm.

146
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,155
See? In.

147
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:55,826
I was genuinely happy for her
and she said I was being sarcastic.

148
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:59,066
But honestly, I think that reporter was right.

149
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,511
That's because you share her beliefs.

150
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,177
I loved your acceptance speech.
Right, Wang?

151
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:10,044
Yes, it was impressive.

152
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:13,266
Yes, that word. Impressive.

153
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,511
And how did that reporter react?

154
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:18,977
She disappeared into the crowd.

155
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:21,866
She was probably mad at me
and took it out on her SNS.

156
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,266
Do you know what her fans call me?

157
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,755
They call me a boomer.

158
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:29,400
But I don't care.

159
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:34,333
The funny thing is this reporter
came up to me and asked

160
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:39,400
if I want to make
my next project a BL drama.

161
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:42,186
You mean, Engraved in Your Heart?

162
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:43,577
Yes.

163
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:45,155
Think about it.

164
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:50,733
A young man falls in love
with his uncle? I want to laugh.

165
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:58,733
This is weird.

166
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:02,800
You're not drinking tonight.

167
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,791
It's a non-alcohol day for Buddhists.

168
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,242
I can't tell if you're serious
or just messing with me.

169
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,377
You can't seriously
think I'm an atheist?

170
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,040
I didn't know you were religious either.

171
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,576
There are a lot of things
you don't know.

172
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,577
Whenever it's a non-alcohol day,
I refrain from drinking and pray.

173
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:18,555
Dear God, make every day
her non-alcohol day.

174
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:23,022
You kid probably wants you to cut down on alcohol.

175
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,133
Right, Wang?

176
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,844
Please, you don't have to
make an excuse for his behavior.

177
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:35,110
Now tell me. What did you do
when I was in Bangkok?

178
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,822
You seem to have gotten closer.

179
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:38,688
We didn't do anything specific.

180
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:40,697
All we did was just
get to know each other.

181
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:42,222
Now tell me, honey.

182
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,222
What did you learn about your uncle?

183
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:48,244
A lot. I learned a lot.

184
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:51,933
Mol.

185
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:54,600
Did you tell your friends I'm okay with the party?

186
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,311
Yes, I forgot to tell you.

187
00:13:58,577 --> 00:13:59,933
The party will be on Saturday.

188
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:01,531
There will be just a few people.

189
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,111
I only invited those who are close.
It won't be more than ten.

190
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,000
And can we leave on Sunday, Wang?

191
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:11,200
What? Why such a hurry?

192
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,400
I don't want to be a burden.

193
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,911
I know how much you enjoy your privacy.

194
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,422
But that's not the case.

195
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:19,844
I have to go back to start
working on my new project.

196
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:23,822
That means you'll leave in three days.

197
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:30,333
Then tomorrow, I'll call a hotel
to make some special dishes for us.

198
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:35,666
Let me do something for this old friend
of mine before she leaves.

199
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:39,911
I want to celebrate your success
and us meeting each other again.

200
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:44,355
It's also for your birthday.

201
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:50,755
You're so nice to me
just like in the old days.

202
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:55,466
But just don't buy any more wine.
I've brought mine.

203
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,755
I can't believe it.

204
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:07,066
Us meeting each other again
after all this time.

205
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,400
Us holding hands. Like this.

206
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,111
As if it's been a day, not years.

207
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,066
How did you get here?

208
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,377
I'm about to go inside.

209
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,244
You have to let me help you.

210
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,520
What if you got into another accident?

211
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,422
I don't think it'll happen.

212
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:07,222
As long as I'm careful.

213
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:09,866
All right.

214
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:11,937
I know you're careful about everything.

215
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,088
I've made up my mind.

216
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:18,977
What do you mean?

217
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,660
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

218
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:37,533
What sort of surprise is so important
that you had to drag me here?

219
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,488
I want to study.

220
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:45,666
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

221
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:56,844
Let's stop here.

222
00:16:57,044 --> 00:17:01,022
What sort of surprise is so important
that you had to drag me here?

223
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:04,288
I don't want you to go crazy and
make it a big deal in the house.

224
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:09,111
Oh, my. What you're about to tell me
will make me go crazy?

225
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:11,133
Your girlfriend is coming to my party?

226
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:14,511
No, I've changed my mind.

227
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:17,000
What do you mean?

228
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,111
I want to study.

229
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:24,400
My god. Are you messing with me?

230
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,555
This is better than
winning those awards!

231
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,555
See? You are making it a big deal.

232
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,422
Well, I'm happy.

233
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,777
I can't believe it.

234
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:35,866
Now tell me, what's your plan?

235
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:38,930
You're going to be a sophomore next
semester and study until you graduate?

236
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,177
No, but don't be mad.

237
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,688
I won't.

238
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,088
I know what I want to major in now.
I want to start anew.

239
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:49,800
Start anew?

240
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:54,311
That's fine.

241
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:57,511
A year late isn't all that bad.

242
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:02,244
Won't you ask me
what I want to major in?

243
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:06,266
I'm fine with whatever
you want to study.

244
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,577
Really? I want to study philosophy.

245
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,555
Philosophy? You want to
study philosophy?

246
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:14,688
You said you were fine with everything.

247
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:17,822
Yes, I am.

248
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:19,666
It's just I'm shocked.

249
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,200
I mean, why philosophy?

250
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,377
You saw Aristotle in your dream or what?

251
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,711
I think deep down inside,
I've always wanted to study philosophy.

252
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,040
But I was only certain of it
when In said it was a good fit for me.

253
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:34,955
Inthawut.

254
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:41,377
I was right to ask him to get you
back on the right path.

255
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,844
I just didn't expect philosophy.

256
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,533
Where do you want to go to college then?

257
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:48,413
I want to move here for college.

258
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:51,577
Why here?

259
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,088
I love this place.
It's quiet. The air is fresh.

260
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,622
You know.

261
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,777
But it's more convenient at home.

262
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:04,600
If you want to study here, you have
to live alone in a dorm room again.

263
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:09,044
No dorm room.
I want to stay here. With In.

264
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:15,355
- What?
- I want to stay here with him.

265
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:25,244
Did Inthawut give you the idea?

266
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:28,911
Bangkok has so many good colleges.

267
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,325
- I don't see why it has to be here.
- It wasn't his idea.

268
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:32,644
It was mine.

269
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,822
And what's wrong with Bangkok?

270
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:38,511
- You can't stand living with me, right?
- That's not it. Be reasonable.

271
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:40,044
It's not that I can't stand you.

272
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:43,644
You can't stand me.
That's why you want to move here.

273
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:46,150
You're not being reasonable. Let's stop for now.

274
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,044
Why do you mean?

275
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:49,111
If you have something
more to say, just say it.

276
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:52,200
- Will you be able to handle it?
- You say it first.

277
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,644
I love In.

278
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:11,822
Is it true?

279
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:23,666
Is this the surprise
you mentioned earlier?

280
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,133
You must be disappointed in me.

281
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:18,866
Are you sure about this?

282
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:28,822
Is my love not enough?

283
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,311
Do I not take good care of you?

284
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,577
- Is that why...
- It isn't your fault or mine.

285
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:37,688
I'm just in love.

286
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:41,111
It doesn't matter with whom
or if it's a she or a he.

287
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,822
But it's Inthawut of all people.

288
00:21:56,577 --> 00:21:59,288
- Mol, want to go with me to the city?
- I'm not feeling well.

289
00:22:12,555 --> 00:22:14,195
I'm not surprised
that she's reacting this way.

290
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:20,444
Honestly,

291
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,133
I think she suspected it too
about my sexuality.

292
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:30,911
But she denied it.

293
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:34,911
That's not surprising.

294
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:40,355
I mean, people say they don't
care whether someone is gay.

295
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,111
But when it's someone
in their family, it's a problem.

296
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,311
The truth is people in that age say it's fine,

297
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
but it's just tolerance, not acceptance.

298
00:22:53,777 --> 00:22:55,400
But for Sasiwimol,
it's more complicated.

299
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,066
It's much more than
you liking men or women.

300
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:02,170
Her problem is it's you.

301
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,911
Can you tell me? What are you afraid of?

302
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,533
Are you afraid you'd lose your best friend?

303
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,866
The truth is you've already lost her.

304
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,133
You've already lost her.

305
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:31,466
What are you trying to save?

306
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:37,355
I may be young.

307
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:40,933
I still have a lifetime ahead of me.

308
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:45,955
But how long do I have to wait?

309
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,666
Do I have to wait until those people
die so I can love who I love?

310
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:56,888
The world isn't even theirs.

311
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:03,844
It wasn't theirs then.
It isn't theirs now.

312
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:08,800
You told me this, remember?

313
00:24:11,644 --> 00:24:12,888
Do you remember?

314
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:25,955
Now, will you tell me?
What are you afraid of?

315
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:37,711
I want to be with you.

316
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:44,066
I don't want to run
for the rest of my life.

317
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:47,822
There would be nothing to live for.

318
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:57,222
Now, will you tell me? What are you afraid of?

319
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:12,222
Look at me, In.

320
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:18,755
The kid who you met
for the first time a few days back.

321
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:24,422
But this kid had been
longing to know you for years.

322
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:35,577
I wanted to know why Dad
adored this brother of his.

323
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,400
I wanted to know if I met you,
would I feel closer to Dad somehow?

324
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:47,466
But no.

325
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:55,800
When I met you, it was like
I'd found Dad again inside me.

326
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:01,444
But I'm not like Dad.

327
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:05,977
Because I won't let you get away unlike him.

328
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:19,266
I love you.

329
00:26:22,444 --> 00:26:24,333
The way Dad loved you.

330
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,133
Let me take care of you for Dad.

331
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,680
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

332
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,333
In.

333
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:46,511
Do you have a minute?

334
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,044
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

335
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:06,933
I told Mom everything that morning,
but it was a complete failure.

336
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:16,377
That day, Mom didn't leave
her room until noon.

337
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:24,533
I think I can do it with
Sangkam and a few villagers.

338
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,466
I know you're upset.

339
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,177
But we have to get over it.

340
00:27:39,422 --> 00:27:41,111
Mom hasn't left her room since morning.

341
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:48,622
Now I understand
why you think everything is politics.

342
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:54,111
Because there's no way for me to know
what she's cooking in there.

343
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,888
Will she come out with a new strategy?

344
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,240
What should I do to counter it?

345
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:07,333
I feel like a typhoon is coming.

346
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,933
But we can't just sit around and do nothing.

347
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:15,577
That's why I want to work on the bridge.

348
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,333
Otherwise, I'll go mad.

349
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,666
That's why I want to do it.

350
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,755
If you're on my side,
I'll do what I have to do.

351
00:28:56,155 --> 00:28:57,715
I think your bridge will be done today.

352
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:00,235
No one will have to
break his leg jumping to and from anymore.

353
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:01,711
Are you tired?

354
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:05,066
Yes. But it will be worth it.

355
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,666
And it keeps me from thinking
about my issue with Mom.

356
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:12,488
I'll name the bridge after you.

357
00:29:14,444 --> 00:29:16,355
I don't deserve it.
It was all these villagers.

358
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,733
I think you should name it

359
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:21,866
either Villagers' Creation or Courtesy from Our Villagers.

360
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,822
But because of you,
the bridge is now done.

361
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:30,017
- Traditionally, it should be your name.
- I don't care about tradition.

362
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:32,044
But I'm intrigued though.

363
00:29:32,044 --> 00:29:34,220
As to what you'd call the bridge
if you were to name it after me?

364
00:29:34,244 --> 00:29:37,404
Please, refrain from those fancy names
like Wang Na Rue Mit (Created by Wang).

365
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:41,066
Wang. I want to call it Wang.

366
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:42,888
Just Wang.

367
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:48,577
Thank you. But please don't make it official.

368
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:51,262
I'm fine as long as you know what it's called.

369
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:17,000
Do you have a minute?

370
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:26,155
Mol.

371
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:29,177
You're feeling better now?

372
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:34,311
No. I don't think
I'll ever be fine again.

373
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:47,688
Wang told me he wanted to study philosophy this morning.

374
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:52,488
To tell you the truth,

375
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:55,973
I have nothing against it.

376
00:30:57,044 --> 00:31:01,644
In fact, I am really happy
he found his true passion.

377
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,600
But he wants to move here to study.

378
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,111
He said he wants to be here

379
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:12,800
where you are.

380
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:24,755
He said he loves you.

381
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:29,733
I understand why, though.

382
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,386
He lacks love and attention.

383
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,280
He practically grew up
in boarding school.

384
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:40,888
I may not be the best mom.

385
00:31:42,888 --> 00:31:46,600
But you know I love him.

386
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:51,644
Even then,

387
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:56,844
I guess it's not enough for him.

388
00:31:58,288 --> 00:31:59,755
I'm not enough for him.

389
00:32:00,355 --> 00:32:02,977
Mol. It's not your fault.

390
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,666
He doesn't have a dad.

391
00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:09,200
He misses his dad.

392
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:15,644
He didn't know anyone who
could be a father figure to him

393
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:21,266
until he found you.

394
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:26,555
And when he learned that you used to be close to Siam,

395
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:32,555
I think he mistook it for love.

396
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:37,488
I don't think it's love
but an obsession.

397
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:41,173
You know when a kid
meets his role model.

398
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,844
I think he loves you the way
a kid loves his role model.

399
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,814
I don't think the obsession
is that bad, he actually loves...

400
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:02,460
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

401
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:06,222
The bridge is now open to traffic.

402
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:08,800
The bridge you call Wang.

403
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:14,355
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

404
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,177
I think together
we can make him normal again.

405
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:34,377
Mol.

406
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,555
- He's normal. He isn't..
- You're not his mom.

407
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:41,200
Every mom wants the best for her child.

408
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:43,017
Of course, you don't know that.

409
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:46,688
You may think I'm conservative.

410
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:49,288
“The world isn't the same anymore.”

411
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:51,928
“It's not that big deal
of a deal being different.”

412
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:59,111
But for a mom, if it involves
her child, it is a big deal.

413
00:34:00,577 --> 00:34:03,400
Everything about him,
no matter how small, is a big deal.

414
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:12,088
In.

415
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:15,977
You know people better than we all do.

416
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,111
Put yourself in my shoes.

417
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:24,400
My life has been nothing
but a disappointment.

418
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,675
To a point where
I can't trust anyone anymore.

419
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:29,688
Except for Wang.

420
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:33,666
He's my only hope.

421
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:37,711
I can't lose him, too.

422
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:42,288
I already lost Siam.

423
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:48,488
Sure, I told myself, life goes on.

424
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:50,862
I know we have to
move on with our lives.

425
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:55,688
But that doesn't mean I've gotten over it.

426
00:34:56,488 --> 00:34:58,600
I can't lose my son, too.

427
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,622
Because I'd have no one.

428
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
In.

429
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,844
You understand, right?

430
00:35:09,444 --> 00:35:10,911
Do you understand?

431
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:22,755
You're not answering me.

432
00:35:25,777 --> 00:35:27,688
This is not good, In.

433
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:36,222
Are you sure it wasn't you who gave him that idea?

434
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:37,466
Mol.

435
00:35:40,911 --> 00:35:41,911
I'm sorry.

436
00:35:43,622 --> 00:35:48,155
Maybe I'm too protective of him.
Too concerned about him.

437
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,533
But is that so bad?

438
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:54,333
No, it's not. And it's not your fault.

439
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:58,622
You know how much I love you, right?

440
00:35:59,822 --> 00:36:01,844
I can do anything for you.

441
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:03,622
Yes, I know.

442
00:36:04,977 --> 00:36:07,177
That's why we're having this conversation.

443
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:11,111
I can't lose him.

444
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:19,266
In.

445
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,111
Can you do me a favor one last time?

446
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:28,066
Please?

447
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:36,866
If you love me, love Wang, love Siam,

448
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:44,466
I'll ask you one last time... please help me.

449
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:46,688
Don't be like this, Mol.

450
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:49,600
Please get up. Get up.

451
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,266
I won't ask you for anything anymore.

452
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:01,933
All I want is... for you
to give me my son back.

453
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,511
Please? In.

454
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:20,355
In.

455
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,777
The bridge is now open to traffic.

456
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,622
The bridge you call Wang.

457
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:54,577
We made it at last.

458
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,155
It's going to rain. Thank God
we're done with the bridge.

459
00:38:42,555 --> 00:38:45,733
You've barely touched your food.
You too, In.

460
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:52,933
You'll get sick if you drink
without food in the tummy, you know?

461
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:56,155
I'm not hungry.

462
00:38:57,955 --> 00:39:00,955
What about you? Eat this.

463
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:02,911
I'm not hungry, either.

464
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:17,133
You're finished?

465
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:24,155
Let's play some jazz.
It will lighten up the mood.

466
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Good idea.

467
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,044
I'm going to bed.

468
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,622
You're going to bed early to pray?

469
00:39:35,888 --> 00:39:37,422
I'll leave for Bangkok tomorrow.

470
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:43,177
What about the party this Saturday?

471
00:39:45,444 --> 00:39:46,533
I canceled it.

472
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:53,866
Why?

473
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:56,866
What about your friends?

474
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,377
I called them and canceled.

475
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:06,377
Something came up. I have to leave.

476
00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:09,688
That's too bad.

477
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,600
Also, I felt the party
would cause you unnecessary inconveniences.

478
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:19,111
I told you, didn't I?
You can do whatever you want.

479
00:40:19,111 --> 00:40:21,671
Can you guys stop with the pretense
and say what you want to say?

480
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:25,220
- What do you mean pretense?
- We're ignoring the elephant in the room.

481
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,866
Wang. Don't be rude.

482
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:29,111
What do you mean I'm rude?

483
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:31,844
You're completely aware of what's going on here.

484
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:35,355
We can't keep up the pretense
just for the sake of not being rude.

485
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:37,056
What you're doing is you're running away.

486
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,910
- Enough.
- You can't face the truth.

487
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,910
I'm not running away.
What is there to run away from?

488
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,777
I just think we should leave.

489
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:45,666
We should leave?

490
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:49,488
You can't say ‘we'
when it's all your decision.

491
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,511
- You have to go home with me.
- I'm not going.

492
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,955
I'm not going anywhere with you

493
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,660
unless you stop
running away from the truth.

494
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,444
I don't care about your truth.

495
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:04,530
Our life in Bangkok is the only
truth I know of and it will continue that way.

496
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,866
You can't keep running
from it forever.

497
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,333
You avoided discussing it with Dad, too.

498
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,480
You know what made him drive away
that night of the accident, but you lied.

499
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,570
What are you talking about?

500
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,644
Do you think I'm stupid?

501
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:17,666
Do you think I never suspected anything?

502
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:21,530
Do you think I'd mindlessly believe
you telling me that Dad died drunk driving?

503
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,333
Stop it. I said stop it.

504
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,888
Stop it, both of you.

505
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:39,044
I know you don't
want me to bring up Dad.

506
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:43,422
Because you're still
traumatized by what happened.

507
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:49,444
See? The wound is still there.

508
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:54,066
And time won't heal it.

509
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,000
If you don't want to talk about Dad,

510
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:07,111
then can we talk about me?

511
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,911
I love Dad.

512
00:42:18,555 --> 00:42:19,915
But he isn't here with me anymore.

513
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:24,466
I love you, Mom.

514
00:42:27,555 --> 00:42:30,533
But I feel sometimes
you don't know how lonely I am.

515
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:36,911
Is it so wrong if I'm in love

516
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:39,666
with someone who
can fill the void inside my heart?

517
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:48,577
Is it so wrong if I'm in love
with a man, not a woman?

518
00:42:56,022 --> 00:43:02,000
Is it so wrong if that man is Inthawut?

519
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:12,711
Is it so wrong if I'm in love
with someone who Dad used to love?

520
00:44:33,155 --> 00:44:35,688
(Next Episode)
I don't know how we all ended up in this place.

521
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:37,422
Is Wang with you?

522
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:40,066
No, he isn't here.

523
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,755
Where is he? It's late.

524
00:44:42,755 --> 00:44:45,488
Calm down, Mol.
Sangkam is looking for him.

525
00:44:45,777 --> 00:44:47,888
What do you mean, he drove away?

526
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:50,333
Siam did the same thing, too.

527
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,333
And he never came back.
