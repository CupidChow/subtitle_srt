1
00:00:55,933 --> 00:01:02,555
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

2
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:08,511
Not only did I get him to join my play,
I also got to bed with a rugby player.

3
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:09,555
Dad?

4
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:12,177
You do nothing all day
but obsess with that globe.

5
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:13,955
What responsibility
do you even shoulder?

6
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:15,955
At least be considerate of my feelings.

7
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:18,155
You must miss your dad a lot.

8
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:20,044
That's why I wanted to see you.

9
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:24,866
For her, you matter the most.

10
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,311
Thank you for being my voice of reason.

11
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:31,644
I'll apologize to her.

12
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:19,155
You're a morning person?

13
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:20,533
Yes.

14
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:22,644
Did you sleep well?

15
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:28,266
The weather here is nice.

16
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,577
You don't need air conditioners.

17
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:32,733
Was it cold last night?

18
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:37,244
I like it. Bangkok isn't cold like this.

19
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:43,933
I wonder if your mom woke up.

20
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,711
Don't worry about her.

21
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,822
She wakes up only after 9 a.m.

22
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:51,777
And it takes her an hour to get ready.

23
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:08,511
I'll take a shower.

24
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:10,222
After that, let's make
your breakfast together.

25
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,755
Don't forget your promise last night.

26
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:21,511
What promise?

27
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:24,311
Apologies to your mom.

28
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:41,666
Sangkam.

29
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:00,222
What is it?

30
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:04,200
Dad won't be coming in today.

31
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,088
It rained a lot last night

32
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:10,355
and ruined what we grew.

33
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,688
When will the bridge
be ready to use then?

34
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:14,000
Your dad can't keep doing this.

35
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,422
I can't answer that.

36
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:17,666
We'll probably have to wait
until the rainy season is over.

37
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:20,244
It'll be inconvenient
for you to come here.

38
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,888
- Yes.
- Give me the vegetables.

39
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,866
Here. Take this.

40
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,088
Thank you.

41
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,066
What do you have there, Sangkam?

42
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,266
- Fruit and vegetables.
- Where did you get it?

43
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:45,800
From the kids whose fathers we hired to work on the bridge.

44
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,644
We buy from them every morning
even though we don't have to

45
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:49,844
since they give us
more than we could eat in a day.

46
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,977
It must be the kids who
went into the creek just now.

47
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:54,066
That's right.

48
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:55,777
That's why he wanted
the bridge there in the first place.

49
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:57,333
For the villagers to cross over
without troubling themselves.

50
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,400
I don't know
when they'll get to use it though.

51
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,755
I mean, their fathers
won't be coming in today.

52
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:04,555
Let me. I'll bring it to In.

53
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:56,666
Fresh vegetables for you.

54
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:00,088
Where is Sangkam?

55
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:01,444
He's outside.

56
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,311
He told me the workmen
won't be coming today.

57
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
I can't say I'm surprised.

58
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:07,311
It did rain a lot last night.

59
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,044
Now when will the bridge
be ready for traffic?

60
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:11,133
Where should I put this?

61
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,133
On the counter there.

62
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:20,333
What are you making?

63
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:23,533
I'm grinding coffee beans.

64
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:29,333
Want some help?

65
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,844
No, thanks.

66
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:34,977
How do you usually take your coffee?

67
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,955
I usually make what's available.

68
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,711
I can’t afford to be meticulous
with everything like you.

69
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:41,044
What do they call what you do?

70
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,555
Art of Living?

71
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,600
You don't need to be meticulous.

72
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,244
All you need is a little attention.

73
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,800
And there you go.
You've found your art of living.

74
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:12,644
Sweet.

75
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,355
If I want to live
the meticulous way that you do,

76
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:25,977
I guess I'll have to learn a lot?

77
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:32,288
What matters is whether you live well.

78
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:35,400
Have you heard this?

79
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,488
People say coffee is 'black as hell'

80
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:41,288
'strong as death',

81
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,466
and 'sweet as love'.

82
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:48,644
Which one is your preference?

83
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:53,111
Black and strong.

84
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:02,466
I didn't know hell and death
smelled this good.

85
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:06,933
Do I smell coffee?

86
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,333
Good morning, In.

87
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:13,955
I slept like a baby
thanks to the weather.

88
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,844
I hope I didn't sleep in?

89
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,200
Normally, if it's my day off,

90
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:22,155
you won't see me
until the sun gets in my eyes.

91
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:28,377
Can I give you this cup of coffee
as my way of saying good morning?

92
00:09:29,822 --> 00:09:31,022
Oh, my.

93
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:33,266
What an honour.

94
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,000
And from my honorary barista, too.

95
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,355
Smells good.

96
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:44,666
But would you mind
if I add a little sugar?

97
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:45,955
Do as you please.

98
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,800
Wang, can you get me
the sugar there?

99
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:53,111
Is it this pot?

100
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,688
I promise it'll be just a little.

101
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:13,200
So refreshing.

102
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:17,422
I love sugar, but I'm not a sweet tooth.

103
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,733
I just feel life is more interesting
when it's a tad sweet.

104
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,355
Do you need help with anything?

105
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,577
Just go and sit at the table.

106
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:29,222
Both of you.

107
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:30,711
Come on.

108
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:35,044
The breakfast is almost ready.

109
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:37,888
Go wait for me at the table.

110
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:49,888
The food is ready.

111
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:50,977
My gosh. In.

112
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,888
It looks so good.

113
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:58,022
This is what you make every morning?

114
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,800
I just make it from what's at hand.

115
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,888
Coffee. Eggs. Fruit.

116
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,955
Every ingredient was locally grown.

117
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,422
Please, enjoy.

118
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,355
Do you call these what's at hand?

119
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,688
You don't know
what you're talking about.

120
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:13,044
A lot of people can't even afford
these ingredients in Bangkok.

121
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:15,444
I see.

122
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,711
Is this why you moved here?

123
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,377
Because of these ingredients
you have at hand?

124
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:21,644
In a way, you're right.

125
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:24,955
The ingredients here aren't fancy,
but enough to get you through the day.

126
00:11:25,288 --> 00:11:27,555
But what clinched it
was the peacefulness of the place.

127
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:31,822
I agree the place is quite peaceful.

128
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:34,311
But it's not right to say the ingredients
are enough to get you through the day.

129
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,088
The groceries could last you a year.

130
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:40,088
In, it's delicious.

131
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:41,688
It really is delicious.

132
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:43,711
Now, I'm flattered.

133
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,311
Then, you can't miss breakfast
while you're here.

134
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:50,911
I'll make it for you every morning.

135
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,755
I don't want to trouble you.

136
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:56,844
I don't even eat breakfast.
Normally, it's just coffee.

137
00:11:57,022 --> 00:11:57,955
Do as I told.

138
00:11:58,155 --> 00:12:00,155
Don't you know how important breakfast is?

139
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,177
Do you have any plans today?

140
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:06,888
I'm going to the city.

141
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,600
I just realized I have a friend there.

142
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,311
I wanted to catch up with her.

143
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:12,533
Don't worry about me.

144
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:14,755
And will you go alone?

145
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:23,777
Why not? I can do things on my own, too.

146
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,200
I even think it's a pleasure.

147
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,355
What about your filming location?

148
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:32,777
How about this?

149
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,577
I'll take you there. Okay?

150
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:35,400
I don't want you to get lost again.

151
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:37,355
No, thank you.

152
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:38,977
I'm not going there anymore.

153
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:41,577
Why not?

154
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:44,733
I don't know.

155
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,933
I'm not even sure
if I want to be a director anymore.

156
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:49,955
I'm sick of it.

157
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,066
But you love this job.

158
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:54,933
And?

159
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:58,022
No one appreciates what I do.

160
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,377
I mean, I've been doing it for so long.

161
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:06,777
It's time to take a break.

162
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,488
In. Can I use the landline?

163
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:12,111
All yours.

164
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:26,888
- She's mad at you.
- I know.

165
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:28,800
Talk to her.

166
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:33,911
Hello, guess who this is.

167
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:36,555
Did you apologize to her?

168
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,444
The timing just wasn't right.

169
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,488
Does this happen a lot?

170
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,288
Once a day. At the very least.

171
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,044
Hurry up and apologize to her.

172
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:51,066
All right.

173
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:55,266
I'm here alone.
Did you think I was with someone?

174
00:13:57,155 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm going to the city today. Are you home?

175
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:07,133
Good. Let's meet before lunch then. Bye.

176
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:11,600
Mol.

177
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:14,311
Take your time and eat your breakfast.

178
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,400
I'll go out and check up on the bridge.

179
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,644
The workmen can't make it today.

180
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:19,177
What bridge? Let me go with you.

181
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:21,422
No. The sun's out. It'll ruin your skin.

182
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:29,333
Honey.

183
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:44,755
I'm sorry.

184
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,177
Please, forgive me.

185
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,222
You called me irresponsible.

186
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,355
That's not what I meant.

187
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:06,822
Then what was it?

188
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:10,133
What I do means nothing to you at all?

189
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:11,711
Listen to me first.

190
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:17,022
You've never once been proud of me.

191
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:21,311
Do you hate it?

192
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:23,355
- No.
- That you're my son.

193
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,266
That's not true.

194
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,400
Listen.

195
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,000
You're the best mom I could ask for.

196
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:32,822
I love you.

197
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,244
And I'm proud of you for being strong.

198
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,800
And for raising me all alone.

199
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,177
Do you know how much it hurt me?

200
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:53,933
I know.

201
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:58,000
It's my fault. And I'm sorry.

202
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,333
So, you're proud of me? For real?

203
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,177
Yes.

204
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:12,977
Please forgive me.

205
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,488
I did everything for you.

206
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:20,422
You mean the world to me.

207
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:24,377
I know.

208
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:28,577
All we have is each other.

209
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,955
I know. I know.

210
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:38,377
I thought you promised not to cry.

211
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:44,488
Do you want to see
the filming location today?

212
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:45,533
I'll take you.

213
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:46,644
We won't get lost this time.

214
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:52,511
That can wait.

215
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,333
Today, I'm going to the city.

216
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:57,377
Want me to go with you?

217
00:16:58,355 --> 00:16:59,111
You don't have to.

218
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,733
I'm meeting a friend.

219
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,844
I thought I meant the world to you.

220
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,311
This friend of mine is a woman.

221
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:10,288
You will get bored.

222
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:12,133
Stay here with In.

223
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:14,400
Wait.

224
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:16,466
What is it?

225
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,822
You didn't tell me. Will you forgive me?

226
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,755
It doesn't matter how much you hurt me.

227
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,711
I'll always find a way to forgive you.

228
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:13,400
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

229
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:16,488
I think I'm gonna work on the bridge
without the workmen.

230
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,488
Do you want to help me?

231
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:20,955
Of course.

232
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:28,222
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

233
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:46,666
I thought Wang was going with you.

234
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:49,466
No, I told him not to.

235
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:52,288
I have a surprise for him.

236
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,288
Give me your ear.
I'll tell you what it is.

237
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:04,711
Keep it from him.

238
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,022
I don't get you guys.

239
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:08,688
You just had a fight last night.

240
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:10,777
Please, take care of him.

241
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,288
He's easy to manage,
but can get rebellious at times.

242
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,377
Inthawut has something that draws me
to learn more about him.

243
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,711
Sometimes, he's warm like the sun.

244
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,888
Sometimes, he's a complicated book.

245
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,577
Sometimes, he's an abstract painting.

246
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:08,377
But there's one thing that connects us.

247
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,222
Did you tell her you're sorry?

248
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:13,666
What did she say?

249
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,800
She cried, but that was expected.

250
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,822
I guess you don't cry often?

251
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:26,177
I don't even remember the last time I cried.

252
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:27,422
Really?

253
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,555
You're a man now. So, you're strong?

254
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,888
I had to be.

255
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:37,666
When I was sent to boarding school, I was very young.

256
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,333
I cried myself to sleep every night.

257
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,755
I was shocked.

258
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
I was hurt.

259
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:44,755
I didn't understand

260
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,244
why all of a sudden

261
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:49,800
my dad was gone.

262
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:54,333
What about you?

263
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,022
When was the last time you cried?

264
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,688
Around ten years ago.

265
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,555
It was when I was studying abroad.

266
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,111
After that, I stopped crying completely.

267
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,266
It's not that I'm strong or anything.

268
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,400
I try not to go where it hurts.

269
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,377
Can you tell me why you cried that day?

270
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,400
I think I'm gonna work on the bridge
without the workmen.

271
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:28,666
Do you want to help me?

272
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:35,822
Of course.

273
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:51,333
The structure is done.

274
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,577
All we need to do is lay the planks.

275
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:54,444
It won't be hard.

276
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:56,533
As long as it's crossable, it's fine.

277
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,088
It's not like you can drown in this creek.

278
00:21:58,088 --> 00:21:59,333
What do you need the bridge for?

279
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,577
It overflows at least once a year.

280
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,022
That's why we need
to get it done as fast as we can.

281
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,533
I agree with Sangkam
building this bridge will be easy.

282
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,377
There's no need
for your complicated design.

283
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:11,822
Or was it an architect thing?

284
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:14,511
Building a small bridge
is easy, all right.

285
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,222
But to make it last,
you need a proper design.

286
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:20,840
What are you doing?

287
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,422
I want to go look over there.

288
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,911
There's nothing there. Just trees.

289
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,755
If you want to go, I'll drive you later.

290
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:29,800
But it's shorter to walk.

291
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:31,488
You've never been on the trail?

292
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:34,466
It's shorter all right,
but the trail can be tough.

293
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:36,288
It isn't tough for the villagers.

294
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:40,200
They were lucky enough
Boss didn't put up a fence.

295
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:42,111
Enough.

296
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:43,688
You get started.

297
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:45,822
What about you?

298
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:48,355
Can you handle saws and nails?

299
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:52,222
Teach me how to.

300
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,000
What Sangkam said was right.

301
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:08,200
We should be glad In decided to go
with the bridge instead of a fence.

302
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,422
But I don't know whether he will ever go

303
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:19,866
to the other side
when the bridge is ready.

304
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:23,600
Or is the bridge only
for the villagers to traverse?

305
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,777
In is meticulous with everything he does.

306
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,222
Whether it's making coffee
or making breakfast.

307
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,911
And of course,
even with this small bridge

308
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,933
that doesn't need to be complicated.

309
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:48,888
But he didn't risk it.

310
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:54,333
He makes me feel like I'm lousy

311
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:56,911
when compared to him.

312
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:55,688
Let's stop for today.

313
00:24:56,977 --> 00:24:57,911
Why stop when we can finish it?

314
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:03,000
I don't want your mom
to think I've overworked her child.

315
00:25:05,977 --> 00:25:08,444
What did she say to you before she left?

316
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,288
- Nothing.
- Don't lie.

317
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,577
I can see through her,
no matter what she does.

318
00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:17,555
Really?

319
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:19,266
What did she tell me then?

320
00:25:20,422 --> 00:25:22,377
She planned a surprise for me.

321
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:24,444
You're good.

322
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:27,977
She probably wanted to do something
nice for you since you made up.

323
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:31,888
No, that's not it.

324
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:34,266
Then, what is it?

325
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,088
It doesn't matter.

326
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:41,733
You'll know it when you see it.

327
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:47,733
Then, I guess the surprise is ruined.

328
00:25:48,022 --> 00:25:48,977
I'm used to it.

329
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:52,088
It's not the first time I play clueless

330
00:25:52,288 --> 00:25:54,266
when I know she's planning
something for me.

331
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,444
In this, you take after your parents.

332
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,755
You never went on the other side of the creek?

333
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:09,155
I usually drive there.

334
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:10,111
That's not what I meant.

335
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:11,688
I mean, have you ever gone
beyond the creek?

336
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:15,044
And why would I do that?

337
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:18,755
To see how it's inconvenient
for the villagers.

338
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,377
I drive all my life. Of course,
I'd find it inconvenient.

339
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,066
But for the villagers
who were born and raised here,

340
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,577
they prefer this inconvenient trail
'cause it takes longer by the main road.

341
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:37,866
That's why the trail
is still used to this day.

342
00:26:40,911 --> 00:26:43,177
We can't think for others
and force our views on them.

343
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:45,711
They travel here.

344
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:49,955
We can establish from that what they truly want.

345
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:54,244
They want a bridge to cross over.

346
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:57,622
But that doesn't mean
they want us to go to their side.

347
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:03,177
And how do you figure
they don't want you on their side?

348
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:09,333
You shouldn't force your views and think for others.

349
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,311
So you're not a risk taker?

350
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:17,333
I don't know.

351
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:23,000
Perhaps, I'm just old enough
to know when to take risks.

352
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,311
I don't want to grow old
and regret not taking risks.

353
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:33,355
I don't want to be old
and have to answer to young people.

354
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,577
“what were you doing
when you were in our place?“

355
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,866
Your shirt is dirty.

356
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,400
Do you want to shower in the creek?

357
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:57,733
You do it. I'm good.

358
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:04,911
Wang. Don't take long.

359
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:07,800
I don't want you to miss
your so-called surprise.

360
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:13,666
It won't be me who gets surprised.

361
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:22,266
But honestly, noting is more
surprising than us meeting each other.

362
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:08,800
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

363
00:29:09,088 --> 00:29:11,400
Let's do something fun.

364
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,355
What is?

365
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:13,333
A game.

366
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:18,200
This game is called 'tell the truth'.

367
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:25,577
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

368
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:32,377
Come here. Sit here now.

369
00:29:32,377 --> 00:29:37,511
But before we begin,
you need a blindfold.

370
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,533
What surprise do you have for me?

371
00:29:42,688 --> 00:29:44,977
I'm so eager to know my heart is beating so fast.

372
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:46,733
What if I get a heart attack?

373
00:29:46,822 --> 00:29:47,666
Are you for real?

374
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,666
Let me listen if your heart is still beating.

375
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,622
What if it isn't?

376
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,377
Stop being silly, Wang.

377
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:57,555
Wait a minute. Get ready for your surprise.

378
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:58,755
Sit still.

379
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,511
Don't cheat.

380
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,333
Can I take the blindfold off?

381
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:19,844
Not yet. Don't rush. It won't be long now.

00:32:31,044 --> 00:32:34,733
I almost forgot.
I have another present for you.

394
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,977
The surprise continues.

395
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:41,444
We have to give it to her though.

396
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:44,466
She went overboard
with the party tonight.

397
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,044
I mean, I've been living here for years.

398
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,533
And yet I didn't know there was
a company that does birthday parties.

399
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:54,822
You're in awe, aren't you?
Did you forget I'm a director?

400
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:58,533
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

401
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,488
Open it. See if you like it.

402
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:13,400
Gosh. It's pretty.

403
00:33:14,444 --> 00:33:17,111
Let me. I'll put it on you.

404
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:23,600
May you know nothing but happiness.

405
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,977
I'll give you my present later.

406
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:28,488
Keep your promise.

407
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,244
Or I'll keep pestering you for it.

408
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:37,755
Let's do something fun tonight.

409
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,844
Don't fall into her trap.

410
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:42,444
Her fun usually means
different from our fun.

411
00:33:42,555 --> 00:33:43,755
What do you suggest, then?

412
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:46,422
- Play a game.
- Here we go.

413
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:47,488
What game?

414
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,577
It's a psychological game.

415
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:52,622
Let your guard down
and she'll hypnotize you.

416
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:55,688
Wang, you make it
sound like I'm a witch.

417
00:33:55,822 --> 00:33:59,044
I do this all the time
with my actors. They're fine.

418
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:04,644
The game is called 'tell the truth'.

419
00:34:05,355 --> 00:34:09,511
The game preys on those
who want to talk about themselves

420
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:13,466
and at the same time
can't resist being nosy.

421
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:15,444
See? I told you.

422
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:18,044
It's fun, though.

423
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,066
Let's start with something easy.

424
00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:23,933
The keyword is my idol.

425
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:27,311
I have to talk about my idol?

426
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:28,333
You're right.

427
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,711
I'll go first.

428
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:34,200
My idol is

429
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:36,866
Elizabeth Taylor.

430
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:39,088
- Who is that?
- Oh my god, Wang.

431
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,688
How could you not know her
when your mom is a director?

432
00:34:42,244 --> 00:34:46,511
Elizabeth Taylor was a great actress.

433
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:48,288
She was very pretty.

434
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:51,822
She was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood.

435
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:53,288
Does that mean she's still active?

436
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:54,622
She died.

437
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:57,244
What do you like about her?

438
00:34:59,711 --> 00:35:01,488
I don't know if I can say this
without getting embarrassed.

439
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,244
But the game is for us to tell the truth.

440
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:09,844
She's my idol because she was pretty.

441
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,755
She was kind and she was smart.

442
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:16,733
And the most important thing
is she got married eight times.

443
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:20,044
Eight times? That means
she had eight husbands?

444
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:24,755
Seven. She re-married
one of her ex-husbands.

445
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:28,711
Now, it's your turn.

446
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:32,244
My idol is.

447
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:37,333
I guess it's my social studies
teacher at the boarding school.

448
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:42,066
This is disappointing.

449
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,777
I thought you were going to say me.

450
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:47,311
Do explain. How is he your idol?

451
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,444
He didn't only teach what's in textbooks.

452
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:58,444
He taught us how to look for what's not in them, too.

453
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:01,422
When the whole school got together and
called out the principal for corruption,

454
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,888
all the other teachers
didn't say a word.

455
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:07,800
Only this social studies teacher
had something to say.

456
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:10,177
And in the end what happened?

457
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:14,088
You lost because you didn't have proof.

458
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:16,044
You're right. We lost.

459
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,244
But it made us more aware of
injustice we have to fight to get rid of.

460
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:23,755
We get it. You're a fighter.

461
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:26,800
It's your turn, In.

462
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,088
Now?

463
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:31,711
The 52-hertz whale.

464
00:36:31,977 --> 00:36:34,022
What? Did I hear that right?

465
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:35,844
You cheated.

466
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:39,355
You didn't say it had to be a person.

467
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:40,533
You're sly.

468
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:43,133
I know you did this on purpose.

469
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,955
I didn't. The 52-hertz whale
really is my idol.

470
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:48,288
You avoided the question.

471
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:51,333
Your technique isn't working on him.

472
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,422
I know who your idol is.

473
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:56,200
You're just afraid to bring him up.

474
00:36:56,288 --> 00:36:57,133
Who is it?

475
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:00,444
It's because I know you're trying to set me up.

476
00:37:09,155 --> 00:37:12,150
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

477
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,644
The 52-hertz whale. I like this answer.

478
00:37:15,644 --> 00:37:16,644
So, you know him?

479
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:20,133
He calls at the frequency of 52 hertz.

480
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:23,044
No one hears him. No one knows where he is.

481
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,244
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

482
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:32,688
It's because I know you're trying to set me up.

483
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,577
The phone saved you.

484
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:47,711
Hello?

485
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,222
For you, Mol.

486
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,444
It must be Elsa.

487
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,377
I called her this afternoon
and left her your number.

488
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:10,533
Hello. What are you calling for?

489
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:15,133
The 52-hertz whale. I like this answer.

490
00:38:16,622 --> 00:38:18,066
So, you know him?

491
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:23,711
He calls at the frequency of 52 hertz.

492
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,866
No one hears him.
He's alone in the ocean.

493
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:32,622
No one knows where he is.

494
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:35,511
He's lonely.

495
00:38:37,711 --> 00:38:38,911
How do you know he's lonely?

496
00:38:41,644 --> 00:38:43,288
I'll look for the perfect dress.

497
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:45,622
Can you book me a flight?

498
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,000
Good news. I was nominated.

499
00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:56,400
Outstanding Director of the year
for Kom Chuen Kom Award.

500
00:38:57,622 --> 00:39:00,222
The award is taking place
the day after tomorrow.

501
00:39:00,222 --> 00:39:02,711
Congrats. I'm happy for you.

502
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:09,866
Elsa told me I could win this
and even Best Lakorn.

503
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,955
He told me it's because
my lakorn is different.

504
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:15,355
The other four contenders are all BL.

505
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:17,266
All couples are gay.

506
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:19,022
What project landed you the nomination?

507
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,088
Silver Sand Castle.

508
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:24,222
They say my presence is mandatory.

509
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,266
The award will be after tomorrow.

510
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:28,577
I'll have to fly back tomorrow.

511
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:30,666
After that, I'll have to look for
the perfect dress.

512
00:39:30,888 --> 00:39:33,377
I'll fly here after the award.

513
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:37,711
Honey, do you want
to accompany me to the award show?

514
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,000
I'd rather stay here.

515
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:41,600
I don't want to trouble you
with a plane ticket.

516
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:45,466
Now you're worried
about what's in my purse?

517
00:39:46,622 --> 00:39:53,111
Wang, he's never shown interest
in the entertainment industry.

518
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:55,755
Otherwise, he would've become an actor.

519
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:58,155
Right? You could be
making money for us.

520
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,488
Take care of him for two days.

521
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:03,600
I'm sure you could handle him?

522
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:07,044
I'll leave the car with you.

523
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:09,466
In case, you want to go
explore the nightlife in the city.

524
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,022
You can't ask In to be your driver.

525
00:40:11,555 --> 00:40:15,933
I'm gonna go pack my things. I don't
want it to be chaotic tomorrow morning.

526
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:20,622
What about the game?

527
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:22,644
Do it with In.

528
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,266
But you were the one who wanted us to play.

529
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,822
Happy birthday.

530
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:49,666
Thank you.

531
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:53,022
I told you.

532
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:56,288
Today wasn't special.

533
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,177
Do you know why she bought me the necklace?

534
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:49,244
Why?

535
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:51,688
Because she is jealous of Dad.

536
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:58,866
She wanted me to take her with me
everywhere I go. Like I do with Dad.

537
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,911
You're being unfair to her.

538
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,333
She loves you. You know that.

539
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:16,888
Why is the 52-hertz whale your idol?

540
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:22,933
Because he can live on his own.

541
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:26,555
No one hears
what he says but that's fine.

542
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:29,933
It doesn't matter
no one understands him.

543
00:42:31,288 --> 00:42:32,622
And no one can find him.

544
00:42:35,244 --> 00:42:36,111
And he isn't lonely?

545
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:40,155
No one knows if he's lonely.

546
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:43,222
That's his nature.

547
00:42:45,888 --> 00:42:46,688
I think he's lonely.

548
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,311
You can't think for others, remember?

549
00:42:51,644 --> 00:42:54,844
You think he's lonely. Because you're lonely.

550
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:00,600
I guess you're right.

551
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,933
I'm lonely.

552
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,511
It's not wrong to be lonely.

553
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,844
We're human, after all.

554
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:12,466
We weren't wired like the 52-hertz whale.

555
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:14,466
In.

556
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:15,622
What?

557
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:18,155
Why didn't you just answer it?

558
00:43:20,022 --> 00:43:21,400
Who is it Mom mentioned earlier?

559
00:43:22,488 --> 00:43:23,600
Who is your idol?

560
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:34,044
You think you're sending out a certain
frequency no one hears like that whale.

561
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:37,155
But I hear you.

562
00:43:42,177 --> 00:43:43,244
Your idol is my dad, right?

563
00:43:52,377 --> 00:43:54,511
Can I ask my birthday
present from you now?

564
00:43:57,177 --> 00:44:00,377
If it's something I can give you.

565
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,822
Can you tell me if Dad…

566
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:13,466
- If Dad...
- The two of us were sorry it happened.

567
00:44:20,466 --> 00:44:22,600
We were really sorry it happened.

568
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:04,911
You're not done packing?

569
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:06,488
You'll be only there for a few days.

570
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:08,288
I'm a lady. Did you forget?

571
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,955
Drive safe. I hope you win tomorrow.

572
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,311
Your mom isn't here. Do you want to explore the city?

573
00:45:15,555 --> 00:45:16,577
I want to stay here.

574
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:18,844
Jump over here.

575
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:20,511
I bet you're afraid.

576
00:45:22,044 --> 00:45:25,288
Do you know you're talented?

577
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:31,933
It doesn't matter if I'm talented
when I do nothing about it.
