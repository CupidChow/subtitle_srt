1
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:04,755
(Previously)
I love In.

2
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:07,133
Did I not take good care of you?

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,377
- That’s why you…
- It’s not your fault or mine.

4
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:11,244
I’m just in love with someone.

5
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:13,644
It doesn’t matter if it’s a he or a she.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,644
But it’s Inthawut of all people.

7
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:18,022
You know how much I love you.

8
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,288
I can do anything for you.

9
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:22,444
All I want is for you to give him back.

10
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:24,000
Please?

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,777
Is it so wrong that I’m in love with Inthawut?

12
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:32,800
The same man Dad was in love with.

13
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:34,488
What is it?

14
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:38,755
Is Wang here?

15
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:42,933
No, he isn’t.

16
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:00,933
Where did he go? It’s late.

17
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:04,688
Calm down. Sangkam is looking for him.

18
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,155
What if he couldn’t find him?

19
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,333
I guess he’s around.
The car key is with you, right?

20
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:14,777
But what if he had a crazy idea
and went into the woods?

21
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:19,733
- I don’t think he would.
- How can you still stay calm?

22
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:24,444
You should’ve known by now
how unexpected people can be.

23
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,822
You think you know him?

24
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:33,622
How many days has it been since you met him?

25
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,733
I’m his mom.

26
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,644
I’ve been with him my whole life.

27
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:40,222
I can’t even say I know him.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,133
People are unexpected.

29
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:46,400
One day Wang met you.

30
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:52,422
He got so infatuated with you he said
he doesn’t want to live with me anymore.

31
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:56,111
He wants to leave me.
Leave everything at home.

32
00:02:56,422 --> 00:02:59,511
So he can live with you
and study philosophy.

33
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:02,511
Do you think I don’t know
it was you who gave him the idea?

34
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:03,200
Mol.

35
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:09,244
I don’t understand why
of all places we ended up here.

36
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:10,955
I don't think it's fate.

37
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,711
What have I done
in my past life to deserve this?

38
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:21,222
I wished and wished
we wouldn’t meet again.

39
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:27,622
Mol.

40
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:31,333
Do you hate me this much?

41
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:36,777
I used to love you.

42
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:39,688
I told you, didn’t I?

43
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,888
You used to be
the friend I trusted the most.

44
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:47,488
I don’t want to bring up the past.

45
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,111
Nor do I want to know what exactly
happened between you and Siam.

46
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:57,266
For me, it ended when Siam died.

47
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:03,044
But I guess I was wrong about that.

48
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,577
Today I begged you on my knees.

49
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:11,333
I begged you to help me one last time.

50
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:17,422
If you don’t want to do it for me,
do it for my son, then.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,044
The son of your dear brother.

52
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,888
But I guess you won’t help me
considering what happened at dinner.

53
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:28,577
Mol.

54
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:31,111
Whatever you’re thinking, I didn’t do it.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
- I’m not who you think I am.
- I’m thinking what?

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,177
What are you exactly?

57
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,244
You’re thinking I don’t want to help you.

58
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:40,377
And am I wrong?

59
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,755
Can you explain
why you didn’t do anything at dinner?

60
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:48,511
Why did you do nothing
when he said he wanted to stay here?

61
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:53,600
When he proclaimed his love to you.

62
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:57,733
I ran away from it once.
But obviously, it won’t leave me alone.

63
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:03,088
So, I won’t run this time.

64
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,377
There are so many things I want to
ask you about what happened in the past.

65
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:08,288
But I’m not going to.

66
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,066
What’s in the past
should stay in the past.

67
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:18,244
I’ll only ask you
about what happened today.

68
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,800
Can you be honest with me
and tell me what I want to know?

69
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,822
What do you want to know?

70
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:27,111
Wang told us he loves you.

71
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:29,466
But what about you?

72
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:33,355
Do you love him? Do you
feel the same way about him?

73
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,955
In. I went to the garage.
Your friend’s car is gone.

74
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:42,577
Wang.

75
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:45,533
You said you had the car key.

76
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,755
I guess I was mistaken.

77
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:50,666
What are we going to do now?

78
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:53,800
No one saw him when he took the car out?

79
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,822
No, ma’am. I was asleep.

80
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,510
It was raining quite loud. I couldn't
have heard when he started the car.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,666
But you shouldn’t worry.

82
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:02,466
I think he went to the city for drinks.

83
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:07,311
He’s young and it’s boring here.

84
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:10,888
If he isn’t here after closing hours,
I’m sure he will be back in the morning.

85
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:16,933
In. How can you just stand there?

86
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,555
Didn’t you hear him?

87
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,888
He said Wang took the car out.
He took the car out!

88
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:23,222
I think we should just wait.

89
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:24,400
I’m sure he’ll be back.

90
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:27,044
What if he doesn’t come back?

91
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:31,666
Don’t worry and go to bed. I’ll take care of it.

92
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:34,933
Take care? What are you going to do?

93
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:36,822
How will you take care of it?

94
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:42,022
How will you take care of it?
By staying silent? By running away?

95
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,555
It isn’t your responsibility,
so it doesn’t concern you.

96
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,800
If it doesn’t affect your life,
it doesn’t concern you.

97
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:51,466
Unlike you, if something happens,
I have to go through it.

98
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:53,555
I have to live with it.

99
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:57,288
How can you say I should go to bed?

100
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:03,688
Do you think I can sleep now knowing
my son is driving alone at night?

101
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:07,022
Don't you know, Inthawut?

102
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,466
Siam did the very same thing

103
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:14,066
and he never came back.

104
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,177
You know what.

105
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:04,377
You disgust me. Inthawut.

106
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:11,622
I’m sorry.

107
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:18,333
I’m sorry.

108
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:23,355
I’m sorry.

109
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:31,666
I’m sorry.

110
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,177
Please, don’t drink.

111
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,066
Don’t cry.

112
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:30,955
Honey.

113
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:33,577
Where did you go?

114
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:39,555
You know how scared I was
when you were gone.

115
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,400
I’m back now, aren’t I?

116
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:48,733
Don’t pull anything like this again.

117
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:51,644
You promised me, remember?

118
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:54,244
You said you won’t leave me.

119
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:03,511
Honey.

120
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,155
You should sleep here tonight.

121
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:13,311
We can even share the bed.
The bed is big. There’s room for you.

122
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:14,177
And...

123
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,200
And tomorrow, we’ll leave early.

124
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,968
I promise. I’ll wake up early.

125
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,955
I’ll wake up before you this time.

126
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:32,710
If we leave early,
we can get there around noon.

127
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,022
You're silent.

128
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:51,022
I don’t like this.

129
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:56,555
Wang.

130
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:08,533
Sometimes, life isn’t
what you expect it to be.

131
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:15,866
You may not have your perfect life.

132
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:27,666
But please know
I’ll do anything for you to be happy.

133
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,844
Don't you think...

134
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:48,088
If it isn’t what I want, it won’t make me happy.

135
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,400
You go to sleep.

136
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:01,866
Sleep here.

137
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:06,333
It’s late.

138
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:23,200
We’ll talk about this again tomorrow.

139
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,533
And we’ll be reasonable about it.

140
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,422
Without tears getting in the way.

141
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:36,977
The three of us.

142
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:42,377
Tomorrow, you will feel better.

143
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,688
Has Inthawut ever told you?

144
00:13:58,177 --> 00:13:59,622
That he loves you.

145
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:03,422
Does he feel the same way about you too?

146
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:15,911
I don’t care if I get hurt.

147
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:19,155
But please know I won’t leave you.

148
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,177
Where did you go?

149
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:54,222
Your mom was worried.

150
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:02,333
I drove around. The road was dark.

151
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:08,688
The rain was pouring hard.
I thought I was lost for a minute.

152
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:19,066
But then I pulled over.
And it hit me where I was.

153
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,622
I knew the location.

154
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,355
I knew even the exact longitude.

155
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:28,844
And then I thought about Dad.

156
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:37,911
I think I know how Dad felt
when he got in the car that night.

157
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:40,111
I think he wanted to go away.

158
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:43,111
But he didn’t know where to.

159
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:51,444
But I think we were different in that
he genuinely didn’t know where to go to.

160
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:54,844
I think all he could see was darkness.

161
00:15:56,844 --> 00:16:01,711
It must’ve been so dark he didn’t know
how he could make it until sunrise.

162
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:08,288
One thing was obvious about that night.

163
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:17,288
Dad didn't know where
to look for that 52-hertz whale.

164
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:39,822
But I knew where to find that whale.
That’s why I came back.

165
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:46,800
And before you came here,

166
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:50,177
did you talk to your mom?

167
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:54,533
I did.

168
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,488
Actually,

169
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:04,733
it was her
who did almost all of the talking.

170
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:10,911
After all, it doesn’t matter
whether I say anything.

171
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:13,666
She has her reason.

172
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,066
I know she’s hurting.

173
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,666
I’m hurting too.

174
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:26,444
But I don’t think it’s right
for us to let it hurt us like this.

175
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:30,133
It's not right for us three to suffer
from it for the rest of our lives.

176
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:32,755
You told me, remember?

177
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,133
That I still have a life ahead of me?

178
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:40,155
Why do I have to wait before I can
finally live the life I want?

179
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:44,333
Why can’t I do it now? At this very moment?

180
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:45,777
Before it’s too late.

181
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,688
We don’t always
get what we want in life.

182
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:51,222
But have you even fought for it?
Have you done anything about it?

183
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:55,000
I’d rather fight for it and lose
instead of sitting around doing nothing.

184
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:58,438
Fight for what? Is the thing so important that
you’re willing to sacrifice your life for?

185
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,822
There are people who don’t fight for it and die.

186
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:02,711
You’ve seen what happened to him.

187
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,680
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

188
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,511
You should know best.

189
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,533
How frustrating it is when you can’t be true to your instincts.

190
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,222
You’re disappointing me.

191
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,888
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

192
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:26,800
There are people who don’t fight for it and die.

193
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,866
You’ve seen what happened to him.

194
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:34,333
I think you should take a shower.
You’ll get sick.

195
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:37,555
You seem different.

196
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:45,311
Different? How so?

197
00:18:46,422 --> 00:18:47,200
The way you talk.

198
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:51,155
It’s an old habit.

199
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,000
What happened when I was out?

200
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:55,733
Nothing happened.

201
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:58,022
- We were just...
- What happened?

202
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:08,244
Wang.

203
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:21,000
If I ask you to do me one more favor,

204
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:25,400
will you do it?

205
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:28,200
Tell me what it is first.

206
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,088
Tomorrow.

207
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,044
You should go with your mom.

208
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:44,933
In.

209
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,488
I’ll be here.

210
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:50,533
I'm not going anywhere.

211
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:54,800
You can visit me anytime.

212
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:58,533
You know the location by heart.

213
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:08,333
You know it too this 52-hertz whale
doesn’t live in the ocean.

214
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:14,844
But he’s here in the mountains.

215
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,444
So this is what you want?

216
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:28,955
Yes, it’s what I want.

217
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:56,400
In.

218
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:02,688
Why does it hurt so bad?

219
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:06,911
I’m sorry.

220
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:12,155
But it’s better this way. It will
hurt even more if we let it happen.

221
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:17,844
You’re a coward.

222
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:27,244
You’re still a coward.

223
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:29,000
You're right.

224
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:33,260
I’m a coward.

225
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,400
But I’m not a coward like you.

226
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:41,888
I’m not a coward like Dad or Mom.

227
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:42,511
Wang.

228
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,111
You can say what you want about me.

229
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:48,555
- But they’re your parents, you... l.
- I shouldn’t disrespect them?

230
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:50,488
I know that.

231
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:53,888
I now know that
everyone in this house is a coward.

232
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:57,400
You’re afraid to bring it out
in the open. You’re afraid of the truth.

233
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:58,977
That’s why you guys are running away.

234
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:02,333
But not me.

235
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:06,533
Unlike you guys, I’ll continue to fight for it.

236
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,266
This is not something
where you can fight and win.

237
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:09,422
Then what is it?

238
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,066
Something to sacrifice for?

239
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:13,977
Do you think by doing this,
you’re sacrificing it?

240
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:19,644
You think by doing nothing,
not taking sides, you’re sacrificing it?

241
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,177
I already took a side
by not taking sides.

242
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,933
I told you.

243
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:25,511
We don’t always get what we want in life.

244
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,555
It’s the reality.

245
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,711
- We have to live with reality.
- But love is real, too.

246
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:34,022
When I love someone, that’s reality.

247
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:35,866
When you love someone, that’s reality.

248
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:39,000
Everyone should be able to love
who they want because that too is reality.

249
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,266
But it doesn’t mean
you can do whatever you want.

250
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:41,977
But it’s how I feel,
I should be able to act upon it.

251
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:45,866
And how do you know
I feel the same way about you?

252
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:52,066
Then say to my face that you have no feelings for me.

253
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:57,044
Say it. Say it.

254
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,711
- Don’t shout, Wang.
- What are you afraid of?

255
00:23:00,222 --> 00:23:01,488
You’re afraid someone would hear us?

256
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,977
We're in the middle of nowhere.

257
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:05,444
In a freaking cave. In your whatever ocean.

258
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:06,933
Who would hear you?

259
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:09,733
If you don’t feel the same for me then,

260
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:13,711
how will you explain those signals
you’ve been sending to me?

261
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:15,309
Be reasonable.

262
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,422
Explain it.

263
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:17,128
Get yourself together.

264
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,218
I'm not losing it.

265
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,708
Yes, you are.
You’re acting irrationally.

266
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,866
I know what I'm doing,
I’m only acting on my instincts.

267
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:23,088
Your instincts are making you crazy.

268
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:23,911
So what?

269
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:25,844
You have never once
acted on your instincts.

270
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:30,400
I came here
because my instincts told me to.

271
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:34,066
I met you and you made me
aware of my true nature.

272
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:37,333
I’d never been more sure of my instincts
until I slept next to you on that bed.

273
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:38,911
You know what?

274
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:42,355
I’m proud of my true instincts.

275
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,066
I’m not in anyway ashamed of them.

276
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:48,377
And now, I’m starting to regret it.

277
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:54,844
I regret not acting out my instincts when I was alone with you.

278
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:56,711
- Get out.
- You know better than anyone.

279
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:59,888
How frustrating it is when you can’t be true to your instincts.

280
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,600
You’re disappointing me.

281
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:05,755
I’m disappointing you?

282
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:08,222
You’re acting irrational.

283
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:11,400
You can’t always act on your instincts,

284
00:24:12,444 --> 00:24:16,200
because then you wouldn’t
be different from those people

285
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,577
who force it
when things don’t go their way.

286
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,422
I thought you were different.

287
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:24,488
I thought you were different, too.

288
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:27,266
But I should’ve known.

289
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:29,644
To you, I’m just a kid who doesn’t know how to wait.

290
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:34,777
To you, I’m just a kid who whines when things don’t go my way.

291
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:37,177
You think kids like me
are all about seizing the day.

292
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,377
I thought you were different, too.

293
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:42,822
But I was wrong.
You’re just like everyone else.

294
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:47,822
You won’t give up what you have
for what you truly want.

295
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,733
Knowing this now, why should I care
whether or not I disappoint you?

296
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:55,711
Because you disappoint me, too.

297
00:24:56,022 --> 00:25:00,688
I’d rather disappoint you
than do it and hurt everyone.

298
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:03,733
You say you don’t want to us hurt
and look what happened.

299
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:05,400
Are you going to tell me all those years,

300
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,177
no one got hurt because you stayed away?

301
00:25:09,177 --> 00:25:11,400
Mom’s hurting.
You’re hurting. I’m hurting.

302
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:15,777
The one who isn’t hurting is Dad because he’s gone.

303
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:18,422
- Stop it. Can you not talk about this?
- Why should I stop?

304
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,977
You were the one
who told me those stories.

305
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:22,955
You even cried when you talked about it.

306
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:27,088
I could see from your tears
that you’re still hurting.

307
00:25:27,822 --> 00:25:28,955
And the pain won’t go away.

308
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,673
You’re hurting because you’re ashamed
of the feelings Dad had for you.

309
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:38,822
You’re hurting because you’re ashamed
of the feelings you had for Dad.

310
00:25:40,577 --> 00:25:42,711
You’re ashamed of what you did to Dad.

311
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:48,622
And now you’re ashamed
of your feelings for me, too.

312
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,000
The truth is I should thank you.

313
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:01,422
Because of you, I know now what
went wrong in my family.

314
00:26:01,422 --> 00:26:03,111
But you left one thing out.

315
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:05,422
Please, stop.

316
00:26:06,244 --> 00:26:08,822
You didn’t tell me what that word was
because you’re ashamed of it.

317
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:11,066
The word that came from Dad’s lips.

318
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,511
You didn’t tell me what it was.

319
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:16,377
The word that changed everything.

320
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:18,755
But I know what it was.

321
00:26:20,177 --> 00:26:22,688
Dad told you he loved you.

322
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:27,400
You still remember all those calls he
made to you in the middle of the night.

323
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,844
He called to say he loved you.

324
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,222
But you didn't want to admit it.

325
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,177
You couldn’t accept it.

326
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:39,155
You know it in your heart it was
his love you ran away from.

327
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:47,422
You said you ran away from him,
but the truth is you pushed him away.

328
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:52,238
You think just because you ran away
it would solve everything?

329
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
You ruined his life by running away.

330
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,911
And as a result,
you ruined mine and mom’s too.

331
00:26:56,177 --> 00:27:02,688
You ran away thinking it was for the best
but it led Dad to his death!

332
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,888
I love you, In.

333
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:03,844
I love you even though I know you would
never find it in you to say it back.

334
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,866
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

335
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:47,955
Tell him I said goodbye.

336
00:28:49,422 --> 00:28:52,266
And thank him for me for everything.

337
00:28:56,044 --> 00:28:58,111
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

338
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:11,000
Where are they? Where did I put them?

339
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:13,577
I’m sure I didn’t wear them.

340
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,888
Honey, do you know
where my sunglasses are?

341
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,777
Why are you asking me?

342
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,377
I don’t even know how many pairs you brought.

343
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:29,155
I’ve looked everywhere and now my head hurts.

344
00:29:30,177 --> 00:29:31,622
I didn’t wear them, right?

345
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:34,133
The white-framed sunglasses with blue lenses.

346
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:35,800
I couldn’t tell which pair is which.

347
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:37,355
To me, every pair is the same.

348
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:41,044
Wang, each pair is different.

349
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,911
What I’m wearing now is dark tea.

350
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:50,200
What you’re wearing is light tea.

351
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:55,288
And this pair is what we call black.

352
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:58,000
You’re color-blind or what?

353
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:01,022
So what if you lost one pair?
You have hundreds at home.

354
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:02,466
Just pick a pair and wear them.

355
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,222
But I don’t want to wear black or dark.
I want to wear blue to go with my mood.

356
00:30:09,222 --> 00:30:12,400
- Don't you understand?
- All right. All right.

357
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,244
You need those blue lenses
to go with your mood today. I get it.

358
00:30:17,488 --> 00:30:20,244
Did you pack?

359
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,755
I’m about to.
I didn’t bring a lot of clothes.

360
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:27,666
Are you sure? Make sure you don’t forget anything.

361
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:37,488
I won’t. How can I?

362
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,333
Does it hurt?

363
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:51,666
I’m good.

364
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,577
All right. You’re doing good, my son.

365
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:02,866
You keep looking for the glasses.

366
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:07,000
I’ll say goodbye to In.

367
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:12,622
Tell him I said goodbye too.

368
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:17,911
And thank him for me for everything.

369
00:31:21,044 --> 00:31:22,222
You won’t say goodbye to him?

370
00:31:25,822 --> 00:31:26,666
No.

371
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:32,288
I'd rather not.

372
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:05,844
I came to get my things.

373
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,333
Did you get any sleep last night?

374
00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:24,866
I’m sorry I hurt you.

375
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:30,355
It’s nothing.

376
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,355
Don’t be sorry. I hurt you a lot more.

377
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:42,711
You didn’t hurt me. It was my fault.

378
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:53,888
I think it won’t be long
until I can take off the cast.

379
00:32:56,244 --> 00:32:58,222
Good. Good for you.

380
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:04,311
When are you leaving?

381
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:09,000
Mom is looking for her sunglasses.

382
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,711
We’ll leave as soon as she finds them.

383
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:15,111
Good.

384
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:21,355
You should leave early
to get there before the sun goes down.

385
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:24,644
I think we’ll get there around noon.

386
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,355
So, there’ll be plenty of time...

387
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,155
to enjoy the day.

388
00:33:34,622 --> 00:33:39,022
You’re right. You still have time to enjoy it.

389
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:04,533
Thank you.

390
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,444
Thank you?

391
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:09,222
Yes, thank you.

392
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:19,111
Do you know
how much I learned last night?

393
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,955
I couldn’t sleep at all.

394
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:25,977
I kept asking myself,

395
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:29,377
Why should I accept your decision?

396
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:33,022
Why can’t I do what I want to do?

397
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:40,822
If I insist on staying here,
I know I’ll win this fight.

398
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,355
No one wants to lose, right?

399
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:51,311
But then it hit me.
If I win, who will lose then?

400
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:57,000
Not me. Not you.

401
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,866
It will be her who stayed up
for me last night.

402
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:18,822
Wang.

403
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:36,488
Wang. What’s wrong?

404
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:38,244
Who did this to you?

405
00:35:38,822 --> 00:35:39,422
Wang.

406
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:49,640
It’s okay. It’s okay.

407
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,066
Mom.

408
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,288
I’m here.

409
00:35:55,177 --> 00:35:57,333
I asked myself. What did she do wrong?

410
00:35:58,111 --> 00:36:05,000
Was she wrong because she loves me and wants
to protect me from the world outside?

411
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:12,377
But this world doesn’t belong to anyone.

412
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:15,200
So, one day I know I’ll be able to break free.

413
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:17,688
Because I still have time.

414
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:23,155
Yes, time is on my side.

415
00:36:24,222 --> 00:36:25,577
That’s why I decided to leave.

416
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:30,222
But just because I decided
to leave doesn’t mean I lost.

417
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:36,577
The one who lost isn’t me or Mom.

418
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:52,266
You’re still mad at me?

419
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:55,977
I’m not mad. I’m not angry.

420
00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:03,088
I still love you.

421
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,022
It hurts now. But it will heal.

422
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:13,222
There’s still time for me to heal.

423
00:37:14,644 --> 00:37:17,822
You take care of yourself.

424
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:27,333
Thank you
for helping me with the bridge.

425
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:31,111
When it rains again, it’ll be easy
for the villagers to cross the creek.

426
00:37:32,488 --> 00:37:36,800
Yes, because of the bridge
you helped build.

427
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:39,644
The bridge I call Wang.

428
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,977
It’s been an honor.

429
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:48,200
Mom said thank you for everything.

430
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,133
She doesn’t want to say goodbye?

431
00:38:05,555 --> 00:38:06,288
It’s all broken now.

432
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:10,933
The world isn’t anyone’s.

433
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,311
I’ll never forget
about the 52-hertz whale.

434
00:38:19,622 --> 00:38:24,800
About this cave and the time
I’ve spent with you here.

435
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:32,155
It lasted just for a few days,
but I was happy.

436
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:38,422
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

437
00:38:39,288 --> 00:38:43,244
Can I ask you to do something for me one last time?

438
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:50,488
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

439
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:54,800
I’ll never forget about the 52-hertz whale.

440
00:38:56,666 --> 00:39:02,022
About this cave
and the time I’ve spent with you here.

441
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:07,488
It lasted just for a few days,
but I was happy.

442
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:14,777
I was happy too.

443
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:24,400
You must think I’m a coward.

444
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:27,955
But do you think I’m selfish, too?

445
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:30,444
No one is truly selfless.

446
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:36,044
No matter what I choose, I’m selfish.

447
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:43,000
That’s why I decided to be brave
about it and listened to my heart.

448
00:39:44,688 --> 00:39:48,600
I'm sorry I don’t have it in me to do what you do.

449
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,555
Yes, you have it. You know you have it.

450
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,533
It’s in here.

451
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:09,555
All those nights we lay next to each other.

452
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:17,044
We were inches apart,
but I could hear it beat.

453
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,644
I know you have it.

454
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:29,866
That’s why you didn’t say it outright
last night that it was all in my head.

455
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:32,088
And that you had no feelings for me.

456
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:43,600
You’re not done with the book.

457
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:46,688
Here. Keep it.

458
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:53,688
Thank you.

459
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:02,911
The Definition of Love.

460
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,244
Do you think different times make different people?

461
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:12,333
Yes, I do.

462
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:16,311
But we can’t blame
different times for who we have become.

463
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,755
For that, we only have ourselves to blame.

464
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:24,355
Maybe you’re right.

465
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:28,044
Sadly, some people can't change.

466
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:43,577
But why?

467
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:49,066
Your dad gave you this.

468
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:52,600
Dad is inside me now.

469
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:54,422
I think you should keep it.

470
00:42:12,955 --> 00:42:13,688
My gift.

471
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,044
Goodbye, Uncle In.

472
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:32,111
Goodbye.

473
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:53,133
Can I ask you to do something for me one last time?

474
00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:56,955
What is it?

475
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:06,311
I finally met you. But you got away.

476
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:12,755
We got close. But we couldn’t touch.

477
00:43:15,466 --> 00:43:20,244
I won’t ask you if you love me
or if you feel the same way about me.

478
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,577
Because I know you will never answer.

479
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:27,133
And there’s nothing I can do
to force the answer from you either.

480
00:43:29,044 --> 00:43:30,777
All I want to ask of you now is that...

481
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:37,622
Can I hug you and you hug me back?

482
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:42,822
Can you hug me
with your true feelings for me?

483
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,422
Be true to yourself and hug me.

484
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:50,888
Hug me with all your feelings for me.

485
00:43:52,111 --> 00:43:53,444
Can you do that for me?

486
00:43:56,977 --> 00:44:00,711
Just one hug for us to
treasure for the rest of our lives.

487
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:18,644
Wang.

488
00:45:21,444 --> 00:45:23,222
Hold on to your beliefs

489
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,688
and be true to your instincts.

490
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:31,466
Use your talent for good.

491
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,533
And maybe one day...

492
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,688
Yes, Uncle In.

493
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,911
I’ll hold on to my beliefs.

494
00:46:34,688 --> 00:46:36,333
And be true to my nature.

495
00:46:39,377 --> 00:46:40,288
And one day...

496
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:44,888
Maybe one day...

497
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,311
But sadly, for you, In.

498
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,422
I know that day won’t come.

499
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:08,977
Wang, get out now.

500
00:47:08,977 --> 00:47:10,950
- No, I’ll drive.
- No.

501
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,220
We'll get lost again with you driving.

502
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,444
- But you get lost all the time.
- You get lost too.

503
00:47:15,444 --> 00:47:17,266
- Get out.
- No, I'll drive.

504
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:19,555
- Get out.
- Please, let me drive.

505
00:47:20,111 --> 00:47:21,511
Please let me drive.

506
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:33,755
I’ll let you drive first.

507
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,555
But this time we take turns, okay?

508
00:49:19,888 --> 00:49:21,177
Honey, are you hungry?

509
00:49:21,555 --> 00:49:23,644
Do you want to stop
for some congee in the city?

510
00:49:23,644 --> 00:49:25,711
Since we left early, there’s still time.

511
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:27,955
I’m not hungry.

512
00:49:29,822 --> 00:49:31,088
You’re not hungry?

513
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:36,355
Fine. We’ll get home faster this way.

514
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:39,555
But if you get hungry on the way,
you let me know.

515
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,422
We’ll stop for some food. Okay?

516
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:54,311
Do you know what happened
to my missing sunglasses?

517
00:49:54,444 --> 00:49:57,888
I called Elsa to discuss
our project this morning.

518
00:49:57,888 --> 00:50:00,688
It was only when I started to complain
about the missing sunglasses

519
00:50:00,688 --> 00:50:02,078
that she said,

520
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,733
“Are you talking about
the pair that comes with a chain?”

521
00:50:07,222 --> 00:50:12,111
“You said there was something
wrong with the lens”

522
00:50:12,111 --> 00:50:14,577
"and asked me to have
them fixed for you. Remember?"

523
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:23,288
I was looking forward to
seeing the world in blue today.

524
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:29,528
And just like that, we left for the
latitude 13 degrees 45 minutes north

525
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,555
and longitude
100 degrees 31 minutes east.

526
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:36,822
Yes, that’s Bangkok.

527
00:50:36,824 --> 00:50:39,600
The city I don't know
when I'll be able to leave.

528
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:47,222
I left his place that day
and I haven’t been back ever since.

529
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:53,244
I haven’t heard from him either.

530
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,688
Uncle In.

531
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:06,111
From him, I learned that
people may live in the same world.

532
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,933
But people experience it differently.

533
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:13,022
I learned from him
sometimes we can’t change people.

534
00:51:14,555 --> 00:51:17,466
Because some people just don’t change.

535
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:22,822
Uncle In,

536
00:51:27,355 --> 00:51:28,933
I will never forget you.

537
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,133
It’s daytime here in my world.

538
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:39,000
But your world is still in the evening.

539
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,088
I will never forget about my journey

540
00:51:48,311 --> 00:51:51,711
to 180 degrees longitude

541
00:51:52,711 --> 00:51:54,755
where I got to spend
my days in the woods.

542
00:51:57,333 --> 00:52:02,711
I will never forget about the 52-hertz
whale who doesn’t live in the ocean.

543
00:52:06,955 --> 00:52:15,044
No one understands what the whale
is sending out, but I do.

544
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:18,111
We were just an inch away
from each other.

545
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,688
We were so close
it felt like we could touch each other.

546
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,155
But we couldn't.

547
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:31,200
Because of the 180 degrees longitude
that separated us.

548
00:52:34,733 --> 00:52:35,533
In.

549
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:41,244
I will never forget
the time we spent together.

550
00:52:45,488 --> 00:52:51,200
I know it was short,
but it was beautiful.

551
00:53:13,622 --> 00:53:16,333
(To you who call yourself a parent)

552
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:19,348
(You can only give birth
to them but you don’t own them)

553
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,350
(To you who are still young)

554
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:25,438
(You have to bleed
first before you learn)

555
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,440
(To you who call themselves wise)

556
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,800
(Don’t let your cowardice
get the better of you)

557
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,222
(Pick a side or throw away
what you believe in.)
