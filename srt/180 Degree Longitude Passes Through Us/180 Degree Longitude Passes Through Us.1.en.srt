1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,130
My time with Dad was short,
but I remember it vividly.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,040
We'd often play with the globe together.

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,770
He would teach me
what latitude and longitude are.

4
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,820
He's the one who named me Wang.

5
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,950
He'd always tell me that he wanted to travel
all the way from the north pole to the south pole.

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,730
And I'd ask him to take me with him.

7
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,350
But in the end,

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,150
he went farther away than the north pole.

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,950
And left me here,
playing with the globe all by myself.

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,570
My dream is to travel and

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,040
to discover things that we don't know of,

12
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,730
thereby uncovering the secrets of life.

13
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,820
But in reality,

14
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,680
I've never been outside of the latitude
of 13 degrees 45 minutes north

15
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,080
and the longitude of
100 degrees 31 minutes east.

16
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,040
Yes, that's Bangkok.

17
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,310
I was born and raised here
and it'll be my twentieth year tomorrow.

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,620
I moved in with my mom after
graduating from boarding school,

19
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,460
but the coordinates have
practically stayed the same.

20
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,530
Are you all dressed up?

21
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,860
You told me we were leaving early.
You wanted to get there by noon.

22
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,970
I'm here now, aren't I?
We'll get there in time.

23
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,730
You think so?

24
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,060
By the time you get done with your make up,
we're bound to be late.

25
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,040
Well, I'm the Great Sasiwimol.

26
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,730
I can't let the world see my bare face.

27
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,240
You're pretty either way.

28
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,130
I'm not done with it. Give it back.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,460
Give it back.

30
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,460
The Great Sasivimol is my mom.

31
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,040
I'm Sasivimol.

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,710
There's a reason we're so close.

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,170
Sure, I grew up in a boarding school.

34
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,220
But her weekends belonged to me.

35
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,310
Stop it!

36
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,570
She would take me to amusement parks.

37
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,170
To the movies. To toy stores.

38
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,440
She bought me everything.

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,130
As if to make it up
for the lack of fatherly figure around.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,620
Why can you listen to me?
You're not a kid anymore.

41
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,260
No, my mom isn't a widow.

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,220
She divorced Dad before he died.

43
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,860
For me, my mom is my best friend.

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,680
Good morning, my gay friend.

45
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,730
No. What do you mean,
did I leave? I'm still home.

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,480
I overslept.

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,000
Your wine was the culprit.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,970
I couldn't wake up because of your wine.

49
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,710
My mom is a drama director.

50
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,730
- Elsa…
- She's famous in her industry.

51
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,730
Everything she's done is a success.

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,660
Even though it's been
adapted way too often.

53
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,370
If the place is all right,
we'll film it there.

54
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,710
It's tiring being picky.

55
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,510
For this version
of Engraved in My Heart,

56
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,510
I want the male lead
to be a prince from the north.

57
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,570
Did the actors say yes?

58
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,770
In that case,
we can start filming next month.

59
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,860
We'll do all the scenes
at the male lead's house first.

60
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,040
And will Nat be
my art director for the drama?

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,260
Elsa, I have to go.

62
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,880
Don't forget to ask Nat.
I don't want to talk to him.

63
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,080
He'd think I'm interested in him.

64
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,040
Let me know if he says yes.

65
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,170
And tell him I really need him for this.

66
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,820
Hi.

67
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,060
Why are you here?

68
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,420
I wanted to say goodbye.

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,000
I told you not to come. My son's here.

70
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,730
Who is it, Honey?

71
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,820
I'm moving to Vietnam for good.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm starting a business
there with my friends.

73
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,280
The electrician.

74
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,460
That's why I'm here to get my things.

75
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,080
Could you look at the electric shower?
It doesn't seem to work.

76
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,640
Hooray, it's working again.

77
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,640
Ouch, it's too hot.

78
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,020
I better go into the shower now
or we'll be late.

79
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,150
I know that my Mom has her own world.

80
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,130
I have mine, too.

81
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,840
Our worlds come together
once in a while.

82
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,040
After my graduation
from the boarding school,

83
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,880
I officially got to see her world.

84
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,400
It was a year ago
that she got me enrolled into college.

85
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,880
However, our worlds
are still pretty much very different.

86
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,370
I guess Dad's world must have been
different from hers, too.

87
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,310
I often look at the old photos
that I took from Dad's house

88
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,530
and I can't help but feel…

89
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,440
I want to know Dad
beyond these photos and memories.

90
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,510
I want to exist in his world.

91
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,260
You look like you're going
there for three months.

92
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,460
You may fall in love with the place
and want to stay there forever.

93
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,860
But will be you okay?

94
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,330
Since that'd mean no school for me.

95
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,730
Get the car now. I'll wait here.

96
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,080
Hi, Elsa.

97
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,460
Did it go well?

98
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,970
For real? He said yes?

99
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,710
Wonderful.

100
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,530
Yes, I'm about to leave.

101
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,080
Did you tell him that
I really, really needed him?

102
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,130
Oh, my.

103
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,930
Honey. Get out. I'm driving.

104
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,570
It will take us years
before we get there.

105
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,310
You go slow and always get lost.

106
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,000
Come on. Don't be like this.

107
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,020
I'm slow but reliable.
You're fast but always lose your temper.

108
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,330
Elsa, I need to go.

109
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,480
It's time to take
my handsome prince to the north.

110
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,000
Stop it.

111
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,040
What's it with you and men?

112
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,970
Spare my son for once, please.
My gay friend.

113
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,950
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

114
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,840
Step in the car, my prince.

115
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,510
What is it now?

116
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,240
We're going for a vacation
and you don't seem excited.

117
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,350
You're mad at me
for not letting you drive?

118
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,510
You always go fast. It worries me.

119
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,150
It's not that.

120
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,240
Then, what is it, my prince?

121
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,080
Why do you always do that to Elsa?

122
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,600
It's homophobic.

123
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,060
Damn, I didn't know
my prince was a queer rights activist.

124
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,970
Stop calling me prince.

125
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,950
Ma'am.

126
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,220
I'm sorr,y Ma'am.

127
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,240
I forgot to tell you.
Your electrician will be here today.

128
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,400
Should he look at
the electric shower while you're away?

129
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,020
Or do you want to
supervise him yourself?

130
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,280
Let him have a look.

131
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,820
Please supervise the situation on my behalf.

132
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,420
Yes, Ma'am.

133
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,910
It's Saturday
and yet the traffic is horrible.

134
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,130
I'm sick of it. Sick, sick, sick.

135
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,970
I told you to leave early.

136
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,820
It doesn't matter when.
The traffic here is always horrible.

137
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,130
It doesn't matter if it's weekend or the weekdays.
If it's Chinese or Thai holidays.

138
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,640
This is no good place to live.
I want to leave.

139
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,800
You wouldn’t leave.
All you do is complain.

140
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,200
You complain and complain
and yet find a way to get used to it.

141
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,110
Plus, you don't really care
about a good place to live.

142
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,020
How come?

143
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,910
If you did, you wouldn't have
made me study here.

144
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,260
And I would left a long time ago.

145
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,660
You're sure you can afford a good life
elsewhere when you're not educated?

146
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,040
You think universities
are the only place where we can learn?

147
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,200
I'm not discussing this with you again.

148
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,680
We've talked
about this for a millionth time.

149
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,480
You stay with me. You need to study.

150
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
You made me study for a year.
I can't stand it anymore.

151
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,660
Can't stand it?

152
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,820
Is your education
something you tolerate?

153
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,820
Is travelling from your stupid
north pole to your stupid south pole

154
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,240
so important it feels like
you tolerate school?

155
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,310
It's not stupid.
Dreams are never stupid.

156
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,440
And you're going to leave me?

157
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,510
Now you're crying?

158
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,110
Don't cry, my baby.

159
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,770
The reporters would love this.

160
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,040
The Great Sasivimol. The biggest female
name in the directing business

161
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,310
cries because
she's afraid her son would leave.

162
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,040
It's because I'm worried
about you, you know?

163
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,730
I know.

164
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,060
I love you so much.

165
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,770
I love you, too.

166
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,880
I can get you anything you want.

167
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,820
All I'm asking is for you to graduate.

168
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,820
Can you do this much for me?

169
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,710
Yes.

170
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,710
- You promised?
- Yes.

171
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,150
Can I ask you something?

172
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,400
Does that mean you took
a cold shower this morning?

173
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,400
Don't keep it from me
if the shower breaks next time.

174
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,080
Are you going to fix it for me?

175
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,020
No. I'll boil water for you.

176
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,730
What are you doing?

177
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,240
Get down now.

178
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,970
Now. Wang, get down.

179
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
(Next Break)
You've done more than enough. I'm driving.

180
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,400
Drive safely then.

181
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,810
We've gotten lost for a tenth time.

182
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,050
But it's nice, though.

183
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,720
Imagine a TV drama.

184
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,630
No one would watch it
if there was no surprise?

185
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,780
Sure, sure.

186
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,560
I told you to take that turn
and you didn't listen.

187
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,740
Well, the GPS said otherwise.

188
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,360
I'm calling Elsa.

189
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,560
Elsa, I'm lost.

190
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,380
Somehow we ended up in the mountains.

191
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,700
I was following the GPS
and this happened.

192
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,900
You gave us the location.
Are you sure it's the right place?

193
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,500
What? What did you say?

194
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,100
Here? There's nothing to tell.

195
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,100
All I see is the mountains.

196
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,920
I should've listened to Wang.

197
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,760
Fine, I'll call you
if we get lost again.

198
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,470
Yes, goodbye.

199
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,520
Wang, get out.

200
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,100
- No.
- No, get out.

201
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
You've done more than enough. I'm driving.

202
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,580
- I told you to get out.
- Let me drive.

203
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,670
No.

204
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,520
Drive safely, then.

205
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,500
You can trust me.

206
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,650
Oh my gosh.

207
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,650
Is there a destination
you don't know how to get to?

208
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,650
For me, it's exciting.

209
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,470
There's no map for it.

210
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,520
All you have to do is draw a line

211
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,540
and follow your instincts.

212
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,670
You're going too fast.

213
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,520
I know how to drive.

214
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,500
Watch out. Watch out!

215
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,180
Stop being dramatic.

216
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,520
It's nothing.

217
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,780
Slow. Slow. Go slow. You'll crash.

218
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,720
I won't.

219
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,740
- Go slow and smooth.
- Stop complaining.

220
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,650
What tree is that?

221
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,010
Watch out!

222
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,960
The car in front of us
is slowing us down.

223
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Don't get too close to him.

224
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,780
Don't honk. It's rude.

225
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,610
You should take a nap.

226
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,780
How could I with you driving?

227
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
What do you mean? I'm a good driver.

228
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,810
Why are you taking us here?

229
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,810
It's a shortcut.

230
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,920
Imagine a TV drama.

231
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,300
No one would watch
it if all we did was go straight.

232
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,670
Right?

233
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,800
No one would watch it either
if we get there too early.

234
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,160
I think we're approaching
the latitude of 18.8801518218...

235
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,540
Stop it. Silly boy.

236
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,560
Your shortcut doesn't look promising.

237
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,300
It's getting dark as we speak.

238
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,920
I thought you wanted to enjoy a sunset?

239
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,250
Oh my stop it.

240
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,180
Why can't you listen to me for once?

241
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,180
Look what you did.

242
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,030
No service?

243
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,780
Where are you going?

244
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,740
There might be houses up there.

245
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,010
I'll get some help.

246
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,670
How do you know?

247
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,670
We should go this way
and look for service.

248
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,360
Stay in the car. I'll be right back.

249
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,430
Wang.

250
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,300
Wang.

251
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,830
You're right, I lied.

252
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,630
This here isn't the latitude
of 18.8801518218

253
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,070
and the longitude of 99.347722166.

254
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,250
But what harm could it do?

255
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,250
It's not like Mom has been
completely honest with me either.

256
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,670
Who knows? Going off course for a few steps

257
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,360
could bring a big change in your life.

258
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,210
Who are you here for?

259
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,450
I'm sorry but my car has gotten stuck.

260
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,320
Do you possibly have any phone service here?

261
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,670
Here? No, there is none.

262
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
How do I call for help?

263
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,250
I'll ask Boss.

264
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,900
Boss.

265
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,300
Well, I'm leaving.

266
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,450
It'll be done in a couple days
if it doesn't rain.

267
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,900
Let's hope it doesn't.
The villagers need the bridge.

268
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,980
(Next Break)
You scared me.
I thought you got lost in the woods.

269
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,070
I told you I would bring help, didn't I?

270
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,560
Get in and start the car.

271
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,430
Well, I'm leaving.

272
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,360
It'll be done in a couple days
if it doesn't rain.

273
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,300
Let's hope it doesn't.
The villagers need the bridge.

274
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,540
I'm sorry but my car's gotten stuck.

275
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,160
It's 200 meters from the entrance.

276
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,670
- I'd like to know if...
- Sangkam, get the equipment.

277
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,740
Let's stop for now.

278
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,740
We have a car to rescue.

279
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,870
Let's have a look.

280
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,160
Where were you headed?
How did you end up here?

281
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,810
I though it was a shortcut.

282
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,360
There's no shortcut here.

283
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,270
Oh, my.

284
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,050
You scared me.
I thought you got lost in the woods.

285
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,360
I told you I would bring help, didn't I?

286
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,670
This is like what we see in a drama.

287
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,120
Wait until you see the big house there.
It's just like what we see in...

288
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,650
Get in and start the car.

289
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,540
In. In.

290
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,560
You're In? Inthawut.

291
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,720
Mol?

292
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,500
Oh my, I'm so happy.

293
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,070
I can't believe it. I'm so happy.

294
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,210
Is it really you?

295
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,940
Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.

296
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,670
What are you doing here?

297
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,720
I should be the one asking that.
What are you doing here?

298
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,920
Ask him.

299
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,580
I was on my way to
a location for my new project

300
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,100
and he's the one had us end up here.

301
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,450
Wang, this is In. Inthawut.

302
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,650
Do you remember him?

303
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,630
How can he? He's all grown-up now.

304
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,140
He knows you.

305
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,700
He once asked me when he saw your photo.

306
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,980
Who's the kid?

307
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,300
I'm not a kid anymore.

308
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,050
Who told you?

309
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,250
You still look handsome
like you did in the old days.

310
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,160
What are you doing? Greet him properly.

311
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,630
Don't just stand there. Now.

312
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,580
Nice to meet you, In.

313
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,230
I've finally found a shortcut to you.

314
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,360
Do you know he wanted to know you.

315
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,320
Well, your wish has come true now.

316
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:36,270
It must have been fate for us to meet
in the middle of nowhere like this.

317
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,900
How long has it been?

318
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,030
20… has it been 20 years?

319
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,900
All right. Let's save
the excitement for later.

320
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,160
First, we have a car to rescue.

321
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,900
Oh, my. I forgot.

322
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,740
I mean, I'm so happy.

323
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,450
Let's get started.

324
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,120
All done.

325
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,560
The car has been saved.

326
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,540
Mol, let's go to my house.

327
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,160
Your filming location can wait.

328
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Sure, I'd love to.

329
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,560
You're a big architect. I want to see
what your house looks like.

330
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,050
And we need to make up for the lost time.

331
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,050
I've missed you so much.

332
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,920
This is better than those houses on the TV.

333
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,070
Who would've thought there would be
such a grand house in the woods.

334
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,010
If it hadn’t been for Wang
and his crazy idea to take a shortcut,

335
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,720
and the car getting stuck
in the middle of nowhere,

336
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,960
I don't think I would
have found your empire.

337
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,010
I wouldn't call it an empire.
It's more like a comfort zone to me.

338
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,540
You talk as if it's dangerous outside.

339
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,320
I heard you're a college professor.

340
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,810
Don't you get tired driving
here and there every day?

341
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,230
I quit. I'm tired of the system.

342
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,470
But why?

343
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,630
But your "nephew" isn't so different either.

344
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,210
Wang, come here.

345
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,430
Come here.

346
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,540
This is your Uncle In.

347
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,050
Doesn't he look like he has an "indie" spirit to him?

348
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,810
You two would make good friends.

349
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:09,050
In, Wang's a rebellious kid.

350
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,250
He claims to be made of young blood.

351
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,610
Do you know what she means by rebellious?

352
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
What does it mean?

353
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,650
- Anyone who doesn't share her belief.
- Anyone who doesn't share my belief.

354
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:33,780
Please, give me a tour of your house.
How many acres did you say?

355
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,470
The Great Sasivimol
has come to grace my place.

356
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,720
Would you give me the honor
to prepare dinner for you, my lady?

357
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,140
Yes, In. I'll gladly accept your invitation.

358
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,070
Do you remember that play you took part in
on my request? Julie, My Lady?

359
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Of course.
The director was horrible.

360
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,140
I once worked all night
for the project.

361
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,380
And yet you dragged me to
the rehearsal early in the morning.

362
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,100
Do you still keep in touch
with Deunden who played Julie?

363
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,180
Of course not.

364
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,580
Since you've taken on
this "hermit" lifestyle.

365
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,760
Do you know she married
into an upper class family?

366
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,610
She's rich now.

367
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,610
With a dozen kids of her own.

368
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,920
However, her figure
has changed drastically.

369
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,270
What about you?

370
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,540
Who's your wife? Is she here?

371
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,100
No, she isn't. Because I'm not married.

372
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,300
I don't believe you.

373
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,670
How can you be single?

374
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,320
I mean, you're in the middle of nowhere.

375
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,010
I'm sure you keep her here right?

376
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Or should I say 'them' here?

377
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,030
Look all you want
but you won't find anyone.

378
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,030
I'm still the same.
I'm not seeing anyone.

379
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,650
Then, I guess I'm the winner?

380
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,160
I have a dozen men in my life.

381
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,540
I mean, I used to have them.

382
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,540
Now he's the only man in my life.

383
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,430
You know, you two could be mistaken
for brother and sister.

384
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,720
That's what they all say.

385
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,870
He doesn't even call me Mom.

386
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,320
To him, I'm his honey.

387
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,010
But I like it.

388
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,100
It's nice to have
a son who can be your friend.

389
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,030
A modern mom, I guess.

390
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,980
But I don't know how long
you'll be with me.

391
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,810
I'm sure you'll leave me
when you find someone.

392
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,070
Having you in my life
feels like a full-time job already.

393
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,430
How can I look for another one?

394
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,940
I'd rather be single. Like you, In.

395
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,870
You know your house is really nice and cozy.

396
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,250
If this were my house, I wouldn't leave at all.

397
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:22,300
You can stay here.
Don't waste your money on hotel rooms.

398
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:25,160
I've already paid for the room.

399
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,120
But that's not the case here.

400
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
I don't want to intrude.

401
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,560
I know you love your privacy.

402
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,980
The guest room here
is pretty private.

403
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,560
You can stay here for a month
and we may not see each other.

404
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,850
Do you want anything
to drink as an appetiser?

405
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,920
I'll ask Sangkam to make his best dishes.

406
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,500
But can you handle local food?

407
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,980
Did you forget I participated in
several volunteer camps in college?

408
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,450
I happen to have some wine in the car.

409
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:58,160
It might be some wine to her,
but she's brought a whole crate.

410
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,700
You haven't changed a bit.

411
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,920
But tonight,
I want you to try our local wine.

412
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,410
The local farmers here need our support.

413
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,120
What about you, Wang?
What do you want to drink?

414
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,830
Alcohol, wine, or cold beer?

415
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,030
Will your mom be okay?

416
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,540
I'm an adult now. Why wouldn't she be okay?

417
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:28,540
In, don't you dare seduce my son with your booze.

418
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,270
My son is a good kid.
He doesn't drink nor smoke.

419
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:38,850
How can I drink when
the Great Sasivimol hogs all the booze?

420
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,030
But today, I'm willing
to make an exception for you.

421
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,450
- Then, what do you want?
- Anything.

422
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,850
You're a young blood
and yet you're fine with anything?

423
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,740
Your reply deserves an F.

424
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,810
Well, I can drink anything.

425
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,650
That's even worse.
It shows you're not willing to decide.

426
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,540
Let me decide for you then.
A glass of warm milk should do.

427
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,100
Good. You drink your milk.

428
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,580
Kids these days need someone
like you to put them in their places.

429
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,630
You shouldn't have quit
your job as a professor.

430
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,760
We need someone like you
to teach them how to behave.

431
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,630
Well just so you know

432
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,030
the other professors accused me of
being too soft on the students.

433
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,940
Even though I was only being impartial.

434
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,120
But doesn't that mean you
weren't willing to decide either?

435
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,150
(Next Break)
I divorced Siam and you went off the grid.

436
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,910
And then Siam got himself into the accident.

437
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,600
I'm sorry.

438
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,880
What are you sorry for?

439
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,500
You shouldn't have quit
your job as a professor.

440
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,760
We need someone like you
to teach them how to behave.

441
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,270
Well just so you know

442
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,630
the other professors accused me of
being too soft on the students.

443
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,540
Even though I was only being impartial.

444
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
But doesn't that mean you
weren't willing to decide either?

445
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,320
Well, all right.

446
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,870
I've decided to stay here for tonight.

447
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,120
I want to keep talking to In. It's fun.

448
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,500
I'll go get our stuff from the car.

449
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,160
Well, what do you think? Your "nephew".

450
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,900
He isn't too bad.

451
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,340
He is exactly like his father.

452
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,030
But I think he takes after you.

453
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,140
Really?

454
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,670
I disagree.

455
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,100
I mean, we both are stubborn.

456
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,380
But at least, I'm open about it.

457
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,250
He keeps everything to himself
just like his father.

458
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,780
That's what I don't get about him.

459
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,030
That's what I didn't get
about his father.

460
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,100
Oh, my. I forgot to brink you water.

461
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,470
In.

462
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,430
Where have you been all this time?

463
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,100
I divorced Siam
and you went off the grid.

464
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,650
And then Siam got himself into the accident.

465
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,160
I'm sorry.

466
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,520
What are you sorry for?

467
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,100
You're sorry that we got a divorce,
or you're sorry that he died.

468
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,360
After graduation,
I got a scholarship to study abroad.

469
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,700
I'm sorry I didn't stay in touch.

470
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,540
I was over there
when he got into the accident.

471
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,610
But surely you could've called?

472
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,030
I had so many things
I wanted to talk to you about.

473
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,010
I don't get it.

474
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,000
I mean, after all these years...

475
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,580
we're here now, aren't we?

476
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,740
After how many years?
What a coincidence.

477
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,030
Yes, what a remarkable coincidence.

478
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,450
The kind that only happens on TV.

479
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,780
Mol.

480
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,320
I'm sorry.

481
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,410
I'm genuinely sorry
for everything that happened to you.

482
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,450
You don't have to believe me.

483
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,610
But I never forgot about you and Siam.

484
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,830
And you should know

485
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,740
I always have your best interest at heart.

486
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,230
Here's your luggage.

487
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,960
Where do you want me to keep it?

488
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,920
The Great Sasivimol is over the moon
because of her guest room.

489
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,120
Aren't you going to join her?

490
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,610
I can sleep in the living room.

491
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,960
Why's that?

492
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,070
I grew up in a boarding school.
I've never shared a room with her.

493
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Is that so?

494
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,870
Moreover, I can’t stay with her
for 24 hours without losing my sanity.

495
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,010
Why? You two seem so close though.

496
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,030
One minute we get along,
and the next we start to fight.

497
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,320
I'm not sure whether to think

498
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,360
of her as my mom or my sister.

499
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,250
Is that thing you carry around important to you?

500
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,920
Yes it is.

501
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,250
Can I see it?

502
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,700
It was my favorite toy growing up.

503
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,650
So you like geography?

504
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,450
No.

505
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,780
It's just that I want to travel...

506
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,230
from the north pole
to its southern counterpart.

507
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,780
And learn of all the things
I never got to know.

508
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,960
And just like that...

509
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,050
the world is in your hands.

510
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,030
You're speaking formally?

511
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,450
I'm sorry. It's an old habit of mine.

512
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,300
I thought you were my student.

513
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,780
You did it again.

514
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,980
I said it's an old habit, didn't I?

515
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,940
I can't call myself Uncle,
since it makes me sound old.

516
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,780
Thai pronouns are what makes the language difficult.

517
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,940
Even if they help convey politeness.

518
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,700
To be honest, I think we don't need
anything other than 'you' and 'I'.

519
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,120
They're polite. They make us equal.

520
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,230
Do you speak formally to Sangkam?

521
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,120
No.

522
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,540
Then don't talk about equality.

523
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,960
You're good. I give you one score for it.

524
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,720
But language and the mind are closely connected.

525
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,430
How so?

526
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,210
Take us for example.

527
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
We're like nephew and uncle
and it doesn't feel like it.

528
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,780
And why is that?

529
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,070
Because it's unbelievable.

530
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:53,980
My long-lost "nephew" of all people
got lost and wandered to my place.

531
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,100
So you don't believe it?

532
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,340
What are you two doing there?

533
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:14,140
I'm dressed up for tonight.

534
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,540
(Next Episode)
How long did you study abroad?

535
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,540
It was for a Master's and a PhD degree.
So almost five years in total.

536
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,180
When you were there,
you didn't find anyone?

537
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,500
What about you? Are you seeing someone?

538
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,670
I think we have a lot in common.

539
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,030
You like your comfort zone.

540
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,630
I guess.

541
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,010
A middle-aged man falling for a young
woman. It's common in English books.

542
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,630
Go. Leave now.

543
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,920
I don't care where to.
Go to your stupid north pole.

544
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,340
Can I sleep with you tonight?

545
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,850
I promise I don't snore.
