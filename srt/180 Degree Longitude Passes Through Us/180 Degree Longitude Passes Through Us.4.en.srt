1
00:00:54,911 --> 00:01:02,733
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

2
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,644
(Previously)
What did she say to you before she left?

3
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:07,955
- Nothing.
- Don’t lie.

4
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,666
I can see through her.

5
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:12,660
She’s planning a surprise for me.

6
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:15,711
Can I ask for my birthday present now?

7
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,444
Well as long as it’s something that I can give you.

8
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:25,777
Can you tell me if Dad…

9
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:31,288
We're really sorry it happened.

10
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:34,933
I’m worried about you.
I don’t want you to go.

11
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,044
But it’s my duty.

12
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:40,111
What duty? You’re just a student.

13
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:42,622
My duty as a citizen.

14
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,466
Then, it’s my duty too.

15
00:01:44,844 --> 00:01:45,577
What duty?

16
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,711
Don’t be ridiculous.
You think you’re going away for a war?

17
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:55,222
Come in, In.

18
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,288
You’re not done packing yet?

19
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:59,244
What all are you taking with you?

20
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,111
You're only going away for a few days.

21
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:02,444
Don’t you have clothes at home?

22
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,844
I’m a lady, you know. Look.

23
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:10,088
I had to move everything
to the smaller suitcase.

24
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:12,266
I’m not taking the clothes.

25
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:17,355
What took me so long
was my skincare products.

26
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,933
I need the perfume and the makeup
because I don't want to look tired

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,244
after the flight.

28
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:27,266
I'm sure you won't look tired
after a one-hour flight.

29
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:29,911
In, I’m not young anymore.

30
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:32,066
I don’t look decent without make-up.

31
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,266
My son is all grown-up now.

32
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:37,755
BY the way, did he go to bed yet?

33
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:39,644
I don’t think so.

34
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:45,622
I got so excited and forgot
to take you out for a celebratory drink.

35
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,600
In, what do you think of Wang?

36
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:54,288
He’s smart. There’s something
in him that could explode anytime.

37
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:56,622
You have a keen eye.

38
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:59,222
I don’t know when he’ll explode.

39
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:01,244
He got it from you though.

40
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:02,488
No.

41
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:06,933
I’m more like a firework. I need fire to go off.

42
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:10,866
But unlike me, he can explode on his own.

43
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:17,777
Honestly, I don’t get why he’s so upset about his life.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,844
He is different from people our age.

45
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:22,733
While we reminisce of our days from the past,

46
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:25,800
he thinks about
the present and the future.

47
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:29,488
You seem to understand him
better than I do.

48
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:32,222
It is because you’ve dealt with
students like him before?

49
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:33,555
I’ve dealt with worse.

50
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,488
Some of my students got so upset
about what was happening in the country,

51
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:37,933
that they ended up getting depressed as a result of it.

52
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,244
That’s exactly what I don’t understand.

53
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:42,288
It’s not his place
to worry about such things.

54
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:45,822
Take me for an example.
I’ve been through a lot more than him.

55
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,622
But I got over it.

56
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,800
How can he talk about changing the world
when he isn’t actually strong enough to do it?

57
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,622
But maybe the reason he isn’t strong enough
is because we don’t let him be.

58
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:01,533
No one knows whether they’re strong or not

59
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:03,333
until there comes
a time when they have to face the truth.

60
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,977
For all I know the truth isn’t pretty

61
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:08,933
and that’s why I don’t want him to face it.

62
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,022
I think Wang adores you.

63
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,866
This doesn’t happen very often.

64
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:28,555
Really?

65
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:30,530
But it’s only reasonable that he does.

66
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:33,088
What do you mean?

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,777
Well, he’s been wanting to see you.

68
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:41,266
When he first found your photo,
he wouldn’t stop asking me who you are.

69
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,933
I had to tell him that your name is Uncle In.

70
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:47,400
And that you were his dad’s junior
and his best friend back in school.

71
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,666
That’s all I told him about you.

72
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,777
I wanted to tell him more about you

73
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:56,266
but I wouldn't be able to do that without bringing up his dad.

74
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:00,377
I guess it’s what people call
a "father-son" bond.

75
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:03,111
He loves his dad a lot.

76
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:05,511
A lot more than he loves me.

77
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:09,666
You’re being silly.

78
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,488
I’m sure he loves you a lot, too.

79
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:18,488
You and Wang. You two are
the cutest mother-and-son duo ever.

80
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,488
Is that really what you think?

81
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,911
You're only doubting yourself because
you're afraid he won't love you, which isn't the case.

82
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:31,022
You think I’m hungry for love, right?

83
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,822
I drink, thinking it can make
the hunger go away but it can't.

84
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,111
And that’s why I can’t stop craving love.

85
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:42,222
That’s why no one sticks around with me but Wang.

86
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:47,088
What about you? Don’t you crave it?

87
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,688
For me, love isn’t meant to be craved.

88
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:59,177
We can just watch it bloom from afar.

89
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:01,666
I don’t need to possess it.

90
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,666
But in the end, it dies there.

91
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,377
And all that’s left is ash.

92
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:09,088
Won’t that ultimately make you regret
not making a move when you had the chance?

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,111
In, you might think I’m hungry for love.

94
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:22,422
But you, you’re simply afraid of love.

95
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:30,666
Love can be a scary thing
if you’re not careful with it.

96
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:33,111
You know this better than I do.

97
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:38,377
You haven’t changed a bit.

98
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,688
You smile and say the harshest thing.

99
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,333
I’m sorry.

100
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:46,244
Don’t worry.

101
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,555
It’s not like you’re wrong.

102
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:53,133
I’m stubborn
and I’m not careful with love.

103
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:55,422
I didn’t mean to...

104
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,533
I told you not to worry about it.

105
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:04,288
In. Inthawut.

106
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,466
You don’t have to apologize.

107
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,000
How long has it been
since I last called you this way?

108
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,600
I didn’t believe it at first.

109
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:22,244
Who knew the architecture
student that took a part in my play

110
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:29,822
would eventually end up becoming my best friend
and the friend I trust the most.

111
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:32,933
Do you remember?

112
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Back then you helped me with everything.

113
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:41,022
“In, can you paint
the background for me?”

114
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:45,466
“In, can you sew these for me?”

115
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:49,266
“In, don’t forget to come by for

116
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:52,244
your rehearsal this weekend.”

117
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,444
You never refused to me once even though you knew

118
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,155
that I only used you
to get to the man I had a crush on.

119
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,755
The man who was always with you.

120
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,844
“In, I like him.”

121
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:16,044
“In, I have to have him.”

122
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,933
“In, I can’t live without him.”

123
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,644
“I love him.”

124
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:23,911
“In, you have to help me.”

125
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:34,466
If you thought love was a scary thing,
then why didn’t you warn me back then?

126
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,711
Well, it's because I loved the both of you
and it’s what you guys hoped for.

127
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,800
Thank you for sayin that, In.

128
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,377
But perhaps you don’t know that

129
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:50,955
I didn’t get what I had hoped for.

130
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:56,600
Siam and I apparently wanted two different things.

131
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,511
And eventually, I didn’t get what I wanted

132
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,888
and he didn't get what he wanted either.

133
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:07,444
So at the end of the day, even you didn’t get what you had hoped for.

134
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,533
Ultimately, no one got what they wanted.

135
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:13,444
I’m so very sorry.

136
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:21,933
This is why this time
I want it to be different.

137
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:33,088
Can I hope for my son to be happy,
successful, and for him to have a perfect family?

138
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,000
Am I allowed to want that for him
as his mother?

139
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,955
We can raise him
in a perfect environment,

140
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:47,111
but when it comes to happiness, success,

141
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,511
and his dreams,

142
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,666
it’s not our call to make, but his.

143
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,577
He may not want what you want.

144
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,222
I’m glad that we met again.

145
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:10,644
I’m glad Wang met you.

146
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:16,088
I hope you can inspire something in him

147
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:19,288
and get him back
on the right path again.

148
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:24,022
I don’t want to be disappointed in him.

149
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:26,488
Could you please do this for me, In?

150
00:10:32,444 --> 00:10:33,333
Look.

151
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,888
TV dramas these days...
I simply don’t know what went wrong.

152
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:48,355
And that’s why the industry needs you.

153
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:52,355
You go to sleep.

154
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,288
You have a long day ahead of you tomorrow.

155
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:05,777
And please don't forget to bring us the good news,
my talented director.

156
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,977
Well, won’t you watch the award ceremony for me?

157
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:13,222
Then, I’m gonna have to do it here.

158
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:16,511
This is the only place
where we have a TV.

159
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:19,711
Watch it with Wang.

160
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:25,933
In.

161
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,488
Are you still that friend that I can trust

162
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:35,533
and put my faith in?

163
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:37,644
Are you?

164
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:48,511
Yes, I am, Mol.

165
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:54,244
I am.

166
00:11:58,155 --> 00:12:01,733
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

167
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,644
You don’t like challenges.

168
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:06,933
You just like challenging people.

169
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:12,533
Why are you two so afraid to talk about Dad?

170
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,800
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

171
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:34,422
That night, I didn’t stay
and listen to their conversation.

172
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,844
All I heard was just a few words.

173
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:43,888
And then my feet took me out here.

174
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:50,311
In the end, I ended up
celebrating my birthday alone as always.

175
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:54,511
And that’s why I hadn’t bothered
with my birthdays before.

176
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,644
For me, it's just another normal day.

177
00:12:58,911 --> 00:12:59,755
Nothing special about it.

178
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:07,111
But this year, I kinda felt it was going to be special.

179
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:15,844
The things I want to know
at a certain longitude…

180
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:19,311
I actually think I’m getting close to them.

181
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:29,666
In said love can be a scary thing
if we aren’t careful with it.

182
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,822
I think love is a lot like
the other side of the creek.

183
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,466
It looks pleasant during the day.

184
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:42,555
But in the evening,
we can never know what lurks there.

185
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:45,866
However, I find it challenging that

186
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:57,422
this was the first time I felt like
I had something in common with my mom.

187
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:19,333
Are you still up?

188
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:22,644
Where had you gone?

189
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
I was out celebrating my birthday.

190
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:32,422
I didn’t know it would upset you this much.

191
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:37,333
I’m not upset.

192
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,688
You don't have to deny it.

193
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:44,133
Just because you’re upset about
something doesn’t mean you’re weak.

194
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:54,022
Usually, I’m not like this.

195
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:58,111
But I don’t know why tonight I…

196
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:15,755
So, was it fun celebrating
your birthday alone?

197
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,888
I don’t know.

198
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:22,333
I guess it was.

199
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:26,688
You call jumping over
the creek at night fun?

200
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:30,244
How was it then?
What did you see on the other side?

201
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:40,466
I didn’t see anything much. It was dark.

202
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:43,111
So, I decided to just sit there and think things through.

203
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,266
And then here I am.

204
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:52,755
Did you learn something new
while you were thinking things through?

205
00:15:55,022 --> 00:16:01,377
I just found out...that I like challenges.

206
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,444
I don’t think it’s wise
to go to the other side at night.

207
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:10,600
If it’s so important to you,
you can go there during the day.

208
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,088
Well, will you go there with me?

209
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,488
I don’t think you like challenges.

210
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,822
You only like to challenge people.

211
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:25,533
Why are you two so afraid
to talk about Dad?

212
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:50,711
It's because we both...

213
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:57,044
we both lost someone we love
when we least expected it.

214
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:07,177
And the pain of itc will always be there.

215
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:11,888
- Don’t you think?
- I just want to know why Dad died.

216
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,600
Is this why you came here?

217
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,511
Tomorrow,

218
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:48,777
Tomorrow,

219
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:56,288
maybe we can go
to the other side together.

220
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:00,466
You don’t have to
come to the airport with me.

221
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:03,244
I know you don’t like
leaving your cave.

222
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:05,022
I’ll be fine with Sangkam.

223
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,200
Wang, don’t you want to go with your Mom?

224
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:09,577
You can explore the town
while you’re there.

225
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:12,000
Don’t worry about him.

226
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:15,533
Let him enjoy the beauty of nature here.

227
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,266
Take care of your “nephew”.

228
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:21,222
Do you think I’m 10 or what?

229
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,911
Please, Madam.

230
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:31,088
Have a safe flight.
And win that award, our big director.

231
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:32,777
Thank you.

232
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:35,511
If I win, we’ll celebrate it together.

233
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:36,800
See you the day after tomorrow.

234
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,844
Honey.

235
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:40,933
Aren’t you going to wish me luck?

236
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:47,577
I’m asking you,
all the deities in the world…

237
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,600
Stop it.

238
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:54,600
I’d be forever in your debt
if you could make my kid normal again.

239
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,377
Bye.

240
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:25,511
And finally, for once, it felt like there was
no one in the world but us.

241
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:33,888
At last, it’s only the two of us
at the longitude of 99.3722160.

242
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:37,266
Thank God I trusted my heart and followed it here.

243
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:39,933
Your Mom has left.

244
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,800
Do you want to explore the city?
You can go if you want.

245
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:45,022
I'd want to stay here.

246
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:47,888
Are you sure?

247
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:52,600
Yes, I want to stay here.

248
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:03,244
FOr it's my only opportunity to be able
to learn something more about him.

249
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,866
Sometimes, he’s warm like the sun.

250
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:13,266
I love these lines, the light,
and how the shadow looks here.

251
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:16,822
Did you intend for this to happen
when designing the house?

252
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:22,244
An architect always thinks
before he draws a line.

253
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:37,622
Your books are hard to read.

254
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,711
It’s because people
these days don’t read.

255
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,133
And in the end, it gets even
harder to read.

256
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:47,644
I think you’re hard to read, too.

257
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,977
Don’t you know?
We can tell a lot from what people read.

258
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,155
So, does this painting
have something to say about you?

259
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:36,111
You can’t look for words
in abstract paintings.

260
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:38,577
They’re for you to feel.

261
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:43,600
I guess he’s right.

262
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:48,088
Because the feelings I have for him...

263
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:51,133
can't be expressed in words.

264
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,333
I don’t know when I started
to have these feelings.

265
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:58,888
Or how I came to have them.

266
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:04,333
At first, I only wanted to meet him
to know more about Dad.

267
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:08,266
But now that I’m here, I want to know more about him.

268
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:20,510
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

269
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,355
Jump over here.

270
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:25,800
I want to hike for the view.

271
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:28,333
Get back here. I’ll drive you there.

272
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:30,555
You’re a chicken.

273
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,420
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

274
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:39,244
A line is important to you.

275
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,644
Because it can later become a bridge or a wall.

276
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:47,222
Do you write a lot?

277
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:49,355
Why's that?

278
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:54,133
It feels like you’re full of ideas and possibly even have what
it takes to be a philosopher.

279
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,111
To be a blogger, you need to know
how to write and narrate stories.

280
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:00,200
I once won an essay contest.

281
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,355
Really? What did you
write in the essay, then?

282
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:08,111
I wrote about crossing the 180th meridian.

283
00:24:08,911 --> 00:24:10,266
The date line?

284
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:14,577
So, you went there and crossed it?

285
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:17,355
I've never even left the country.

286
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,711
So, you wrote it from your imagination.

287
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,088
Not exactly.

288
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:26,733
The essay focuses on
a conflict between two groups of people.

289
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,844
People on one side live in the present,

290
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:30,933
while people on the other side
live in the past.

291
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:35,133
They try to overcome
the line that sets them apart.

292
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:38,311
See?

293
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,266
A line is important.

294
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:43,311
Even when it only exists in our heads.

295
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,688
Even when we drew it there ourselves.

296
00:24:52,422 --> 00:24:54,066
I want to read your essay.

297
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,222
Do you still have it?

298
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:59,600
I didn’t throw it away. So, I guess
it’s somewhere at home.

299
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,977
Find it. And send it to me.

300
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:08,933
- Are you sure you want to read it?
- Yes, I am.

301
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:15,622
Usually in school, no one says
anything when you win an essay contest.

302
00:25:17,511 --> 00:25:20,511
But it's a different story when you win
a robot contest or for a science project.

303
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,260
It’s sad.

304
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,555
Our country is very selective

305
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:30,600
about which students
they want to give props to.

306
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,800
Is this why you don’t want to study?

307
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:38,755
You hated it too. That’s why you quit.

308
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:49,244
Did you let your Mom
read your essay?

309
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:51,266
My Mom?

310
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:55,844
Let’s just say she lives
on the other side of the date line.

311
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:16,377
If you want to work on
the bridge today, I can be of help.

312
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,866
- We don’t have to wait for Sangkam.
- That’s okay.

313
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:22,177
I haven’t seen the villagers here
since the day it rained.

314
00:26:22,488 --> 00:26:24,377
I think they’re busy
taking care of their vegetable plots.

315
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,844
Be careful, Wang.

316
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,311
It’s a bit rocky there.

317
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,600
Jump over here.
I want to hike for the view.

318
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:39,577
Get back here. I’ll drive you there.

319
00:26:42,422 --> 00:26:44,022
You’re a chicken.

320
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:45,866
And what’s wrong with that?

321
00:26:46,844 --> 00:26:49,488
You’re afraid to get out of your comfort zone.

322
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:54,222
- Are you challenging me?
- Will you accept the challenge?

323
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,177
I don’t think you will.

324
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:11,755
Welcome to the dangerous side.

325
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:23,200
The dangerous side is actually just
outside the zone we feel comfortable in.

326
00:27:24,822 --> 00:27:26,222
I see nothing dangerous about it.

327
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,777
We only think it’s dangerous
because our minds tell us so.

328
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:33,200
Our minds form a cage.

329
00:27:33,977 --> 00:27:38,688
And in the end, we end up rejecting freedom
without knowing the taste of it.

330
00:27:55,666 --> 00:28:00,088
We’re not far from
the latitude of 18.8801518218

331
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:03,977
and the longitude of 99.347722166
which I guess is over there.

332
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:07,422
We’re only a few minutes of arc
away from your house.

333
00:28:08,777 --> 00:28:11,200
And your Mom? Where is she now?

334
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,800
I think she’s reached
the latitude of 13 degrees north

335
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,044
and the longitude of 100 degrees
east over there.

336
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:22,800
Do you know you’re talented?

337
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,555
It doesn’t matter if I’m talented
when it’s not practical.

338
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:45,266
I think it’ll come in handy
for you... one day.

339
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:49,555
One day?

340
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,177
When is that?

341
00:28:56,244 --> 00:29:00,733
I’m sorry. I forgot
you only live for the present.

342
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:03,800
I think the past is important too.

343
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:07,466
But I focus more on the present because...

344
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:09,577
it can become something
we can look back at fondly.

345
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,155
And that's something I don't have.

346
00:29:45,155 --> 00:29:46,000
What about you?

347
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:51,688
Do you have things you regret
not doing... when you take a look back?

348
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:53,333
Yes, I do.

349
00:29:53,955 --> 00:29:56,222
As a matter of fact, I think we all do.

350
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,288
And what stopped you
from doing it in the first place?

351
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:10,933
Perhaps, it’s because you didn't have no choice?

352
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:19,933
For some things, it’s probably best
you don’t go through with them.

353
00:30:29,822 --> 00:30:31,288
I don’t agree with him.

354
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,733
How could you say it’s best
not to go through with something

355
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,000
and get sad about it later?

356
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:43,711
I enjoyed the time
we spent there together.

357
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:47,955
I stopped thinking about where we were
in this world for a moment.

358
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:55,555
I knew we went there
because we wanted a break.

359
00:30:57,688 --> 00:30:59,555
And I wanted more than
anything for time to stop

360
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,000
and to sit there with him.

361
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:13,955
Sangkam is probably wondering
where we are.

362
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,933
What if he called the police
to look for us?

363
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:18,644
I don’t think he would.

364
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:21,822
You’re right.
Given that this probably happens a lot.

365
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:23,466
Let’s get back.

366
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:34,777
Be careful.
It’s not as easy as jumping back over there.

367
00:31:35,622 --> 00:31:37,377
I think I better go into the creek.

368
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,555
But you’ll get wet. Jump now.
I got your back.

369
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,177
It’s rocky there. I don’t think it’s safe for me to land.

370
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:49,866
It’s safe. See?

371
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:58,000
I have an idea. I’ll get you a plank.

372
00:32:07,444 --> 00:32:08,644
You can step on it.

373
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,533
- Are you okay?
- I’m fine.

374
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,422
Are you hurt anywhere?

375
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:57,111
I’m still in one piece.
Nothing’s been damaged.

376
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,155
What about you?

377
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:00,200
I’m fine too.

378
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:05,466
What’s wrong?

379
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:09,600
Where are you hurt?

380
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,622
I don’t think it’s serious. Let’s go.

381
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,977
Ouch.

382
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:19,177
We should go to the hospital.

383
00:33:20,577 --> 00:33:23,088
Sangkam.

384
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:26,222
Careful.

385
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,730
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

386
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:40,688
And you want to stay here
and take care of me for two months?

387
00:33:41,177 --> 00:33:44,288
I’ll stay here until you can take care of yourself.

388
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:52,111
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

389
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:59,511
You can go. I'll take care of him.

390
00:33:59,577 --> 00:34:01,600
All right. Call me if you need anything.

391
00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:15,622
If your mom finds out
about this, I’m screwed.

392
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:18,066
It’s my fault you fell into the creek.

393
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:20,133
Luckily, you didn’t get hurt.

394
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:22,488
What are you talking about?

395
00:34:22,555 --> 00:34:23,777
It’s my fault and not yours.

396
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:26,000
I was the one who suggested it.

397
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:28,688
Are you hungry?

398
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:31,000
You haven’t had your dinner yet.

399
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:33,355
Want me to tell Sangkam
to make something for you?

400
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,266
You haven’t had dinner yet either.

401
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:37,133
I’m not hungry.

402
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:42,555
Go change. You could catch a cold
wearing those damp clothes.

403
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:44,933
In.

404
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:48,800
Do you always take care of other people?

405
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:52,088
You got hurt because of me.

406
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:53,955
I should be the one looking after you.

407
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,222
It’s nothing serious. I can take care of myself.

408
00:34:59,888 --> 00:35:02,066
When are you going to stop talking
as if we aren’t close?

409
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:04,111
It’s a habit of mine.

410
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:05,688
Habit this, habit that.

411
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:08,222
It feels distant. It doesn’t feel close.

412
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:11,577
It’s as if you want to keep a distance.

413
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,133
Then, what pronoun should I use when I’m talking to you?

414
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:16,955
Uncle.

415
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:20,955
- No, it makes me feel old.
- Uncle. Repeat after me.

416
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:25,422
Uncle.

417
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:28,844
Again. Open wide.

418
00:35:29,244 --> 00:35:30,177
Stay it out loud.

419
00:35:30,577 --> 00:35:32,088
Uncle.

420
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:35,444
Uncle.

421
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,911
There you go. Good job.

422
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:41,777
I love it when you’re not stubborn.

423
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,844
From now on, I’ll take care of you.

424
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,155
Do I feel guilty about what happened?

425
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:58,200
Of course.

426
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,577
I don’t even know how to apologize to him.

427
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,111
Part of me is glad though

428
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,755
that he went to the other side with me.

429
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:13,400
And I’m content that I get to take care of him.

430
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:22,866
Do you want anything?
I can get it for you.

431
00:36:23,822 --> 00:36:26,888
You’re treating me as if I’m disabled.
I only broke my leg.

432
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:29,155
That pronoun again.

433
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:31,866
Uncle.

434
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,577
You broke your leg because of me.

435
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,400
The doctor said it will take
two months for your leg to heal.

436
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:43,222
And you want to stay here
and take care of me for two months?

437
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:48,600
I’ll stay here
until you get back on your feet.

438
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:54,977
How can I do that when you don’t even
let me try to do things on my own?

439
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,688
Uncle In, I’m sorry.

440
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:11,600
The bridge wasn’t ready to use.
It’s not your fault.

441
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:22,511
You should go to sleep.
I’m going to sleep on the couch.

442
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:24,933
Don’t you want your present?

443
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:35,600
Your dad, Siam, is indeed my idol.

444
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,888
I moved to a new school
for my middle school year,

445
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:02,600
and ended up meeting your dad
who was one year ahead of me.

446
00:38:03,622 --> 00:38:09,177
He was a jock
and one of the best students there.

447
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:12,022
Everyone loved him.

448
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:15,555
They did not love him
just because he did well in school

449
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:17,733
or because he was a jock.

450
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:21,111
But they loved him because he was nice.

451
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,577
He was already ready to lend a hand.

452
00:38:30,022 --> 00:38:31,844
There was a river behind the school.

453
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,555
I would sit there by the river
alone at lunch break.

454
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:39,666
Because I didn’t have friends.

455
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:45,555
One day, I fell asleep there.

456
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:51,911
I only woke up when I heard
my schoolbag fall into the river.

457
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:59,577
The thing is I couldn’t swim.

458
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,311
All I could do was stand there crying.

459
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:06,555
And watch my bag float away.

460
00:39:11,377 --> 00:39:13,177
My mom was a teacher.

461
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:15,866
We weren’t rich.

462
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:24,800
We couldn’t afford
a new bag and the textbooks.

463
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,600
And then Siam and his friends walked by.

464
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:34,555
No one batted an eye on me.
Except for your dad.

465
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:40,400
He stopped and asked why I was crying.

466
00:39:42,244 --> 00:39:43,977
I couldn’t stop crying.

467
00:39:44,822 --> 00:39:47,600
All I could do was point at
my bag in the river.

468
00:39:55,377 --> 00:39:58,377
Adn that's when he went into the river
and rescued my bag.

469
00:40:04,555 --> 00:40:08,755
We laid my books
on the basketball court.

470
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:11,711
That afternoon,
no one could use the court.

471
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:15,355
Because Siam was there to make sure
no one stepped on my books.

472
00:40:17,755 --> 00:40:20,733
But alas, that didn’t help much.

473
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:23,688
The books had been ruined beyond repair.

474
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:26,777
I wasn’t worried
about my mom punishing me

475
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:30,155
as much as I was worried
about buying new books.

476
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:38,111
That evening, while I was thinking about
how best to break the news to my mom,

477
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:47,266
your dad came to my house
on his bike and gave me his old books.

478
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,177
Did you tell your mom what happened?

479
00:40:53,288 --> 00:40:54,244
I did.

480
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,422
And she told me
that Siam was a nice kid.

481
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,311
And that I was lucky
to have such a nice friend.

482
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:10,088
My mom adored him a lot.

483
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:14,644
She even asked him to look after me.

484
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:18,288
Because I was still new in town.

485
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,644
I didn’t have friends.
I didn’t have anyone.

486
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:29,355
And she was right.

487
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:35,844
All my mom and I had was each other.

488
00:41:43,111 --> 00:41:44,622
Siam said yes.

489
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,533
He said he would look after me.

490
00:41:57,444 --> 00:41:59,377
And he never once failed to do that.

491
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:13,155
That was the first time
I heard stories about Dad

492
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,200
from someone
who isn’t my Mom or from my Dad’s family

493
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:22,444
who don't speak so fondly of him.

494
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:26,622
The dad In talked about...

495
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,688
inspired a warmth in my heart
I didn’t know I longed for.

496
00:42:31,955 --> 00:42:33,422
For once, I could suddenly feel this warmth

497
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:36,288
in my heart.

498
00:42:38,777 --> 00:42:43,266
And I felt like I wanted to share that warmth with people like my Dad did.

499
00:43:31,377 --> 00:43:32,777
(Next Episode)
Happy belated birthday, Wang.

500
00:43:35,888 --> 00:43:39,022
You don't like to drink.
Your dad didn't like to drink either.

501
00:43:39,222 --> 00:43:40,955
That’s one of the things
I don’t understand.

502
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:43,200
People tell me he was an alcoholic.

503
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,333
I want to hear more about him.

504
00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:48,777
You’re stuck here. Aren’t you bored?

505
00:43:49,022 --> 00:43:51,177
I told you, didn’t I? I will take care of you.

506
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:55,155
There are so many things
to explore in town.

507
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:57,066
Especially for young people like you.

508
00:43:58,155 --> 00:43:59,800
I’d rather learn all those things
from old people like you.

509
00:43:59,977 --> 00:44:00,933
It’s more effective.
