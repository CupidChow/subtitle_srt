1
00:00:55,088 --> 00:01:02,600
"180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us"

2
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,000
(Previously)
My Dad named me Wang.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,777
Sasiwimol is my mom.

4
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:10,755
It’s time to take my handsome prince to the north.

5
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:12,755
You’ve done enough already. I’m driving.

6
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,755
My gosh, stop it.

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,777
You stay in the car. I’ll be back.

8
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:17,511
Wang.

9
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:20,355
I'm sorry but my car has gotten stuck.
It's about 200 meters from the entrance..

10
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,822
Sangkam, get the equipment.

11
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:24,933
- In? Inthawut?
- Mol.

12
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:27,155
It’s unbelievable.

13
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,222
My long-lost nephew of all people
got lost and wandered to my place.

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,333
When you turned down Ornjira, the beauty of the campus,

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,577
she completely stopped going for men.

16
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:46,440
In the end, she got together
with that fourth year girl, Nuansamorn.

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,422
I’m telling you those engineering
students were enraged.

18
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:53,933
What’s the main course?
It smells so good.

19
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,444
Fried chicken with ma kwaen.
What do you think, Wang?

20
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:57,466
It’s really good.

21
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,022
Actually, it wasn’t just Ornjira
who got her heart broken.

22
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,444
You turned down a lot of girls.

23
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:07,511
At the time,
everyone was so crazy about you.

24
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:08,911
Inthawut, the architecture student.

25
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,311
Whenever you came
for our rehearsals,

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,060
your fans would always be there to greet you
with plenty of treats for you to try.

27
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,888
Why did he turn them down?
Was there a special girl that he was into?

28
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:24,688
No, there wasn’t.
He just wasn’t interested in any girls.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,377
Mol, more wine?

30
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:32,333
And how did you get him to do your play?

31
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:38,511
I had plenty of tricks
back in the day, you know?

32
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:45,844
I went to his rugby match and wouldn’t
leave him alone until he said yes.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,977
But I couldn’t act to save my life.

34
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:49,555
Did you play rugby too?

35
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:51,266
No, I was in the audience.

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,333
The drama majors were so jealous of me.

37
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:59,955
Not only did I get him to join my play,
I also got to be with a rugby player.

38
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:02,466
You mean Dad?

39
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,733
Actually, your dad was the real hot shot.

40
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:09,866
Your mom cast me in her play
only because she fell in love with him.

41
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:13,177
I knew that if I had to get to him,
I'd have to befriend his best friend.

42
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:15,955
Are you finished, Mol?

43
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:19,200
Yes, normally I don’t even eat dinner.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
That's because "normally" wine is your dinner.

45
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,733
People don’t call me the female Dionysus for nothing.

46
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,155
You should eat some more.

47
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:31,088
Thank you.

48
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:34,422
How long did you study abroad?

49
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:37,133
It was for my Master’s and a PhD, almost five years in total.

50
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:40,133
Did you not have anyone while you were there?

51
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:42,044
Anyone? Who?

52
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:46,222
Zero point. You know who
I’m talking about. Your exes.

53
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:50,666
How could I date? It was hard
enough to focus on my study.

54
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:53,150
I was on a scholarship. I had to
graduate before the grant ran out.

55
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,666
Even after graduation?

56
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,200
Are you doing an interview
for a magazine or what?

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,666
Zero point. You didn’t answer my question.

58
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,622
Oh, my. He’s gotten you cornered.

59
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:07,844
- Reminds me of a certain someone.
- Well?

60
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:15,733
How should I put it? I’m a man.
It’d be weird if I wasn’t seeing anyone.

61
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:18,666
But in the end you broke it off with everyone?

62
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:23,088
Why are we discussing my love life?

63
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,666
What about you Wang? Are you seeing anyone?

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,288
I’m a man. It’d be weird if I wasn't.

65
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,133
How many points
should he get for this answer?

66
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,933
I give him a ten out of ten.

67
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:42,555
Are you done?

68
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:45,955
I couldn’t eat no more. I’ve never
tried something like this in Bangkok.

69
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:49,777
Sangkam would be happy to know
you loved his food.

70
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:52,200
Do you want your dessert now?

71
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:58,777
Thank you, but I prefer
to have my wine as dessert.

72
00:04:58,844 --> 00:05:00,111
What about the gentleman here?

73
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:02,222
No, I don’t eat desserts.

74
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:05,977
In that case, let’s relocate there.

75
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:08,866
This lady here is dying to wash
all the food down with her wine.

76
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:14,044
As for you, I’ll make you
another glass of warm milk.

77
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:22,533
Hooray! Party! Party!

78
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,622
To the happy accident today
that brought us together.

79
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:37,400
And… to my son who made it happen.

80
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:47,488
I’m going to take a shower.
Is the water warm?

81
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:54,200
You can use the shower in my bedroom.
The bathroom has an electric shower.

82
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:55,888
Sure. I’ll do that.

83
00:05:56,311 --> 00:06:00,266
Someone's happened to mess up
the electric shower in her room already.

84
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:02,688
If you’ll excuse me.

85
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:20,466
Won’t you ask me for a dance?

86
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:08,330
I’m glad I decided to stay with you tonight.

87
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,177
Otherwise, who knows what would’ve happened to us?

88
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:17,044
This is normal up here.
You don’t know when it’s going to rain.

89
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,333
But here you don’t have to
worry about it when it rains.

90
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:26,466
Unlike in Bangkok, where rain
means traffic and flooding issues.

91
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,733
If you’re lucky, you’ll might as well even see a sea of fog

92
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,911
from your bedroom early in the morning.

93
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:36,511
That is if I can wake up that early...

94
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:43,177
Wang’s been gone for quite a while.
He said he was going for a shower?

95
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,288
Did he go to sleep?

96
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,977
I’ll go check on him, my lady.

97
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:51,155
And come straight to me when you’re done.

98
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:55,377
You don’t really want to
leave a lady alone with her wine.

99
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:58,244
There’s a cave underneath this house.

100
00:08:58,511 --> 00:09:01,933
I'ver set up a cellar to store all of the wine.
There’s even a wine bath.

101
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:05,177
You can drink all day
and the wine won’t run out.

102
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:08,177
Are you for real?

103
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:10,377
No, I was messing with you.

104
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:11,866
Gosh.

105
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I’m sorry I didn’t bring my towel,
so I used the one you had in the bathroom.

106
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,666
You don't mind, right?

107
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:58,177
Here. Use the clean one.

108
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:20,311
Thank you.

109
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:32,311
Your mom asked me to check up on you.
She’s having the time of her life.

110
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:34,622
Go up to her when you’re done.

111
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:44,088
I think we have a lot in common.

112
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,022
I guess you’ve been to
several destinations around the world?

113
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,333
No, I’ve only been to some.

114
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:00,533
There are places I've never been to.

115
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,088
And there are places I simply don’t want to visit.

116
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:07,311
How come?

117
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:14,022
You don’t like travelling to new places?

118
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,688
No.

119
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:24,066
So you're someone who prefers
his comfort zone?

120
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:27,755
I guess that's the case.

121
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:39,977
So, in a way, you’re rather old-fashioned.

122
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:45,888
I listen to and most of the time
side with the younger generation,

123
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:49,444
but sometimes it’s…

124
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:51,355
You don’t want to go out of your way?

125
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:02,777
You should go. Mom doesn’t like to be kept waiting.

126
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,911
I’ll join you in a while.

127
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:15,622
Wait. Can I sleep in your room tonight?

128
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:17,844
I swear I don’t snore.

129
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:23,333
Sure. You can sleep wherever you want.

130
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,622
Looks like it won’t
stop raining anytime soon.

131
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:50,288
So what? Is there a problem?

132
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:53,488
We’re building a bridge over there.

133
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,422
To help make it easier for
the villagers to go to the main road.

134
00:12:57,955 --> 00:13:00,800
If it continues to rain,
we have have to halt everything.

135
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,044
That means those villagers
get to walk freely around your house?

136
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:06,044
Yes.

137
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:11,440
Are you sure they can be trusted?
You’ll get yourself killed one day.

138
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,488
The people here can be trusted.
They’re not dangerous.

139
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:15,866
How can you be so sure?

140
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:18,844
I thought you went to several volunteer
camps in the countryside when you were in college.

141
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,333
And yet you look down on villagers?

142
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,822
Are you done with your bath, my prince?

143
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:27,844
Would you do me a favour
and dance with me?

144
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:31,533
Oh, my. You barely set foot here
and the lights are out.

145
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,088
It’s to be expected.
Especially when it rains.

146
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,533
That’s why we have candles around.

147
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:42,377
I’ll help. I have a lighter.

148
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,933
Why are you carrying a lighter, Wang?

149
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:46,777
To burn paper, I guess.

150
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:49,444
Watch your mouth, kiddo.

151
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:16,022
- Any more candles, In?
- No, thanks.

152
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,822
My gosh. This is romantic.

153
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,133
The power could be out
all night unless it stops raining.

154
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:32,511
I love it, though.

155
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:36,311
It’s dark.
Everything’s prettier this way.

156
00:14:36,488 --> 00:14:38,577
Like in TV dramas.

157
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,044
I have an idea.

158
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,288
We should do a play
and take a trip down memory lane.

159
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:47,466
We can’t exactly listen to music now.

160
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,466
Do you still remember your lines?

161
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:51,577
From Julie, My Lady?

162
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:54,933
I’ll be Julie tonight.

163
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:58,488
Julie comes down to the kitchen

164
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:02,133
to find her handsome servant

165
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:06,355
with a young maid
who’s sitting with her head down,

166
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,355
tired from her kitchen duties.

167
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,155
Wang, go sit over there.

168
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:18,577
Seeing them together makes Julie
want to win him over even more.

169
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:21,866
Can I sleep for real?
I don’t want to see this.

170
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:25,422
Pour me more wine, Jean.

171
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,866
But I thought in the play, Julie liked beer?

172
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:37,777
Today is different. She wants wine.

173
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:43,555
And go do your bow.

174
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:54,200
Now, kneel before me and kiss my foot.

175
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,244
So this was your favourite genre
of play even back in college?

176
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:00,111
What do you know?

177
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:07,200
Every girl dreams to have a handsome,
young man kneel before her.

178
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:10,155
And to have her foot kissed?
What for?

179
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,333
It’s to show him she owns him.

180
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:19,444
The handsome servant betrayed her
by getting chummy with that young maid.

181
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:21,000
What a terrible character.

182
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:24,244
Well it’s not like she’s real.

183
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:29,000
My son takes this very seriously.

184
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:33,822
He values human dignity
and despises class systems.

185
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:37,755
He can’t stand injustice even in movies.

186
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:45,511
You should know we make movies and
TV shows to escape reality.

187
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:49,577
Because life’s already hard enough.

188
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,311
Are you drunk?

189
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,422
No, just a bit tipsy.

190
00:16:56,777 --> 00:17:03,444
You know? In told me there is
a cave with a wine cellar underneath the house.

191
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:09,888
There’s even a wine bath.
I want to get into that bath for once.

192
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,977
You believe that story?

193
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:15,955
I prefer to live in my imagination.

194
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:19,444
Especially when the truth isn’t pretty.

195
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:21,355
You’re wise when you’re drunk.

196
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,755
As expected from the big and successful director.

197
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:28,955
Now tell me, In. Have you seen any of my shows?

198
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,555
Don’t get mad.

199
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:33,466
But no.

200
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:42,600
Too bad. You know
all my shows were a success.

201
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,644
Everyone loves them.

202
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,488
Actually, I don’t even watch TV.

203
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:49,711
Look around you.

204
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:52,777
There is no TV here
except in the guest room.

205
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,111
I don't even have a Wi-Fi connection.

206
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:02,800
Inthawut, you truly are a real introvert.

207
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:07,733
How am I going to contact the outside world then?

208
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:09,422
There’s a landline over here.

209
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:12,666
Classic.

210
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:19,777
But how do we use it? Let me try.

211
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:22,155
911.

212
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:24,400
Hello.

213
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:30,800
Please, help me. I’ve been taken
against my will to an ancient cave.

214
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:35,444
I can’t find my way out.
I’m not even sure if there’s a way out.

215
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:38,955
What are you talking about?
You got lost and ended up here.

216
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:43,800
Yes, I always get lost when I drive.

217
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:50,888
But it wasn’t my fault this time.
It was his. He brought us here.

218
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,711
Tell me about your job.
What kind of lakorn (Thai soap operas) do you make?

219
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,222
I bet it’s progressive.

220
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:03,377
On the contrary,
she’s a bit of a hypocrite.

221
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:07,222
She looks flashy on the outside,
but everything she does is a remake.

222
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,844
Well, I think of my creation as a fine wine.

223
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:13,955
The older the wine, the better it tastes.

224
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,200
And you came here for what sort of a project?

225
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,288
It’s called Engraved in Your Heart.

226
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:22,955
- Sounds familiar.
- Right?

227
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:28,577
The title only has to be familiar for it to work.

228
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:33,000
It doesn’t matter if it’s a remake as long as we restyle it.

229
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:34,711
So what’s the story about?

230
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:38,888
A young maiden falling in love with a much older man.

231
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:41,177
Daddy issues.

232
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:45,977
The theme is rather common in English literature.

233
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:53,444
But since it’s a lakorn, the male lead has to be a prince.

234
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,888
I added jealousy and everything for a little spice.

235
00:19:57,177 --> 00:19:59,733
In the end, the maiden gets everything.

236
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:01,977
Everyone is happy.

237
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,000
The viewers want this because
they want to have that kind of romance.

238
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:07,644
That's why they call it romance.

239
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:13,311
But unlike the previous versions,
my prince comes from the north.

240
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:15,000
That’s all?

241
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:19,755
- He doesn’t like what I do.
- It’s not that I don’t like what you do.

242
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,222
- It’s not progressive enough.
- I just don’t like lakorns because

243
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,770
they’re only fantasies
and don’t keep your feet on the ground.

244
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,711
Fantasies?

245
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:28,666
You should be the last person
to say anything about fantasies.

246
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,640
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

247
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,288
Maybe the viewers don’t want to get on with their lives.

248
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:38,666
That’s because you don’t let them.

249
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,666
I don’t let them what?

250
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,711
Are you saying I should let you go
to your stupid north and south poles?

251
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:44,133
You don’t seem to want to get on with your life.
You’re irresponsible.

252
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:50,688
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

253
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:54,377
A young maiden falling in love
with a much older man.

254
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,288
In the end, the maiden gets everything.

255
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,822
Everyone is happy.

256
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:02,777
The viewers want this because they
want to have that kind of romance.

257
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,488
That's why they call it romance.

258
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:11,088
But unlike the previous versions,
my prince comes from the north.

259
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:12,377
That’s all?

260
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:17,310
- He doesn’t like what I do.
- It’s not that I don’t like what you do.

261
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,240
- It isn't progressive enough.
- I just don’t like lakorns

262
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
because they’re only fantasies
and don’t keep your feet on the ground.

263
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,288
Fantasies?

264
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:26,355
Mr. Wang, you should be the last person
to say anything about fantasies.

265
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,440
Well, my dream is different
than your fantasies.

266
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,933
Can you point me
where the difference lies?

267
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,660
Having a dream means
you’ll work towards making it happen.

268
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,688
A fantasy doesn’t get you anywhere.

269
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:35,688
Maybe the viewers
don’t want to get on with their lives..

270
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:36,711
That’s because you don’t let them.

271
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:37,800
I don’t let them what?

272
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,888
Are you saying I should let you
go to your stupid north and south poless?

273
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:42,680
You shouldn’t call
anyone’s dream stupid.

274
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,000
That’s rich coming from someone
who just called what I do a mere fantasy.

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,977
There’s no harm in it.

276
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:48,822
But that means you look down
on my viewers and their dreams.

277
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:52,488
Mr. Wang, they need entertainment.
Are you listening to me?

278
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,244
All they need is entertainment.

279
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:57,088
You don’t seem to want to get on with your life.
You’re irresponsible.

280
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
What did you say?

281
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,555
Did you just say I don’t get on with my life?

282
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:07,111
Did you say I’m irresponsible?

283
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:10,955
I wouldn’t be here today had I not gotten on with my life.

284
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:14,333
I wouldn’t be standing before you for you to call me irresponsible.

285
00:22:14,822 --> 00:22:19,377
I do what you call “fantasies” to support you.

286
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:22,911
You can only be arrogant and call yourself progressive now

287
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:24,911
because of all that money I made from what you call fantasies.

288
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:27,088
You know what?

289
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:30,355
You do nothing all day
but obsess over with that stupid globe of yours.

290
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:32,244
Is this what you call "to get on with your life"?

291
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:34,288
What responsibility do you even shoulder?

292
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:36,288
At least learn how to be considerate of my feelings.

293
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:43,733
Go. Leave.

294
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:47,044
Just leave. I don’t care if it’s
the north pole or the south pole.

295
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:11,466
You’ve said enough.

296
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,111
Can I make you a hot drink?
Or do you want to go to bed?

297
00:23:38,555 --> 00:23:42,444
In, did you see that?

298
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,177
I just don’t get him.

299
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,866
You were getting along just fine and it happened.

300
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:55,600
I feel like he’s withholding something from me.

301
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,888
I can’t seem to get through to him.

302
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:01,244
That’s how kids his age are.

303
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:03,466
They’re passionate.

304
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,133
They only know how to express themselves.

305
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,711
We were once like that, weren’t we?

306
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:14,711
Actually, I know what he’s hiding from me in his heart.

307
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,555
And what is that?

308
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,488
He and his father were very close.

309
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:36,911
Even after I divorced Siam,

310
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,933
he never once stopped visiting.

311
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:44,622
He only stopped because of the accident.

312
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:47,666
And that’s when I sent Wang to boarding school.

313
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:51,355
You did your best.

314
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:54,177
Do you understand me?

315
00:24:56,666 --> 00:25:02,066
I only did that because
I couldn’t cope with his death either.

316
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,088
That’s why I shifted all my focus to my job.

317
00:25:08,444 --> 00:25:10,088
People think I have this hard shell,

318
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,600
but the truth is that...

319
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,600
I’m lonely and in need of someone.

320
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:22,266
I understand.

321
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:24,555
No.

322
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:27,533
No, you don’t.

323
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:30,888
How could you say you understand me

324
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:34,000
when you went off the grid

325
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,111
the moment I needed you the most?

326
00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:40,555
I’m sorry.

327
00:25:42,311 --> 00:25:43,688
What you did was terrible.

328
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,755
I told you I never forgot about you and Siam.

329
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:11,466
Wang probably thinks it’s my fault that his father died.

330
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:18,688
You want to know something?

331
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,977
Siam was acting like this too when he was with me.

332
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,022
I couldn’t get through to him.

333
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:30,511
I didn’t know what he was thinking.

334
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:36,511
Whether he was happy or sad.

335
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:44,066
I was determined to make him mine.

336
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:54,311
But in the end, all I had was his body.

337
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:00,511
His heart was somewhere else.

338
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:05,555
That's when I thought...

339
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,222
he was after all the father of my child.

340
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,822
I thought we could live together as friends.

341
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:20,222
Friends who drink together.

342
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:30,200
But I was wrong.

343
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:36,555
Because he couldn’t be my friend.

344
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,466
In the end, he asked for a divorce.

345
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,622
I didn’t even ask for anything
through the divorce.

346
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:00,555
I had my pride.

347
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:04,088
He didn’t love me.

348
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:07,400
He only loved his son.

349
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,511
He was an alcoholic,

350
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,600
but at least he never failed to visit his son.

351
00:28:18,688 --> 00:28:24,177
Even on that night,
he came over to visit Wang.

352
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:28,533
It was after he put our son to bed

353
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:36,933
and after we started drinking that I told him...

354
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:41,222
I told him.

355
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:46,777
I knew he wasn’t like this because of me.

356
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:51,133
I told him.

357
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:54,577
I knew why he wanted the divorce.

358
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:59,133
He put down the glass and hurried out.

359
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:02,133
He didn’t want to listen to what I had to say.

360
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:10,377
I heard his car start and then he left.

361
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,555
Less than an hour later,

362
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,866
I got the call.

363
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:27,600
They said that he’d been in an accident.

364
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,422
In.

365
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:49,333
You have no idea
what I have had to go through.

366
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:54,377
You have no idea
how hard it was to have to tell my son

367
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:02,733
that he dad isn’t with us anymore.

368
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:09,088
It broke my heart for him to bear all of this.

369
00:30:50,577 --> 00:30:53,266
I may not be the best mom.

370
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,866
But I always put his best interest before anything else.

371
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:23,266
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

372
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:25,844
Tomorrow, do it for me
and apologise to you mom.

373
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:27,000
You think it was my fault?

374
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
We can’t change people.

375
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:32,355
What’s important is how to live together
without hurting each other.

376
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:38,177
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

377
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,644
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Turn on the lights.

378
00:32:08,088 --> 00:32:09,111
The power is back?

379
00:32:12,044 --> 00:32:15,155
Now, have you calmed down?

380
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,288
Yes. I’m sorry for ruining the fun.

381
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:31,288
Life doesn’t have
to be all fun and parties.

382
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:36,933
I don’t think my mom knows that.

383
00:32:38,511 --> 00:32:40,755
She hates it when we fight.

384
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,466
Did she go to bed?

385
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:49,600
The wine made her tired.

386
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,644
What about you? Do you want something to drink?

387
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:55,644
Your mom isn’t here
to tell you what to drink anymore.

388
00:32:56,644 --> 00:33:00,422
I made a promise to myself
I wouldn’t touch alcohol.

389
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:08,711
I had to since
both Mom and Dad are alcoholics.

390
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:35,555
I’m sorry.

391
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:37,866
It must have triggered you.

392
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:43,466
I shouldn’t have asked your mom to drink.

393
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:49,577
Mom would’ve suggested it
herself even if you hadn’t you asked her to.

394
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:53,666
You don’t look drunk, though.

395
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,533
I prefer looking after
drunk people instead of getting drunk.

396
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:03,777
What about Dad? Did he always get drunk?

397
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:11,977
In my memory,

398
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:15,888
your dad hardly touched alcohol.

399
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:21,888
Still, he became an alcoholic.

400
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:27,666
Can you tell me more about him?

401
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:36,355
You miss him a lot, do you?

402
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:39,355
That’s why I wanted to meet you.

403
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,911
Well, we’ve met, haven’t we?

404
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:52,888
You must think it’s unbelievable.

405
00:34:55,488 --> 00:34:56,755
You mean, the whole thing that happened today?

406
00:35:04,177 --> 00:35:05,577
Do you find it believable?

407
00:35:17,222 --> 00:35:22,733
Now, can you do me a favour?

408
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:24,822
What favour?

409
00:35:26,577 --> 00:35:29,222
Tomorrow, do it for me
and apologise to you mom.

410
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,422
You think it was my fault?

411
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:35,200
In this case... it should be you who apologise.

412
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:36,422
Why?

413
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:39,333
Because technically, you started it?

414
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:40,955
I started it?

415
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:43,533
Yes, you started it.

416
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,840
You touched on her sore spot
and that was…

417
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,044
Impolite? Improper?

418
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:51,088
Inconsiderate.

419
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:52,844
Inconsiderate?

420
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:56,844
You were inconsiderate
to your mom’s feelings.

421
00:36:05,555 --> 00:36:06,688
I thought you would understand me.

422
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:10,644
You can’t ask people to understand you

423
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:15,111
when you’re not willing
to understand others.

424
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:23,155
Compromising?
Is that the rule you live by too?

425
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:28,200
No, but we can’t change people.

426
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:32,844
What’s important is how to live
together without hurting each other.

427
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:38,133
So we should just ignore
the elephant in the room

428
00:36:38,622 --> 00:36:41,666
because she’s too
sensitive to talk about it?

429
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,266
You and your mom look at
this world from a different angle.

430
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:50,511
You may think a lot of things
in this world matter.

431
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:54,422
But for your mom, the only thing
that matters to her is you.

432
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:07,600
I just want her to know
that this world doesn’t belong to me.

433
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:12,511
It’s everyone’s as much as it’s mine.

434
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:15,377
It doesn’t matter what you say.

435
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:17,444
The world isn’t going to change.

436
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,911
The same round world.

437
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:24,088
Still, everyone looks at it differently.

438
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:26,688
It doesn’t matter when you’re in the world.

439
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:31,088
And the world isn’t anyone’s to claim.

440
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:44,311
I take it you know who gave me this?

441
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,688
Why do you think I know?

442
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:50,244
Because I feel you’d know.

443
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:53,622
And?

444
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:02,755
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

445
00:38:03,044 --> 00:38:05,644
I can sleep anywhere. You’re old.

446
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,200
Stop disrespecting old people

447
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
or I’ll drag you out to
spend the night by the terrace.

448
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:10,244
Wait, In.

449
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:16,577
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

450
00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:25,800
I take it you know who gave me this?

451
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:30,222
Why do you think I know?

452
00:38:30,222 --> 00:38:31,600
Because I feel you’d know.

453
00:38:34,422 --> 00:38:35,155
And?

454
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:43,111
You’re right.

455
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:46,533
The world doesn’t belong to anyone.

456
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,844
Dad gave me this.

457
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:55,977
And someday, you’ll have to
give it to someone else.

458
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:01,488
If only Mom knew that…

459
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:03,400
I told you.

460
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:07,022
Different things matter to different people.

461
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:13,444
In her life, you matter the most.

462
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:28,422
I’ll apologise to her tomorrow.

463
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:32,133
Thank you.

464
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:34,422
For what?

465
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:37,488
Thank you for doing something nice.

466
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,133
Even if it’s for your own good.

467
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:41,933
It’s late. You should sleep.

468
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:45,488
Are you an early bird?

469
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,555
You can look for something to eat
in the kitchen if we wake up before us.

470
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:54,244
But if you want a full-course
breakfast, you’re gonna have to wait.

471
00:39:55,688 --> 00:39:57,777
Why are you sleeping there?

472
00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:01,177
I’m the host.
I can’t let my guest sleep on the floor.

473
00:40:02,155 --> 00:40:05,688
I can’t let you do that for me.
I don’t want to upset you.

474
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,044
I’m sleeping here.

475
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,911
I promise I won’t get upset.

476
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:12,888
I sleep here all the time,
when I work late into the night.

477
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:15,488
But I’m still young. I can sleep anywhere.

478
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:18,600
You’re old. You need the bed for your bad back.

479
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:21,155
All right, I’m old.

480
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:24,155
But I’m pretty sure I’m a lot stronger than you.

481
00:40:25,622 --> 00:40:27,955
I didn’t expect old people to be this strong.

482
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,840
Stop disrespecting old people

483
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,600
or I’ll drag you out
to spend the night by the terrace.

484
00:40:37,244 --> 00:40:38,888
You’re quite stubborn, you know?

485
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:42,133
And you’re quite authoritative.

486
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:45,044
Does that make you afraid of me?

487
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,222
No.

488
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:53,888
Go to sleep.

489
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:56,755
Wait, In.

490
00:40:59,044 --> 00:41:01,600
There’s plenty of space.
You can sleep here with me.

491
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,488
I’d feel weird.

492
00:41:09,955 --> 00:41:10,911
In.

493
00:41:11,822 --> 00:41:12,555
What?

494
00:41:14,444 --> 00:41:15,555
Thank you.

495
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:17,377
For giving you the bed?

496
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:23,755
For reminding me what I should do.

497
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:31,933
See you tomorrow. Goodnight.

498
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:35,600
Goodnight.

499
00:42:14,244 --> 00:42:17,844
That was the first time I wanted
someone to put a blanket on me.

500
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:22,777
I feel the blanket is warmer this way.

501
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,066
That night, despite no one putting a blanket on me,

502
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:36,755
somehow I felt warmth and slept like a baby.

503
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,355
I dove and dove into a void that we call a dream.

504
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:47,666
Eventually, I arrived at the heart of it.

505
00:42:56,444 --> 00:42:59,444
In the dream, his back was turned to me,

506
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,088
but I knew it was Dad.

507
00:43:06,088 --> 00:43:08,733
It’s weird because I just had this big fight with Mom.

508
00:43:10,444 --> 00:43:12,666
And yet, she wasn’t there in the dream.

509
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:18,000
The one who appeared

510
00:43:22,555 --> 00:43:23,533
turned out to be In.

511
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:36,866
I saw Dad and In,
walking out of the game together.

512
00:43:37,777 --> 00:43:39,977
I ran after them. I shouted to my dad.

513
00:43:40,244 --> 00:43:43,530
It'd been so long. I missed my dad.

514
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,000
But he didn’t seem to hear me.

515
00:43:45,466 --> 00:43:47,288
I mustered all my strength

516
00:43:47,422 --> 00:43:49,933
and charged at them, as if I was
a rugby player scoring a touchdown.

517
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:53,933
Finally, the two stopped walking.

518
00:43:54,644 --> 00:43:56,111
In turned around and smiled at me.

519
00:43:56,777 --> 00:43:58,666
And Dad took off his cap.

520
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:01,466
But it wasn’t Dad that I saw.

521
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:03,955
It was me.

522
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:31,177
(Next Episode)
Don’t forget about your promise from last night.

523
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:32,133
What promise?

524
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,777
To apologise to your mom.

525
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:36,150
I don’t know if I should
continue making lakorns.

526
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,444
No one appreciates them.

527
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:41,444
What I do means nothing to you?

528
00:45:41,688 --> 00:45:44,644
I think I should go ahead
and get the bridge done by myself.

529
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:46,155
Do you want to help?

530
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,822
Sure.

531
00:45:47,822 --> 00:45:50,377
Sangkam was right. It’s a simple bridge.

532
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:52,155
There’s no need for complicated designs.

533
00:45:52,244 --> 00:45:54,711
Can you handle saws and nails?

534
00:45:54,822 --> 00:45:55,977
You can teach me how to.
