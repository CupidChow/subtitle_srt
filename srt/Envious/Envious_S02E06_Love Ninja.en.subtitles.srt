WE'RE LAUNCHING FRIDAY NIGHT KARAOKE

10
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,178
You are breaking my heart

11
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,391
Maybe I really deserve it

12
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,563
For being
Just a girl in love

13
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,277
And always going round in circles

14
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,157
You are
Becoming my obsession

15
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,453
Now I need to realize it

16
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,584
That I'm just a ninja so in love

17
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,172
I'm your ally in this war

00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,928
So tell me "yes"
That you love me

19
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,806
Say it once more
Now say it slowly

20
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,891
Say it to me, say it to him

21
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,894
Shout it out loud, so they hear it again

22
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,605
Take me away
I can't take anymore

23
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,066
It feels like the start
But it's nearly the end

24
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,694
Tell me it's not-
That it's not over

25
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,696
Tell me, "I love you"

26
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,201
I really do love you

27
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,254
