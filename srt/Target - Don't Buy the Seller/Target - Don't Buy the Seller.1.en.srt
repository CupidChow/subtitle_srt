1
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,690
A brand new 24” iMac will sell for $1000.

2
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,450
The new 24” iMac will be on sale.)

3
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,540
I am selling the 512GB M1 chipset retina display for urgent needs.

4
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,380
I didn't run it for exactly three months. Actual price is $1600. Selling price is $1000.

5
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,500
The new 24” iMac will be on sale.

6
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,250
The same ad is circulating all over the internet.

7
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,150
Damn it! How many boys?

8
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,350
Yeon_vely0206: I'll look into things first. Then I will decide.

9
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh!

10
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,050
Oh... not bad!

11
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,030
Yeon_vely0206: I'll look into things first. Then I will decide.

12
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,620
Salesperson: But since the iMac is big, it's difficult for me to carry it that far.

13
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,340
Also, take a look at the price. Because there is no chance of bargaining.

14
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,590
Yeon_vely0206: I will give you as much as you want. Address and contact number please?

15
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,850
Vendor: Address- Nowon-gu, Seokgye-dong 24-1, near the entrance of City University, Phone: 010-1464-0162

16
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,680
Yeon_vely0206: I can't leave without finishing work.

17
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,770
If you meet in the evening will be a problem?

18
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,940
Seller: Not at all!

19
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,440
Okay!!

20
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,580
Told you a thousand times I didn't want it.

21
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,290
Both of you were present when I said.

22
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,010
But what are these?

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,200
What do I do with it?

24
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,900
Please don't say that you made the same mistake in the bathroom.

25
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,450
Ah!! I want to pull out all the hair on my head!

26
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,240
If this is not resolved by tomorrow, it will be twelve o'clock.

27
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,640
Why are you talking about such a small thing?

28
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,260
If you had not made the mistake, then there would have been no trouble.

29
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,730
Everyone has played the twelve bells of the inner construction.

30
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,410
If my job is gone, will you find another one?

31
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,980
talk?

32
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,200
I have told them many times,

33
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,940
Even checked the whole thing.

34
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,400
Where were you when they were working?

35
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,310
I was on holiday yesterday due to moving house.

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,430
After moving into the new house, you should have gone to the site early in the morning.

37
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,200
Soon going to declare you team leader.

38
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,400
But I am disappointed with your behavior.

39
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,220
It's an exaggeration, understand?

40
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,820
i'm sorry

41
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,030
However, since you say it's the workers' fault,

42
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,310
Then confirm the additional cost.

43
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,020
Do you understand?

44
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,280
- According to the rules, you have the last word... - Started again!

45
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,210
But if the salary of the workers is cut, the rest of the work will be done as well.

46
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,130
You know the current status of the site.

47
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,820
So what to give out of his own pocket?

48
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,440
What?

49
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,620
However, Mr. Kim I'm very uncomfortable with your behavior lately.

50
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,700
Please don't mind my words.

51
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,210
But I was called to the sixth floor for personal work

52
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,960
i don't like

53
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,380
We only talk about work.

54
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,100
A couple of personal things outside of work, though.

55
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,040
Let's talk about work, right?

56
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,420
Yes, we talk about work.

57
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,600
But, you keep calling for personal reasons…

58
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,570
Ah! Team Leader Zhang,

59
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,160
Do you combine work and personal talk?

60
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,810
Hey, why did you buy it?

61
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,540
So what to do?

62
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,720
Otherwise, Manager Kim will reprimand me.

63
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,780
Ah! I have already spent a lot of money to change the house.

64
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,640
Enjoy the coffee.

65
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,240
Manager Kim follows you around because you look good.

66
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,900
I don't know if it's intentional.

67
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,380
But it seems he is weak towards you.

68
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,540
Ah! Such weakness is enough to kill one.

69
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,540
I will kill the manager.

70
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,990
This is crazy love!

71
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,300
This girl's head is gone!

72
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,280
God! In the end, whether such a result.

73
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,910
You are trapped, Miss Team Leader!

74
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,080
Don't start over!

75
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm not a skeptic.

76
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,650
But why did it happen after getting into a new house?

77
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,380
Hey, don't get wasted!

78
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,730
I'm going crazy!

79
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,330
Call people to respond.

80
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
Didn't you think?

81
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,410
It will cost $50.

82
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,760
50 dollars? Does it seem too much?

83
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,140
Yes, washing machine repair is more readable.

84
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,440
Then buy a second hand machine.

85
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,130
There are some good sites for buying and selling used goods these days.

86
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,040
I bought an old microwave from one such.

87
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,530
Very nice going! i liked

88
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,080
So? How much did it cost?

89
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
Bought a $150 microwave for only $40.

90
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,890
Really?

91
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,890
The cost is not high.

92
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,560
Like new again. clean clean

93
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,620
Hey Team Leader Zhang!

94
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,610
What are you doing right now?

95
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,850
Going to the construction site.

96
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,720
Hey, are the tiles already removed?

97
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,220
I don't want to see them, will stay up all night if necessary.

98
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,480
Started again!

99
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,220
Why am I going to do other's work?

100
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,930
What did you say?

101
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,270
Hagu will actually go to his home.

102
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,520
What is the meaning of this word?

103
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,600
The last time I visited a construction site, there was an urgent need to get work done.

104
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,080
So I went to the bathroom on the second floor, and since the pipe was not yet installed,

105
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,410
So Hagu went downstairs.

106
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,650
What? Huh? your hug?

107
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,260
Hey, I didn't know!

108
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,160
What are these things!

109
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,240
Hey! I don't know what goes through Manager Kim's mind.

110
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,210
Maybe I said it wrong.

111
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,920
Manager Kim has no interest in you.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,630
Yeon_vely0206: I'm telling you so that you don't find it difficult to recognize

113
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,520
I am sending my brother because I am stuck on an important task.

114
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,370
Brother? I am sending my brother because I am stuck on an important task.

115
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,590
I am sending my brother because I am stuck on an important task.

116
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,820
Damn it!!

117
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,410
Are you selling Mac?

118
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,910
My sister is stuck with important work, so sent me.

119
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,060
Yes, yes! come in

120
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,570
It's like new, selling fast.

121
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,440
Oh, that's good!

122
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,930
Did you bring the money?

123
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,930
Not 1000 dollars?

124
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,440
yes

125
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,610
Did you bring cash?

126
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,300
Need to look into

127
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,300
Check if everything is fine, the box is also brand new.

128
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,560
Rightly said. Really good!

129
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,460
Gotta pay, right?

130
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,620
Ah, yes!

131
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,660
take it

132
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,050
ok

133
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,580
Hyeong-Jini: What's the matter? How was yesterday's blind date? [Going on a date with someone you have never met before is called a blind date]

134
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,840
Was the girl beautiful?

135
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,590
Seller: I'm going to Busan. lol

136
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,470
Hyeong-Jini: Why?

137
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,970
Seller: Blyde to date. lol

138
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,970
Hyeong-Jini: Hey! So far. lol

139
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,730
Seller: Haha. I will tell you everything back. lol

140
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
Mago!

141
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,330
what mago

142
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,160
Manager Kim, you surprised me!

143
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,890
Is it so late to come?

144
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,520
What about the washing machine?

145
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,160
Impossible to fix, said to change.

146
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,760
Hey! Don't worry, I'll fix it.

147
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,740
Who is the manager?

148
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,540
I passed engineering.

149
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,890
stop eating

150
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,040
I will fix the machine first.

151
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,700
No! ok,

152
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,170
I will handle it myself.

153
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,280
what will you do

154
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,250
All the tiles must be removed...

155
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,230
As a construction manager I will handle it tomorrow.

156
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,160
don't worry

157
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,600
Manager Kim, I'm absolutely fine!

158
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,330
- Get up guys! - Well, let's go together!

159
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,970
Oh, dal-ya!

160
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,970
We can eat at home.

161
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,950
I did not say, get up!

162
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,560
It's all gone.

163
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,280
Impossible to answer.

164
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,820
But you have passed engineering.

165
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,100
Yes, but that's basic engineering.

166
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,770
And it is electrical engineering.

167
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,530
May I help open the boxes?

168
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,340
no

169
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,890
Has it been arranged to keep these? Or will I?

170
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,060
no thanks you can come now

171
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,890
Are you asking me to leave?

172
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,760
Does tea or coffee offer nothing?

173
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,290
Smoke die! If you can't fix it, leave.

174
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,830
Why do you want coffee! Have a high school student?

175
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,250
Oh Team Leader Dal-ya!

176
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,880
Be more polite with people.

177
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,890
People will help each other, right?

178
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,250
No? Then I come.

179
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,490

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,740
Damn, who knows if it's sold out? Jang Soo-Hyun: Hello, I contacted you after seeing a post about a washing machine for sale. I'm curious, is it still there? I will pay now if necessary.

191
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,760
Jang Soo-Hyun: Hello, I contacted you after seeing a post about a washing machine for sale. I'm curious, is it still there? I will pay now if necessary.

192
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,170
Yes, Team Leader Jang?

193
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,540
Hello Captain, did you get Manager Kim's call?

194
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,730
Please do the work of removing the tiles...

195
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,260
I didn't get a message, I...

196
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,050
What?

197
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,420
Did you do it, Team Leader Zhang?

198
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,020
yes Okay, got it. i am coming

199
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,380
I'm going to talk to you.

200
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,240
- Well. - Yes.

201
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,180
I have transferred three hundred thousand won (Korean currency), please send the item to this address.

202
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,770
Hello, washing machine repair technician.

203
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,120
When will you be home?

204
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,740
Oh, well. When can you come?

205
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,770
Around seven in the evening.

206
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,140
Ah... I can't be there by seven o'clock.

207
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,940
So what can be done?

208
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,340
Then it became difficult!

209
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,580
Will cancel?

210
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,000
I'll tell you in a minute.

211
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,780
Captain, a mechanic will come to the house to fix the washing machine.

212
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,780
So, I have to go now.

213
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,200
And then blame us.

214
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,810
Oh no, please handle the job in my absence.

215
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,790
OK, what else to do.

216
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,810
Please do it right!

217
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,400
Eh! Absolutely gone!

218
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,940
What? Please don't look any further.

219
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,110
I checked everything inside and out.

220
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,580
These days, some fraudulent sites have been opened in the name of selling used goods.

221
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,000
They are cheating people by sending spoiled things!

222
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,870
What a Buddha I am! Dhyattiri!!

223
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,420
I will come then.

224
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,980
Is it strange? He does not have an IDE?

225
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,190
Scams related to sale of second hand or used goods

226
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,560
Damn! Where did you go?

227
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,500
How long will it take to catch him?

228
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,990
Several similar cases are at hand.

229
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,520
So it may take time.

230
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,630
I lost 220 dollars in the blink of an eye.

231
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,240
Yes, we also want to resolve your case quickly,

232
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,600
But one more case came from the department.

233
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,080
How long can it take?

234
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,640
It usually takes three to four months.

235
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,980
It will take so long to catch a criminal?

236
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,430
No, to start investigating the case.

237
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,340
Does this word have any meaning? Why will it take so long?

238
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,100
Excuse me!

239
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,010
These cases have come from the department in the last two days.

240
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,220
Anonymous phone calls, internet scams, all over a hundred.

241
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,420
Even if everything is fine, solving such cases is not a word of mouth.

242
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,090
It takes a lot of time. Moreover, the criminal may be a foreigner.

243
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,060
That means it will take a long time.

244
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,360
So please be patient.

245
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,220
We will try our best, go home for now.

246
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,740
i will call

247
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,770
Of course! Will remember!

248
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,430
Have a nice day.

249
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,690
Hey! You were answering everything in detail, so he kept asking questions.

250
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,530
Are there any other victims?

251
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,560
Nope, checked the site, no other victims found.

252
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,090
So how to find the culprit?

253
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,360
don't know

254
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,510
You can't go home without solving these cases.

255
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,960
How to catch the criminal?

256
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,430
Request and apply to the office.

257
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,260
And finish the head office cases first.

258
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,640
Gee, got it!

259
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,820
Such criminals should be killed.

260
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,670
I will catch him at any cost, and kill him.

261
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,290
Why would you try?

262
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,970
Forget that.

263
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,960
Last year, I lost $100 in a similar scam.

264
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
I never got my money back, and the culprit was never caught.

265
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,940
Oh, dal-ya! Are you saying this now?

266
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,790
Oh Manager Kim, you've arrived!

267
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,620
Saying that, the last time I went hiking,

268
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,440
I have done everything as you said, once you confirm the Lata is done.

269
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,420
Team leader Jang, why do you look like this?

270
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,310
Did something happen?

271
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,530
The washing machine is gone, so upset.

272
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,830
Let's go inside!

273
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,610
Let's go...

274
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,030
Actual price is 1500 dollars, I will give it for 1300.

275
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,320
What are you interested in taking?

276
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,120
12 month installment please.

277
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,230
Sure, I will give you 12 months installment facility.

278
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,520
When can you send?

279
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,000
I can send tomorrow after 5 pm.

280
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,350
Wouldn't that be possible today?

281
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,250
There are many deliveries today.

282
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,140
So, it will be a little difficult. Please sign here.

283
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,810
Ah! I'm not letting go of that surprise easily.

284
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,480
where are you

285
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:51,380
300 dollars. I am going to go out of the country, so I am selling it.

286
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,110
Mago! Got it!!

287
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,320
what's the matter Why not save?

288
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:12,580
Is it a picture? So this is why I can't catch Shala.

289
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,580
The brain works well!

290
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,080
This guy is a fraud. Don't pay it.

291
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,130
This guy is a fraud. Don't pay it.

292
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,500
30 dollars for phone number and 1500 dollars for burner number

293
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,290
How much will you give?

294
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:48,390
Online sites like SNS ID, Password, Education, Job and Misc will be required.

295
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,840
No one will know who posted it?

296
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,650
Undoubtedly, all you need is a mobile phone.

297
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,070
Only if it is SNS, I am thinking about the rest.

298
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,120
I do not know the residential number.

299
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,530
Then just say the name.

300
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,860
Please deposit before that.

301
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,760
This guy is a fraud. Don't pay it!

302
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,470
Was going to make a deposit, but something big happened...

303
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,900
Such fraudsters need to be reported

304
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,880
Washing Machine: Stop before life teaches you

305
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,090
Learning from life? This is how you should live, pig!

306
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,100
It's your fake ID, right?

307
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,390
You stole it, didn't you?

308
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,520
How did you live without doing anything in life?

309
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,530
Stop here, or you will see your own destruction.

310
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,080
Think for yourself, beast.

311
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,620
Clearly warned!

312
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,310
It seems like to threaten!

313
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,130
I was not afraid at all, stupid!

314
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,630
Don't you have anything to do?

315
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:41,850
I also warned you, it's only a matter of time before you get caught, beast!

316
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:50,020
Three days is enough to catch someone like you.

317
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,070
I told the police, be prepared to go to jail!

318
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,040
He is so scared that he doesn't answer anymore.

319
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,720
Hey, Jang Soo-hyun, why are you wearing your hair? Need clips?

320
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,840
Is the washing machine late?

321
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,030
No, sir, excuse me.

322
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,820
So?

323
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,640
I stayed up all night to catch that cheater.

324
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,170
So, did you get him?

325
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,870
Brace yourself. It's just a washing machine!

326
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,370
Because of this you are late for work.

327
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,740
Apart from going to field work,

328
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,250
Have to be present at the office on time at any cost?

329
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,920
Not clearly warned?

330
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,000
I have to report to the construction manager, supervise properly.

331
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,430
yes sir

332
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:20,080
Can you meet directly? I can see the condition of things and pay the price? Please contact this number 010-1423-9887

333
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,430
Delicious!

334
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,250
Take pictures!

335
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,700
Look at it!

336
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Looks delicious.

337
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,700
Hey, take some pictures too!

338
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,810
wait

339
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,300
This is Jang Soo-hyun.

340
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,760
Called you regarding sale of second hand goods.

341
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,110
What?

342
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,530
Selling used goods.

343
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,550
Dialed the wrong number.

344
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,360
Hey, check it out.

345
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,720
Great to eat.

346
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,880
Who is this again?

347
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,710
hello

348
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,980
oh hi Did you post about selling second hand products?

349
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,580
What? What's on sale?

350
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,610
Have you posted regarding the sale of washing machines? I called about that.

351
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,800
Washing machine?

352
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,540
yes

353
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,930
Where, no.

354
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,500
what's going on

355
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,920
Was the phone fraudulent?

356
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,360
What kind of washing machine and why do I do this?

357
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,520
It's exaggeration, taking over the mood.

358
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,440
What is happening? I feel like going crazy.

359
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,920

Hello, posted about washing machine sale.

365
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,680
No, I didn't.

366
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Huh? Hello?

367
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:20,670
This is the work of a fraudster. Nothing will be sold, please do not call.

368
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,300
Can I go get it?

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,470
Sold out!

370
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,450
I lay here for a while.

371
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,960
The chicken has arrived!

372
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,050
I did not order.

373
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,920
No. 302 flat? We have received your order.

374
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,440
I did not order!

375
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,600
I'm sure someone ordered from 302.

376
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,970
It's strange!

377
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,630
I didn't really order it.

378
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,090
Cash or card?

379
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,820
I didn't order any meat!

380
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,100
010-1423-9887 Is this your number?

381
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,080
- Yes, the number is mine, but I didn't order. - Delivery!

382
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,620
Looks like the address has changed.

383
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,220
what's the matter

384
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,700
Jajang noodles and sweet and sour pork meat.

385
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,650
Here it is, your pizza!

386
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:07,020
No order was placed from flat number 302. It was a prank call. Police are looking into the matter. [Prank Call - call for fun]

387
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,630
It has nothing to do with your previous case. Hence it will be investigated separately.

388
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,660
So what steps are you taking?

389
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,450
A separate case will be filed and investigated.

390
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,810
That is asking me to wait again?

391
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,470
Isn't it clear that he is the culprit in both cases? Even?

392
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:33,070
It's obvious that he's wandering around in the open air, so try to relocate for now. That would be good.

393
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,200
So you're asking me to leave?

394
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,890
Tell me?

395
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,970
First, change your phone number.

396
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,600
Will it be done?

397
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,340
Well, I'll get to the site soon, but for now you go home.

398
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,910
I will contact you soon. Please spare me now.

399
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,890
However, act quickly.

400
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,020
Yes, don't worry. Sorry!

401
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,730
Go safe.

402
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,680
Hey, are you going to the site?

403
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,670
If I want to go, I will go. why do you go

404
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,640
Excuse me, I think he's in a hurry, that's why.

405
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,640
i will go crazy

406
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,630
Can you find out the location of the number? Text if you go.

407
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,740
Well sir!

408
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,610
Yes, he studied in a college in front of this building.

409
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,820
Did something happen?

410
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,680
No, there were a few things to be sure of.

411
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,030
Do you have his number?

412
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,860
yes there is one minute

413
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,430
I have very bad eyesight.

414
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,220
The phone is not coming in.

415
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,380
So or not?

416
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,000
Yes!

417
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,560
Can I see his flat?

418
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,770
No, if you know, you will leave it all in your head.

419
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,750
It's impossible.

420
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,560
I will contact her later, please come later.

421
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,170
- Oh, I'm a police officer. - Come later.

422
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,260
Look at this number.

423
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,950
010

424
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,690
6687

425
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,230
5171

426
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,600
5171?

427
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,400
yes

428
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,700
Find its location, recent calls and user details.

429
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,570
But it says user is not registered.

430
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,730
Listen guys, this number is available on the site.

431
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,040
Tell me what I want to know for now.

432
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,280

433
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,810

434
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,690
There is no CCTV?

435
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,690
Yes, the manager left it here and went on a business tour.

436
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:34,930
Money is not for money security, usually no one wants to be caught in the eye.

437
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,160
Manager, someone has forced their way into my flat.

438
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,240
Frankly, it is difficult to investigate without evidence.

439
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,870
Wait, where are you going?

440
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,900
In flat number 302.

441
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,810
Did you see?

442
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,350
What do I do now, detective?

443
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,020
Well, we're calling all the restaurants.

444
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,180
Go and rest. i see

445
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,820
Go away, that was a prank call. I am a police officer.

446
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,130
302?

447
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:27,760
Yes?

448
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,040
Is it for 302?

449
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,620
yes

450
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,210
It was a prank call, go away.

451
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,180
302 you live in?

452
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,290
I am a police officer.

453
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,540
ok

454
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,810
What's going on here?

455
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,060
nothing

456
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,390
Lots of noise around. I have to go somewhere else.

457
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,780
Eat as usual. I just changed the eating time.

458
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,170
Well, thanks a lot.

459
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,510
Yes, have a good day!

460
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,260
The house must be changed.

461
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,510
I don't see any other way.

462
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,610
I've only been here for two weeks.

463
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,980
Hey, there is no para of the tree.

464
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,340
Luckily, nothing was opened.

465
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,640
I hate you!

466
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,070
All right, have a drink for now.

467
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,040
Now the police is looking into the matter, you should drink alcohol comfortably.

468
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,630
One more?

469
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,010
Eating for seventeen years! We should eat more quickly.

470
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,480
I remember the old days.

471
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,840
Isn't it fun to be with me?

472
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,780
So understand?

473
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,460
Will you sing some old songs?

474
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,520
please no

475
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,160
No!

476
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,970
Ah, could have stayed here.

477
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,970
Do you want to see me crying after listening to my husband's cheek?

478
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,220
I doubt him in everything.

479
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,040
hard worker

480
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,710

488
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,240
Is it CCTV?

489
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,930
Developers have made it this way for a long time.

490
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,200
Did they send you on holiday?

491
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,390
no holidays

492
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:35,370

Yes, but haven't figured it out yet.

536
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I invited someone, why did you drive him away?

537
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,260
Five million won.

538
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,050
If you send the money within 5 minutes, Lata will be here.

539
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,520
Hope you don't have to send the account number again?

540
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:10,430
Do you want to send 5 million won to Lee Cheol-oh?

541
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,430
Hello, I came as you said.

542
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,400
i came

543
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,760
I'm here, now open the door.

544
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,250
Hello?

545
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,570
Hello?

546
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,530
Officer Kim...

547
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,490
You come here.

548
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,160
The matter has reached an extreme level, should the police not take action now?

549
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,960
Yes, we have taken the matter seriously, investigation will be initiated as soon as possible.

550
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,200
If there is any problem please call this number.

551
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,550
How do you know the password?

552
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,440
I applied for a second hand product.

553
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,740
And I am contacted through messages. I was invited.

554
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:17,530
At first I thought it was a prank too, but they send messages to my cockatoos too.

555
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:17,970
Is it true that you are looking for a partner?

556
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,270
Message them out of curiosity and get this reply. Is it true that you are looking for a partner?

557
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:21,340
Is it true that you are looking for a partner?

558
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:21,690
The reply came. Is it true that you are looking for a partner?

559
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,640
My lover will be alone. The reply came.

560
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,610
My lover will be alone.

561
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:23,940
They also told me the address. My lover will be alone.

562
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:23,980
They also told me the address.

563
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,400
Fulfill your desires. They also told me the address.

564
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:25,420
They also told me the address.

565
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:29,930
Their lovers will be completely alone.

566
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,680
They even sent me videos of their lovers.

567
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,980
He recorded videos of his girlfriend with others…

568
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,360
Give me your phone.

569
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:43,740
It's personal...

570
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,320
Hey!

571
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,060
This video is taken from an illegal site, stupid!

572
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,710
So or not?

573
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,260
Didn't they call? What is the number?

574
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,220
The call came from a spam caller ID.

575
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,780
An immaterial one!!

576
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,680
Please speak well, why are you reprimanding me like this?

577
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,370
Even if they get caught...

578
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,790
What did you say?

579
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,300
Jang Soo-hyun...Your hometown is in Daejeon.

580
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:39,140
27th batch of Jeongil High School

581
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,180

00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,350
Awarded in design competition from Hyoncho Construction University.

583
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,100
Join Kim's studio. Currently the team leader.

584
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,980
Do you have no more work? Shala is a demented beast.

585
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,940
Are you proud of teasing people by doing these things?

586
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,990
Don't look scared yourself.

587
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,370
OK, try again.

588
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,090
Now you go and take legal action.

589
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,400
Yes, went, but got nothing.

590
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,680
I could not communicate.

591
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,820
You can't communicate, isn't that mysterious?

592
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,130
Go and try again!!

593
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,210
When are search warrants available?

594
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,760
At least someone has to be there, only then can a warrant be obtained.

595
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:41,140
Ah, you want me to stay like this?

596
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,400
Did something happen to the new tenant?

597
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,740
Why are you looking for them?

598
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,620
I came to see their flat immediately.

599
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,390
Excuse me!

600
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,640
Is there anyone inside?

601
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,100
Is it strange?

602
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,900
Are they gone?

603
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,900
oh god

604
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,380
What happened?

605
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,980
I didn't think it would go like this.

606
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,380
what is it...

607
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,560
Did they leave it?

608
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,980
what's the matter

609
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,460
Ruined or not?

610
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,000
Oh God!

611
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,060
It's a crime scene!

612
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,520
It's a crime scene!

613
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,120
General public access is prohibited here.

614
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,020
Everyone go back.

615
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,860
i'm sorry

616
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,000
Please go back.

617
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,760
Why are you standing here?

618
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,100
Make the place safe!

619
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,880
Why is the car here?

620
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:09,920
Hey!

621
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,240
I said that no car should enter!

622
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,560
What is it doing here?

623
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,200
I asked to ensure the safety of the place!

624
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,460
what are you doing

625
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,460
Did you come here to play?

626
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,720
There's a corpse here!

627
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,020
be careful be careful

628
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,000
Move carefully.

629
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,480
Miss Soo-hyun!

630
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,320
Miss Soo-hyun...

631
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,040
i have to go

632
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,580
Stand for a minute.

633
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,140
Excuse me.

634
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:46,500
Please deliver Miss Jang safely to her home.

635
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,280
Yes, sir.

636
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,880
We will deliver you safely.

637
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,460
Please go and sit in the car.

638
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,320
come on

639
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,740
Will deliver carefully.

640
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,680
Did you understand something?

641
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:22,660
Not much. The body has been here for a long time... all the suspects have been cleared.

642
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,980
Hey, Detective Zooey. working hard

643
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,600
This case has been transferred to us.

644
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,260
If I get anything, I will let you know.

645
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,900
You already have many cases... is it possible to investigate it thoroughly?

646
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,560
Must be able to. It's a murder case, we'll let you know if we find anything.

647
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,220
Now let's go inside and find out.

648
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,560
Hurry, we're running out of time.

649
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,140
Talked to someone he recently contacted.

650
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,540
As far as he knows, his friend is planning to move out, hence selling his belongings.

651
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,360
Meanwhile her college friend is also worried as she is not able to contact him.

652
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,820
I sent the last message I was going to Busan.

653
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,500
Do you have his phone records?

654
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,220
I have sent the file to you sir.

655
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,880
There is no record of his phone in Busan.

656
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,900
His last phone record was when he was buying the fridge.

657
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,280
The beast orders the fridge through the victim's phone, and places the body in it.

658
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,560
He had planned everything long ago.

659
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,480
Complainant is not supposed to come today?

660
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,800
He is supposed to come to testify today.

661
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,820
But Detective Xu, shouldn't we prepare a report on this?

662
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,140
We do not have any evidence to make it clear that the two are the same person.

663
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,880
We need to investigate further.

664
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,920
I have already spoken to the owner of the house.

665
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Please let me go as soon as possible.

666
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,420
You will be liable for breach of rental agreement.

667
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,240
What does it smell like?

668
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,380
I ordered a second hand product.

669
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:19,600
But the delivery did not come, and communication was not possible.

670
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:27,440
The contact address on the product is the same but the seller's name is different.

671
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,820
It seems strange that there is no better way to find it.

672
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,920
Later I realized it was all a scam.

673
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:43,640
I was so mad that I commented on that account.

674
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:53,740
And since then it all started.

675
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,400
who

676
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,120
Chicken delivery!

677
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,620
I did not order.

678
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,640
Did you order?

679
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,620
no

680
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,380
Pizza appeared!

681
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:09,000
He called again and again.

682
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:16,900
All of my contacts used to communicate with me through social media.

683
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:26,220
Even knows all about me.

684
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,980
My things were disappearing one by one.

685
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,220
It seemed like he was playing with me.

686
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:48,320
Everything was fake because the number belonged to a girl.

687
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,060
How do you know it?

688
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,660
he came

689
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,380
Stay with me for a few days.

690
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,820
How is that possible?

691
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,330
You also have a mother-in-law. I don't want to be a burden.

692
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:07,400
You don't have to think about it.

693
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,400
You said someone died!

694
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,620
I was worried about you.

695
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,640
How to leave alone like this?

696
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,860
i'm fine Police guard outside.

697
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:21,600
I should sleep now. Must go to the site tomorrow morning.

698
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:27,570
I will leave in the morning so you can stay a little late.

699
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,200
thank you I kept

700
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:45,620
[Student 'A', who had been missing for five days, was found dead in his apartment]

701
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,170
Let's go back.

702
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,440
We will now return to the station.

703
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,800
Did something happen?

704
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,000
Fortunately nothing happened.

705
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,640
Should have quit earlier.

706
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,600
Let's all go home.

707
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,200
Leave everything in place and rest.

708
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,240
Sir, it's not time to close yet, are you leaving so soon?

709
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,080
I will call them myself.

710
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,400
We are contracted, and I don't think you should go so soon.

711
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,960
A few days ago we were fine.

712
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:54,060
Do you think, someone of knee age will listen and there I will work?

713
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,220
Sir...

714
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,310
Are you doing injustice to them by leaving without permission?

715
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,880
I can't talk to you.

716
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,600
Sir, he can do many things now, but is emotional.

717
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,350
Worked hard enough today.

718
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,930
Worked hard today.

719
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,620
Go home carefully!

720
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,110
Goodbye everyone.

721
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,060
Hey, you should rest.

722
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,260
I am handling this.

723
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,240
No, sorry. you go away

724
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,480
no, no This is what I see.

725
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,440
you go now

726
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,160
Lakshmi is a girl.

727
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,760
Be careful!

728
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,160
Su-hyun.

729
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,960
Manager Kim, are you here?

730
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,560
I've heard it all.

731
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,920
I was waiting for you because I was worried.

732
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,920
i'm fine you go now

733
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,880
You should have someone by your side right now.

734
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,400
I am very well. please go

735
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,960
Su-hyun!

736
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,960
I said, I will be with you.

737
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,310
Why do you say that?

738
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:22,880
Please go away!

739
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,510
what are you doing

740
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:25,970
I will be with you!

741
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:29,480
Try to understand my feelings!

742
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,770
Why?

743
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,710
Hey!

744
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,570
Hey!

745
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,680
Do you hate me so much?

746
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,680
Why don't you like me?

747
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,420
People should look positively!

748
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,940
Think of yourself as something big!

749
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:01,820
I don't like you that much!

750
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,820
Baal!

751
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:04,600
I'm going!

752
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,650
Courage!

753
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,250
God!

754
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:42,840
If you come back home so soon...

755
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:49,910
I checked everything even the chopsticks but everything was cleaned well.

756
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:51,250
all clear

757
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,800
Not even a hair in the bathroom.

758
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,200
And CCTV?

759
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,620
Saw, but could not see his face as he was wearing a helmet.

760
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:03,170
I retrieved the memory card for further investigation.

761
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,480
The beast...

762
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,370
Miss Soo-hyun...

763
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:16,820
Will you stay here from now on?

764
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,620
Miss Soo-Hyun.

765
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,600
Miss Soo-hyun?

766
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,280
Miss Soo-Hyun.

767
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,220
Miss Soo-Hyun.

768
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,400
Miss Soo-hyun!

769
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,540
I have to go somewhere, but I will come.

770
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,570
Please take some rest.

771
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,080
Detective Ju...

772
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:56,880
For the sake of necessity I have come across other cases.

773
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,970
I found six similar cases.

774
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:05,940
All are related to buying secondhand goods, trespassing and murder.

775
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,400
Why did I not see them?

776
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:10,220
These cases have not been investigated?

777
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:14,110
In these cases, no clear evidence was found, so they may have been piled up.

778
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:17,820
There is no allegation of negligence in the investigation.

779
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,020
Hello?

780
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,110
Did something happen again?

781
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:37,740
I was worried because you didn't come to work.

782
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:38,970
where now?

783
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,540
in the hospital

784
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,400
I'm going now.

785
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,340
In the hospital? Why?

786
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,250
are you sick

787
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:46,880
Which hospital?

788
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,510
Shall I come to see you?

789
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,770
After all.

790
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:51,740
Su-hyun.

791
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,970
Let's go to Nonyang Crossroads please.

792
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:13,080
I'm in a taxi. I am calling you on arrival.

793
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,800
Should I do what I want?

794
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,540
Should?

795
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,540
Please stop these?

796
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:26,710
please

797
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,800
I want 10 million in cash.

798
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:39,110
Then stop these?

799
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:43,510
Turn off the phone and go home quietly.

800
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,820
If the police call again, we will start from the beginning.

801
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,340
yes, hello

802
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,600
Detective Joo Cheol-jo, I admitted Miss Jang Soo-hyun this morning.

803
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,020
Is Miss Jang Soo-hyun still in the emergency ward?

804
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,480
I can't contact him.

805
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,140
what is that

806
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,400
Detective Xu wanted it.

807
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,620
give me

808
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:17,710
What is it?

809
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:19,800
Phone location information.

810
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,280
Miss Zhang left the hospital long ago.

811
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,450
oh well

812
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,400
He asked him to let him know if he could figure out the exact location according to the date.

813
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,430
[Dongil-ro, Nowon-gu 24]

814
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,420
Car parking is prohibited here.

815
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,110
i am the police I am in charge.

816
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,570
Detective Ju...

817
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:43,110
When Miss Soo-hyun reported the forced entry into the house four days ago, the suspect was still around.

818
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:46,000
He always was.

819
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,880
hey who are you

820
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,940
I am Su-hyun's manager. who are you

821
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:16,020
Oh, so you?

822
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,510
The man named Washing Machine.

823
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:19,050
That crazy guy.

824
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:23,400
I heard all about you.

825
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,620
The girl has suffered enough because of you.

826
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:28,820
damn die Do you like him too?

827
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:29,650
Are you the intruder?

828
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:34,540
Because of you I have become an intruder too.

829
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,710
Open it!

830
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:37,450
I see your moon face!

831
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:38,570
Some tenants do not like ordinary CCTV cameras, so such designs are made.

832
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,110
Do not recognize me?

833
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,310
CCTV...

834
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:15,600
are you ok

835
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,450
Detective Zoo!

836
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,620
Detective Zooey.

837
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,110
Detective Zoo!

838
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,250
Get up, Detective Zoo!

839
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,020
Can you hear?

840
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:11,000
He has taken her, and his car is heading towards you.

841
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,940
He is going fast.

842
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:12,570
Move on!

843
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,250
We have to stop him.

844
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:18,600
Go ahead! Go ahead!

845
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,310
damn die

846
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:55,310
Ouch!

847
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,000
Move away!

848
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,020
Not Siang-hyun!

849
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,650
Siang-hyun! Siang-hyun!

850
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:53,600
Not Siang-hyun!

851
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,820
Siang-hyun!

852
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,200
Stay awake!

853
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,170
Hey, Nah Siang-hyun.

854
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,450
We have to work together, Seang-hyun!

855
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,280
We have to work together, Seang-hyun!

856
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,820
Ambulance, ambulance

857
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,050
Please call an ambulance.

858
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,970
One officer was injured.

859
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,770
Miss Soo-hyun!

860
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,340
Miss Soo-hyun!

861
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:36,480
Miss Soo-hyun! Miss Soo-hyun!

862
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,970
Can you hear me?

863
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:48,600
Fill it to 100 ml.

864
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:50,080
Yes, sir.

865
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,510
Get an ultrasound of the ribs and look at the chest.

866
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:52,970
Yes, sir.

867
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:55,570
Excuse me, I will do the ultrasound.

868
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:55,710
Every ten minutes will check his blood pressure, ultrasound I am doing.

869
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:56,820
Check his blood pressure every ten minutes.

870
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,140
CT scan room?

871
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:58,910
What is here?

872
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,940
Blood color returned to normal.

873
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,710
Scan or not, I have to do it.

874
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,050
His blood is full now.

875
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,220
Out of saline, need one more bag.

876
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:17,140
We tried to catch him.

877
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:20,710
Ask hospital staff to cooperate.

878
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:27,570
If necessary, always have a friend with you.

879
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:32,510
That's fine, I'll handle it all.

880
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,880
You take some rest.

881
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,880
He should be given a sleeping pill.

882
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,740
It is very powerful, so you will feel its effects quickly.

883
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:05,600
The person you called is unavailable.

884
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,620
Leave your message after hearing the tone.

885
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,200
Soo-hyun, are you okay?

886
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,280
What are you doing that you can't pick up my phone?

887
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:16,080
In such a situation, people should stay close.

888
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:17,510
Erase everything from your mind.

889
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:22,340
If you keep doing this, then no one will be worse than me.

890
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,940
Your strange behavior is worrying me.

891
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:28,740
Will call me as soon as I get the message.

892
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:32,880
There is no CCTV footage.

893
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,310
Where did the footage go?

894
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:35,370
oh you come

895
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:38,710
Listen when you come, remove yourself from this case.

896
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,170
It should not mean giving the case to someone else.

897
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,770
But the nose must be in the throat.

898
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:42,910
You heard right.

899
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,510
I don't see any solution.

900
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:47,540
Until the culprit is caught, the situation is out of our hands.

901
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:51,050
Besides...it's a very big serial killer case, so they're doing their best.

902
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,770
We have been asked to stop our investigation.

903
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:53,650
There is nothing else to do.

904
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:55,170
So wrap yourself up from this case.

905
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,050
The devil has not been caught yet.

906
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:57,850
Soo-hyun...

907
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:00,770
What should we do?

908
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,200
He really...

909
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:15,400
Yes, Detective Cheol-jo of the Cybercrime Division.

910
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,770
Can I know why you called?

911
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:44,540
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

912
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:54,600
The detective is not dead.

913
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,280
CCTV footage will disappear, I will find the dog on my own responsibility.

914
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:24,280
Can you recognize him after finding?

915
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,370
are you ok

916
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,000
How about taking it?

917
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,250
I really like it!

918
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:47,540
Suddenly remembered, sold quickly.

919
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:52,400
Even I have never made such a post.

920
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,050
But just in time it comes up, an offer is made.

921
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:58,480
"Offer, whatever the situation"

922
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,910
We can't stay away for long.

923
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:27,140
I'm not leaving behind you, understand?

924
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,680
I'll be back for you!

925
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:39,050
I'll be back for you!

926
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,510
i will be back

927
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:51,850
Guys!

928
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:53,050
Detective Cheol-joo!

929
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,450
If we force him to come!

930
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,200
If he finds us.

931
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,910
Ahammakta prefers to target a certain class.

932
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,680
People who live alone, away from family,

933
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,680
Those who speak Chinese spontaneously

934
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:23,170
That means we are going to be a worthy target for him, not just on Chinese sites

935
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,020
On all SNS platforms.

936
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:29,910
I was trapped, what if he came looking for me?

937
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,250
Miss Soo-hyun, we don't have much time left for the post.

938
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:34,850
do?

939
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:41,570
I'm the only one who's seen his face, so should at least try.

940
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:13,680
Don't take too much pressure.

941
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:15,170
What else to do!

942
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:16,080
This is the only way.

943
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,510
If this continues, you will have to run to the hospital again.

944
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:20,250
Go get some sleep.

945
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,050
Yes!

946
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,220
Miss Soo-hyun, where are you right now?

947
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,540
I went out to meet the seller.

948
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:47,740
I'm almost there too, stuck in a jam.

949
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:50,280
No problem, still have quite a bit of time.

950
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,540
University students this time?

951
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:55,600
I have to check that too, at least I can do that.

952
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:02,050
Excuse me! Are you lazy?

953
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:03,620
Huh?

954
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:06,850
Chinese...

955
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:09,570
aren't you?

956
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,620
I have to meet a student.

957
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:18,820
Oh, she's my little sister, she was supposed to come.

958
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:22,370
But the world is so dangerous now that I have come instead.

959
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,340
He got them as a gift, not much use; That's what he said.

960
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,170
Well...

961
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:42,770
Excuse me!

962
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:56,510
Actually...my friend saved the money very hard, so if possible...

963
01:26:57,110 --> 01:27:00,250
I wanted to check the status of the product.

964
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:06,620
Yes, definitely check it out.

965
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:13,340
Sorry, but my trunk is full so it will take a while to get them down.

966
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,800
Check it out here instead.

967
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,800
ok then...

968
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:22,170
Do I wait for your money to come? Come and check...

969
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,170
I will stay outside the house.

970
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:28,970
DETECTIVE Where are you?

971
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:29,850
got him

972
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:31,110
Almost there.

973
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:32,310
where are you now?

974
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:33,140
On the second floor.

975
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,600
Can you see him?

976
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,080
One minute!

977
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,310
You see, I came!

978
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:22,080
Such a situation is extremely shameful for me.

979
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,600
Now let's see how to save yourself.

980
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,220
It's strange.

981
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:38,970
This is not his house.

982
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:48,000
Damn, where did I go?

983
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,510
the detective

984
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,480
Detective, where are you now?

985
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,140
Please come quickly.

986
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:14,510
come quickly

987
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,250
Stop the game, open the door.

988
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:21,400
open the door

989
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:25,450
Save me!

990
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:59,400
You were hiding, you thought I wouldn't find you.

991
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,250
I found you because of your plan.

992
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,740
No one knows me except you.

993
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:09,220
Just kill you.

994
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:13,220
Do you think so?

995
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,510
Do you think that no one knows you except me?

996
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:29,250
Even if you kill me, you will be caught.

997
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:00,310
Detective!

998
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,340
Pig, I will kill you.

999
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,480
No!

1000
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,680
die

1001
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,110
Why always come in the middle!

1002
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:07,480
immaterial

1003
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,540
Why always have to swallow the nose!

1004
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:12,340
die ass

1005
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,170
The story is over.

1006
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:05,940
At least take one please, drink it.

1007
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,220
please take

1008
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,110
Ma'am, please take one.

1009
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:14,000
Mr. the frog

1010
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:14,970
Yes, Miss Zhang

1011
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:15,850
take one

1012
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:17,510
Why did you call us here?

1013
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:20,310
Oh thank you, thank you very much.

1014
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:26,170
Is it possible to finish the master room bathroom today!

1015
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:27,480
Oh that means it's a bribe.

1016
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:30,050
Yes, you are right, it is a bribe.

1017
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:50,600
Recently, a robbery through a website related to the sale of second-hand goods,

1018
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:53,450
Several crimes have even been committed, including murder, in which a policeman has also been killed.

1019
01:36:53,450 --> 01:36:57,000
Criminals use these platforms to first extort and then kill their victims.

1020
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,420
In addition, criminals used to sell used products to victims at a higher profit.

1021
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:04,370
A police officer realizes the matter and starts an investigation by collecting relevant evidence. However, during the course of the investigation, the death of the accused was confirmed.

1022
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:06,850
Meanwhile, even after the death of the criminal is confirmed,

1023
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,170
Dealing in second hand goods, forgery by impersonation,

1024
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,880
And the coercion case is still ongoing.

1025
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:18,340
According to police statistics, in the past year,

1026
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:21,340
Number of criminal activities on websites selling second-hand goods

1027
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:25,200
It has more than doubled compared to previous years.
