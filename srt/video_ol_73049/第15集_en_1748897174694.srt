1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,960
We are destined to be together

2
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,260
passive

3
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,400
picked up people will always see

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,660
Due to the foot injury

5
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,300
who couldn't do anything

6
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,280
for her deadcken please?

7
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,780
As the woman was wearing her"?

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,220
Have a look at this.

9
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:49,600
Tell me where this swirl purple

10
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,360
AMAui months ago

11
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,420
How did it happen?

12
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,360
Yesterday I saw the photo

13
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,680
It's more terrible than the map.

14
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
It's a moral kidnapping, okay?

15
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,040
If the two of you like each other,

16
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,200
it's fine.

17
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,520
If the girls don't like him,

18
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,800
they'll marry him.

19
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,920
Everyone will feel sorry for him.

20
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,040
Let's introduce that girl.

21
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,200
My feet are all wet.

22
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,240
I can't stand it.

23
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
The architecture school,

24
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,840
the architecture department,

25
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,440
Mr. Da Yi Xu Zhi.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,080
I'm the man.

27
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,720
Xu Zhi.

28
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,920
Mr. Da Yi Xu Zhi.

29
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
So the person he confessed to is you.

30
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,720
Here.

31
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,160
I want to use a poem

32
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,160
to express my feelings for you.

33
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,120
Here.

34
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm a person

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
who's desperate.

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,040
Hurry up.

37
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,280
You didn't reply.

38
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,880
Okay, okay.

39
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,440
Don't look.

40
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,760
I don't look.

41
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,240
Hurry up.

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,880
Wait a minute.

43
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,320
Hurry up.

44
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,800
Hurry up.

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,440
I don't see him.

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,160
You were so stupid last year.

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,640
Sorry.

48
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,280
Si Si, I'll go down the hall.

49
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,280
Hello, Dad.

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,680
Hello, Miss Lin.

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
Yes.

52
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
How are your legs?

53
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,960
Much better.

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,920
It doesn't hurt.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,600
If it hurts,

56
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,680
don't take it off.

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,640
You must go to the hospital to check.

58
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,080
On my earth,

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,080
you are my last rose.

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,520
Who's that voice?

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
I'm thinking.

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,560
I feel...

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,760
You're pursuing for it.

64
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,520
You're handsome.

65
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
Which one?

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,720
I don't know.

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,480
Don't worry.

68
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,800
Besides,

69
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
I have Cheng Ruozhou.

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
Why do you always have to

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,600
be so stubborn?

72
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,040
Can you change your mind?

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,000
I just think

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
the Chinese play

75
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
is about others.

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
There's no place

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,840
for romantic poems.

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,120
Of course.

79
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,000
Can young people

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,200
have a good time

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,800
when they write poems?

82
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Let me tell you.

83
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,600
Your father was

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,040
a poet from the Yuanjin people.

85
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,320
I don't know

86
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,760
if he wrote those poems

87
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,080
or copied them from other places.

88
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,560
But it's true.

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,200
He lost a lot of women

90
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,720
in his childhood.

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
You mean

92
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,880
after he's old,

93
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,440
he'll be like his father?

94
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,480
I'll find a way

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,400
to draw him.

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
Don't be so selfish.

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,080
You have such a mind.

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,760
Dad, don't worry.

99
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
Okay, I'll hang up.

100
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
That's it.

101
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,360
My son!

102
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay, okay.

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,920
Don't be shy.

104
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,640
I'm Xu Zhi's roommate.

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Do you like Xu Zhi?

106
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,120
From primary school to now,

107
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,160
there are six or seven

108
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,280
of you who like Xu Zhi.

109
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,040
How about this?

110
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,880
Go back first.

111
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,160
I'll make a bet with you.

112
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,400
How about number eight?

113
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,240
No, this thing

114
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,480
is for the feeling.

115
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,920
It's for the fate.

116
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,240
You can't just come and go.

117
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,240
You're confident.

118
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,040
Have you heard of Jiang Yu?

119
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,960
That...

120
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,320
The one who's in the middle of school.

121
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,840
The Yuancao of the Yuanmen School.

122
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,720
He's the one who's in the right place.

123
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,120
Okay, okay.

124
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,600
Wait a minute.

125
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,320
I'll go now.

126
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,760
Let's go.

127
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,280
Forget it.

128
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,240
In our school,

129
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,080
men are more likely to be in the same class

130
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,640
than women.

131
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,680
Especially women

132
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,000
who are in the same class.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,320
That's more like it.

134
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,600
Please forgive me.

135
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,680
But that big-head man just now,

136
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
we've already given up.

137
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,520
What about Jiang Yu?

138
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Do you have any ideas?

139
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,320
No, I don't.

140
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,280
I really don't have any feelings for him.

141
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,840
And I don't want to be in a relationship now.

142
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,960
What are you talking about?

143
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,360
Sister,

144
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
do you think Jiang Yu

145
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,160
and Xu Zhi are so compatible?

146
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,040
And he's so handsome.

147
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,920
No.

148
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,360
But I really don't have any ideas for him.

149
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,120
And I don't want to be in a relationship now.

150
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
Tell me.

151
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,800
Have you already told me

152
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
who you like?

153
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,200
I've talked about it

154
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
during graduation.

155
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,200
But it's been a while.

156
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm only thinking about

157
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,880
getting into the national zoo.

158
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,440
These are my four-year-old boyfriend.

159
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,800
No.

160
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,120
You've talked about love.

161
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,320
Oh my god.

162
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,520
What kind of guy is he?

163
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,680
Tell us.

164
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm so curious.

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,320
What kind of guy can he be?

166
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,000
Xu Zhi.

167
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,320
He's so handsome.

168
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,000
So handsome.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
So handsome.

170
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,320
That's all?

171
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,960
He's so handsome.

172
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,160
He's actually a famous actor.

173
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,520
Just like Jiang Yu.

174
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
I really think he's so handsome.

175
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,960
But you think he's that kind of guy.

176
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,720
Besides,

177
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,080
he's so nice.

178
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,560
Maybe he's a guy.

179
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,600
He's not handsome at all.

180
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,280
Then he's not that kind of guy.

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,960
Maybe it's my personal question.

182
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,160
I think

183
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,400
he's a good guy.

184
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,560
Especially handsome.

185
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,120
But I think

186
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800
Jiang Yu is very reliable.

187
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
Exactly.

188
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,480
Really?

189
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,560
You've got a lot of connections with him.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,800
He's a good singer.

191
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,440
He's so romantic.

192
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,200
Exactly.

193
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,640
So romantic.

194
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,960
He's a good singer.

195
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,880
I didn't expect you to be so nice.

196
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,280
Do you have time today?

197
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
To live in a big house?

198
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I asked you.

199
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
He said he could.

200
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,560
Do you have time for Ma Tong?

201
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,520
Jiang Yu has time for him.

202
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,440
Don't bother.

203
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,960
It's hard to wash.

204
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,960
I think it's okay.

205
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Okay, okay.

206
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,880
Wash.

207
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,720
Good night.

208
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,960
Good night.

209
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,200
Sleep tight.

210
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Wait for me.

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,160
Thank you very much for all your милли DanceWaiters.

212
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,520
How about our performance today?

213
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,880
Aren't you going to international concert this month?

214
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,200
Don't worry.

215
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,160
I'm just a little old.

216
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,920
Don't think too much.

217
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,480
Yes, yes.

218
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,520
But, as I see it,

219
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,640
they still have to fight.

220
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,520
Because President Zh and Lucy

221
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,040
looked like they were fighting.

222
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,520
But,

223
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,000
they didn't give up at all.

224
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,680
How's it going?

225
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,920
Is Zhuge practicing well?

226
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,040
Look at his forehead.

227
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,440
Yang Qichu, let me do it.

228
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
You... You put that lens

229
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
in the back.

230
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,480
Right?

231
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,320
Okay.

232
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,800
Not bad.

233
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,920
I won't say it.

234
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm training.

235
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,400
I'm hanging up.

236
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,240
Why?

237
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,080
Here you are, President Zh.

238
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,200
Let's go.

239
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,320
I'm telling you, this is a very good thing.

240
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,240
It's a good box.

241
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,280
Let's go.

242
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,200
Hello, this way, please.

243
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,760
I'm starving.

244
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,840
Show me the menu.

245
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,520
This way.

246
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,200
Okay.

247
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,760
Thank you.

248
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,360
Trust me.

249
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,320
One for yourself.

250
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,240
And then two for the slow-motion meal.

251
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

252
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,880
Please wait a minute.

253
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,200
Sit.

254
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,280
Did you takenel?

255
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,520
Is it apparently so?

256
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Well, let me push you.

257
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,520
I watched them for a year and they couldn't master it like that.

258
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,240
They broke it one month.

259
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,360
So, just a complete Hairie.

260
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,160
See?

261
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,520
See?

262
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,120
Well...

263
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,520
Can you still change it back?

264
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,600
You're acting like you're not doing well.

265
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,160
Not at all?

266
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
No later on.

267
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,920
Say what you just said.

268
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,440
It's full of birth control.

269
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,320
This is true.

270
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,920
男's gender

271
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,600
isn't the same as common men's gender tho.

272
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,680
We like it in Directory face

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,420
ausge,

274
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,140
I shouldn't distribute the part-time job.

275
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,780
I should be in not Intentiary,

276
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,720
跟我akes team

277
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,760
Both of us.

278
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,340
Do you miss him?

279
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,940
I think what took you long

280
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,880
is you miss him very?

281
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,260
You wouldn't please me?

282
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll use this instead of I'm going to let you have a hard time being me.

283
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,340
That's hadi!

284
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,240
Your cooking is yet so exciting.

285
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,640
If you don't dare to challenge me..

286
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,500
That's better!

287
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,040
Here you are.

288
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,920
Here you are.

289
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,560
What's this?

290
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,520
This is my grandma's wine.

291
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,360
Look.

292
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,920
It's very good.

293
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,120
It's a wine made in the daytime.

294
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,680
I told you

295
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,800
my dad wouldn't give me

296
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,600
this recipe.

297
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,320
I stole it.

298
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,200
Try it.

299
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,720
It's good.

300
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,040
You...

301
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,080
Are you playing with me?

302
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,160
Don't be so unreasonable.

303
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,760
You're responsible for the big deal.

304
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
Yes, I'm responsible.

305
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,920
You should say I'm responsible.

306
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
You've been responsible

307
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
for so many times.

308
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,200
I don't need to be responsible.

309
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,680
Then why don't you need to be responsible?

310
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,240
I just don't need to be responsible.

311
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,960
Have a taste.

312
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,840
It's not good to drink.

313
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,320
Actually,

314
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,560
I've been in Beijing for so long.

315
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,120
I dare not contact you.

316
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm just afraid

317
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
you'll think of her

318
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,640
when you see me.

319
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,040
Why are you staring at me?

320
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,840
Can you think of her?

321
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,280
I heard you have

322
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,760
a school called Jiang Yu.

323
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,960
Am I handsome?

324
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,400
How do you know Jiang Yu?

325
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,000
I have a new eye.

326
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,000
How many times

327
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,920
Cheng Luzhou asked you

328
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,320
to stay by my side?

329
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,080
Did he ask you to do that?

330
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,920
I'll serve you some food.

331
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,520
No.

332
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,680
After the score was out,

333
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,880
he knew you were a big fan.

334
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
He told me

335
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
to watch him.

336
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
He was afraid you'd bully him.

337
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,080
He couldn't listen to you.

338
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,240
So what about Jiang Yu?

339
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,960
Is he our Lu Si?

340
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,560
What does he mean?

341
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,640
No, Xu Zhi.

342
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,360
Don't misunderstand.

343
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,680
He really doesn't mean anything.

344
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,560
He really wants me to

345
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,000
watch you.

346
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
He's afraid you'll bully him.

347
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,440
He also said

348
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,280
he can be his boyfriend.

349
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,360
Xu Zhi.

350
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,960
I want to tell you something.

351
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,720
I think you should

352
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
keep looking for his shadow

353
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,400
in other people's eyes.

354
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,520
You really can't do that.

355
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,080
How about...

356
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,440
you have a relationship?

357
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,120
After all, Lu Si is abroad.

358
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,840
He can't go back

359
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,960
for a while.

360
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm not sure.

361
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't think so.

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
I just want to see him.

363
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,320
I don't think so.

364
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,440
I don't think so.

365
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
I don't think so.

366
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
I don't think so.

367
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,520
I don't think so.

368
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,120
I can't go back for a while.

369
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,880
I think

370
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,080
it's not good to be so curious.

371
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,080
You're right.

372
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
Where is the new brother?

373
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,320
Where is he?

374
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Where is he?

375
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,440
He's so handsome.

376
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
He's so handsome.

377
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,640
He's so handsome.

378
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,160
He's so handsome.

379
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,040
He's coming every day.

380
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,400
He's so handsome.

381
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,440
He's so handsome.

382
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,560
He's so handsome.

383
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
He's so handsome.

384
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
He's finally here.

385
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,240
You're back so soon.

386
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,600
Are you back for the model?

387
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,400
No.

388
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,760
They said this is your seat.

389
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
I'll wait here.

390
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,240
This is not a model.

391
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,640
This is my buddy Lucy.

392
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,240
It's not easy to come back from Europe.

393
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,560
Come on.

394
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:28,880
Let's go.

395
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,320
Come on.

396
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,240
Let's eat.

397
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,200
You can't go up there.

398
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
It's important to go to class.

399
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,040
What's wrong with you?

400
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,080
The red gold cloth.

401
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,240
Of course.

402
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,960
Why is the car so beautiful?

403
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,240
I haven't finished it yet.

404
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,600
Aren't you wearing a shirt?

405
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,440
Don't eat with us.

406
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,600
How can we grow vegetables?

407
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,680
I don't need to grow meat now.

408
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,840
I need to grow vegetables.

409
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,240
Eat it.

410
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,120
You eat with vegetables.

411
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Otherwise,

412
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,320
you'll eat salad every day.

413
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,440
You'll be so full.

414
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,080
Just like today's lunch,

415
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,800
I ate the same amount of ingredients as Xu Zhi.

416
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,480
It's expensive and hard to eat.

417
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,080
Haven't you seen Xu Zhi?

418
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,680
I heard that he didn't mention you in the lunch.

419
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,200
I went to the Chinese restaurant.

420
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,840
But I didn't tell him.

421
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,800
Why?

422
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,520
I went to the Chinese restaurant.

423
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,560
But the result hasn't come out yet.

424
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,160
Before the result is confirmed,

425
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,760
I don't want him to know.

426
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,720
You went to the Chinese restaurant?

427
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,160
Then you don't need to go abroad?

428
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,480
Sure.

429
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,880
No.

430
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
Does your family agree?

431
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
Didn't you always say that I'm a mother?

432
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,760
I didn't listen to anyone from the beginning.

433
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,000
I just listened to myself.

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,920
Okay.

435
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,840
Lucy, you're so smart.

436
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
Now,

437
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,520
you dare to talk to Lord Queen.

438
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,280
That's all.

439
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,960
Come on.

440
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,360
Let me hug you.

441
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
You're so crazy.

442
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,880
Really?

443
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,840
Get up.

444
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Wait a minute.

445
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,800
This...

446
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,720
Why did you go abroad and become a mother?

447
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,520
What's this?

448
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,560
Do you care?

449
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,800
Xu Zhi, right?

450
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,360
Lucy.

451
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,200
Lucy.

452
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,480
You're not a mother now.

453
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,200
You're in love with your mother.

454
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,920
Zeng Yan knows I'm here to keep it a secret.

455
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,080
Don't talk to me.

456
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,800
Lucy.

457
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,520
I can keep it a secret from Xu Zhi.

458
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,360
But...

459
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,720
I think you're too lonely to live alone.

460
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,680
How about this?

461
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,960
I'll stay with you.

462
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
I'll talk to you

463
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,640
and have a rest.

464
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,520
Okay.

465
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
That's the one I'm looking for.

466
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,600
I really can't take it.

467
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,840
He doesn't wash his feet every day.

468
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
He doesn't wash his feet.

469
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,960
He keeps his feet on the floor.

470
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,040
He keeps my head and legs on the floor.

471
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,960
Can he stand it?

472
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,040
He's so weak.

473
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,960
You have to sleep.

474
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,120
Oh, yeah.

475
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,120
Come on.

476
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,800
Eat it all.

477
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,440
Eat it all.

478
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,120
I'll treat you.

479
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,680
Okay?

480
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,840
Waiter.

481
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,960
Order some food.

482
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,760
Okay.

483
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,000
Come on.

484
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,880
I'll have a look.

485
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,840
Let's see what's next.

486
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,320
Xu Zhi, how is it?

487
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
I don't think it's right to have a class last time.

488
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,640
This is a class from Professor Wang.

489
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,600
How many people do you hang out with every year?

490
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
I can't take it.

491
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,800
This is the first class

492
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,400
I graduated from.

493
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,120
I just want to keep it a good impression.

494
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,160
I think

495
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,120
you want to give it a little insurance now.

496
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,320
Xu Zhi, I'm angry.

497
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,840
Professor Wang's class,

498
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,360
do you dare to be a little bit more strict?

499
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,800
Our university doctor knows it's his class.

500
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,320
He doesn't even eat lunch.

501
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,440
He just sits at the door of the classroom.

502
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,240
Professor Wang is so cruel.

503
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,040
Wang is a kind person.

504
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,600
Unless you're good enough,

505
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,880
don't use him to give the key

506
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,360
when you're in the exam.

507
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,720
Otherwise, if the attitude is not correct,

508
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,320
he might just hang it up.

509
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,520
Let's hurry up.

510
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,800
Don't be late. Let's go.

511
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,560
Hurry up.

512
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,680
If Xu Zhi wants a WeChat,

513
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,480
he'll be late.

514
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,320
Let's go.

515
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,960
Let's go.

516
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,160
It's Professor Jiang Yu.

517
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
He asked me to help you.

518
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,960
Thank you.

519
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
You're welcome.

520
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,320
It's still Professor Jiang Yu.

521
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,760
When will you tell him?

522
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,320
Next time, I'll ask your boyfriend

523
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,640
to take a look at the wall.

524
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,560
I'll tell him.

525
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,640
I'll tell him.

526
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
I'll tell him.

527
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
I'll tell him.

528
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
I'll tell him.

529
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
I'll tell him.

530
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
Let's take a look at the wall.

531
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,800
If you think about it,

532
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,600
you'll know that he's not my boyfriend.

533
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,840
Let's sit here next time.

534
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,920
Sorry, I was wrong.

535
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,800
It's okay.

536
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,960
Thank you.

537
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,120
Good morning, everyone.

538
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,280
Good morning, Professor.

539
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,640
Open the book.

540
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
It's the 27th page.

541
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
This question.

542
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,600
Xu Gongzhu,

543
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,840
answer this question.

544
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
She agreed.

545
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:54,760
You can have his

546
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,280
I can't even get a night sleep.

547
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,640
Yu Xi doesn't know about it.

548
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,160
Then will you?

549
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,440
I know.

550
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,320
I heard that

551
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,680
other movies

552
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,360
have a name for their play.

553
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,240
They have been missing for a month.

554
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,440
I haven't been there

555
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,240
since they passed.

556
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,120
That's not good.

557
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,280
No, no.

558
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,720
I have to.

559
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,800
I can't.

560
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,720
I can't.

561
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,840
I can't.

562
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,200
You can.

563
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,440
He must remember me.

564
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,360
What should I do?

565
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,640
Raise your feet.

566
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,120
Don't be so stubborn.

567
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,120
Get up.

568
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,840
All right.

569
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,920
What do you mean?

570
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,360
Decision.

571
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:37,960
This is called

572
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,760
the decision of the case.

573
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,280
Wait.

574
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,200
There's something up there.

575
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,920
Seize the idea of a relationship.

576
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,000
Wait.

577
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,120
There's something up there.

578
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,640
New information ceremony.

579
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,160
And

580
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,520
I need to look it up often

581
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,600
to find the idea.

582
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,840
Let's have a look. It's gone.

583
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,000
How is it?

584
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,120
Is it okay? Tell me.

585
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,880
Tell me.

586
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
It's not.

587
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,000
It's impossible.

588
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,160
Is it done?

589
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,320
I'm more nervous than you.

590
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,880
Don't do this.

591
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,520
I can't stand it.

592
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,120
Can you tell me the result?

593
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,360
I don't have two days.

594
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,440
I'll do my best.

595
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
You've got a big score.

596
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
What's the score?

597
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,760
Go. Go.

598
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,520
Clear it.

599
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,120
You've got a big score.

600
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,880
You can teach me.

601
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,600
By the way,

602
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,600
I won't come back this weekend.

603
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,880
I'll let you handle it.

604
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,120
Okay.

605
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,680
Take care. Bye.

606
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,480
To challenge the queen,

607
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,000
you have to do it yourself.

608
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,480
You have to do it for free.

609
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,600
Lucy, Lucy.

610
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Don't be too handsome.

611
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,000
Come on.

612
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
Sit. Sit.

613
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,800
Come on.

614
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,600
Oh my god.

615
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,160
It's so big.

616
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
It's raining.

617
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,360
What's the weather?

618
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,320
It's wet.

619
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Where's my phone?

620
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,120
It's so wet.

621
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,240
It's raining.

622
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,960
I'll take a picture of the mountain view of the Minsu Bridge.

623
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,680
500 yuan for a camera.

624
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,200
500?

625
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,400
500 for a camera?

626
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,880
You have to take a picture of the mountain.

627
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,640
It's slippery.

628
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,120
It won't be wasted.

629
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
It's about 5000.

630
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,440
500 for a camera.

631
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,960
It's too expensive.

632
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,720
I'll go.

633
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Oh my god.

634
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,360
You're so young.

635
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,080
Yes.

636
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
It's so cool.

637
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,960
You know what the picture is?

638
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,200
It's a beautiful picture.

639
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,720
It's beautiful from the top to the bottom.

640
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,880
It's so beautiful.

641
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,800
Even 500 won is not enough.

642
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,720
It's a good picture.

643
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,240
It's not that expensive.

644
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
It's so beautiful.

645
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,360
Are you interested in joining the student council?

646
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,000
It's suitable for the group like you.

647
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,720
When the departments get up,

648
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,520
there will be a big party.

649
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
If it's you,

650
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,960
you can control it.

651
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,040
Forget it.

652
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,000
The promotion department will open at 10 p.m. every night.

653
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,280
I'm so hungry.

654
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,880
I don't have any important work.

655
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,080
I have to report to the department every night.

656
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,880
It's a good idea.

657
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,680
I would know that I'm not late.

658
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Fine.

659
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,080
What are you doing?

660
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,320
Nothing.

661
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,600
I'm just listening to you.

662
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,800
Why are you hiding from me?

663
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,120
You stepped on my shadow.

664
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Fine.

665
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
I'll go back.

666
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,080
You step on me.

667
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,120
I still have something to do.

668
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
I'm going to go back.

669
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,720
I still have something to do.

670
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm going to go.

671
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,040
Is Guo Qing home?

672
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,560
Is the promotion department busy?

673
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,840
It's a bit late.

674
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,240
You can go home.

675
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,200
After Guo Qing came back,

676
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,800
the school's competition hasn't been arranged yet.

677
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,360
There are basketball games,

678
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,160
photography games, and painting exhibition.

679
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,440
We haven't changed the poster of the promotion department.

680
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,040
There are some short video promotion and editing.

681
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,720
We haven't finished it yet.

682
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,800
If you don't go home,

683
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,840
I want to talk about Guo Qing's overtime.

684
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Can you?

685
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,960
Then leave the key to me.

686
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
I'll go with you.

687
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,520
After that, I'll invite you to watch the Lian Youjia concert.

688
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,160
No.

689
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,480
I'm coming back with Guo Qing.

690
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,640
I have to accompany her.

691
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,120
I might not be able to work overtime.

692
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,880
What about the concert?

693
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,360
Actually,

694
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,480
I added you to the letter

695
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,880
because you have a special image of me.

696
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,600
I thought he changed his name.

697
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,800
I didn't plan to date him.

698
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,720
Your image is very similar.

699
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,040
Is that guy from high school?

700
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Yes.

701
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,440
What kind of person is he?

702
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,240
He broke up with her.

703
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
He's not black?

704
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,320
He's a soul.

705
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,240
I'm sorry.

706
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,320
I'm sorry.

707
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm sorry.

708
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,320
I'm sorry.

709
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm sorry.

710
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
I'm sorry.

711
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
I'm sorry.

712
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
I'm sorry.

713
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
I'm sorry.

714
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
I'm sorry.

715
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
I'm sorry.

716
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm sorry.

717
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
I'm sorry.

718
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
I'm sorry.

719
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
I'm sorry.

720
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
I'm sorry.

721
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
I'm sorry.

722
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
I'm sorry.

723
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
I'm sorry.

724
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
I'm sorry.

725
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
I'm sorry.

726
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
I'm sorry.

727
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I'm sorry.

728
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
I'm sorry.

729
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
I'm sorry.

730
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I'm sorry.

731
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
I'm sorry.

732
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
I'm sorry.

733
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
I'm sorry.

734
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,520
I'm sorry.

735
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,280
I'm sorry.

736
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,880
I'm sorry.

737
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
I'm sorry.

738
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,680
Where did you got your lucky starPLY for?

739
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,120
모칠ade

740
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,040
How many more to go?

741
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,240
Can we finish the tonight?

742
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
You have no choice.

743
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,840
Because we have to finish this.

744
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,400
There's too much propaganda Department.

745
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,080
We can't study unless we do.

746
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,560
It's okay.

747
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,360
I can laquelle made for you.

748
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,880
We defeat Tian Ming

749
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
I don't know how to play the role of a student.

750
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
You are so anxious.

751
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
What do you know?

752
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
My name is

753
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Ice Horse Wei Dong, Liang Cao Xian Xin.

754
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Come on, let's play a game.

755
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Cheers.

756
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Come on.

757
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Put this in the finance room later.

758
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Hello, dad.

759
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
Nice.

760
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
It's fast.

761
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
You're the one who's going to shoot this time.

762
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Look at me.

763
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Xiaocheng is going to leave the company.

764
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
But the work is still serious.

765
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
If you can do this to her,

766
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
can't our company

767
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
be a big hit?

768
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Yes.

769
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Xiaocheng,

770
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
the company lacks a talent like you.

771
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
Welcome back.

772
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
If there's any work to be done,

773
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
I'll look for you first.

774
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Thank you, boss.

775
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,880
But the project's salary is still to be paid for.

776
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
And my supplementary fee is 500 yuan.

777
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Here, take this.

778
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Thank you.

779
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Okay.

780
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
Good morning.

781
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Good morning.

782
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Good morning.

783
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Good morning.

784
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
Take care.

785
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Thank you.

786
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Okay.

787
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Jia Ying, you're welcome.

788
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Who is it?

789
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
What a long face.

790
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Do you believe in the news?

791
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
You're so funny.

792
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Are you having a rest?

793
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Are you happy?

794
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Help me put my luggage down.

795
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm so tired.

796
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
No.

797
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
How did you know this place?

798
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
You remember the sound checkup

799
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
you gave me?

800
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
I remember it.

801
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
I remember it.

802
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
You forgot it?

803
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
The living room is in a good mood.

804
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm here to go to Beijing City.

805
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
I didn't tell you.

806
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
I'm giving you a surprise.

807
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
A surprise?

808
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Hurry up and call Xu Zhi.

809
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I pretended to be selling it.

810
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
I'm going to get him.

811
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
Call him Zhen Er?

812
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
No.

813
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
No.

814
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
What's wrong with that?

815
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
It's just that it's not working.

816
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
What's wrong?

817
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Drink some water.

818
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Come on.

819
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
The soup is noodles.

820
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Come on.

821
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
You... You're in love?

822
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
You... You...

823
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
No.

824
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

825
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
No.

826
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
I'm not suitable here.

827
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
Why?

828
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
You're not coming back?

829
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Hurry up.

830
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
He didn't tell me.

831
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Hurry up.

832
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Why are you not closing the door?

833
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
Zhu Yanqian.

834
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Zhu Yanqian.

835
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,880
Chen Luzhou.

836
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Cai Yanye.

837
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
Shouldn't you be abroad?

838
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880
When you go back to Beijing City,

839
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
don't tell Xu Zhi.

840
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
How could that be?

841
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
We've been friends for a lifetime.

842
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
We have no secrets.

843
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
Cai Yanye.

844
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Don't tell him.

845
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
I'll tell him when the time is right.

846
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Okay.

847
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
You'd better hurry up.

848
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,880
I can't hold it.

849
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
Thanks.

850
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,880
Since I helped you,

851
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
you can help me, too.

852
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Me?

853
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Okay.

854
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
No.

855
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Thanks.

856
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
You asked me out of the blue.

857
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
I didn't do anything else.

858
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
You didn't?

859
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Didn't you wake up last time?

860
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
I was just asking you out.

861
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Can you give me a hug?

862
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Hug me.

863
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
Hug me.

864
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
Hug me.

865
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
I'll hug you.

866
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Are you okay?

867
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
Are you okay?

868
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Zhifang.

869
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
Yingying.

870
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
It hurts.

871
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
Stop acting.

872
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
I'm going to give you a surprise.

873
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
I'm so upset.

874
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
Can I not be hurt?

875
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Let's go.

876
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
Let's go.

877
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
You're leaving me?

878
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
You're taking me as a human.

879
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
Mr. Zhi, you don't know

880
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,880
that the days of the poison are not over.

881
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
It's even bitter than the third.

882
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Really?

883
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Didn't you have a good time?

884
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
You're really good at talking.

885
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
I didn't tell you that

886
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Tanxu and I are a couple.

887
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
How is he?

888
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Not good.

889
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
The last time I tested him,

890
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
he was rude.

891
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
His parents came to school

892
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
and scolded him a lot.

893
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
He was so stubborn.

894
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
He was so stubborn.

895
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Is he still capable of doing this?

896
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
So,

897
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
the person who hates is the one who is pitiful.

898
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
You still hurt?

899
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
I'm much better now.

900
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
Didn't I have a foot injury?

901
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
My roommate suddenly brought me a bag of medicine.

902
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
I said I didn't know who gave it to me.

903
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
I saw that there were many key-eyes in it.

904
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
I thought about it.

905
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
Other than you and Xu Zhi Dao,

906
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
my wife is sick.

907
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
I've talked to Chen Lu Zhou.

908
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
I thought she went back to Beijing.

909
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
I was so worried.

910
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
I didn't know she was going back.

911
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Mr. Zhi, actually...

912
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
The secret agent.

913
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
What is it?

914
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Actually, I've seen a word on the Internet.

915
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
It's

916
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
that people who want to see

917
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Guan Shan Chong Chong

918
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
will always see him.

919
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,880
So, you and Chen Lu Zhou

920
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
will definitely see him.

921
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
I didn't say I wanted to see him.

922
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
By the way,

923
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
I've sent you my new number.

924
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
You've changed your phone number?

925
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Didn't you say

926
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Chen Lu Zhou was worried about you

927
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
at night?

928
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
So you haven't changed your number?

929
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I've sent it to you.

930
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Who wants to contact me

931
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,880
at this age?

932
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Who is not happy?

933
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
What do you mean?

934
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Didn't you tell Chen Lu Zhou

935
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
your new number?

936
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
No.

937
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
No need to.

938
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
It's okay.

939
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
I'll call you when I get home.

940
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Okay.

941
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Let Chen Lu Zhou

942
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
be quick.

943
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Mr. Zhi is going to forget.

944
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,080
Xiaodai,

945
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,680
Xiaodai,

946
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,880
can you eat right now?

947
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
No one is here.

948
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
So, you...

949
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
Chen Lu Zhou?

950
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,880
Ke Ke?

951
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
You...

952
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880
You...

953
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Why are you here?

954
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
I live here.

955
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
You...

956
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
I...

957
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
You also live here?

958
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,720
I live here.

959
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,840
You... I...

960
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,440
I...

961
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,240
You live here, too.

962
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,760
What's going on?

963
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,320
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

964
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
What do you mean?

965
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,600
Nothing.

966
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,680
I've participated in a big project.

967
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,320
I'm managing the company.

968
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,440
What's the big deal?

969
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,400
What's wrong with your brain?

970
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,600
Wait.

971
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,400
You brat.

972
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
You came to Huada and didn't inform me in advance.

973
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,680
You're too much.

974
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,200
I was wrong.

975
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,920
Have you eaten?

976
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,840
I need to clean up.

977
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
What are you talking about?

978
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,560
Go.

979
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,840
There's no food in the kitchen.

980
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,400
Go.

981
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,040
Hurry up.

982
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,360
The report is on the school.

983
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,720
I've told you.

984
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,040
Guo Qingjie is taking you.

985
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,720
On the way to the second floor,

986
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,120
many people are looking for him.

987
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,840
So handsome.

988
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,480
Xuezhi.

989
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,160
Come on.

990
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,320
I saw Liu Yisi and Shuai.

991
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,040
Shuai?

992
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,400
How handsome.

993
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,200
So handsome.

994
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,840
All the girls in the cafeteria

995
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,440
were fighting with him secretly.

996
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,720
The little flower in the outer room

997
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,400
was still active on WeChat.

998
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I heard it's a business management department.

999
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,240
We'll move the class of Professor Wang tomorrow.

1000
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,680
We'll move them together.

1001
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,280
It'll be a big deal.

1002
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,520
You two are so annoying.

1003
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,760
You're not afraid of the people in the room.

1004
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,000
You can't stay up all night.

1005
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,800
Einstein said

1006
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,160
that looking at Shuai is good for your health.

1007
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
That's a big advantage for learning.

1008
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,320
Really?

1009
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
You haven't eaten yet?

1010
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,360
I've eaten.

1011
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,080
I'll drive.

1012
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,200
You can go to the second floor.

1013
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,920
Shuai,

1014
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,960
where should you go for dinner?

1015
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
The second floor is good.

1016
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,400
There's a table for rice.

1017
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,480
What table for rice?

1018
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,400
There's Shuai.

1019
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,920
Really?

1020
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,760
Why are you so shameless?

1021
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
You're so stupid.

1022
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,320
The food is delicious.

1023
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,880
I'll tell you when we're on the line.

1024
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,200
Okay.

1025
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,840
I'll go to save him.

1026
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,560
Xu Zhi.

1027
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Professor Wang.

1028
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
I'm so tired.

1029
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
I'm so tired.

1030
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
I'm so tired.

1031
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
I'm so tired.

1032
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
I'm so tired.

1033
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
I'm so tired.

1034
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,160
I'm so tired.

1035
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,160
I'm so tired.

1036
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
I'm so tired.

1037
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
I'm so tired.

1038
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,160
I'm so tired.

1039
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
I'm so tired.

1040
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
I'm so tired.

1041
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
I'm so tired.

1042
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
I'm so tired.

1043
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
I'm so tired.

1044
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,160
I'm so tired.

1045
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
I'm so tired.

1046
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
I'm so tired.

1047
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
I'm so tired.

1048
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
I'm so tired.

1049
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
I'm so tired.

1050
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
I'm so tired.

1051
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
I'm so tired.

1052
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,160
I'm so tired.

1053
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
I'm so tired.

1054
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
I'm so tired.

1055
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
I'm so tired.

1056
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
I'm so tired.

1057
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
I'm so excited

1058
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
I can't wait to see you

1059
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,160
I'm so excited

1060
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
Is the porridge tasty?

1061
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
I'm so excited

1062
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,360
You love me all the way

1063
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,360
I don't know you

1064
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,360
What's your relationship with Chen Zhezhou?

1065
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,360
He...

1066
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,160
He's my older brother, Chen Zhezhou

1067
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Okay, let's keep it a secret

1068
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
After all, Chen Zhezhou is still in Europe

1069
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,160
Xu Zhi

1070
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
I'm so excited

1071
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
I can't wait to see you

1072
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
I'm so excited

1073
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
I can't wait to see you

1074
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
I'm so excited

1075
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
I can't wait to see you

1076
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
I'm so excited

1077
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
I can't wait to see you

1078
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
I'm so excited

1079
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
I can't wait to see you

1080
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
I'm so excited

1081
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
I can't wait to see you

1082
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
I'm so excited

1083
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,160
I can't wait to see you

1084
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
In the middle of the night

1085
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,160
I can't stop chasing

1086
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,160
I don't know if I'm hurt

1087
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,160
I don't care about the future

1088
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,160
You are the one

1089
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,160
You are the one

1090
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,160
I'm the one

1091
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,560
I want myself to go into you

1092
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,760
go into you
