Seeing you take care of everything on your own, I was proud.

My Ma Ha... doing everything on your own

492
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,880
must have been lonely.

493

Every once in a while, I thought that I wanted to be an only child to have all of the love.

But mom, are you not tired?

Miss Newlywed, I've laid the blanket out for you, so hurry off and sleep.

Why is he out like that without going back?

519
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,890
It's colder because it is near the sea.

520
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,940
Should I have brought a blanket?

521

655
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,620
Ryeok! You were careful when driving this, right?

656
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,960
Following the speed limits?

657
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,070
I'm not going to get any tickets from you speeding or not following other laws, right?

658
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,500
You know, right?

659
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,680
I've been taking care of you without scratching you once.

660
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,870
I hope you didn't scratch My Star, too.

661
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,450
Why aren't you answering?

662
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:35,850
Hyung.

663
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,950
What?

664
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,450
I want to date publicly.

665
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,680
Are you crazy? Public relationship?

666
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,890
Aren't you out of your mind?

667
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,050
What did you just say?

668
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,950
This is a big bomb.

669
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:50,960
Public relationship?

670
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,560
You're nuts. You're totally nuts.

671
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,270
I had a strange feeling since Kwon Ryeok came to the café.

672
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:05,230
I'm sorry for making the situation like this. I was afraid of affecting SHAX's image.

673
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:10,630
So I did hold back my feelings for quite some time, but I can't hold back anymore.

674
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:13,510
Please understand me this once.

675
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,000
I know. I know I'm being selfish,

676
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,240
but I just can't do this anymore.

677
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,360
Please understand me this once.

678
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,640
Hyung.

679
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,870
I don't want to date her while fooling you and Fins.

680
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:34,410
That is why I thought of this. This is the best method.

681
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,900
- Public relationship.
- Hey! You crazy fool.

682
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,960
Yes, let's reveal everything.

683
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,400
Since this is for SHAX, let's reveal it all.

684
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,300
Yes, reveal it. Let's reveal everything.

685
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,320
Cool down.

686
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,110
Why didn't you tell me first?

687
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,860
I'm sorry.

688
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,650
Don't forget it's going well!

689
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,030
I am this team's leader.

690
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:09,340
You should have consulted with me before dropping such a big bomb.

691
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,240
I'm sorry.

692
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,970
I know how hard you are working for SHAX.

693
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:18,750
That is exactly why it was hard for me to tell you.

694
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,200
Please trust me this once.

695
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,790
I will make sure it doesn't affect SHAX.

696
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:27,610
I don't want to lose you just like we lost Eun Jo.

697
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:32,140
SHAX is going to go all the way.

698
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:36,800
Ahn Jae Woo, why are you dragging Eun Jo into this?

699
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,940
I will do anything within my power for the team.

700
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,030
Will you be alright?

701
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,640
I'm also scared after holding hands with him.

702
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,700
I'm more aware of reality this time, compared to the last time.

703
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:26,010
But I don't want to fool

704
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,060
myself and others.

705
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,370
What will we do now?

706
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,880
You guys don't have anything to lose, isn't it?

707
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,580
No, that's not what we mean.

708
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,110
I understand your feelings.

709
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:47,660
I do, but this isn't the right timing.

710
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,410
We need a solution.

711
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,570
You guys are making me exhausted.

712
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,430
Guys, I am busy.

713
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:59,040
I even have to look around for a good company, and I have lots of work to do.

714
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,840
I have to release a song and promote it soon.

715
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,820
When will you give me my song?

716
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,700
It's settled that we will be the only ones knowing,

717
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,380
and they won't go public about their relationship.

718
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,610
You all agree, right?

719
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,710
Then where do they meet?

720
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:16,830
What if we don't let them meet?

721
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,860
The guy would be in straight mode.
(T/N: only looking straight ahead)

722
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:23,420
So you guys are worried that they will get caught by the sasaeng fans like last time.

723
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,890
They can't go to popular places.

724
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:26,780
They can't go to parks or mountains either.

725
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,670
They will take care of it themselves.

726
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,650
No!

727
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,820
That will make it easier for them to get caught.

728
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,540
Anyway, I'm not going to care.

729
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,830
Since earlier, why are you watching a fire from across the river?
(T/N: acting as a spectator in the situation)

730
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,330
Then what should I do? Get them a hotel room?

731
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,600
Hotel room? Hell no!

732
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,770
What hotel suddenly?

733
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,080
They will take care

734
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,950
of it anyway.

735
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,320
We will have the hardest time.

736
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,540
Hey! You guys, seriously.

737
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,960
Have you guys not dated before? The safest hideout is your dorms.

738
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,570
- Dorms?
- Is your dorm ok or not?

739
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:53,500
Definitely not.

740
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,030
There are so many eyes there.

741
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:57,650
No, no. I will feel uncomfortable.

742
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,590
How about you guys?

743
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:02,160
What? The thing is...

00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,450
Our neighborhood can be considered silent.

Oh, no!

These are all pictures of me practicing.

750
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,780
I did practice a lot.

751
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:31,320
We also ate food and drank coffee here, it's all nice but

752
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,330
why are my eyes stinging?

753

Ah, Sunbaenim. There is something I have to get from you.

They're all cute.

Where did I see her before?

758
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,860
Why don't you sit down if you're not here for an inspection?

759
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,170
But who is she?

Annie?

762
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,450
She was one of the original members of Omega III.

763
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,970
Ma Ha came in after Annie left.

What is wrong?

It's strange that you suddenly left like that and that you were asking questions about Annie.

01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,070
- It's the same.
- It's been three years already.
