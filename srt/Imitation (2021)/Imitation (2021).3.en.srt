♫ Lalala, even though it's a repeating pattern ♫

5
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,000
♫ Lalala, I’m letting it go. What did you do yesterday? ♫

6
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,370
Wow! That was a great performance by Shax's youngest.

7
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,330
Alright! Idol Outing's official introduction time.

8
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,020
Let's continue. Next up is Third Eye's Yoo Ji!

9
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,490
Hello! I'm Third Eye's leader Yoo Ji. Please look after me kindly!

10
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,610
Ma Ha. You don't have to do this.

11
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,820
I'm okay.

12
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,480
I have to do my best on behalf of Lia and Hyun Ji. And for Tea Party.

13
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,190
Thank you!

14
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,870
Thank you for your hard work.

15
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:14,600
Our last introduction. A rookie appearing on Idol Outing for the first time.

16
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,930
It never crossed my mind that this person would have a younger sister!

17
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,950
La Ri Ma's younger sister, Lee Ma Ha! Please come out!

18
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,400
Hello! I'm La Ri Ma's younger sister, La Ri Ma Ha!

19
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,350
Today, I'll try to imitate my sister

20
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,000
properly.

21
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,380
Play the music!

22
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,330
♫ It’s me, it’s me La Ri Ma ♫

27
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,330
Will you help me Sunbae-nim?

28
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,710
She has held her hand out for help.

29
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,680
Will he take her hand?

30
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,270
Will he!? Will he take her hand?

31
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,230
Don't do it. Don't do it.

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,200
He took her hand!

33
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,190
Why is he acting like that today?

34
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,140
♫ It’s me, it’s me La Ri Ma ♫

39
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,540
Really! This was a performance that will be remembered on Idol Outing!

40
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,300
Did you two practice beforehand?

41
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,910
No.

42
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,940
It's such a great song.

43
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,720
A great song?

44
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,130
Thank you.

45
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,570
Ah, okay.

46
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,570
This was Lee Ma Ha from Tea Party, who will always be happy.

47
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,620
Thank you!

48
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,810
This was Idol Outing! See you next week!

49
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,990
Okay! Cut!

50
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,930
Great job, everyone!

51
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,610
You've worked hard!

52
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,710
You've worked hard!

53
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,210
Great job today.

54
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,040
You've worked hard today.

55
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,120
Ryeok.

56
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,590
It's been a while.

57
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,740
Ryeok!

58
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,210
Let's grab a drink next time.

59
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,110
Let's go.

60
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,890
Okay.

61
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,040
- Great work today!
- Great work today!

62
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,770
Why isn't he picking up?

63
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,280
Ryeok, the car is right outside. Give me five minutes!

64
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,740
What? Hyung!

65
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,340
Good job today!

66
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,700
It was so hectic.

67
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,320
You were the best, in my opinion. You did really well.

68
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,280
Let's go.

69
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,190
PD-nim! PD-nim!

70
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,860
Can you edit the opening dance part?

71
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,440
It came out pretty good, though.

72
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,240
It wasn't something Ryeok would normally do, and it wasn't part of the script.

73
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,420
Please!

74
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,880
Sunbae-nim!

75
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,860
You asked if the only thing I could do is imitate.

76
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm just doing the best that I can in my current position.

77
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,350
Although it might not look much to you.

78
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,170
You surprised me.

79
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,060
What was that?

80
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,460
What was what?

81
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,950
When did you get here?

82
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,720
Before she said, "Sunbae-nim!"

83
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,140
What is it?

84
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,520
Go in.

85
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,770
Let's see.

86
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,890
It is our padding!

87
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,790
Will you help me Sunbae-nim?

88
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,380
I got stomped all over

89
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,520
by a mere copycat!

90
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,120
- Can you go by yourself?
- Yes.

91
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,550
I can go with my eyes closed.

92
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,440
You worked really hard today.

93
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,070
You've worked hard today.

94
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,750
Get home safely.

95
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,830
Drive safely.

96
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,080
- Yoo Jin.
- What's with the long face?

97
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,180
Shouldn't you not be out?

98
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,070
How were you able to come out?

99
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,420
It's my last outing before our comeback.

100
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,700
Before your comeback.

101
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,790
Comeback? Really?

102
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,110
We received a song today.

103
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,720
Congratulations!

104
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
Things are going to be hectic from now on.

105
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,430
The last album didn't too well, so it'll be tougher this time around.

106
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,040
You know it's hard to continue if you don't have a hit song by your third year.

107
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,920
Are you trying to show off?

108
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,800
I didn't mean to...

109
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,870
Why are you scared?

110
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,290
How are things for you guys?

111
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,730
Not yet. Apparently, we'll be receiving a song soon, so we'll just have to be patient.

112
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,130
You'll get a lot of good songs.

113
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,080
Of course, it's our album.

114
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,580
How was the shoot today?

115
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,270
Tact, tension, fear,

116
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,310
embarrassment,

117
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,880
surprise.

118
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,050
Among those, excitement and joy.

119
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,910
Excitement and joy?

120
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,270
Yoo Jin! I danced with a star today.

121
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,160
A star?

122
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,580
La Ri Ma?

123
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,620
No.

124
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,150
A brighter star, one that is hard to approach.

125
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,760
A star that's hard to approach?

126
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,550
I don't know! Watch it when it airs.

127
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,430
Aren't I taking too much of your time?

128
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,030
- No.
- Don't overdo it.

129
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,550
Make sure to keep the path to music shows clean! I'll follow right behind you.

130
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,180
Alright, hurry and follow.

131
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,590
- I'm not doing it, I'm not doing it.
- You just have to do it here.

132
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,820
It's fine.

133
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,180
Unni is here!

134
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,790
Ma Ha!

135
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,420
Did the recording go well? What was the atmosphere like?

136
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,340
Sunbae-nim La Ri Ma was there, too, wasn't she? I heard she's terrifying. Was it okay?

137
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,030
I was worried she might say something to you.

138
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,890
Why would she say anything? What did Ma Ha do?

139
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,620
You know. I'm La Ri Ma's younger sister, La Ri Ma Ha!

140
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,230
Forget it. Don't worry about it.

141
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,730
What are they saying?

142
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,330
They told me I was really good, and for me to imitate her more!

143
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,020
I completely flexed on them.

144
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,750
La Ri Ma Ha flex!

145
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,120
Well, our Ma Ha really is a good dancer.

146
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,830
I don't know. I don't know if I did well or not.

147
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,660
But I did do my best.

148
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,450
Check it when it airs!

149
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,490
Say something!

150
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,980
Say what?

151
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,100
So

152
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,300
the padding you gave last time was this?

153
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,840
You saw it too, Hyung.

154
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,140
You're crazy! How many times did I tell you to be careful!

155
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,010
How could you give this to anyone?

156
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,030
- Hyung!
- Blood is going to come out of Ryeok Hyung's ears.

157
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,920
- What is it?
- Look at this!

158
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,390
It's our sixth anniversary padded jacket.

159
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,170
It's obvious that this is the jacket from Shax's fans.

160
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,450
If you don't look at it carefully, you wouldn't be able to tell.

161
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,040
Hyung asked for the logo to be smaller because it would look tacky if it were bigger.

162
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,430
As if it's barely there. That's all about fashion.

163
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,930
But still, giving this away at the filming site.

164
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,780
Alright, I'm sorry. I was wrong. Let's end it here.
