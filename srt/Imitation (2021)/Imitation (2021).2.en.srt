[Episode 2]

3
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,860
Sorry to bother you, but how can I get to town from here?

4
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,200
It's a bit far.

5
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,320
You need to head straight that way.

6
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,660
Thank you.

7
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,290
Thank you for your hard work today.

8
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,110
- Thank you for your hard work today.
- Goodbye.

9
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,630
You met a bad owner, and now you're suffering, too.

10
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Let's go.

11
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,720
See you tomorrow.

12
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,630
Okay, see you tomorrow.

13
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,160
Everybody always leaves work so quickly.

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,590
- Hyung.
- What?

15
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,180
The number got leaked again.

16
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,760
It hasn't even been six months.

17
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm tired.

18
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,570
I'll buy you a new one. Let's go.

19
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,290
You need to rest up for your interview tomorrow morning.

20
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,010
- Thank you.
- Get in.

21
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,630
Okay.

22
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,450
Put on your seatbelt, Ryeok.

23
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,280
What's that?

24
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,850
Hyung, what was that just now?

25
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,770
I heard there are a lot of ghosts around here.

26
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,040
What kind of ghosts?

27
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,360
You get out and check. Go, quickly.

28
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,840
You're the manager, Hyung.

29
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,510
Ryeok! You make more money than me.

30
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,140
Quick, check now.

31
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,900
What? Is something there?

32
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,290
I don't see anything.

33
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,840
Really?

34
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,350
Why? Why?!

35
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,600
There is something.

36
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,960
- It's that kid.
- What are you saying?

37
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,620
The kisaeng you stabbed to death today!

38
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,590
I heard that a manager ran off without his actor. Was that her manager?

39
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,600
What are you talking about?

40
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,570
The manager ran away.

41
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,460
I've heard of managers leaving their van and abandoning a nutcase actor,

42
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,840
but a manager taking the van with him is a first.

43
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,400
Hyung.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,170
Back up.

45
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,790
- To give her a ride? We can't!
- Why not?

46
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,170
You know the company policy. No.

47
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,680
Hyung.

48
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,650
Hello.

49
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,730
- Get in.
- What?

50
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,580
Oh, I am fine.

51
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,190
The town is just over that hill. It won't take long.

52
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,060
Right, so get in.

53
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,820
I'm in the industry, too. I know you can't just let people into the van.

54
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,880
I don't want to complicate matters for you over such a small thing.

55
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,650
Thank you so much for the offer.

56
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,810
Goodbye.

57
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,880
You might be fine now, but you'll catch a cold once the sweat dries!

58
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,510
If you're doing this

59
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,490
because of what happened before, you really don't need to be concerned.

60
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,930
I just want to take a walk, so you should go your way, too.

61
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,780
Try hard.

62
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,370
What, did he know?

63
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,700
It's cold!

64
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,890
Do you know Stevie Wonder?
[Seven years ago]

65
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,980
"I Just Called to Say I Love You."

66
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,330
He's my dad's favorite singer.

67
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,940
We saw Stevie Wonder on TV once.

68
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,390
He's blind, but he writes music and sings.

69
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,290
On that show, he said,

70
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,530
"We all have our abilities.

71
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,890
The only difference is that

72
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,390
some people use those abilities, and some don't."

73
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,740
My dad heard that and said to me,

74
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,550
"Ma Ha,

75
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,010
I hope you live like him."

76
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,210
So that's why you suddenly showed up and asked to join our team?

77
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,910
Yes.

78
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,780
That's why I want to move to Seoul.

79
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,420
I don't think he'd let you do that.

80
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,560
Dad, you'll let me, right?

81
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,690
You can't really see the stars in Seoul,

82
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,010
because of all the lights.

83
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,400
That's kind of lame.

84
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,010
There are so many stars.

85
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,360
How long have you known?

86
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,660
Since you started avoiding me.

87
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,510
No, I wasn't avoiding you—

88
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,970
Keep following behind me.

89
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,900
Okay.

90
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,850
If anything seems off, Hyung will race over here.

91
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,660
This is me.

92
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,300
It's still cold.

93
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,560
Is this really where you needed to go?

94
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,480
Yes, I know where to go from here.

95
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,670
My friend is coming.

96
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,790
You might as well have given her a ride.

97
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,690
She didn't want to, and there's the company policy, too.

98
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,900
You know I always follow the company's orders.

99
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,920
Never mind.

100
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,610
Idiot!

101
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,560
- Hyung.
- Yes?

102
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,930
- Let's slow down a little.
- Okay.

103
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,110
What is that?

104
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,670
Lee Ma Ha!

105
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,890
Oh, so there was a reason.

106
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,540
What happened?

107
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,670
- Lee Yoo Jin?
- Are you hurt anywhere?

108
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,120
No, I am not, but what are you doing here?

109
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,900
That's a relief.

110
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,930
Hyung, I am tired.

111
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,790
- Let's go quickly.
- Okay.

112
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,550
Why did you come?

113
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,230
Hello, Yoo Jin? I can't reach Ma Ha.

114
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,920
She may be in the middle of filming. Maybe she did not see it.

115
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,800
I cannot get a hold of her manager either. It's just weird. Nothing's wrong, right?

116
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,780
Hang up for now.

117
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,490
[Ma Ha]

118
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,130
[Ma Ha]

119
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,900
[Ma Ha]

120
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,600
A movie shoot just came up, so I'm on my way to Mungyeong.

121
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,990
Were you that worried about me?

122
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,590
I can only rely on my friend.

123
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,730
- My soulmate.
- It's so far.

124
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,460
How could you walk around there by yourself at night?

125
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,690
I just ran.

126
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,130
The wind was nice and it felt good.

127
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,770
And there were a lot of stars.

128
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,600
Did you not have even one person to ride back with?

129
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,100
There was...

130
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,960
But I thought I wouldn't be comfortable riding in that car.

131
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,530
I really feel comfortable with you, Yu Jin.

132
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,600
Anyway, what's wrong with your manager?

133
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,930
How could he just leave you by yourself and run away?

134
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,660
Report him right away! You should not let people like him off the hook.

135
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,730
He may cause trouble elsewhere.

136
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,100
Nevermind. I was the one who held onto him.

137
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,080
And he's not that bad a person.

138
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,770
He must be feeling very sorry right now.

139
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,900
Hey, but what are you going to do if you are found out?

140
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,870
It's fine.

141
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,230
Just sleep. You must be tired.

142
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,150
Shall I?

143
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,560
[Shax]

144
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,730
Shax?

145
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,360
When did we arrive? You should have woken me up.

146
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,560
Hyun Ji, you're here, too.

147
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,900
They said they could not get in touch with you, so I was worried.

148
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,530
Are you all right?

149
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,040
Yes, I am fine.

150
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,900
Yu Jin, you are going to be late. Go back quickly!

151
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,960
Okay, you worked really hard. Just rest up.

152
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,800
Okay.

153
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,990
Thank you so much, and drive carefully on your way back.

154
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,830
Go safely.

155
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,110
Let's go.

156
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,110
Where did you go all night after stealing your manager's car?

157
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,990
- I'm sorry.
- I don't care that you are sorry. Just tell me where you were!

158
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,140
Did you go see a girl?

159
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,120
Wow, that silence seems to be agreement.

160
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,370
Why? Do you think you can just go out like that because we don't have any fans coming to see us?!

161
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,860
Do you think the others are stuck here because they have nowhere else to be?!

162
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,370
I won't ever do anything like this again. I am sorry.

163
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,970
You, get a grip on yourself.

164
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,870
Do you or do you not know that we have to risk everything for our comeback this time?

165
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,100
If we don't get good results this time, I don't know what will happen to Sparkling.

166

Let's just go in now. Head in.

167

- Hyun Oh, you should also stop.
- That bastard.

168
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,690
He pretends to be obedient all by himself.

169
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,500
But where did he really go?

170
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,430
Weren't you scared?

171
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,960
I told you, right?

172
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,760
That guy reeks of betrayal just by looking at his profile.

173

You also should have stormed out like us earlier.

174

I knew from the beginning that this would be a hit or miss.

175

Just...

177

I just wanted to hold onto that thread tightly.

178

I felt like I would lose it forever if I did not hold on to it.

179

I can't believe that he just left someone at the filming site and ran away.

180

While coming down the mountain,

181
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,160
do you know what I was sad about and scared of the most?

182
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,780
That the thread I was barely holding onto...

183
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,370
got severed again.

184
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,970
I finally realized my place.

185
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,770
That place that I had dreamed of

186
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,020
showed up so close as if I could catch it.

187
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,640
But I could not get any closer to it.

188
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,050
I kept on turning back for some reason.

189
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,610
So I felt worse.

190
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,050
I think this is it.

191
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,950
I decided while I was on my way back.

192
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,960
I am going to let go of my dream now.

193

I think I did everything I could do.

194
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,590
I want to prepare for the GED (qualification examination).

Lia, why do want to quit?

203
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,820
I worked part time, singing at a festival yesterday.

204
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,430
I was sad for no reason. Reality hit me suddenly.

205
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,410
When I was young,

206
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,380
I went from this house to that house,

207
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,830
singing songs at every party in our neighborhood.

208
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,240
And until now, I was still singing at someone else's party.

209
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,990
I wondered if I worked that hard to be doing this now. I was so ashamed.

210
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,520
True, I am going to quit, too.

211
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,570
I heard people say I was pretty since I was little.

212
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,000
So I thought I was actually pretty,

213
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,460
but there were goddesses (pretty women) everywhere.

214
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,690
I guess the time when I acted all high and mighty because of that,

215
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,790
was the end of my golden years.

Hello. Nice to meet you.

227
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,510
Mr. Kwon Ryeok, are you filming a new historical movie?

228
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,030
Yes, I had a lot of worries, as this is the first historical movie I filmed.

229
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,690
So with a rookie mindset,

230
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,080
I am practicing hard and putting my all into the filming.

231
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,800
I am curious about what kind of new look you will show.

232
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Please visit the movie theatre and see that for yourself.

Then finally, please tell us how you feel about Shax's sixth anniversary.

When we are separate, we are lacking and full of flaws,

236
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,080
but when we are together, we fill in the gaps and we can last for the next 10 or 20 years...

He must be a scammer, just lying about NOG and Shax.

330

shall we just go in?

332
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,990
I'm going in because you are pitiful.

Nice to meet you.

341
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:15,510
I am JH entertainment's CEO and the owner of this cafe, Ji Hak.

Since you're all here, can we start once you're ready?

Can we perform together?

344
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,960
The audition is just an excuse. We came to make a memory.

345

We didn't debut. We were close to it.

353
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,990
There was an accident the day we were supposed to debut.

354
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,780
That you were forced to go down when you were doing your rehearsal for the music show?

355
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,920
Yes, I know that too.

356
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,880
It's become so difficult to put young people out there.

368
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,500
Stories like these work these days.

369

Even you know that their capability fills just a page.

370

Not obviously practiced smiles... but barefaced kids.

395
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,660
I am scared because this opportunity came without a single warning.

396
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,790
Is the role of an entertainment agency CEO,

397
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:18,250
one where you can have two jobs wearing an apron and serving in the neighborhood coffee shop?

398
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,340
True, it does not look like he has any part-timers either.

399
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,620
Yeah, that means that he has no money, right?

400
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,650
But when we were auditioning,

401
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,820
there was something in the way his eyes looked.

402
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,130
That I acknowledge.

403
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,910
But did you all fall for it?

Anyway, we are not going to do it. Shall we have fun putting forth some tough conditions for the contract?

409
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,320
Well, because you want us to work together...

410
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,460
We will put forth our condition.

415
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,690
At the same time when entering into a contract with us?

416
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,120
Does this make sense?

417
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,350
It's the minimum hourly wage right now,

418
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,960
but after we make a profit from your activities, I will distribute it according to what is written in the contract.

419
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,280
That does not make any sense.

420
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,450
Are you a fraud or something?

421
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,040

Are there really no restrictions on using smartphones, going out, or dating?

426

I am sure you all know they are things you can't really prevent even if you try to.

427
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,700
But actions have to have consequences.

428

Even so, does this make sense?

It's just that we have heard clauses like this for the first time. But it does make sense.

I only have that much to pay you salaries.

442
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:07,600
And if you don't see any hope after this time, we can break off the contract without any repercussions.

443
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,320
What if we do well?

444
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,700
Then we have to redraw the contract, coming to an understanding of each other's conditions.

Of course, only when both parties want to.

504

They're still idols, so they should at least release a song before they appear on TV.

We get a monthly salary.

550
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,750
When I was a trainee I had more than one part-time job.

551
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,400
We had to do many part-time jobs when we were trainees.

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,390
Singing at weddings, working at shops, and even doing deliveries.

It's nice that we don't have to do all that and that we can just practice.

If it's not rude of me, can you tell us about your salary?

555
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,820
It is ₩1,822,480 (around 1,822 dollars).

556
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,350
It's minimum wage.

557
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,930
Isn't it the first time that there is such a contract?

558
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,320
Actually, people don't talk about this but the money invested in trainees

559
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,650
is also counted as debt in many places.

Does he have a lot of money?

565
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:07,060
No. Our CEO is definitely not rich.

[Happy Time 3 p.m.]

652
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,150
Three years ago and now,

653
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,780
appearance fees haven't changed at all.

654
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:53,980
But still, you did your best.

655
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,790
So how much did we earn?

656
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,390
What?

657
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,460
That is–

658
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,330
Oh, how much is it?

659
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:08,940
Your debut broadcast at Sisa People earned 187,600 won ($166).

660
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,300
Because 6 p.m. Hometown was filmed in the countryside, 288,600 won.

661
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:18,890
He and I was also filmed in the countryside, so 252,000 won.

662
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,620
Can you give us a salary if we earn this much?

663
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,290
We should do events to earn money.

664

"Why does she keep copying La Ri Ma?"

665
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:49,240
"Someone who goes by other artist's songs, you're just a copycat."

666
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,390
Ah, seriously!

667
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,410
If it's going to bother you, don't look at it.

668
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,290
I'm looking at it because it bothers me.

669
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:01,570
At first, everyone said it was fun.

670
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,590
Are you going to speak casually from now on?

671
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,520
They keep calling us "copy-idols." It is impossible not to look at them.

672
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,280
If you don't have the confidence to not look at them, why don't you study the mean comments?

673
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,690
Look at the mean comments and the things you cannot change with your will and actions, disregard them.

674
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:21,430
The things you can change with your will and actions, go and fix them.

675
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:26,950
Lastly, collect the remaining trash comments that don't belong anywhere, and report them.

676
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,850
Okay?

677
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,380
We understand.

678
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,770
One of these can really hurt your self-esteem.

679
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,900
"They don't even have their own song. What are they doing there?"

680
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,810
I think so, too.

There's nothing to be nervous about.

705
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,380
Since it's the first time don't get greedy. Think before you act.

If they ask you to do anything, don't decline and do it well.

What?

728
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,990
You're the one who asked for her.

729
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,560
Yes.

730
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,610
Since things turned out this way, we will just have to have some fun.

731
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:32,710
She's my copycat. It's the first time we're coming out in the same shot.

732
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:38,210
How about coming out with the exact same make-up as me?

It's okay, right?

Wouldn't you at least need to mimic me... to come out for a few more days?

Of course you should do it.

Thank you very much for last time.

It's already been one month.

I think she came up from the countryside.

777

I admit, she's enthusiastic.

778

Don't you know it's the end for you if the fans catch on?

788
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,750
- How is it?
- It doesn't seem like our song.

789
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,390
Our song. Omega III's debut song!

790
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,890
There'll be loads of other songs. Why does it have to be that song of all songs?

791
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:11,400
Because it seems like us...

792
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,720
I want to bring it out.

JH Entertainment, Ji Hak made them.

01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,860
Kwon Ryeok, who thinks of his fans as laughable: expel him.
