00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,390
By any chance, don't think of doing anything silly.

329
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,080
What. What would I do?

330
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,790
Whatever it is.

331
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,100
- Turn it on.
- Just quickly read the script.

332
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,170
Can you give us a moment?

333
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,940
The kiss scene was no joke.

334
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,180
You must have enjoyed it.

335
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,870
I'm so grateful that you increased the viewer count.

336
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,410
I didn't watch it. I watched a clip and didn't want to watch it.

337
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,020
That's why I didn't do the OST.

338
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,190
By any chance, did you film that thinking it was me?

339
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,040
Were you thinking about me while filming with my imitator?

340
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,800
Stop it. It's not funny.

341
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,580
And you keep saying imitator.

342
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't want you to call her that.

343
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,900
You two are very different.

344
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,830
La Ri Ma and Lee Ma Ha

345
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,040
are different.

346
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,570
Am I supposed to like what you're saying?

347
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,890
Yes, come in!

348
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,350
Hello.

349
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,160
- Hello.
- Oh! Yoo Jin!

350
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,550
- Hyun Ji!
- Yoo Jin!

351
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,320
What is this? Do you two know each other?

352
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,230
That's great. Alright, then!

353
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,690
We will start with Hyun Ji's individual shot first.

354
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,190
Yoo Jin, let's get ready.

355
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,490
Alright.

356
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,400
Okay.

357
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,890
Okay.

358
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,130
This shape is so pretty.

359
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,890
Okay!

360
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,710
Okay! Hyun Ji, let's change outfits! Yoo Jin, get ready!

361
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,330
Oh, Hyun Ji. Looking good.

362
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,260
Is this really your first shoot? You're doing well, considering it's your first.

363
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,250
It's because you are nicely looking after me.

364
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,130
I do like pretty girls.

365
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,170
Yoo Jin is doing really well for his first time, too.

366
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,340
He is nice and has manners.

367
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,330
And he has a really good personality too.

368
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,020
Always taking care of the people around him.

369
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,770
But

370
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,700
I don't think he's just a nice guy.

371
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,120
knowing that he completely beat Kwon Ryeok.

372
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,420
What? Kwon Ryeok?

373
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,220
Did something happen to Yoo Jin?

374
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,300
We don't know.

375
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,910
Who touched the sleeping cat?

376
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,930
Well, we will have to see who's the cat

377
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,900
and who's the culprit.

378
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,910
Are you disappointed that it's a guide?

379
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,780
No, it's not that. If it's something you're doing, of course, I should help.

380
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,870
Don't think that you're singing someone else's song.

381
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:47,660
- What?
- I don't ask just anyone to sing my songs.

382
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:53,190
You're bringing life to a song that has not come out in this world yet.

383
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:58,210
With your voice, you'll be able to make sure the song can live forever.

384
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,920
I want to ask you to sing mine as well.

385
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,490
Turns out I heard your private conversation.

386
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,680
When did you get here?

387
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,240
Not too long ago.

388
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,320
I want to ask you for that favor, too.

389
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,400
Really? Lee Hyun from SHAX?

390
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,890
- He asked to work with you?
- What did he say?

391
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,210
I guess SHAX is composing a song for girls too.

392
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,080
Lia, you're the best!

393
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,060
You must have been surprised.

394
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,600
Surprised? That's how they flirt.

395
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,810
How dare he use his tricks on me.

396
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,180
Anyways! Don't ever get involved with SHAX!

397
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,130
I'm right.

398
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,950
- No way.
- Really!

399
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,630
- You're Tea Party, aren't you?
- It is!

400
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,920
We don't have makeup on!

401
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,440
Show us your face!

402
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,740
Your faces are so small!

403
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,960
Unni! You were so cool!

404
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,330
It's my first time seeing a celebrity in this neighborhood. Daebak!

405
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,630
Celebrity?

406
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,720
Unni, you're Hyun Ji, right? And Unni, you're Ma Ha.

407
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,830
Unni, your singing is amazing!

408
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,420
You know our names too? Thank you.

409
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,620
Unni! Can we take a picture?

410
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,690
Pictures are a little—

411
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,750
Let's take it!

412
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,230
One, two, three!

413
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,470
We became fans of Tea Party after seeing your performance!

414
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,160
One, two, three!

415
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,090
Our first paycheck after three years.

416
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,920
My tears are fogging up my vision.

417
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,510
What should I buy?

418
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,730
Should I buy a new 350 horsepower car?

419
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,190
That might be possible if you pay in 360 monthly payments.

420
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,600
Why not?

421
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,100
- Let's go out!
- Where?
- Today is cheating day!

422
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,130
Shall we?

423
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,520
Yoo Jin! Aren't you coming?

424
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,900
- What about Hyun Woo?
- He is already gone.

425
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,560
- Yes!
- Yes!

426
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,010
They called us celebrities!

427
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,740
Are we celebrities?

428
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,020
Daebak!

429
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,910
I should have put some BB cream on.

430
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,640
Hey! Let's come back after we put some on.

431
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,180
Yoo Jin!

432
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,190
What are you guys doing today?

433
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,530
"On a dark night road, the sight of the woman"

434
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,930
"in the distance makes my heart sink."

435
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,570
"Listening to that woman's pounding heartbeat, I smile as I dance."

436
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,690
"He wipes her tears. The very moment the lips of both touch."

437
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,850
- Pass!
- You can't beat me.

438
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,460
Block! Block!

439
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,490
Come over here.

440
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,070
- That's mine.
- No, that's mine.

441
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,620
That's right!

442
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,990
- A suicide goal?
- Suicide goals are skills too.

443
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,960
That's right.

444
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,890
Jae Woo...

445
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,720
Ryeok! I'm saying this as the team leader. Don't do it.

446
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,630
Don't do anything.

447
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,190
Okay! 2:0! Oh, it's 1:1.

448
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,700
1:1

449
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,750
There's not much left.

450
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,160
One more!

451
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,260
Hyuk...

452
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,590
Fins! Fins! Kwon Ryeok...

453
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,260
Yes! I'm happy.

454
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,200
I can never do that. I'd rather die than do that.

455
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,890
What's with the long face?

456
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,240
Lee Hyun?

457
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,130
What? What do you want me to do about it? Take care of it yourself.

458
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,220
Nice!

459
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,620
One point left, hyung.

460
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,690
Jae Woo,

461
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,520
you've grown.

462
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,890
Alright.

463
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,590
There's A and B. But A keeps telling B sorry and runs away.

464
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,310
B pretends not to know. A keeps on appearing.

465
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,890
But B gets annoyed with A but also cares.

466
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,900
So B is A and A is B.

467
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,640
Is this a math problem?

468
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,790
Do Jin!

469
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,950
You're my only hope. Concentrate.

470
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,190
- Listen to me carefully.
- Okay.

471
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,000
- Okay.
- Okay?

472
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,890
I have a close friend.

473
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,050
He's a total best friend, a really close friend.

474
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,050
Best friend? But you don't have any friends, except for us.

475
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,560
No...

476
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,950
I do.

477
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,300
I have friends, too.

478
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,660
But that friend has a friend that he has known for a very long time,

479
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,040
who is totally like a younger sister,

480
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,490
but now he recently met her.

481
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,500
And that girl keeps appearing in front of him.

482
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,410
So he keeps feeling concerned about her?

483
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,470
He likes her!

484
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,800
I mean I wouldn't say he likes her.

485
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,660
But if you keep thinking about her, then you like her.

486
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,980
No... no.. it's just...

487
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,660
being concerned for her, that's all.

488
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,720
- There's also something he needs to return to her.
- Call her!

489
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,740
But he doesn't know her number.

Why are you here? You said you were going to rest.

653
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,390
I don't think I'm the type to rest.

654
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,920
That's good.

655
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,640
Let's talk.

656
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,970
Why?

657
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,720
You still haven't solved the math problem?

658
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,320
B was able to contact A.

659
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,260
- And?
- But they haven't replied.

660
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,410
What's going on?

661
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,120
What's A and B?

662
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:22,010
A is... some girl.

663
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,190
- Some girl?
- Yes.

664
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:26,260
B is... a friend of Ryeok's.

665
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,180
What?

666
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,350
Hyung Ryeok has friends?

667
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,570
No.

668
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,500
Hyung, you like someone, don't you?

669
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,820
Are you crazy? Me?

670
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,700
Calm down. So what's the problem?

671
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,720
With my advice, he was able to find her number.

672
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,660
But that one phone call was all.

673
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,120
I don't know the way—

674
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,720
Yes.

675
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,350
It's hard.

676
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:58,750
After all, a created image is scary.

677
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,620
When you look like this, you're completely in love.

678
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:06,010
Without knowing his own heart, the AB story... Did you call her?

679
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,430
Yes.

680
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,260
He did.

681
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,350
So what's the problem? Start!

682
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,540
How?

683
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,670
- There's nothing to say.
- What?

684
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,390
You have to show your heart!

685
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:22,100
- My heart?
- Hyung!

686
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,640
When Do Jin hyung plays soccer, he only dribbles.

687
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,550
When? I'm a total striker!

688
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,370
When are you going to take a shot if you're only dribbling?

689
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,030
You need to kick to make a goal.

690
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,590
Hey!

691
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,100
Ryeok is going to get some good sleep tonight.

692
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,910
I need to take him home.

693
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,500
Where are my car keys?

694
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,470
Car keys!

695
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,430
Where are my car keys?

696
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,830
You've arrived at your destination.

697
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,690
You've arrived at your destination.

698
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,750
What is this?

699
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,670
Where does she live that a car can't get to it?

700
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,370
Lee Ma Ha!

701
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:54,010

[Ji Hak]

703
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:06,720
I don't want to be an idol. I'm not interested.

704
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,340
This is your opportunity to do what you want to do for the rest of your life.

705
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,090
Hello.

706
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,800
Hello.

707
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,230
He'll be joining you as the newest member. Introduce yourselves.

708
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,970
Hope you'll get along.

709
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,190
Hello.

710
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,470
Hello.

711
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,210
What is this?

712
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:10,260
He didn't even say goodbye.

713
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,660
[Imitation]

714
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,900
You know this isn't something to overlook. Did you forget how we got here?

715
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,930
Looks like you didn't take my advice.

716
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:23,650
Don't you know you against him will cause trouble?

717
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,530
- ... without contacting me
- Why is it so quiet?

718
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:28,350
- You're one step late.
- This is not even a sitcom audition.

719
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:31,170
Don't get caught up.

720
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:33,030
Why do I keep running into you in unexpected places?

721
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,910
Even if it's you, I don't see any reason for you to act like this.

722
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,290
A cute junior, who calls me a role model... Kwon Ryeok is off limits.

723
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,890
You see, I like Kwon Ryeok.

724
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:42,990
♫  No one's forcing me.  ♫

725
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,610
♫  You're telling me how... ♫
