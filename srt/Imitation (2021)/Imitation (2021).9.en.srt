00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,550
Did you wait for a long time?

4
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,570
No.

5
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,260
It's been so long since we've seen each other, right? Like... a week?

6
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,320
Yes... I think it's been about that long.

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
No wonder... I really missed you.

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,310
Ma Ha...

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,680
What is it?

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,400
What is it that you look so troubled?

11
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,060
I don't have the courage to say this to your face.

12
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,890
Let's...

13
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,480
break up.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,700
Of course, we should leave each other. Did you want to stay together all night?

15
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,090
Were we a thing?

16
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,080
It's the same for me from the beginning, fanship.

17
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,090
Fanship?

18
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,460
Even before you debuted.

19
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,130
Since it was before Fins was even created...

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,340
I am a real fan, right?

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,050
Ma Ha...

22
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,120
By imagining it, you're a dangerous person.

23
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,820
This is not a melodrama with a sad ending.

24
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,000

162
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,130
Oh, is this because I warmed up after a long time?

163
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,790
Energy's overflowing.

164
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,530
How can you warm up for half a day?

165
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,940
Something's going on, right?

166
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,360
Forget it and get me a schedule.

167
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,860
Is he suddenly energized?

168
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,780
There is something going on.

169
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,880
Where's Hyun Ji?

170
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,510
She went to the bathroom.

171
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,150
I can't find the right time to apologize.

172
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,300
It's my first time seeing Hyun Ji that mad.

173
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,970
Geez! You clueless girl.

174
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,010
Hyun Ji.

175
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,670
Your hand is still cold.

176
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,970
Take this.

177
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,660
Use this when it's cold.

178
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,350
I'm sorry, Hyun Ji.

179
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,850
I made a mistake that day.

180
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,210
I didn't know how you felt. I'm really sorry.

181
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,700
You'll accept my apology, right?

182
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,250
That's a relief.

183
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,110
Is it because we already did this together?

184
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,630
You and I looked the best together.

185
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,200
I overheard the staff earlier.

186
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,940
What's your schedule for this week?

187
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,380
- Me?
- If you're free, do you want to meet up?

188
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,650
Are you going to release it or not?

189
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,520
You said you'd release an album long ago.

190
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,170
You should release something so that people don't forget your face.

191
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,580
You reject everything that comes in.

192
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,900
There's nothing different, that's why.

193
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,640
La Ri Ma.

194
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,380
I climbed Mt. Halla last week, you see. For ten hours.

195
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,930
Do you how long it took me to come down after all that pain?

196
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,400
I took a few pictures and came down in fifteen minutes.

197
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,030
Your position won't last for long.

198
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,340
I know that, too.

199
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,140
If you do, release an album, and show your face on an entertainment show!

200
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,990
Okay.

201
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,080
In return, I decide what goes on the album.

202
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,550
I won't just go on any entertainment show either.

203
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,850
I will only perform in the most popular shows. Okay?

204
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,870
If you want, you can be the CEO, too.

205
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,270
I'm the boss. How does she get the say?

206
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,690
Then how's everything going?

207
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,550
Music Holic and S.J. Entertainment are closing the deal soon.

208
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,700
What about Queen Entertainment?

209
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,510
Not yet.

210
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,300
Our girls are weak, so I told you to pay attention to Queen Entertainment.

211
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,020
La Ri Ma is a bit expensive.

212
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,430
Why are you making things so difficult? Since when did we do business with money?

213
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,100
If you make the best out of a situation, the money comes in.

214
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,920
What we need is a decent title text.

215
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,030
Fix a meeting with Queen's CEO.

216
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,610
Hyun Ji.

217
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,780
I'm sorry for being clueless.

218
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,820
Because my feelings were complicated,

219
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,480
I made you and Lia uncomfortable.

220
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,310
I didn't know how you felt.

221
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,730
Why are you like this suddenly?

222
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,410
You've always been worried for me.

223
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:08,530
It was my mistake not considering you because you are a close friend.

224
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,310
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

225
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:18,860
But there's something I need to tell you.

226
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,550
I used to like you.

227
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,940
Since we were trainees.

228
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,990
Yoo Jin.

229
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,930
You're surprised, right?

230
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,830
What is this suddenly?

231
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:35,960
I just wanted to tell you how I felt.

232
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,360
Now I feel free.

233
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,740
You are like a goblin.

234
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,680
I couldn't see it because I was looking at someone for a very long time,

235
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,680
but now I see.

236
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,970
The same eyes looking at me that I had when I looked at you.

237
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,500
He rejected me as soon as he confessed. Bad jerk.

238
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,160
I couldn't tell you because I wasn't in my right mind these days.

239
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:23,080
Yoo Jin's feelings are for you now.

240
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,690
You know better than me that he's a good guy.

241
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,350
He's a warm and sincere guy.

242
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,820
Yes.

243
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,350
Hyun Ji.

244
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:47,830
Ever since I joined Omega, I wasn't lonely, thanks to you.

245
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:55,400
I was always grateful, and I'll treat you better from now on.

246
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,350
I won't get distracted and only focus on Tea Party.

247
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,190
I'm also sorry for throwing a tantrum.

248
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,980
And... thank you.

249
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,070
Ayo, B!

250
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,150
Look away and maintain distance.

251
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,410
Hey.

252
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,830
Yes?

253
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,670
Hey!

254
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,470
Hello, Kwon Ryeok.

255
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,760
Yes. You have to be like this when there are a lot of people.

256
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,550
We're going for lunch.

257
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,710
Have you eaten yet? If not, come with us.

258
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,840
Eat what? We have to go to our meeting.

259
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,770
Today was the day of the entertainment meeting.

260
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,030
I'll get going first.

261
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,030
Do well with your shoot.

262
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,720
Good job. Don't even look at her in public.

263
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,220
- Isn't something strange?
- Both A and B.

264
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,910
- There's something.
- Something we don't know.

265
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,720
Thank you.

266
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,070
I am more thankful.

267
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,280
I don't know what the rumors are about, but PPLs are just...

268
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,550
Of course, he's Kwon Ryeok for a reason.

269
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,050
Since things have turned out this way, let's increase the scale.

270
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,880
For real.

271
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,420
I look forward to your cooperation.

272
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,960
Let me thank you.

273
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,380
Yes, sure.

274
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,960
It feels good to busy.

275
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,700
I told you.

276
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,140
It's been a long time, Kwon Ryeok.

277
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,700
I thought that a couple of fools in love would be happy,

278
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,720
but I was wrong.

279
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,550
Did you fight?

280
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,790
Please lower your voice.

281
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,740
How old are you?!

282
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,270
I'm glad I got it out of the fishing grounds.

283
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,930
Hello.

284
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,100
You're here.

285
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,260
I called her.

286
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,430
Was it too much?

287
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,610
I'll be going.

288
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,890
I went overboard.

289
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,030
Tell me.

290
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,690
What?

291
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,370
"What?"

292
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,390
You two!

293
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,600
It's... It's not what you think.

294
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,340
What do you mean, it's not?

295
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,380
We decided to remain as good Sunbae-Hoobae.

296
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,560
That is... supporting each other and wishing success for one another.

297
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,050
And... and...

298
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,020
That's enough. Stop.

299
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,310
What's this?

300
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,000
You can't leave before eating all of this.

301
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,210
Eat quickly. It'll get cold.

302
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,940
Okay.

303
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,190
It's tasty.

304
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,990
Right?

305
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,590
The coffee scent is very nice.

306
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,010
You won't kick me out now that your work has been done?

307
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,770
Of course not.

308
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,270
Oh, right, its looks like they're going to drop the charges.

309
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,590
It's all thanks to you.

310
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,880
I didn't do much.

311
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,800
You wrote the article well. Thank you.

312
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,830
I just wrote down facts as a reporter.

313
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,250
And well, I didn't write it for free.

314
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,750
I've told you before too, but if it's about Eun Jo—

315
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,430
Not the one who doesn't have the right to be forgotten.

316
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,750
It's just that he can’t forget what happened.

317
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,410
SHAX!

318
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,470
He’s already wearing the harness.

319
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,690
I'm sorry Eun Jo.

320
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,910
Annie.

321
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,050
I deeply regret that I wasn’t with you.

322
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,890
I'm sorry.

323
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,840
Annie.

324
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:42,330
Eun Jo and Annie had been dating since they were trainees.

325
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,360
They had the same dream.

326
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,550
Eun Jo became a trainee at NOG.

327
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,430
Annie went to Omega.

328
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,940
Eun Jo debuted with SHAX and went straight to the top at.

329
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,890
And Annie

330
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,320
could not even debut.

331
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,220
But one day,

332
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,090
a picture came in with a tip-off.

333
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,510
Annie was involved in something bad.

334
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,490
Some time ago, this photo came in saying this is the reason Eun Jo's disappeared.

335
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,680
An anonymous tip-off came in with this picture about his girlfriend.

336
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,350
You don't even have many days left till your debut. Why the heck did—

337
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,120
There must have been other ways.

338
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,830
Did you have to do this?

339
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,520
I am sorry.

340
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,290
I am not saying this

341
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,600
because you are dating Eun Jo.

342
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,270
Did you not think that this could hurt both of you?

343
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,600
Because she thought if people came to know Eun Jo was dating her, this would become a roadblock to him.

344
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,050
Did you tell this to Eun Jo?

345
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,570
No.

346
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,140
Eun Jo does not know about this.

347
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,960
Do you not know how important this time is for you right now?

348
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,760
It's better to break up for the both of you.

349
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,660
So hold it in and wait till I take care of this.

350
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,440
Then what are you going to do? Answer!

351
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,660
I cannot break up. I am sorry.

352
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,400
If you behave like this, SHAW will disband.

353
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,760
Are you going to end it like this?

354
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,360
SHAX?

355
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,870
It's all my fault.

356
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,040
Rather than caring about Eun Jo's feelings,

357
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,720
I grilled him about SHAX's existence.

358
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,680
It's because you were their manager.

359
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,200
The reason why Annie chose death

360
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,810
and why Eun Jo disappeared,

361
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,890
it's all my fault.

362
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,540
So you made tea party

363
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,390
to atone for what you did.

364
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,290
Atonement, you say...

365
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,190
I am not sure.

But why did you choose now after three years passed by?

370
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,610
I was thankful that you came looking for me to the U.S.

371
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,290
At that time,

372

the things you said too...

373
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,910
The thing you said about living doing what I wanted...

374
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,120
it helped me a lot.

I am still at the dorm.

384

Make sure to eat well even if you don't have any schedule.

385
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,110
Yes. Have a good day.

- Me, too.

The atmosphere totally changes when Hyun Ji smiles.

That's right, that's the real tea party.

What is the bad news?

00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,830
There is no bad news.

400

The lawsuit has been dropped. The contract has been taken care of.

401

It's such a relief.

Oh, another thing. It must have been credited to your accounts.

Credited? Today is not our salary day.

Yes!

00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,700
Copyright payment, music production payment, performance payment.

411
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,380
- Copyright payment?
- Music production payment?

412

You guys are the artists and lyricists for Tea party's "Show me."

So you should obviously receive all those payments.

I am not sure.

451
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,890
I have not thought of it either.

- You?
- Then let us...

453

Why don't the three of us spend it in a meaningful way?

What is this determined look that you guys have?

455
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,180
You are giving me too much space. It's making me anxious.

456
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,810
We will invest in JH Entertainment.

457

Even though the amount is not much.

458
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,520
Invest?

459
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,320
We thought about it from the beginning. We don't just want this to be a company we have signed with,

460
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,820
but a base that all of us create along with you, Mr. Ji Hak.

461
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,590
Because you trusted us and started this.

462
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,950
We also want to go till the very end with JH Entertainment.

463
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,810
We may have become an issue, but people don't know us yet.

464
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,920
We want to go along with a color that suits us.

465
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,930
Your unique color?

466
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:10,360
Not first or second, figures that you can only see with your eyes.

467
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,620
But a happy Tea Party.

468
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,750
"Hello, we are always happy Tea Party," just like our introductory line.

469

While communicating with our fans.

470
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,230
We got anxious due to the accident at the music show, but

471
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:25,760
I will never forget that joy I felt performing on the stage.

472
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,820
- It was thrilling.
- I am happy that I am with you guys.

473
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,460
Fighting!

474
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,570
Old reaction.

475

Me, too.

476
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,880
Me, too.

477
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,240
Then CEO, you know, right?

478
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,120
Always happy, Tea Party.

I thought you were different from other guys,

651
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,340
but you are a coward.

652
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,590
Yes, sir.

653
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,480
Then the problem of the fight is solved like that.

654
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,640
Yes, thank you.

655
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,190
Okay. Thank you.

656
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,830
Do I have to endure the media calling me and telling me all this?

657
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,250
I'm sorry.

658
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:51,000
Since I stopped this scandal, Kwon Ryeok and two members of Shax

659
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,790
will have to go to the YMSA show.

660
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:55,330
Two more?

661
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,470
Are you stupid?

662
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:02,990
All shows want to invite SHAX, but only three members will go to one of them. They'll go to YMSA.

663
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,130
So don’t reply me and schedule it.

664
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,190
Yes, sir.

665
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:22,730
Ryeok, why can’t I control you? Every day you look more like him.

666
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,850
Who wants to go to YMSA?

667
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,000
To YMSA out of nowhere?

668
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,100
Kwon Ryeok has to go.

669
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:35,960
Why Ryeok?

670
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,910
Why do you think?

671
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,770
You've been working hard.

672
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:48,170
Since the scandal was avoided, two of you must accompany him. So who wants to go?

673
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,100
If it’s to help Ryeok, I’ll go.

674
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,090
Even if I lose, I’ll go, too.

675
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,380
Then Hyuk and Do Jin will go with you.

676
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,550
Thanks.

677
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,550
Who will all be there?

678
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,630
The lineup's not confirmed yet.

679
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:09,210
Okay. SHAX and La Ri Ma will come to our show.

680
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,780
Then we can fill up the rest with new faces.

681
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,360
If SHAX is coming, why don’t we invite this guy of Sparkling?

682
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,110
I heard he got into a fight with Kwon Ryeok when they were on a music show.

683
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,510
Don’t you think it would be interesting to have them both on our show?

684
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,710
Really? Contact him.

685
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:24,930
Okay.

686
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,740
- What about the girls?
- Blue Velvet and Honey Pink?

687
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,230
Both groups will be on another show that has the same schedule that ours.

688
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,640
Ah, wait a minute.

689
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,290
How about them?

690
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,140
Tea Party? Is this the revelation group?

691
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,250
They’re only good for music shows.

692
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:46,090
Their video went viral.

693
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:49,030
After that, they appeared on the music charts. They are so famous right now.

694
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,830
Are they that famous?

695
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:53,570

What's the lineup?

698
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:02,960
Yoo Jin will go, but they also want one of you to go to the show.

699
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,020
Why do they want me?

700
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,230
You won't have anything for a while.

701
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,880
- What?
- Our agency has decided that you have to rest, so there’s nothing you can do.

702
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,200
Kwon Ryeok hit me first. Look at this.

703
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,460
Do you think it's because of this time?

704
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,970
Do you think no one knew you were with that girl?

705
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:21,630
- Hyung.
- Hyun Oh, you better keep in mind what you did.

706
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,540
Got it?

707
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:36,080
SHAX will also go to the show, so you better prepare your best song.

708
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,090
You should go with Yoo Jin.

709
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,870
No, it's alright.

710
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:45,510
Tae Geun, I think it's better if Min Soo goes with Yoo Jin.

711
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,770
What do you say, Min Soo?

712
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,070
Thanks.

00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,980

I wonder who's attending.

00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:12,000
Yoo Jin and Min Soo. Yoo Jin's not that great.

La Ri Ma.

719
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,950

Yeah.

I can't reach CEO Park.

740
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:01,360
He's probably in a meeting regarding the takeover.

741
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,230
- Probably?
- Yes...

742
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,480
CEO Park is working hard to build up the company,

743
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,830
but you don't even know the CEO's schedule?

- Forget it.

What am I supposed to do with people like this?

752

La Ri Ma's price is quite high.

Why are you making things so difficult?

754

All of them. They only look down on me.
