00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,840
So you can't have a girlfriend.

165
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,010
Girlfriend?

166
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,940
After I take the entrance exams, it'll be our first day as a couple.

167
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,450
- So you have to wait, okay?
- Day one?

168
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,720
- Study.
- This is nuts.

169

- That pinky—

Are you joking? Are you going to act like this?

The person you like is over there with someone else!

194
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,960
Doing that! How does that make you feel?

195
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,920
Don't you feel horrible?

196
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,490
Fill your eyes with those horrible emotions.

- Fill.
- Yes.

It's hot! Aish!

Cheer and encouragement? Why aren't you rooting for her?

201
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,980
Stay out of it, you single person.

202
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,680
No wonder he's hot. He's always running like that.

203
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,910
Make a right from the set. Then a left when you see the equipment car.

Enter through the metal doors.

205
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,030
Come down the stairs.

206

Then turn left.

207

Enter through the metal doors, and go straight.

208

- Sunbaenim!
- You pretended to not know me the entire time during filming.

209
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,100
Then should I have acted like I know you?

210
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,850
The kiss scene was intense.

211
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,190
It wasn't a kiss, just a peck.

212
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,620
"I'm going to be your girlfriend, Oppa."

Oppa?

Are you getting jealous of Yoon Bin?

Jealous? Yeah, right.

216
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,480
I think you only need to take care of those two.

217
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,450
- Sunbaenim, I'm sorry!
- Forget it.

You did it well and stuck to him during the shooting.

Hey.

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,590
You were glued to him like you were a piece of gum. What about me? Am I a pervert?

Sunbaenim...

I'll get going first.

Yes.

How was Yoon Bin?

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,260
He was really good-looking, wasn't he?

We have different interests, so of course, we wouldn't know.

a star lecturer is a famous idol to them.

How long do idols' careers last anyway?

After time passes, fans move on, too. Isn't it just a phase?

While cleaning out the office there, I took whatever could make money.

00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,280
Sunbaenim.

654
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,340
What is it at this hour?

655
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,660
We have a problem.

656
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,990
They have a picture of us.

657
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,730
Hello? Are you listening?

658
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:12,550
Yes.

659
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:15,080
There are a lot of pictures like that.

660
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,360
Really?

661
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,990
Yes.

662
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,770
Don't worry too much.

663
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,680
I'm going to hang up now.

664
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,880
Over here!

665
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,530
What's the occasion?

666
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,490
You are calling me first.

667
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,650
I have a favor to ask.

668
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:41,920
- Favor?
- Can you release an article?

669
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,690
What type of article?

670
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:47,930
A follow-up article regarding the companies of Omega and Tea Party.

671
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,060
Oh, that?

672
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,630
Resources...

673
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,080
are all here, so take a look, and you can decide.

674
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:54,970
Is it a request?

675
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:58,390
No, the truth.

676
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:07,330
These articles are always written to make an issue, but the conclusion is never talked about.

677
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:11,650
Since it doesn't make money or anything of that matter.

678
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:16,230
But I thought you would.

679
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,490
- I'll look at it.
- Thank you.

680
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:31,050
But did you know, if I write the article, then you'll owe me one?

681
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,480
Ryeok. Why are we here?

682
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,770
But it's bothering me because it's a photo from the same night as Kim Ji Min's photo.

683
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,320
What are you guys doing?

684
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,790
CEO, you're at work till late.

685
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:04,930
You two are having fun, aren't you?

686
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,790
Hey.

687
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,850
Hey.

688
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,590
I told you to take care of him.

689
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:14,490
Hyung doesn't know anything.

690
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,420
Doesn't know?

691
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,230
Doesn't know?

692
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:19,780
I'm sorry, CEO!

693
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,170
Hyung, step out for a minute.

694
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:44,950
She's doing anything and everything to get famous using you.

695
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:49,170
What good does it do for you to meet someone like her?

696
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:55,750
Ryeok, you should have met someone that's at your level.

697
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:58,580
And think about it,

698
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:03,970
would you be the one that's affected more or her?

699
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:07,930
You need to think about who's more at a loss.

700
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:13,020
Have you gone blind just because you're so popular?

701
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,130
Do you think you achieved everything because of yourself?

702
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,280
SHAX? You can leave it now also if you want.

703
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,360
I have nothing to lose. Why?

704
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,320
I've earned enough.

705
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,840
Do the other guys know?

706
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,890
That you're dating?

707
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,580
Do they know?

708
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,750
Would you be the one that's affected more or her?

709
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:58,950
You need to think about who's more at a loss.

710
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,140
That's a relief. I feel at ease because you said that.

711
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,030
Do the other guys know?

712
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,370
That you're dating?

713
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,340
SHAX has been together for six years.

714
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,370
I want to go till the end without getting distracted. Do you get it?

715
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:33,450
Director.

716
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:40,810
If you were still SHAX's manager, what would you have done in this situation?

717
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,780
What would you have done?

718
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:52,770
If I were still SHA'sX manager, I would have prevented things.

719
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:56,790
But not now.

720
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,560
What's important is you.

721
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:05,000
I would have left it up to you to decide.

722
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,890
Thank you for your advice.

723
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,170
And I'm sorry for calling you for something like this.

724
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,880
Did you wait long?

725
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,730
No.

726
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,080
How long has it been since we've seen each other?

727
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,590
Has it been about a week?

728
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:50,510
I think so.

729
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:54,040
No wonder. I really missed you.

730
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:00,660
There really must be something going on.

731
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,590
Ma Ha.

732
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,950
What is it?

733
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,800
What do you need to say that you're having so much trouble with?

734
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,510
I don't have the strength to say this while looking at you in the eyes.

735
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,350
Let's...

736
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,960
break up.

737
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:59,160
I only show you my bad side.
[Epilogue]

738
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,960
I'm really sorry.

739
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,320
Hyung, what's wrong?

740
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:06,250
[12 years ago]

741
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,170
I feel disgusting.

742
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,630
Have a drink and let it all out, okay?

743
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,050
Good days will come.

744
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,950
Ji Hak.

745
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,070
I can't live like this anymore.

746
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,850
I won't live like that anymore.

747
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:39,680
♫ What if either of us... ♫

748
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,460
[Imitation]

749
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,590
Ryeok is back.

750
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,980
I'm back to normal.

751
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,020
I'm not seeing him anymore.

752
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,530
If you were going to break up so easily, why did you have to make people around you so uncomfortable?

753
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:54,570
An anonymous person sent this picture and information about Eun Jo's girlfriend, mentioning that this is the reason why Eun Jo disappeared.

754
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:56,990
I told you I don't want to get involved with SHAX.

755
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,870
- I'm interested.
- You know Kwon Ryeok, don't you?

756
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:00,930
They said they fought over a woman.

757
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:04,090
He can't get it together. He's becoming like someone I know these days.

758
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,790
When you were after Ma Ha, were you not sincere?

759
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:10,920
How is she so not phased by anything? Makes me even more worried.
