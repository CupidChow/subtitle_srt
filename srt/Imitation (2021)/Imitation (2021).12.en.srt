00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,160
Hyung, five is better than one.

168
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,270
Don't you think so?

169
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't steal our spots. We're all SHAX.

170
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,950
SHAX.

171
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,020
Don't do that again, okay?

172
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,850
Hey!

173
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,450
Hey! Stop holding me!

174
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,360
Hey! Hey!

175
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,390
I'll be back.

176
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,640
What a relief.

177
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,810
Hello, I'm Lee Ma Ha from Tea Party.

178
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,920
I really wanted to meet you at least once.

179
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,760
Thank you for letting us sing that song.

180
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,620
A lot of people will sing it together tomorrow.

181
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,150
I had never met Unni Annie,

182
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,400
or you,

183
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,130
but when I heard that song I knew.

184
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,890
How much you loved each other.

185
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,330
I have someone special, too, so I was able to feel it.

186
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,780
I'm sure Unni Annie was happy.

187
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,740
She was able to hear the true feelings of her beloved.

188
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,290
I will do my best to portray your emotions.

189
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,910
- I hate you.
- Me?

190
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,960
You didn't even wipe down your sweat after practice.

191
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,050
You'll get sick being out here in the cold.

192
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,490
Don't worry.

193
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,800
Here.

194
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,490
What's all this?

195
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,770
My tribute.

196
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,670
I'll take care of you today.

197
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,250
Then, of course, I have to try it.

198
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,690
Is it good?

199
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,540
I can feel the strength coursing through my veins.

200
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,810
The CEO won't leave us alone.

201
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,360
Let's go back to the beginning of SHAX.

202
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,380
Okay, you can go.

203
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,420
What are all of you here for?

204
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,640
This MML stage is the last stage as SHAX.

205
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,020
The last?

206
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,220
Yes, after the MML concert ends, we're going to leave NOG.

207
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,120
Jae Woo.

208
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,190
I agree with the members.

209
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,260
Really?

210
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,450
We will leave after solving Ryeok's contract problem.

211
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,420
Solve?

212
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,930
All of SHAX will take responsibility,

213
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,480
so please stop bothering Ryeok.

214
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,220
This is upsetting.

215
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:03,730
I raised a few ducklings, but now they're trying to fly away from home, and they're even making false accusations.

216
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,750
Do you think you can pull off the performance?

217
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,860
You knew, didn't you?

218
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,990
About Eun Jo and his girlfriend?

219
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,460
- What?
- I have nothing else to say.

220
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,330
Should I let MML know that SHAX won't be performing?

221
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,520
Are you crazy?

222
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,680
Send out that article.

223
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,640
Sorry?

224
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,660
Do I have spell everything out for you?!

225
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,120
Who dares to mess with my things?

226
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,680
Put out an article that SHAX and NOG are on good terms!

227
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,430
And remember to keep their mouths shut until after MML.

228
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,290
Ryeok can't fly away anyways.

229
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,610
Let's figure this out after MML.

230
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,760
Yes, sir.

231
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,210
And what's this about Eun Jo's girlfriend?

232
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,860
Sorry?

233
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,090
Can't you take care of the members more properly?

234
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,670
You didn't even know that he was meeting a girl like this..

235
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,550
And now there are pictures.

236
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,320
Ji Hak is no longer one of ours. We have nothing to do with him.

237
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,310
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes.

238
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:34,400
So he's not even allowed to say the N in NOG.

239
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,410
I didn't even think of that.

240
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,310
But my actions were worth it!

241
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,320
What do you mean?

242
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,290
What did those guys just say and leave?!

243
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,320
Eun Jo's girlfriend... Omega Entertainment.

244
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,330
It's that girl.

245
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,790
The door was open.

246
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,120
CEO Park, your expression is hard to discern.

247
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,270
Could it be that you didn't know Eun Jo's girlfriend was from President Kim's company?

248
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,140
If it comes out like this, my topic becomes a little complicated.

249
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,050
During such an important period of time where NOG is trying to expand,

250
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,750
who would send in an edited photo like this?

251
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,250
You bastard.

252
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,570
I think we'll be seeing each other very often from here on out, so don't avoid my calls!

253
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,530
I'll close the door on my way out.

254
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,400
Secretary Kim.

255
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,030
What kind of foolish things have you been doing?

256
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,190
Well?

257
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,970
What have you done?

258
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,280
Since it's matched to the song...

259
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,970
We can't mess up the positions.

260
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,180
I'm already nervous.

261
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,790
I'm saying this again,

262
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,270
but please let our Hyun Ji get past her stage fright and rip this stage apart!

263
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,730
- Amen.
- Amen.

264
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,370
Amen.

265
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,430
I shouldn't be doing this right now.

266
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,100
I'm going to do the studio.

267
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,060
Lia, don't work too hard.

268
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,270
Got it. I'm going!

269
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,190
Bye!

270
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,890
I also have to get our outfits.

271
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,720
Alright. Be careful!

272
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,200
Okay.

273
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,450
See you later!

274
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,010
Min Sung.

275
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,960
I hope you can come.

276
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,220
[2021 MML]

277
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,090
I'll see if I can.

278
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,730
♫ Come closer closer ♫

279
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,110
♫ In this sweet time ♫

280
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,930
♫ Suddenly, the time is midnight ♫

281
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,250
♫ The two of us, all night ♫

282
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:22,400
♫ Come closer closer. This moment will last forever ♫

283
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,720
What's this? Are you trying to practice?

284
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,250
Yes.

285
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,920
Are they cockroaches in the practice room, or what?

286
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,030
I mean, what kind of company has only one practice room?!

287
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,780
Sunbaenim, thank you so much for taking care of us when we had nowhere to go.

288
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,160
What is this, so tacky?

289
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,300
If you're thankful, then pay me back.

290
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,490
Let's stand together at MML next year.

291
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,650
Okay.

292
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,430
Don't risk your life though!

293
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,420
Just do it while you're having fun, while having fun.

294
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,250
- Okay?
- Yes.

295
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,930
Let's carry them together. It must be heavy.

296
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,160
It's not heavy.

297
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,020
You should rest after practice. Why come here?

298
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,350
I heard you haven't slept in days.

299
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,820
Your face looks worn.

300
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,220
Really?

301
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,330
Where?

302
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,880
I look worn out because I couldn't see you. Let's go.

303
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,760
Let's get one more clip.

304
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,040
We're running out of time...

305
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,780
You still have some time left.

306
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,510
There! It's a little weird there.

307
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,130
Why are you making mistakes you usually don't make, Lia?

308
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,210
It's okay.

309
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,800
If you make a mistake, I'll cover for you.

310
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,350
You said you weren't interested in me, right?

311
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,580
Is that not true?

312
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,160
No...

313
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,000
I... That's...

314
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,320
So... If you don't know how you feel,

315
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,090
just follow my lead.

316
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,820
You don't want to?

317
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,030
No... I'm not saying that...

318
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,130
Aigoo, his face is all red...

319
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,800
You should be taking care of yourself. Can you be going out like this the day before the concert?

320
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,690
I have been taking care of myself all this time. You,

321
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,490
ran out as soon as I called.

322
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,100
It's my first time performing on such a big stage.

323
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,450
Honestly, I'm so nervous I can't sleep.

324
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,430
Our Ma Ha

325
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,150
will do well.

326
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,080
Really well.

327
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,900
After tomorrow... what will happen to us?

328
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,690
What do you mean?

329
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,840
You'll still be

330
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,330
shining like that star.

331
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,360
I'll be shining next to you.

332
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,140
It's a satellite.

333
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,290
What?

334
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,970
My star.

335
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,200
Oh, it's moving.

336
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,370
Still, I'm glad.

337
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,730
It's coming to me.

338
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:55,350
It's much better than being separated while we're in the same place.

339
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,990
We'll be separated for a moment,

340
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,730
but you'll come back to me.

341
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,210
I'll wait for you without changing so you can come find me.

342
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,850
I'll come to see you dozens of times a day.

343
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,180
Always with a happy heart.

344
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,310
The title for the song!

345
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,720
What do you think of Constellation?

346
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,350
Constellation?

347
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,100
I like it.

348
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,310
♫ You don’t give it up. Boom boom boom yeah ♫

349
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,090
♫ Believe, don’t doubt. Lift up your head, look at me ♫

♫ Boom boom boom yeah ♫

351
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,090

352
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,660

354
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:24,330

355
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,420
Thank you.

356
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,930
Okay! Let's clean up the set.

357
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,990
After this song ends, we have one minute until the video for the next song starts,

358
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,540
and 1 minute 30 seconds after the video starts.

359
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,860
Let's move more quickly.

360
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,240
- Okay.
- Yes.

361
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,590
But is SHAX doing a finale?

362
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,400
I don't know. It's written, so they probably will, right?

363
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,910
If you just write the finale song here, is that okay? Are they going to go up without anything?

364
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,780
There's no way.

365
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,820
Manager Ji.

366
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,430
I'm late. This is the finale's video file.

367
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,270
Even for SHAX, if you do this, it's not okay.

368
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,870
You haven't changed.

369
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,620
Dae Kwon will set the timing for you.

370
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,120
I will?

371
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,080
But did you take over again?

372
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,380
No.
