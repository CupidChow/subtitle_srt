Good job, good job.

Thank you!

Pouring or dipping. Did you make this mess over that?

165
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,020
They childishly poured the sauce before hearing me out.

Who are you saying poured it? It wasn't me!

The camera will zoom in on Kwon Ryeok's right side.

636
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,920
And run away! Go chase Kwon Ryeok.

637
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:24,030
- Let's do it.
- Please monitor it!

638
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,710
I'll explain it one more time.

639
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,220
When he comes up, everyone moves to the side.

640
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,870
When he stabs him, the kisaengs can exit from that side.

641
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,590
The movements are a bit long, so please come out this way.

642
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,520
Don't be confused.

643
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,690
Alright?

644
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,560
Yes, sir.

645
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,970
Okay, from the top!

646
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,700
Two Americanos.

647
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,530
Thank you.

648
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,390
Welcome!

649
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,410
Your Excellency.

650
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,980
Your Excellency!

651
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,450
Your Excellency.

652
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,550
Your Excellency.

653
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,390
Your Excellency.

654
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,350
Your Excellency.

655
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,810
Your Excellency.

656
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,270
This is hard.

657
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,150
The sun will set soon.

658
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,920
They're throwing a drunken party with the hard work of the citizens.

659
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,400
Not one person can leave this place alive.

660
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,540
It's a bit weak.

661
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,590
They're throwing a drunken party...

662
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,530
They're throwing a drunken party with the hard work of the citizens.

663
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:56,750
They're throwing a drunken party with the hard work of the citizens.

664
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:00,490
Not one person can leave this place alive.

665
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,300
What?

666
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,280
Did the paparazzi get a picture of me?

667
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,770
Where did Dae Kwon go?

668
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,010
Dae Kwon!

669
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,030
One second.

670
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,300
Excuse me. Ryeok hasn't been sleeping well lately.

671
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,420
He has a rash on his right side.

672
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,960
So what?

673
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,920
You can see it. If the fans spot it, they'll go crazy.

674
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,350
So can't he swing the sword and get a close-up on his left side instead?

675
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,200
If you ask this so suddenly, all of the formations will be thrown off.

676
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,660
I'll ask him not to mess up.

677
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,690
Please, thank you.

678
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,980
It'll be hard.

679
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,830
Excuse me. Ryeok...

680
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,090
Then let's do that.

681
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,010
Thank you.

682
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,320
His Majesty!

683
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Do it once.

684
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:34,160
They're throwing a drunken party with the hard work of the citizens.

685
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:41,030
Not one person can leave this place alive!

686
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:56,370
Cut!

687
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,370
Are you okay?

688
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:02,810
Did you get hurt?

689
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,370
Didn't you tell them the formations changed?

690
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,470
Sorry!

691
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,430
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

692
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,190
I forgot to tell you. I'm sorry.

693
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,790
It's okay. I'm okay.

694
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,750
I'm fine.

695
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,510
Are you okay?

696
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,870
Yes, I'm fine.

697
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,130
Are you sure?

698
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,030
Yes. Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

699
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:26,220
Sorry.

700
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,640
Sorry!

701
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,920
Okay, then let's take it from the top.

702
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,630
You're okay, right?

703
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,950
Sorry.

704
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,000
Sorry.

705
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,350
Standby!

706
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,300
Nice expression!

707
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,620
Okay!

708
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,280
Thank you.

709
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,920
Good work.

710
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,950
Good work.

711
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,180
Dae Kwon!

712
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,120
- I'll hold it.
- No, no, I will hold it.

713
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,460
Let's go. Good work.

714
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,660
I'm sorry, Ma Ha.

715
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,840
I'm really sorry.

716
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,130
I was wrong.

717
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,990
It's cold.

718
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,570
Oh, my...

719
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,840
[Epilogue]

720
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,260
[November 2013]

721
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,020
Hello. I'm Lee Ma Ha.

722
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:56,460
I want to learn dance from the best team, "Star is Born."

723
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:04,800
We don't just accept anybody. Go.

724
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,390
[Imitation]

725
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,530
Even if you're okay right now, you will catch a cold from all the sweat.

726
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:17,930
Did you know?

727
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:19,430
I got a weird call earlier.

728
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:20,900
JH Entertainment?
[To you who wants to dream once again. Renew audition
- JH Entertainment]

729
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,860
Didn't Shax originally have six members?

730
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,780
Is there no possibility that Eun Jo will return?

731
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,540
If you three are okay with it, I'd like to work with you.

732
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,460
- He's a scammer.
- Is it voice phishing?

733
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,530
The only thing you know how to do is to imitate La Ri Ma?

734
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:36,180
Just one year. I want to extend my dream one more year.

735
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:41,730
This is the first stage you three will perform as Tea Party.
