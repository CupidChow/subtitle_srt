00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,000
This is their secret couple phone.

168
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,870
I knew that after seeing Annie's phone at your place.

169
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,750
Then...

170
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,930
that means that this is Sunbaenim Eun Jo's phone, right?

171
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,500
And the one at our place is Unni Annie's phone.

172
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,300
Three years ago, Eun Jo disappeared just before our comeback stage.

173
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,470
He didn't even know he dropped this phone.

174
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,720
Did he disappear?

175
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,020
The articles said that Eun Jo Sunbae was sick so...

176
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,900
Three years ago!

177
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,080
SHAX's comeback stage.

178
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,690
MML?

179
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,350
- Right.
- October 28.

180
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,520
That's the day Unni Annie died.

181
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,360
I remember.

182
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,340
The magnificent lights of the main stadium.

183
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,100
Eun Jo disappeared the day Annie died.

184
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,950
What must have happened to

185
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,370
the two of them that day?

186
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,490
I want to know, too.

187
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,900

192
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,410
We're done after we record the vocals.

193

You don't know how demanding she is now that we're in the same company.

194

199

Don't you guys have to leave?

200
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,970
I also have a mountain of work to do.

201
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,740
I need you guys to give me my space back.

202
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,330
The practice room is so...

203
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,350
plain.

204
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,820
- La Ri Ma!
- La Ri Ma!

205
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,040
- La Ri Ma!
- Noona La Ri Ma!

206
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,680
- La Ri Ma!
- Is this JH Entertainment?

207
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,770
- Shhh, quiet.
- La Ri Ma! La Ri Ma!

208

- Don't get excited. Cool down.

La Ri Ma! La Ri Ma!

210
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,770
This is really something to see.

211
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,410
Who is this La Ri Ma now?

212
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,280
It's tiring, right?

213
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,570
It is all part of the job.

214
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,540
You're here?

215
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,440
It will be noisy for a while, right?

216

218
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,750
Look at that.

219
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,740
She's totally taking over the practice room.

220
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,370
I know, right.

221
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,260
Sunbaenim.

222
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,860
Sunbaenim!

223
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,140
Oh. What happened?

224
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,620
- How's the song?
- You just have to record it.

225
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,300
Also, this is our practice room.

226
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,910
Now it's ours.

227

Your fans are outside.

228

Many of them have been there since this morning. Aren't you curious?

229
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,200
When do I have time to be curious? MML is around the corner.

230
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,030
Ah! Of course, you're participating this year too.

231
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:52,400
Wouldn't it be possible for Tea Party to participate in the Rookie Group category?

232
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,300
Us?

233
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,060
From hate comments for being a copycat to the music show debut issue

234
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,590
and climbing the music charts. You did a variety of things.

235
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,850
It seems like there's nothing you don't know about us.

236
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,680
Of course, I know it all.

My lookalike. Composer of my song. And you...

238

Let's get closer.

239
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,250
Now, no matter what others say, it's your Tea Party so look forward to it.

240
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,480
It's been decided that this year's headliners will be SHAX and La Ri Ma again.

241
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,220
For the rest, we will discuss the list I have distributed.

242
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,760
Best Boy and Girl Dance group

243
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,620
will be Sparkling and Sha Sha Sha, who got the most votes.

244
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,370
Then we have to decide the best Rookie Group.

245
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,700
How about Tea Party?

246
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,200
Their debut song Show Me entered the charts, and

247
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,050
they've been active on radio and music shows.

248
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,610
The ranking on the chart was higher for MiniMe.

249
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,110
MiniMe released three new songs this year,

250
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,500
they are also popular as variety idols.

251
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,430
The candidates are supposed to be chosen only with respect to their music.

252
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,390
Thinking of Music is My Life, I immediately thought of Tea Party's broadcast accident.

253
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,400
When the MR got cut,

254
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,140
they dramatically changed the worst stage,

255
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,450
it was impactful compared to other newbies.

256
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,820
Figures.

257
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,640
The impact of the return of Omega III's Call Me was also huge.

258
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,330
Does anyone want to recommend any other group?

259
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,700
Yes, yes, thank you. Yes.

260
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,220
You came at the right time.

261
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,150
Sparkling is going on MML.

262
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,280
What happened in the audition to replace Hyun Oh?

263
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,760

264
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,790

265
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,420
Come in.

266
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,580
What is it with you?

267
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,350
I am sorry CEO Kim.

268
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,870

269
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,720
Please let me remain a part of Sparkling.

270
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,100

I realized I don't really know much about Eun Jo.

287
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,880
He could not even open up to anyone properly before disappearing.

288
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,620

00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:36,610
I thought if I just close my eyes once, it would not be a big deal.

It's not easy to get spotted by the CEOs of big entertainment companies.

341
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,330
Just think of it as making a sponsor

If you miss this chance too, you won't be able to debut.

The same goes for Lia and Hyun Ji.

00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,840
It must have been hard. How were you able to get through it?

489
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,200
It was thanks to Manager Ji Hak.

490
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,140
Did you run away so you could be like this?

491
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,740
Well?

492
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,700
I know you feel guilty, but—

493
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,340
It's about time you come to your senses.

494
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,230
And do what you want to do!

495
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,130
That's what she probably wants you to do.

496
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,810
That you shouldn't get hurt.

497
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,820
She only worried about you.

498
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,000
That girl.

499
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,930
So live so

500
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,260
others won't have to worry about you.

501
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,910
Did you ever regret your decision from back then?

502
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,860
If you're talking about Eun Jo from SHAX,

503
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,630
my decision from when I was standing on the lift,

504
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,420
I don't regret it.

505
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,130
I trusted you guys. And even without me,

506
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,980
I knew SHAX would still exist.

507
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,790
Even if I couldn't help stop Annie from leaving,

508
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,200
I would have made the same decision.

509
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,610
At that time, I was all that she had.

510
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,960
You might not understand.

511
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,580
I wonder...

512
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,340
I'm not going to throw a punch at a tough guy for nothing...

513
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,160
I'm not going to be a crazy workaholic either...

514
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,880
Above all, I won't do anything that would hurt the ones that are precious to me.

515
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,270
I couldn't understand you then,

516
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,080
but I think I can now.

517
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,420
Weren't you curious?

518
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,610
Curious?

519
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,480
I would hear about you anywhere.

520
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,790
- Don't get hurt.
- I guess you were worried after all.

521
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:31,230
Even if I didn't want to, everyone was talking about it. So how could I not?

522
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,710
I should get going.

523
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,460
Don't you...

524
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,490
want to see the members?

525
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,820
No.

526
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,180
How could you answer so quickly? So harsh.

527
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,800
SHAX is SHAX, even without me.

528

Hyuk. It's better that they don't know about me.

530
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,510
I don't want the members to be swayed by me.

531
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,590

[NOG Entertainment]

549
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,200
Would they be MML headliners for the third year for no reason?
