00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,400
Is something going on?

168
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,280
No!

169
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,720
We came to see Ma Ha off for her first sitcom.

170
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,260
Ma Ha, good luck today!

171
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,820
Fighting!

172
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,340
Your face... Did you not sleep well?

173
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,920
Since it was my first shooting, I couldn't sleep that much.

174
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,960
Take care of your body.

175
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,180
Sorry.

176
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,590
Try to sleep some more on our way.

177
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,070
Okay.

178
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,490
Alright, so Ma Ha, you will be dancing here.

179
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,800
You two will look at her like, "why is she dancing this way?"

180
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,280
Ma Ha, can you try dancing?

181
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,670
Yes.

182
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,770
No, no, not seriously. Try dancing funnily, in a funny way.

183
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,230
That way, these two can give a reaction.

184
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,110
Okay, that's good.

185
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,740
Rehearsal is finished! Everyone can eat, and we will resume shooting at 2!

186
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,690
She practiced so hard. Why would they suddenly change it?

187
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,090
I don't know. Let's go.

188
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,400
Excuse me...

189
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,240
Are you okay?

190
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,070
Yeah, I'm always doing pretty good. No problem.

191
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,440
- I think she's asking about Ryeok.
- Ah...

192
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,710
Did he get hurt a lot? Is he okay?

193
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,230
You don't need to worry. You can see it later when it comes out on the news.

194
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,480
How can I not worry?!

195
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,980
Sunbae is hurt, but how can I not worry?!

196
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,790
Okay, okay.

197
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,410
Hyung! What are you doing here?

198
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,040
How's Ryeok doing?

199
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,100
He woke up.

200
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,950
That's a relief.

201
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,700
What are you doing? Are you looking for someone?

202
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,110
Is Lee Ma Ha also done?

203
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,060
Ma Ha? Why are you looking for Ma Ha?

204
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,980
Hey, you guys, move aside. Hyung! Hyung!

205
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,550
Hey, Dae Kwon.

206
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,260
Hyung, I'm sorry but can I have two hours...

207
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,620
What?

208
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,690
There's nothing on the news yet

209
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,420
and the members say he's doing okay.

210
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,500
I just want to confirm with my own eyes if he is okay.

211
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,370
We found A, didn't we?

212
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,290
Yes.

213
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,760
Go ahead.

214
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,840
Surprise~

215
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,380
Hyung! What's the plan?

216
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,520
- Why are you guys here?!
- Let's go to the hospital.

217
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,210
They're here! They're here!

218
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,310
Stop!

219
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,260
Only ten minutes! Only to confirm that he's alive.

220
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,470
If Ma Ha comes in...

221
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,850
I should be lying down here

222
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,080
pretending to be hurt,

223
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,140
and then slowly get up,

224
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,630
and then she would ask if I'm okay.

225
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,170
For such a big accident, the injuries are minor. Did I make you worry, Ma Ha?

226
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,730
Thank you for coming.

227
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,900
Sunbaenim...

228
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,720
They said you weren't hurt that badly...

229
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
then why are you like this?

230
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,690
There's still something I haven't told you yet.

231
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,500
Since back then, I actually was a really, really big fan of yours.

232
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,470
When the manager abandoned me,

233
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,170
I wasn't cold at all because you walked with me.

234
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,640
And when you asked me if all I knew was to imitate La Ri Ma,

235
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,520
I didn't hate you.

236
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,270
Sunbaenim, you held my hand.

237
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,690
You danced with me.

238
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,130
So please wake up soon!

239
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,500
You have to give me my pouch.

240
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,740
Sunbaenim, I wanted to see you.

241
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,150
I prayed so much that the kiss scene would be picked as the best scene.

242
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,720
I like you, Sunbaenim.

243
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,880
I like you a lot.

244
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,880
You mean it, right?

245
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,660
Did you mean what you said?

246
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,750
Sunbaenim.

247
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,110
So that—

248
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,600
Well...

249
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,890
Here, take a really deep breath.

250
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,160
You just need to hold your breath and cover your ears like this.

251
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,100
Just like how you wanted to personally give me my coat,

252
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,220
I wanted to personally give you your pouch.

253
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,260
I missed you.

254
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,820
I also like you Lee Ma Ha.

255
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,440
In my heart, my best scene was this.

256
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,970
There was a car accident during the filming, and he was promptly sent to the emergency room, where he received treatment.

257
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,010
From now on, the SHAX members will be with him through his recovery.

258
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,180
From here on out, so he can get the medical help he needs and for him to rest,

259
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,410
please refrain from further articles about this matter.

260
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,950
How is Kwon Ryeok's condition right now?

261
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,560
- Has he regained consciousness?
- Yes.

262
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,930
Yes, we will end the interview here.

263
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:57,220
Please tell us more!

264
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,030
[010-0572-0143]

265
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,010
Hello?

266
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,170
Did you get home safely?

267
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,340
Yes.

268
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,210
I miss you.

269
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,880
Why aren't you responding?

270
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,410
Hello? Ma Ha?

271
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,800
Ma Ha?

272
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,140
I miss you.

273
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,920
Me too...

274
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,520
It's really late! You should rest.

275
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,790
She's cute.

276
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,570
Lia... Aren't you asleep?

277
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,670
Lee Ma Ha.

278
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,770
You looked like you were going to faint anytime, but now you're full of life.

279
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,060
What?

280
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,150
Seeing as you're coming back with blushed cheeks, it's obvious.

281
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,530
What are you saying?

282
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,490
You saw him, didn't you?

283
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,680
- Sorry.
- Really?

284
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,590
Why? Wait, how did you go alone?

285
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,890
Are you even thinking?!

286
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,800
It's not that... We are...

287
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,770
We? You and Kwon Ryeok? We?

288
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,530
No... I mean... I... I am... Sunbaenim is...

289
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,910
What are you going to do?

290
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,120
There is something between you and Kwon Ryeok for sure.

291
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,470
What can there be? There's nothing yet...

292
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,970
What about Hyun Ji?

293
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,910
Are you going to tell her?

294
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,470
Lia! Look at your red eyes.

295
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,610
You must be so tired. What time is it?

296
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,330
Wait. What is this smell?

297
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,060
This smell on your clothing... Oh!

298
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,800
It's because I just bought this. Hurry and go to sleep.

299
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,840
Hurry and sleep. Lie down. I'll go wash up. Sleep!

300
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,860
- Oh.
- Oh.

301
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,290
Mission complete. We kept our promise, Ryeok.

302
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,970
I can't do this another time.

303
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,460
Let's just end it with this.

304
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,310
Don't look.

305
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,990
Make sure you don't get caught by the CEO.

306
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,410
It's all up to how you two behave.

307
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,940
Let's keep the secret between us for now. The more people know, the further it will spread.

308
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,920
Let's do a "fighting."

309
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,580
Don't look!

310
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,450
Good morning!

311
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,910
Welcome.

312
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,890
Hello... Who are you...?

313
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,860
I'm the part-time worker.

314
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,410
Oh, they finally found got one.

315
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,600
Nice to meet you. I'm—

316
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,820
Are you going to order?

317
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,560
Vanilla latte...

318
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,520
That's 5,900 (~$5.90).

319
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,270
I'm a member of Tea Party, an artist under JH Entertainment.

320
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,730
I'm a part-timer for Cafe H.

321
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,890
Tea Party or whatever, I don't really know.

322
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,430
The price for Cafe H's vanilla latte

323
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,170
is 5,900₩.

324
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,340
Would you like to order?

325
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,070
Ma Ha!

326
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,260
She doesn't give in.

327
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,910
- Boss!
- CEO.

328
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,350
You need to pay.

329
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,140
I had to, too.

330
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,140
By any chance, can I put it on a tab?

331
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,820
Since a reliable part-timer has arrived...

I'm worried about the filming for the movie,

I've been lying down all day and feeling stiff. I feel like I need to work.

339
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,670
I can see through it all. Do you think I don't know what you're thinking about?

Don't go. I said, I can't let you go like this!

Jae Woo, you need to pay more attention to the group.

350

Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

Dae Kwon does supervise, but

352
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,360
he's too nice of a person. I can't trust him completely.

Yes.

Yes, I know.

356

As the team leader, make sure to keep your position well.

357
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,130
Make sure to report immediately if there's anything we need to know about.

358
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,890
I'll make sure you have nothing to worry about.

Don't worry, I'll be discharged in two days.

Ma Ha, wait for two days.

Your lines and the dance are not a problem, but I'm worried.

That you're more precious than anyone else.

Are you bragging to someone who has never dated?

What should I reply with?

392

At least it's sent now.

I think I told you I don't want to be involved with SHAX.

498
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,570
I'll leave for today.

499
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,010
Okay, sure.

500
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,190
Hey...

501
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,150
Not as SHAX,

502
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,790
but think of it as just me, Lee Hyun.

503
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,830
What?

504
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,150
Think about it a little.

505
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,270
She does not give me a chance.

506
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,100
Hyung! It's this vibe we have going.

507
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,950
You know that... You wouldn't know.

508
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,250
Be careful.

509
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,990
Get some sleep.

510
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,010
- Hyung...
- What now?

511
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,760
Okay.

512
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,410
They say to lend your wife but not your car.

513
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,540
You don't have a wife.

514
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,350
Ryeok, Ryeok. Gently, gently!

515
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,270
You better not get a scratch on it.

516
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,970
Gently...

517
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,700
Seatbelt.

518
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,250
Yes.

519
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,840
Let's go.

520
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,220
Our first date.

521
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,170
It's here, quiet and secluded.

522
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,340
Right, it is quite secluded.

523
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,650
But... they apparently take photos from across the river.

524
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,760
Across... the river?

525
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,680
Crow tit,

526
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,830
shall we kiss?

527
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,540
Oh, my!

528
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,630
Sure.

529
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,410
No.

530
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,410
Here.

531
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,360
A must-go holy place for dating.

532
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,620
It's literally a holy place.

533
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,580
Let's go.

534
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,570
Going on a drive is nice, right?

535
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:15,040
Yeah, but the scenery is the same.

536
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,370
I drive well, don't I?

537
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,410
You are great at making turns.

538
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,940
Sunbaenim... do you possibly have any medicine for motion sickness?

539
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,820
You were just on cloud nine with your excitement. Why are you moping again?

540
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,760
I really don't know.

541
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,180
You have a commercial shoot tomorrow, so sleep well. I'll wake you up at eight tomorrow.

542
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,470
Be punctual! Maintain your face!

543
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:48,610
I won't let you use the excuse of being sick twice.

544
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,490
Bye.

545
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,230
It's not easy, is it?

546
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,760
That's right. It's not easy.

547
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,670
You have to look out for Dae Kwon. You don't have any place to go to, neither any time on your hands.

548
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,350
You were just excited and all blown up till your bubble broke.

549
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,610
There was nowhere to go, so I just drove for two hours.

550
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,780
You didn't go to Han River, right?

551
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,510
That place is off-limits. No, no, no.

552
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,050
You know, they stake out there for all hours, right?

553
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,270
We didn't go there.

554
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,710
What about the arboretum? It's quiet and—

555
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,940
No way! An actor couple got busted there last week.

556
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,350
It's a known place now.

557
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:35,090
Wait, that means you just went round and round for your first date?

558
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,130
Round and round?

559
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,990
Want some help?

560
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,350
Help?

561
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,160
Should we help out this once?

562
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,130
March forward!

563
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,380
Forward!

564
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,740
What are you so happy about?

565
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,450
Startled me.

566
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,510
Is something going on with you?

567
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,560
What is?

568
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,370
Is something troubling you?

569
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,720
Tell me. I'll listen.

570
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,550
So there's an A and a B.

571
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,090
- Hold on.
- Why?

572
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,650
- Use C and D.
- Why?

573
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,700
Because A and B already have a happy ending.

574
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,370
Go with C and D.

575
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,770
Okay, sure.

576
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,000
So there's C and D.

577
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,110
C is aggravating and annoying, but it's not exactly disliking.

578
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,170
Hold on. Things don't work out? Do you keep getting concerned?

579
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,210
Yes. Yes!

580
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,150
What am I supposed to do?

581
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,210
Hyung, please pick me up at five tomorrow. Be punctual.

582
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,720
What? What do you mean five o'clock?

583
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,880
Oh, no, make it four. Four o'clock! I'll see you then.

584
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,250
Are you filming a drama in the middle of the night?!

585
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,250
Make sure to be there on time!

586
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,310
Psycho!

587
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,610
Hello?

588
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,790
What are you suddenly doing here at this time?

589
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,900
What if someone sees?

590
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,030
Who is going to see?

591
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,520
Did you put on makeup?

592
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,150
In case someone saw...

593
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,360
Look at your arms. They are just rolling.

594
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,750
I saw your face, so I should get going.

595
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,080
- What?
- Shooting.

596
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,950
Hurry up!

597
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,830
I'll get going.

598
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,620
I said I know.

599
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,430
Hurry go, go.

600
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,280
We'll be late, go quickly!

601
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,930
Leave quickly. We're late!

602
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,630
♫ To be my lover ♫

603
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,210
♫ To be my lover ♫

604
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,760
♫ To be my lover ♫

605
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,940
Just a moment, please.

606
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,190
I am not having fun.

607
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,990
Unni!

608
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,620
Didn't he come yet?

609
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,340
Not yet.

610
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,770
But did you not say that I was filming together with Ryeok?

611
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,370
Hello.

612
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,100
Are you okay?

613
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:20,140
I know you were hospitalized, but you should still be punctual.

614
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,560
Ah, what shall I say?

615
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,120
"I miss you."

616
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,150
"I am missing you"?

617
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,970
What are you doing?

618
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,740
What?

619
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:11,350
Who changed your aura like this?

620
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,000
Are you dating?

621
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:20,350
Is your silence a yes?

622
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,040
That's right.

623
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,210
- Who is it?
- Now, now...

624
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,620
I cannot tell you that.

625
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,380
Hey, Ryeok—

626
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,780
Since when did Ryeok start dating Lee Ma Ha?

627
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,360
What?!

628
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,760
Damn, I asked you not to tell anyone!

629
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,880
Do you think I would have told her?

630
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,980
Bingo!

631
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,610
My hunch is never wrong.

632
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,020
Please keep it a secret.

633
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:58,140
I thought it would be me. It's a bit shocking.

634
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,250
I am waiting. Will you come to me?

635
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,360
But I am not messing around.

636
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,880
Neither am I.

637
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,360
Please keep this a secret. This must not leak!

638
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,170
Okay.

639
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,260
Kwon Ryeok, stop smiling.

640
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,010
You are making it too obvious that you are dating.

641
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,900
Hey, I'm in the wrong, right?

642
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,320
It seems I am the one who made a blunder.

643
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,340
Do I really make it obvious?

644
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:51,200
Why?

645
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:56,190
I don't feel like filming today.

646
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,480
Shall we begin?

647
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,750
[Tea Party]

648
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:40,490
Will he smile at me if I behave like Ma Ha?

649
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,420
When do you finish?

650
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,650
I am still filming. I won't be able to see you today.

651
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,410
Ma Ha, they are doing the next scene.

652
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,100
Yes.

653
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,960
Here, eat.

654
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,570
I asked you guys to eat.

655
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,820
You are going to lose weight anyway. Better eat and then lose it.

656
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,700
At least, that is how you will get motivated to do it. Sit down.

657
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,890
Excuse me, Sunbaenim we really appreciate the gesture, but

658
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:25,150
if they the company finds out...

659
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,820
It's okay because I got it for you.

660
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,230
The company would not say anything. Come sit quickly.

661
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:34,550
Then I will help myself. I was really hungry.

662
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,320
Are you not going to eat, Sunbaenim?

663
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,650
Am I the same as you guys?

664
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,820
Then...

665
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,420
thank you for the food!

666
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,350
Lee Ma Ha!

It's too late.

668
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,600
I miss him.

669
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,940
Then you can just see me.

670
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:43,640
How did you come here?

671
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,420
Hyeok told me that your schedule was done.

672
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,410
How about not running away this time?

673
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,910
Oh? Are you not taking deep breaths anymore?

674
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,780
You were super embarrassed on the call, though.

675
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,940
There will be more things to make you take deep breaths from now on.

676
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,770
Where is this place?

677
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,790
Just follow me.

678
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,050
Put your mask on.

679
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,130
Really?

680
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,680
That's Kim Ji Min!

681
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,020
Pretend like you did not see.

682
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,960
It smells and tastes great.

683
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,390
I can't believe I am drinking coffee with SHAX's Kwon Ryeok at this time in the morning.

684
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,070
A star shining brightly in the dark night,

685
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:24,280
started shining brightly next to me, one fine morning.

Oh it's so hot!

689
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,490
Where did he hide it?

690
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,500
Seriously!

There is a problem. We have been caught on camera together.

700
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,490
I had gone to the hospital that day to meet Kwon Ryeok.

701
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,190
Do the others know that you are going around dating?

702
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,710
Do they?!

703
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,950
Please write an article.

704
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:25,570
You will owe me one if I write the article.

He must be really embarassed.

706
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,070
It's our sixth year as SHAX. I want us to go till the end without being swayed.

707

Guys, what do we do now?

708
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,770
Both the article and the lawsuit, it's all your plan, right?

709
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,340
I am warning you. Don't touch my kids!
