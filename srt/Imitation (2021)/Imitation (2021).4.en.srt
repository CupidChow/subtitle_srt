- Ah.
- Oh, I am tired.

5
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,740
Hey, kids, your clothes are finally here.

6
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,780
- Our stage outfits?
- Amazing!

7
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,340
Our stage outfits.

8
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,130
Daebak!

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,190
You can't see me at all, can you?

10
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,910
Hello!

11
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,590
And this is your outfit to wear on your way to the music show.

12
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,290
You should draw attention from the very beginning.

13
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,120
It's so cute!

14
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,740
You guys don't see me either, do you?

15
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,060
It came out at last.

16
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,570
Annie, our album came out.

17
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,760
Are you watching?

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,610
I am not here to ask you to make our debut go well.

19
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,030
Just don't be hurt anymore and be at peace.

20
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,100
You can't be upset that we are 'Tea Party' now instead of 'Omega III.'

21
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,930
It is an Omega III song sung by Tea Party.

22
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,670
The song that you practiced.

23
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,810
You will tell us that we did well and congratulate us, right?

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,790
I will do my best to fill your shoes.

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,430
I was a bit late.

26
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,190
Doesn't this feel like déjà vu?

27
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,820
Don't say anything.

28
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
We need to start moving from early morning.

29
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,120
Let's not think about anything and sleep quickly.

30
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,170
Can't you sleep either?

31
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,590
No. We need to sleep.

32
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,900
Then let's hold hands and sleep.

33
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,290
Okay.

34
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,640
- I like you guys so much.
- Me too.

35
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,030
- Sleep tight.
- Sleep tight.

36
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,700
I will park and follow you guys. It's your day, so don't feel down. Fighting!

Yes, PD-nim we just arrived.

Come to the meeting room quickly.

40
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,110
Sure.

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,660
Hello, we are always happy Tea Party!

Let's go.

Hey, Yu Jin.

Hey, Ma Ha.

We finally meet here.

This day finally came.

00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,340
- Congratulations!
- You, too.

48
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,100
We need to reduce the screen time for the rookies.

49
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,320
How can you do this suddenly?

50
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,290
I am also a salaryman. If they ask me from the top to take them out, I have to follow that.

51
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,010
Still, this is not right.

52
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,670
Do you think I am doing this on purpose?

53
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,360
Who knew that Shax, who never come to live music shows, would turn up out of nowhere like this?

54
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,240
Anyway, as the rehearsal is in an hour,

55
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
prepare an MR of two minutes.
(T/N: MR is music recorded)

56
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,360

- CEO Park...
- Doesn't this mean that our kids won't be able to debut today?

59
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,820
They are truly the Devil's children.

60
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,770
Why is Shax coming to this show?

61
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,400
Why are they asking us to prepare something for two minutes?

62
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,240
How did it go?

63
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,370
It is hard.

64
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,130
Just three minutes.

65
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,810
Ah, you scared me! Congratulations, Hyung!

66
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,920
Ah, it's really hard.

67
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,390
It looks like they got a spot.

68
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,330
Looks like I still got it.

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,000
Hey, Park Jin Man!

70
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,030
Don't be so angry, Ji Hak. It's not good for your health.

71
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,140
It was your doing, right?

72
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,600
You said that the business in this field with the kids is an easy one.

73
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,980
That it involves blowing their noses and cleaning up their shit.

74
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,310
You have it all wrong. This is not a business at all.

75
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,780
It's a dream, a dream that the kids put their life on the line for!

76
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,250
You will definitely pay for this.

77
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,360

78
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,750

[Shax Pre-recording]

80
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,550
This does not make any sense. Then what's gonna happen to us?

81
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,160
You will perform on the stage, what else?

82
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,690
Ah, this is befuddling. Why did Shax have to appear out of nowhere?

83
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,100
Hyung, we are fine, right?

84
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,000
It's only a problem for the teams who are debuting today.

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,960
Tell me about it. What is with those 'Tea Party' people, repeatedly?

86
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,830
The place makes a person.

87
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,650
So you guys also need to make this a hit to avoid looking bad.

88
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,180
If you don't want to do this, then do you want to go back home?

89
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,260
At this rate, you guys will get off the stage in two seconds instead of two minutes.

90
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,990
How do we prepare for a two-minute show right away?

91
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,880
I think we are back to square one.

92
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,370
Argh, we are done for thanks to Shax!

93
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,230
We are so done for.

94
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,480
- You have to do well, you get me?
- Yes.

95
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,120
Stop. Stop! Omega III can't go on air today.

96
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,720
Then do you want to give up?

97
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,520
I'll make sure what happened three years ago doesn't happen again.

98
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,200
Trust your CEO.

99
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
Because I trust you, too.

100
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,680
What's with this morning radio? Even the roads are free of cars!

101
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,240
You're right. We need to stop your CEO, who sends you all over the place.

102
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,690
- What is it?
- Notifications are going crazy regarding SHAX.

103
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,720
What about SHAX?

104
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,040
Apparently, they're going on music shows.

105
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,560
Really?

106
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,850
What is this? Coming to your senior's dressing room.

107
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,820
It's quite noisy for someone who has their stage ahead.

108
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,970
What you said at that press conference three years ago, looks like it was all bluffing.

109
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,100
"From now on, SHAX doesn't plan to appear on music programs."

110
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,860
We will not on go music programs for the benefit of our junior singers.

111
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,990
We have a lot to do.

112
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,770
When we debuted, we also cut down our precious song to fit a two minute stage.

113
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,070
As time went on, we thought,

114
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,100
"just like we experienced,"

115
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,730
"Are we taking away our juniors' time?"

116
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,690
If we don't stand on the stage,

117
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,600
For junior singers, that time

118
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,310
would allow them to perform the song in its entirety. That's what I heard.

119
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,730
Hey! Don't you know your place?

120
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,320
Don't make a big deal out of this and leave!

121
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,550
Tell me!

122
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,860
To you, the three minutes is a way for you to earn money but

123
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,410
for us, every minute on the stage

124
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,750
is our dream.

125
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,880
What's with the vibe here?

126
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,570
I wanted to give my congratulations on your comeback after a long time but

127
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,280
you, don't you know there's a time and place for everything?

128
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,030
How long has it been since you've debuted?

129
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,530
Do they or the company decide whether to appear on music programs?

130
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,760
You must know that already.

131
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,020
It doesn't look like I should congratulate you.

132
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,870
Contact me once you feel better.

133
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,240
No, call me if even if you don't. Okay?

134
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,700
Must be embarrassing.

135
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,640
La Ri Ma was here.

136
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,600
All of us in SHAX share the same opinion.

137
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,210
We've promised our fans to see them at our concert, and

138
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,940
this is a matter to respect for our junior singers.

139
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,150
Please exclude our appearance this time.

140
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,700
Ryeok.

141
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,380
Back then, we let you do the interview because we were proud you were thinking about your juniors.

142
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,220
Music programs that don't bring in much profit and have an effect on sales...

143
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,290
it was about time we stopped anyway.

144
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,590
The contract that the members don't know about

145
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,780
is still valid.

146
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,600
What are you doing this early?

147
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,850
Sorry. I got this urgent project to work on.

148
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,300
What is urgent? You must be urgent to make money!

149
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,350
You kept going on and on about turnover. Don't ruin my work because you want to make a small sum.

150
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,500
How much do you need?

151
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,360
It's not money! They need my song.

152
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,110
I'm going to release this under my name.

153
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,290
You need my song but...

154
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,380
What?

155
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,910
♪ We will give everyone a sorcery melody ♪

156
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,880
♪ Now I want to cheer up the sky ♪

157
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,810
It's here. The MR.

158
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,790
They're probably sensitive because it's been a while since they've had a comeback.

159
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,720
Don't misunderstand anything.

160
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,000
Make sure something like that doesn't happen again.

161

322
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,060
We aren't mentioned. Why only Ma Ha? What about us?

323
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,230
Right, Hyun Ji?

324
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,760
Right.

325
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,180
Obviously.

326
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,420
Lia, Hyun Ji, and Ma Ha. We're Tea Party.

327
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,720
Should we each make a wish?

328
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,860
Okay! Hyun Ji, you start.

329
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,920
Do I have to say it?

330
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,630
What is this secretive talk between us?

331
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,220
What is it?

332
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,840
You do have something, right, Hyun Ji?

333
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,690
Okay. Whatever the wish is, I hope it comes true.

334
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,930
I'd like that too.

335
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,380
Let's make the wishes quicker.

336
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,190
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

337
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,040
Even if it wasn't a jackpot, it's a relief the reaction was better than we thought.

338
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,460
You guys worked hard. Let's wait for our next schedules.

339
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,590
Yes!

340
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,730
- Take a lot of rest.
- Thank you.

341
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,860
It would have gone better if someone didn't butt in.

342
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,680
It's ok. Stop thinking about it.

343
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,350
We can just do better next time.

344
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,420
Let's go out. We don't have anything scheduled.

345
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,230
I'm a bit tired.

346
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,050
Next time.

347
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,860
[Ma Ha]

348
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,290
We ate the cake. You're the only one I have!

349
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,760
I don't have anything scheduled for tomorrow. Do you want to meet?

350
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,100
Tomorrow isn't possible. How about the day after tomorrow?

351
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,250
Let's meet at the cafe.

352
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,090
Okay.

353
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,440
"You're the only one I have".

354
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,820
Hyung! Help me out.

355
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,680
Lift it properly!

356
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,200
Omg! Omg!

357
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,460
Seok hyung!

358
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,260
Lift it properly!

359
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,550
Hyung!

360
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,370
Hyung!

361
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,360
I couldn't come to my mentor's studio with empty hands.

362
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,170
Congratulations.

363
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,130
[Congratulations on your song, Ammonite]
[Ammonite, the best in the whole universe]

364
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,360
Well, it's a bit small,

365
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,660
but you are Ammonite, the best in the whole universe.

366
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,550
Thank you.

367
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,910
How is it?

368
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,010
It's always a little lacking.

369
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,090
I like it.

370
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,440
What is it?

371
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,940
Seong Ah Hyung is being investigated for taking propofol.

372
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,450
What are you talking about?

373
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,460
I don't see any news article, though.

374
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,430
They are holding it back as they asked not to disclose it yet.

375
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,410
But because this is related to Lee Jong Wook...

376
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,390
- Can you really stab me?
- There is no reason I cannot.

377
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,580
I am the Ijojeonrang's daughter.
(T/N: Ijojeonrang was a very high ranked govt. official in the Joseon era.)

378
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,350
[NOG]

379
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,690
What happened?

380
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:35,300
The source sent to the fact check side before was about Lee Jong Wook's propofol drug abuse.

381
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,830
But it all got tied together.

382
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,430
They are the ones who gave a cause to film again, so manage the contract properly.

383
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,560
Anyway, ask them not to drag this on for long.

384
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,770
I won't do it.

385
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,300
Why not?

386
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,160
It's a role that you wanted so much, acting next to Kwon Ryeok.

387
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,500
I have repeatedly told you, right?

388
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,000
Acting is not for me.

389
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,150
The moment I start acting, the image I have built up will flow out the window.

390
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,520
Kids who are worse actors are also doing it.

391
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,890
Ah, it's up to them.

392
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,960
And I am La Ri Ma.

393
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,600
I won't stand in for some druggie who got fired.

394
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,780
Still, it's Kwon Ryeok.

395
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,740
Even if it's Kwon Ryeok, I won't do what I don't want to.

396
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,720
Tell them I can sing the OST if it's a duet with Ryuk.

397
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,820
They contacted saying La Ri Ma won't be able to do it.

398
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,810
Is that so?

399
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,490
She fits the role perfectly. It's a shame.

400
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,930
Bring your standards down. High-profile people won't take up this role.

401
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,850
Nothing will come out of waiting.

402
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,220
Director, please take an audition. If you drop your standards a bit,

403
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,930
there are a lot of people who want to do it. There's no time. Let's reduce it to some people.

404
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:07,360
This is Lee Ma Ha, who I recommend. She is an idol.

405
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,270
Is she an up-and-coming idol these days?

406
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,780
She became a bit popular as she debuted with quite an impact.

407
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,320
Tea Party?

408
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,090
She's done minor roles too. She's appeared in our movie as well.

409
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,820
Our movie?

410
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,620
The one where she got stabbed by Ryeok.

411
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,590
Ah, it does look like she'll be good for the role, but...

412
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,200
[Ma Ha]

413
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,260
- Yes, Ma Ha?
- I am sorry, Yu Jin.

414
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,910
What?

415
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,520
Ah, I am such a scatterbrain...

416
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,200
I was too busy because of the audition. I forgot that I had to postpone our meeting.

417
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,620
Audition?

418
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,080
Yeah, it's a movie audition. It's because I got it in a rush.

419
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,870
Okay.

420
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,860
It can't be helped.

421
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,060
It's not even once or twice. I am sorry for doing this again.

422
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,930
It's okay. Work comes first.

423
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,280
I am telling you it's fine.

424
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,820
Don't worry about me and have a good audition.

425
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,570
Okay.

426
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,860
"Really,"

427
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,070
"can you really stab me?"

428
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,410
"It's such a relief."

429
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,630
Is it a comedy or a thriller? Looks like a new genre.

430
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,860
What do I do?

431
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,960
Why? It looks like you will do well.

432
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,700
"Lee Ma Ha develops a new genre."

433
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,120
I am really really serious.

434
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,290
They did not even give me more than a day to look at the script.

435
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:20,210
You will burn a hole in the script if you look at it a day more.

436
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,930
Ma Ha, believe in yourself.

437
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,840
All the time you spent on this will prove it.

438
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,330
Okay, then shall we begin?

439
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,550
Yes.

440
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,140
Don't be nervous.

441
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,250
Let's read scene 26.

442
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,120
Page 38 for scene 26.

443
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,120
"Eun's glittering sword gets closer slowly."
(T/N: Eun is the character played by Ryeok.)

444
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,780
"Yeon So, who has turned pale."

445
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,400
"Their wavering gaze settles."

446
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,960
"She opens her mouth with a chilly expression."

447
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,210
"Will you really be able to stab me?"

448
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,080
"There's no reason I cannot."

449
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,220
"I am the Ijojeonrang's daughter."

450
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,590
"Can you actually stab me?"

451
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,420
Wait, wait. You don't have to read the stage directions or other parts.

452
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,330
I was too nervous. I am sorry.

453
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,390
It looks like you memorized all this.

454
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,910
Yes, the script was fun. I kept on practicing too...

455
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,470
I am thankful she came to us because it was fun.

456
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,930
Okay, read Yeon So's parts.

457
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,610
Okay.

458
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,350
"Can you really stab me?"

459
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,160
How did the audition go?

460
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,480
[Movie 'Nang Rang Phi Hwa']

461
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,060
It has her name, too.

462
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,960
Ma Ha you are cool!
[Yeon So role (Lee Ma Ha)]

463
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,370
"Yeon So." What kind of role is it?

464
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,860
I don't have many scenes.

465
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,020
But it's a bit worrying

466
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,570
because Kwon Ryeok is the main lead.

467
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,290
SHAX's Kwon Ryeok?

468
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,990
You got this role all on your own. Don't worry about it.

469
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,590
Still, there's the jacket ruckus from last time.

470
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,560
Insults, curses,

471
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,050
all the way to our debut stage, we are the ones who are suffering.

472
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,040
This is an opportunity that you got all by yourself.

473
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,990
So don't think about anything else and stop worrying.

474
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,360
I told you to believe in yourself, right?

475
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,920
Why did that role go there? Does this even make sense?

476
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,660
Ryuk, shall I tell something to the director?

477
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,780
If you guys get roped in together again, and the CEO comes to know about it, he will be really angry!

478
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,790
What is it that will make me angry?

479
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,500
Lee Ma Ha from Tea Party in Ryeok's movie...

480

But something seems to be missing. Do it with more impact.

509

510
