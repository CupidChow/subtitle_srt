You are so cool

without realizing it, I started to copy you.

Yes.

It's like the noodles became too overcooked even before I eat them!

You should elegantly spit the notes out and bring them back.

00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,800
- What are you doing here?
- I passed for a movie audition.

490
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,360
Really? Lee Yoo Jin!

491
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,400
It's not that big a deal.

492
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,540
Congratulations!

493
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,070
Thank you.

494
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,470
But were you always interested in movies?

495
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,170
I didn't know.

496
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,750
You have debuted in movies first. So Sunbaenim, teach me well.

497
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,090
That's true.

498
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,040
I shall deign to teach you.

499
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,710
Thank you. Then I will recompense you with tteokbokki right now.

500
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,150
Really?

501
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,390
Sunbaenim Kwon Ryeok?

502
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,260
What are you doing here?

503
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,180
Get in.

504
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,370
Hello. I keep running into you in the most unexpected places.

505
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:48,820
You're done, right? Let's go. I'll take you home.

506
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,450
No, it's okay.

507
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,190
I barely got out so that I could take you home. Get in.

508
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,900
You should head in quickly. If someone happens to see you,

509
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,760
it will be Ma Ha who will come under hot water.

510
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,190
What?

511
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:17,450
Even if it's you, I don't see a reason for you to act like this according to your will.

512
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,890
You always talk pretty whenever I see you.

513
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,430
Yoo Jin, it's not like that. It's okay.

514
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,270
Yoo Jin.

515
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,030
I'm sorry, but I'll see you next time.

516
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,330
I got it, so let's go quickly.

517
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,590
Hyung Jae Woo is looking for you right now.

518
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,450
We're in your bed pretending to be you.

519
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,530
Hurry and come home before Hyung Jae Woo finds out.

520
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,890
Oh god!

521
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,660
You sided with me, right?

522
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,690
What side?

523
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,520
Earlier.

524
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,920
You agree, that you took my side?

525
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,390
Why did you come?

526
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,790
Because I missed you.

527
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,420
Hyung! Please look at your messages.

528
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,770
If you saw them, contact us!

529
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,700
Hurry and come!

530
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,430
Emergency! Emergency!

531
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,580
Why didn't you respond? I kept sending you messages.

532
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,560
You changed your number, didn't you?

533
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,470
Give me your number.

534
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,140
How did you know?

535
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,790
Give it to me.

536
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,720
Drop me off over there.

537
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,060
No, I don't want to. Give it to me.

538
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,660
I'm a member of Tea Party. You saw Hyun Ji and Lia, right?

539
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,590
Please drop me off over there.

540
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,000
No...

541
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,920
I'm not trying to do anything. I just want to send you messages.

542
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,080
I hate all this crying and whining.

543
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,260
Seriously!

544
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,600
I dated you for a few months because you were an NOG trainee.

545
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,050
If you call me once more, I won't say nice words.

546
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,740
So annoying.

547
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,490
What were you listening to?

548
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,860
You stand out a lot these days. Be careful.

549
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,500
Hyung, you should be the one to be careful.

550
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,870
That bastard.

551
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,300
Where did you take my car?

552
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,060
Ryeok. Did you forget that we wouldn't keep secrets from each other?

553
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,430
- It's nothing.
- Turning a blind eye...

554
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,100
I'm not going to do it anymore.

555
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,350
Explain the situation properly.

556
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,550
Answer me, Kwon Ryeok!

557
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,450
- Let go.
- Calm down.

558
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,980
Wow, wow.

559
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:19,410
Get lost. I'm not joking. I'm asking him as the leader of SHAX.

560
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,430
Jae Woo, talk later.

561
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,070
I'm sorry.

562
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,940
The only thing I can say right now is that I'm sorry.

563
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,510
I'm sorry.

564
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,080
- Hey!
- Hyung.

565
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,860
Don't forget that you're a part of SHAX!

566
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,680
Hyung!

567
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,750
I like Kwon Ryeok.

568
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,360
I can go by myself from here.

569
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:13,330
Goodbye!

570
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,720
Sunbaenim.

571
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,650
Don't forget that you're a part of SHAX!

572
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,640
Okay! We'll continue after a five-minute break.

573
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,170
You haven't even eaten properly.

574
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,960
Drink this.

575
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,790
It looks like you're overworking yourself.

576
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,450
You're the one who told me not to think of other things and focus on work.

577
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,820
That was...

578
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,600
It's fine. I'll end up having a hard time twice over whenever I have time anyways.

579
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,640
Since it keeps on coming to mind.

580
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,420
What!

581
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,360
Hello!

582
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,910
What's this? Why are you here?

583
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,270
It's a small role, but I'll do my best!

584
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,940
Please take care of me.

585
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,650
Sure.

586
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,570
I'm sorry.

587
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:55,180
I'm sorry.

588
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,000
It's okay.

589
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,680
Let's go again.

590
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,180
Are you okay?

591
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,490
You must have been nervous. I'm sorry.

592
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,340
It's okay.

593
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,200
Hey!

594
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,960
Are you okay?

595
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,160
I'm okay.

596
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,600
[Love Virus]

597
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,070
How many dance covers are there?

598
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,760
Are you practicing all of them?

599
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,370
Yes.

600
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,390
It must be tiring.

601
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:16,970
Don't think about other things and just practice, or you'll get hurt.

602
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,680
You're right.

603
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,520
You have been blanking out often these days. It's obvious that your mind is cluttered.

604
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:28,290
I'm sorry for that day.

605
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:31,150
I was too ahead of myself.

606
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,580
I'm sorry I couldn't be encouraging.

607
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,690
No, I'm sorry.

608
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:41,500
I won't blank out anymore, and I'll get my act together. So don't worry too much.

609
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,790
I'm okay!

610
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,820
Let's go together!

611
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,550
Where?

612
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,920
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

613
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,540
You stay and the rest, follow me.

614
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,020
Show more anxiety with your eyesight.

615
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,580
- Okay.
- I think that will do.

616
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,730
It was good, right?

617
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:28,230
Alright, let's prep for the drifting scene!

618
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,210
1, 2, 3!

619
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,790
Cue!

620
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,300
Alright. We'll do it this way!

621
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,680
Because you're doing it yourself, it looks really good.

622
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,640
We'll go over the action moves and then go straight into shooting.

623
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,050
Let's go over them and then try to get it in one take if you're okay with it.

624
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,130
We'll try it in one take!

625
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,870
Yoo Jin, first! Straight!

626
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:19,230
Dodge. Throw a fist, and then kick.

627
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,330
Alright, grab him, overthrow him.

628
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,170
Kick from the back.

629
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,060
Grab, and kick.

630
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,580
Then, throw him over.

631
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,530
Yoo Jin goes in, left, right.

632
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,260
Alright, grab.

633
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,200
Switch places.

634
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,060
Push!

635
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,350
Then, kick!

636
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:38,930
Looks good.

637
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:39,820
We'll go with that.

638
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,550
Yes. Let's get going.

639
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,620
Yes.

640
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,150
Alright, now with your left hand.

641
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,050
Yes. Now hook.

642
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,420
Alright, one, two, three.

643
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,920
Great. We'll go like this.

644
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:56,450
Hey! Lee Yoo Jin!

645
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,630
Remove the kicking,

646
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,700
I'll just add some action here.

647
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,310
Yes. Let's go with that.

648
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,810
Yes. I got it.

649
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:11,220
We'll start shooting!

650
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,290
1, 2, 3... Fighting!

651
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:18,400
We're ready.

652
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,220
Okay, sure.

653
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,310
Wow.

654
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,850
Ma Ha! Are you here to watch?

655
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:33,040
Hello.

656
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,980
We're ready, right?

657
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,720
Alright. If you're ready, we'll get going!

658
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,460
1, 2, 3!

659
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,360
Cue!

660
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,450
Ryeok!

661
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,950
Ryeok!

662
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,890
Ryeok!

663
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:30,510
Ryeok!

664
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,740
Ryeok, wake up!

665
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,000
Ryeok!

666
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,870
[Epilogue]

667
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:54,760
There are no troubles amongst the members these days, right?

668
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:00,350
Don't be afraid and tell me.

669
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:04,130
You're the leader, Jae Woo.

670
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,890
It's all for the team, so just tell the truth.

671
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,780
It's just that...

672
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,960
I think Eun Jo has a girlfriend.

673
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,230
One that he's been dating for a while.

674
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,170
Is that so?

675
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:25,200
Tell me more.

676
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,780
[Imitation]

677
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,430
Come to your senses.

678
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,660
Ryeok. Come to your senses.

679
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,690
How much did he try to do?

680
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,800
It's clear he did it on purpose.

681
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,520
There's not much you can do here.

682
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,790
But I still want to be here until he wakes up.

683
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,480
You're probably not here to grab a coffee.

684
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,340
Eun Jo is back in Korea, isn't he?

685
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,560
Where is he right now?

686
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,150
Have you thought about what I said last time?

687
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:55,000
I think I told you I don't want to have anything to do with SHAX.

688
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,690
Please get up quickly.

689
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,730
I like you, Sunbaenim!
