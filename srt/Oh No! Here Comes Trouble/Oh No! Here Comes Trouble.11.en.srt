00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,170
How did you get in?

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,820
Did you sneak in?

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,470
Why should I sneak in?

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,050
I just walked in.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,950
Do you remember what was on the floor of the ruins?

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,130
Broken ceramic tiles,

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,310
stones, and things like that.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,270
It's better to change it to blue.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,990
What about the roof?

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,360
She can tell who the person is just by the footsteps.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,730
And so is the conversation.

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,830
She often meets someone there.

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,250
Ms. Chen.

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,270
I heard that

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,320
the prosecutor has come to my husband several times.

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,980
He said that he was staying with me

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,970
because it was really embarrassing

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,340
to be left alone

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,200
while having a meal with a girl.

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,660
-So this... -He was following you.

22
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,090
-I'm thinking... -I'm sorry.

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,960
I'm not feeling well.

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,390
I need to use the restroom.

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,090
Are you okay, Jingmei?

26
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,970
Please give me a new one. Thank you.

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,340
Your husband saw you leaving.

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,020
He quickly paid the bill and followed you.

29
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,870
But he didn't enter the ruins.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,970
You've been together for so long.

31
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,100
He probably didn't ask you anything.

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,620
I met him first before I came here.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,400
It can't be helped.

34
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,750
That's how I do things.

35
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,340
Whether there is or is not, whether it's true or not,

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,750
I want to figure it out.

37
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,800
I can't have such a big doubt in my heart and

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,260
live with this person.

39
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,350
Isn't he amazing?

40
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,039

[Episode 11]

43
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,100
I went to medical school

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,690
to become a doctor,

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,190
but not to save people.

46
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,310
I just wanted to be a doctor.

47
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,580
I don't want to admit that he,

48
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,060
Pu Yiyong,

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,800
is more like a policeman and a doctor than us, right?

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,930
-Yes. -I forget about it every time.

Cao Guangyan!

54
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,570
So how do we assign this?

55
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,079
Assign what?

56
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,110
You should have finished it at home, okay?

57
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,910
Can you check whether I am right?

58
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,950
Am I right?

59
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,620

65
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,210
You always go to the police station.

66
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,170
Why don't you discuss it with your parents

67
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,000
and try to become a police officer?

68
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,080
If you're too shy to say anything,

69
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,730

Yao...

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,980
So is he your son?

77
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,040
Where's my cup?

78
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,410
When will you give it back to me?

79
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,220
Didn't you say we'll meet at the same place?

80
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,840
Isn't it the police station?

81
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,520
I don't want to blame you anymore.

82
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,500
Since we don't have a tacit understanding,

83
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,550
you should've written down the location from the start.

84
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,710
So it's true.

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,100
Someone often met
Xie He'an in the ruins.

86

But I'll find a way.

91
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,800
I said I would find a way or he'll look like that again.

92
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,700

I'm a bad guy who only knows how to take advantage of others?

98

He asked me to save his brother.

103
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Then he wrote Bi Fu

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,520
You came to see me.

190
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,030
Is it about him?

191
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,880
Who?

192
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,540
Your father?

193
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,800
-No, he's still in prison. -About him,

194
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,090
don't come to me.

195
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,840
Sorry, I have to go to work.

196
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,920
But I just saw the younger brother, Yang Yu, this morning.

197
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,140
What are you?

198
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,060
Obsession.

199
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,460
Come on.

200
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,020
Before...

201
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,380
We've done this so many times. You still don't get it?

202
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,700
But they are twins.

203
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,950
The child was not Xie He'an either.

204
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,350
You're not Yang Yu.

205
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,790
Come out.

206
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,010
You are not professional.

207
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,390
You didn't put out the cigarette until I pulled you here.

208
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,480
[Smoking Area]

209
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,750
You should have some common sense even if you're not human.

210
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,770
That's a ward.

211
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,180
No one saw it.

212
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,310
Am I not human?

213
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,780
Isn't my grandpa human?

214
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,740
Stay away from my grandpa.

215
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,170
No.

216
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,260
I can't stay too far away from him.

217
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,620
Do you know how many times his heart stopped today?

218
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,160
If

219
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,670
I get all the paper,

220
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,400
can I make a wish?

221
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,220
Do you think that's a dragon ball?

222
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,110
No, it is not.

223
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,840
You can.

224
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,570
But I can only

225
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,890
grant you one kind
of wish.

226
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,650
Do you mean one wish?

227
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,440
It's a kind of wish.

228
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,270
If you make a wrong wish,

229
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,780
I can't help it either.

230
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,940
But you,

231
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,080
when will you help me fulfill my wish?

232
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,090
You saw

233
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,020
the things about the twins.

234
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,510
Upsetting, isn't it?

235
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,930
These kinds of bad things

236
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,780
happen every day.

237
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,440
You're just a delivery man.

238
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,250
How many can you manage?

239
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,270
I'm not a delivery man now.

240
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,640
You'd better fulfill my wish.

241
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,970
Think about it.

242
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,380
I'll go first.

243
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,780
Your dad is still in prison.

244
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,110
I don't know and I don't care if he's okay or not.

245
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,400
I came to you to know

246
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,820
about you and your brother nine years ago.

247
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,430
Of course.

248
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,600
I can't tell you the reason.

249
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,880
You said last time,

250
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,830
"You didn't want to listen."

251
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,620
Who are "you"?

252
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,430
Police,

253
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,250
and

254
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,100
the man who saved me.

255
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,870
Please tell me the details at that time.

256
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,840
It won't rain today.

257
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,830
They must be here.

258
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,500
Are you kidding?

259
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,520
That boy went to your house twice, and

260
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,220
it both rained.

261
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,950
When it rained yesterday,

262
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,050
they disappeared.

263
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,330
So it must have something to do with the rain.

264
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,950
My brother and I

265
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,980
were most afraid of rain

266
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,990
because the factory had an iron roof.

267
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,960
It was loud when it rained.

268
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,240
We couldn't hear anything else,

269
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,800
especially his voice,

270
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,770
my dad's footsteps.

271
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,710
Whenever it rained,

272
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,200
he drank when he was unhappy.

273
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,160
When he was drunk,

274
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,450
he threw things.

275
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,610
We preferred him to throw things.

276
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,610
At least we could hear where he was.

277
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,010
We were afraid when he quieted down.

278
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,550
If we were lucky,

279
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,170
he slept.

280
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,940
If we were unlucky,

281
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,560
he came to us.

282
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,140
At that time,

283
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,560
my brother would go out to check on the situation.

284
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,260
He would tell me...

285
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,850
It's okay.

286
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,560
It's better than both of us getting beaten up.

287
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,110
Don't go.

288
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,260
You want me to save your brother.

289
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:24,980
How can I save him?

290
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,670
I thought so too.

291
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,830
You must have no idea.

292
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,750
Do you know that your brother is behind you?

293
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,990
Do you know what obsession is?

294
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,710
It means that you can't let go of something.

295
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,810
You guys were born from obsession, right?

296
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,100
Do you know what kind of obsession it is?

297
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,320
What is it?

298
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,340
The elder brother is an obsession.

299
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,020
What do you mean?

300
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,760
He is behind me.

301
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,020
There is no one.

302
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:20,950
There is him.

303
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,230
He's writing.

304
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,190
Writing...

305
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,720
What's wrong?

306
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,980
Why aren't you copying it?

307
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,270
It's too complicated. I can't copy it.

308
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,780
Too complicated...

309
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,340
It was raining heavily and cold that day.

310
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,660
My brother was beaten up like that and was locked outside in the rain.

311
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,220
I wanted to open the door and let him in.

312
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,140
But I was beaten up

313
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,240
by my dad too.

314
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,800
I saw my brother lying on the ground

315
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,060
from under the door.

316
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,240
But I saw...

317
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,370
You go ahead.

318
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,490
You go.

319
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,310
You go.

320
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,460
No.

321
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,810
You're taller.

322
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,040
It's brighter there.

323
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,610
Wait for me.

324
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,390
Why are you standing there?

325
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,850
It's brighter here.

326
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,140
Why did you call us here?

327
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,190
Dongjun is scared.

328
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,020
I was...

329
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,070
Isn't he the good student

330
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,230
who didn't do anything wrong

331
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:10,950
but is bullied by you, the villain?

332
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,360
You should grow up.

333
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,920
We won't beat him for you.

334
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,410
What a stupid comic!

335
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,480
He can't make it.

336
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,260
Come on.

337
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,210
Do you believe

338
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,650
what I said?

339
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,350
Can you tell me why you came to me?

340
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,980
You can hardly believe what I want to say.

341
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,010
I came to you because

342
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,630
I saw you and your brother in Bifu Factory.

343
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:31,770
No.

344
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,790
It's not you.

345
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,560
Simply put,

346
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,380
your brother, Yang Jing, died nine years ago.

347
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,880
He didn't know that

348
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,200
his brother was saved.

349
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,060
His desire to protect his brother

350
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,610
has become an obsession in the factory.

351
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,550
This obsession created

352
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,060
something with the appearance of his younger brother.

353
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,710
In the past nine years,

354
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,290
his brother has been protecting

355
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,540
the substitute that he thought was his brother

356
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,590
from being hurt by his father.

357
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,740
What do you mean?

358
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,320
I...

359
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,860
I know it's hard to understand,

360
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,710
but this is already very logical...

361
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,680
Are we funny,

362
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,720
my brother and I?

363
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,620
What?

364
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,250
Come with me to the factory.

365
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,300
That place will be burnt down.

366
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm not going.

367
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,590
Because I'm a policewoman.

368
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,020
I can't tell you

369
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,310
whether I believe your words or not.

370
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,280
I have to find the evidence.

371
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,620
So I promise that I will investigate it.

372
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,970
But on the contrary,

373
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,540
you don't have to trust me now.

374
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,640
But you should at least go and see

375
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,530
whether it's true or not in person.

376
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,120
The policewoman

377
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,440
has made it very clear to you, right?

378
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,910
What do you not understand?

379
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,510
Who are you?

380
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,530
Those brothers are still escaping your dad every day.

381
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,190
Even if you want to burn down the factory,

382
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,440
at least let them go.

383
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,790
Then call them over to answer the phone.

384
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,650
It can't be helped.

385
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,750
They can only write

386
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,260
on others' backs.

387
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,910
Luckily I have two translators.

388
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,880
If not, he'll just say, "Save my brother."

389
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,490
Don't worry.

390
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,360
Cao Guangyan and the others are consulting the dictionary.

391
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,520
They will write the right words and let you go.

392
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,430
Okay.

393
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,420
Li Can.

394
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,580
Where is Yang Yu?

395
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,560
[The bad man is in prison.]

396
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,360
What does this mean?

397
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,000
He is just guessing.

398
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,360
This one.

399
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,020
Good.

400
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,200
Who is he?

401
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,900
His surname is Chen.

402
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,210
He said

403
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,380
it's okay. Even if they can't leave,

404
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,680
at least they are still together.

405
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,720
Are you kidding me?

406
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,360
I'll get you out of this place.

407
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,450
Brother.

408
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,700
Then call them over to answer the phone.

409
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,890
It can't be helped.

410
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,680
They can only write

411
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,040
on others' backs.

412
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,900
Luckily I have two translators.

413
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,520
If not, he'll just say, "Save my brother."

414
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,580
Brother!

415
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,510
Brother.

416
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,190
I'm Yang Yu.

417
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,870
Do you remember me?

418
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,330
They told me everything.

419
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,770
You still want to protect me until now.

420
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,670
I'm sorry.

421
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,230
You died because of me.

422
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,100
I was useless.

423
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,490
I only hid behind you.

424
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,520
I was so useless.

425
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:24,620
But...

426
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,000
Don't worry about me anymore.

427
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,760
Look at me.

428
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,110
I've grown up.

429
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,730
I'm not as weak as I used to be.

430
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,190
Don't worry about me anymore.

431
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,050
Look around.

432
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,570
This place is different.

433
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,900
There's no sound of smashing,

434
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,080
or his footsteps.

435
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,260
The rain has stopped.

436
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,070
The rain has stopped.

437
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,720
It's time for you to leave.

438
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,240
You should go.

439
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,140
I'm glad they could see each other again.

440
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,530
I think I know what to write.

441
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:14,560
[Joining twins, holding hands with yin and yang]

442
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,180
How did you know?

443
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,840
Know what?

444
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,400
Can you give it to me?

445
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,330
Yes.

446
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,880
Do you want a ride?

447
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,430
I want to stay a little longer.

448
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,700
Are you really going to burn this place down?

449
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:25,890
It's illegal.

450
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,330
Don't worry.

451
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,610
I won't.

452
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,290
I will investigate

453
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,700
what you saw.

454
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,080
Thank you.

455
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,060
Save my brother.

456
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,300
Why is he still talking about this?

457
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,230
Officer Chen,

458
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:00,680
you should have seen the inspection report

459
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,860
when you came here.

460
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,460
He was beaten up so badly that he was unconscious at that time.

461
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,230
I've handled too many cases like this.

462
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,210
When they were hurt

463
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,400
or in extreme fear,

464
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,190
their memory would be in disorder and misplaced.

465
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,070
So in the end, the police and prosecutors

466
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,400
could only investigate in the direction of the death led by domestic violence.

467
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,850
There was a heart-shaped stain on the white canvas shoes.

468
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,170
Among the social workers that Mr. Huang once led,

469
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,970
was there really a person who

470
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,090
wore shoes with this stain?

471
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,580
At that time,

472
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,590
I was just a supervisor.

473
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,340
I did bring many young social workers and volunteers

474
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,640
to visit homes where cases took place.

475
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,330
But who would remember how their shoes looked like

476
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,050
and what pattern they had?

477
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,110
Even if there were,

478
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,760
at that time,

479
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,760
the children wanted us to save them,

480
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,310
so their memories got confused.

481
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,960
Are there any records of

482
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,980
the volunteers who followed you?

483
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,500
I need to look for it.

484
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,200
If it weren't for

485
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,030
how special they were

486
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:00,860
as twins,

487
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,590
I couldn't possibly have remembered them

488
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,260
given the large number of cases I have handled.

489
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:06,710
You forget it because

490
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,880
it was just a case to you.

491
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,450
But to that kid,

492
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,850
he lost his brother that night.

493
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,480
He still remembers the footsteps.

494
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,120
I'll believe that he saw it first.

495
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,360
We just need more time to verify it.

496
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,940
Please let me know

497
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,390
if you get any information.

498
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,500
At that time, it should be the factory staff

499
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,500
who reported it secretly.

500
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,040
Then, social workers came.

501
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,240
But because my dad was beside us,

502
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,410
we didn't even dare to raise our heads. We just stared at the ground.

503
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,980
I thought that he was

504
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,050
an angel who came to save us.

505
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,540
Because there was a stain on his shoes, and

506
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,290
it had a shape of a heart.

507
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,670
Wait.

508
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,490
It's time for you to leave.

509
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,990
It's time for you to leave.

510
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,020
Is it that bad?

511
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,170
It's not very good.

512
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,360
Then...

513
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,820
I'm sorry.

514
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,380
That's not what I meant.

515
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:20,640
What's wrong?

516
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,520
I will be transferred to the investigation team tomorrow.

517
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,210
Am I really qualified?

518
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,550
Take your time.

519
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,250
I'll cook something delicious

520
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,090
so that you won't cry.

521
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,010
Aren't you from the alcohol test department?

522
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,070
Why are you investigating cases from so long ago?

523
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,300
What alcohol test department?

524
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,080
There's no such department.

525
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,360
I didn't discover those cases.

526
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
You won't believe me even if I tell you.

527
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,420
I believe there are aliens.

528
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,150
What nonsense are you talking about?

529
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:10,930
I believe everything.

530
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,030
[Helping oneself]

531
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,460
These four words together are so annoying.

532
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,200
But

533
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,830
just by looking at this character,

534
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,090
[Kindness]

535
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,150
I really like it.

536
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,280
Let's make it your test paper.

537
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,020
Did I pass it?

538
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,260
You passed it.

539
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,210
So, are you going to make a wish?

540
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,290
I only have one chance to guess right.

541
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,380
I don't want to waste it.

542
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,620
Then will you fulfill my wish?

543
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,760
Only the words I write with all my heart are powerful.

544
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,800
I can't wish someone to die

545
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,290
from the bottom of my heart.

546
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,370
You mentioned the reincarnation devil last time...

547
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:03,820
It's him.

548
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,580
So this is what obsession grows into.

549
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,360
He's in charge of

550
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,460
solving problems related to those weird things.

551
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,120
I should solve humans' problems.

552
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,070
But it's really hard.

553
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,240
Without him, I can't find any clues

554
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,070
or do anything.

555
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,390
Without him,

556
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,710
I wouldn't have found out that

557
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,710
there were true murderers in the two cases.

558
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,970
Should I go back

559
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,060
and be a "three in a line"?

560
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:37,520
They didn't find the culprits back then.

561
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,720
It meant that it was that hard.

562
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,930
Because your friend is not an ordinary person.

563
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,830
Otherwise, what happened so long ago

564
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,180
shouldn't have been discovered.

565
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,500
Fortunately, I have Pu Yiyong as my friend.

566
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,750
Fortunately, you have Pu Yiyong as your friend.

567
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,140
Your friend,

568
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,640
Yiyong...

569
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,300
♫It is like light on the eyes♫

570
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,150
Does he like sweet food?

571
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:08,630
-Maybe he doesn't like it.

572
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,560
♫Stay in my heart♫

573
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:16,630
♫Those regrets transform into longing♫

574
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:12,770
It's okay.

575
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,430
I'll make

576
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,770
a special one for Yiyong

577
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,310
to thank him

578
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,310
for letting Ms. Chen

579
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:19,780
see things she shouldn't see.

580
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,510
♫I didn't hide it or make it public♫

581
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,580
Forget it.

582
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,490
He'll be happier if you give him meat buns.

583
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,110
♫But it's warm enough for me♫

584
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,490
I have an appointment.

585
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,230
Bye.

586
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:31,660
♫It's snowy. It is a place to shelter from the snow♫

587
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,320
Is it a date?

588
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,590
Investigating a case.

589
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:40,510
♫In fact, you're here, as if it's real or fake. The reality is too arrogant♫

590
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:36,180
Thank you.

591
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,010
You always listen to my complaints.

592
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,630
I like Ms. Chen.

593
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:48,300
♫You're always there. When I'm walking on the wire♫

594
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:44,800
Nothing.

595
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:55,560
♫You're always there. The hysterical world is crazy♫

596
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,400
Bye.

597
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,410
Chuying,

598
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,760
although I don't know what's  "three in a line",

599
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:02,250
♫Turn the unbearable into the extraordinary♫

600
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,500
you won't always be a "three in a line".

601
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,740
You don't make a wish first.

602
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,120
How about this?

603
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,400
I'm one of the things in the ruins.

604
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,380
I'll give it to you

605
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,720
as a gift for your passing.

606
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:16,430
No.

607
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,160
It sounds scary.

608
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:19,590
How rude!

609
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,740
That's over a thousand years old.

610
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,670
It's valuable.

611
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,140
It can be sold for a lot of money.

612
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,200
[Help me find out how much I can sell it for.]

613
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,670
[What is this?]

614
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,360
[A thousand-year antique.]

615
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,800
[Selling fakes is fraud.]

616
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,420
Are you Pu Yiyong?

617
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,890
No matter what happens to anyone,

618
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,950
you did nothing wrong.

619
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,430
Don't split hairs.

620
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:11,830
For your mother,

621
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,730
and your friend, Xie He'an,

622
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,120
please try to recall your memory.

623
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:16,860
Did she mention that

624
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,100
she had made some new friends?

625
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,470
Maybe they were adults

626
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,210
rather than classmates.

627
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,850
Have something sweet to calm down.

628
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,520
I will answer the phone, and I'll be right back.

629
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,020
Got it?

630
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:45,580
Director Huang.

631
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,200
Ms. Chen.

632
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,100
Yes, I'm Chen Chuying.

633
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,630
I searched everywhere, and

634
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,570
I found him.

635
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,320
The one who visited the factory with me

636
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:53,580
wasn't a social worker. He was a volunteer.

637
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,430
I have a photo of him taken at the foundation.

638
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,610
I'll send it to you right away.

639
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,770
Okay, thank you.

640
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,980
The third one from the left of the back row.

641
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,180
I only remembered it when I saw him.

642
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,140
He was very thoughtful.

643
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,090
He brought the dessert he made

644
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,130
for the two children.

645
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,630
Officer,

646
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,290
I remember it now.

647
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,970
I saw the cake you gave me.

648
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,340
I remember that An

649
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,680
gave me that kind of cake too.

650
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,470
She said that a big brother gave it to her.

651
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,740
But her mother didn't want An

652
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,500
to be fatter,

653
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,000
so she didn't allow An to eat sweet food.

654
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,270
So An told me not to tell her mother.

655
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,460
Is that Pu Yiyong?

656
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:49,870
Please.

This is a blessing
