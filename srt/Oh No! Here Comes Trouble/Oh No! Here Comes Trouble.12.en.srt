I'm sorry.

00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,470
I have told them many times

that they can't smoke here.

6
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,550
How many times do I have to tell you

Are you a thief?

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,970
You went into my room and searched my house.

15

Turn yourself in.

turn yourself in.

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,100

19
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,550
Why should I turn myself in?

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,009
You left your friend

21
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,560
in a small pond in the mountain area.

22

You...

For the past seven years,

25
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,180
you've been looking at that pot every day.

26
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,210
You say sorry to your friend inside.

27
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,060
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,020
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,979
I didn't mean it.

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,490
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,600
You let the pot grow a human heart.

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,560
It is like a recorder,

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,210
It repeats what has happened.

34
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,010
But if you had no conscience,

35
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,780
I wouldn't have known about this.

36
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,260
Are you writing a ghost story?

37
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,800
You are crazy.

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,240
It's been seven years.

Is my grandpa dead?

47

What do you think?

48
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,230
Your dad was at most

49
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,840
10 or 11 years old by then.

50
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,470
Your grandma took him to the hospital during class.

51
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,390
Your dad said he refused to go to school later.

52
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,460
He wanted to stay in the hospital to keep Grandpa company.

53
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,980
Even after Grandpa was discharged from the hospital, your dad insisted on sleeping with him.

54
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,610
But he woke up from nightmares every day.

55
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,210
Dad?

56
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,840
What did he dream about?

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,310
Your grandpa died.

58
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,120
Although it's scary,

59
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,910
judging from the result,

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,070
it doesn't seem bad.

61
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,650
Your dad said when he was young,

62
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,200
your grandpa seemed to hide something.

63
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,110
He was not close to his family.

64
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,230
But after that,

65
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,970
he was clingy to his family.

66
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,600
He was so clingy that your grandma was sick of him.

67
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,490
Was my grandpa happy?

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,470
I...

69
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,600
I don't know.

70
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,360
There's no reason to be unhappy.

71
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,909
What about you?

72
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,780
Are you happy now?

73
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,760
One night when I went to the hospital,

74
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,940
I saw you in the smoking room.

75
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,090
I can explain, but you won't believe me.

76
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,780
I believe you.

77
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,790
I haven't said it yet.

78
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,680
When did I not trust you?

79
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,250
I told you in high school

80
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,790
if you dye my hair recklessly, I'll be targeted by the school,

81
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,420
but you didn't believe it.

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,710
Yes.

83
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,550

Do you know what the only thing I don't believe in you is?

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,460
You said you don't have a future you want.

89
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,570
What if the future I want can't make money?

90

00:11:59,570 --> 00:11:59,990
Hello.

190
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,940
I'm a friend of Chuying, 
Zhuang Hezhen.

191
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,620
I'll make a special one for Yiyong

192
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,320
to thank him

193
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,400
for letting Officer Chen

194
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,820
see something she shouldn't see.

195
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,260
Did you call him?

196
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,280
He did.

197
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,040
But he hung up as soon as I picked up.

198
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,370
Then it changed to voice messages.

199
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,210
What about his mother and the hospital?

200
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,020
No.

201
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,190
I didn't ask them.

202
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,280
Why? What happened?

203
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,100
Didn't your dad see him either?

204
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,610
He was called to the publishing house. He isn't there.

205
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:35,780
What happened?

206
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,720
Okay.

207
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,780
Call his mother first and I'll contact the hospital.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,290
You stay at home first. I...

209
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,070
Wait.

210
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,560
Chuying!

211
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:45,790
What happened?

212
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,070
I'll give you a number later,

213
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,920
and tell me when you locate it.

214
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,010
No, I have no right...

215
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,150
He took my friend away.

216
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,230
Please investigate

217
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,420
Zhuang Hezhen.

218

[There's an unfinished cake residue in the stomach]

219
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,980
[There's an unfinished cake residue in the stomach]

220
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,670
Come on.

221
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,040
Do you have a headache or feel dizzy?

222
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,450
I'm sorry. I didn't control my strength well.

223
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,680
We're almost there. Hang in there.

224
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,180
Can you walk by yourself?

225
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:33,970
Okay.

226
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,790
What do you mean?

227
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,310
There are two things.

228
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,790
I won't mention the first one.

229
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,500
Second,

230
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,310
I need your help.

231
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,310
You really...

232
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,330
Do you really know Chen Chuying?

233
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:56,710
Yes.

234
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,440
Did she arrest you?

235
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,960
I can't help you if you have any grievances.

236
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:01,810
No.

237
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,550
You misunderstood.

238
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,910
She and I are really friends.

239
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,900
What?

240
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,460
Why don't you ask me more questions?

241
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,910
The More I know, the sooner I die.

242
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,450
Let's go first.

243
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,450
Let's talk on the way.

244
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,030
This is a science museum...

245
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,350
Chuying!

246
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,330
What about his mother?

247
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,770
He went to his mother today,

248
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,180
but he left after a while.

249
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,390
What about the hospital?

250
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,690
We will go ask the person who builds the sidewalk for help.

251
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,050
I did.

252
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:29,870
And then?

253
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,060
He's digging the road and hasn't even paved the cypress oil.

254
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,100
Then let's go...

255
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,050
I went there too.

256
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,630
The shop next door said Ms. He hasn't been here for a while.

257
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,090
Our doll was taken away too.

258
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,150
Zheng Lisong has also left.

259
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,200
What should we do now?

260
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,660
We can find a person,

261
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:43,640
but...

262
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,720
But what?

263
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,460
We don't know her, and we can't see her.

264
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,570
Who is she?

265
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,000
She's an old lady.

266
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,010
Where is the old lady?

267
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,750
It's her.

268
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,660
Where is Pu Yiyong?

269
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,680
Granny Zeng Jiang.

270
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,720
She's not the one.

271
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,730
Grandma,

272
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
did you drink with

273
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,339
an old lady before

274
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,510
at my dad's stall?

275
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,339
She?

276
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,590
I don't know calligraphy.

277
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,750
I don't know if these are good enough.

278
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,240
What are you going to do?

279
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,210
I said it just now.

280
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,530
I need your help.

281
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,260
but I didn't have time to tell you

282
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,890
when...

283
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,460
Is my brother

284
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,450
here?

285
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,210
Obsession.

286
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,660
Can you see that?

287
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,680
There, next to the cake.

288
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,830
What cake?

289
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,340
I'm asking you to look at the obsession rather than the cake.

290
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,200
You saw the twins too, right?

291
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,210
Yang Jing.

292
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,370
How do you know Yang Jing?

293
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,710
I knew it was him when Chuying talked about him.

294
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,110
He is miserable.

295
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,770
I wanted his brother to die with him too,

296
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,270
but I really couldn't find a chance.

297
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,760
I have a brother,

298
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,620
so I understand.

299
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,720
How is it?

300
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,040
Is there any?

301
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,240
Like the twins,

302
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,890
is my brother's obsession here too?

303
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,330
Even you...

304
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,140
What did you do to your brother?

305
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,530
Pu Yiyong may be in danger.

306
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,420
Do you know where he is?

307
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,200
Pu Yiyong is the person who collected these

308
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,180
and looks like a gangster.

309
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,370
Where is he?

310
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,350
Did he tell you?

311
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,710
Is someone really here?

312
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,470
Can she really see?

313
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,700
She told me not to misunderstand her.

314
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,420
She didn't do it.

315
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,440
It's a token of our gratitude.

316
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,150
It's a token of gratitude for the kind Yiyong.

324
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,290

We've caught him.

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,170
He beat and extorted the young victims for a long time.

330
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,860
We need to re-investigate the case.

331
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,100
Didn't you ask me to see if the obsession is there?

332
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,520
But I need to know what has happened

333
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,130
to see it.

334
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,740
Really?

335
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,040
Chuying didn't tell me.

336
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,400
What does she know?

337
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,530
She only knows how to give a ticket.

338
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,820
Sweets make people feel better when they suffer.

339
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,550
You know that, right?

340
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,310
I don't like sweet food.

341
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,490
My brother liked it.

342
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,660
He spent most of his time in the hospital bed.

343
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,650
He wanted to eat sweet food.

344
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,240
His favorite was the cupcake from this store.

345
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,430
But eating sweets, phlegm will increase.

346
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,200
So he couldn't eat a little bit.

347
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,210
If he ate the physical food that was not completely broken,

348
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,700
the consequences might be very serious

349
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,060
let alone eating sweets.

350
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,890
He kept crying

351
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,120
because of pain that day,

352
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,000
so I bought a cupcake here.

353
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,820
I broke

354
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,700
such a small sugar cream to let him keep it in the mouth.

355
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,030
You killed someone!

356
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,780
Why did you look behind me?

357
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,160
What did you see?

358
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,380
Ask him for me.

359
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,260
With me doing this,

360
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,420
was he happy?

361
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,130
Ask him yourself.

362
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,180
I can let you see him too.

363
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,560
My grandpa has been in the hospital for almost two years.

364
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,520
He's worse than your brother.

365
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,460
At least your brother was sober.

366
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,920
Can you talk while...

367
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,220
Did your brother say he wanted to die?

368
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,570
Why did you think

369
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,950
he would be happy when he was smothered to death?

370
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,430
This is common sense, right?

371
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,210
As you can see,

372
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,040
Yang Jing also wanted to take his brother away.

373
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,370
Because he knew his brother would only live in pain.

374
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,560
His obsession was kept

375
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,010
because he wanted to protect his brother

376
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,130
and let him live.

377
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,560
Then...

378
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,910
what did the little girl say?

379
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,890
Which little girl?

380
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,240
Xie He'an,

381
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,290
the fat girl who was

382
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,310
bullied by her classmates.

383
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,800
Let's split up.

384
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,340
If you run into Zhuang Hezhen, don't take the risk.

385
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,680
Contact me immediately.

386
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:56,840
Okay.

387
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,870
Is this

388
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,420
my brother?

389
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,500
No.

390
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,810
I've always wanted to punch someone like that.

391
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,590
Your grandson did it for me.

392
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,630
[Hey, old lady.]

393
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:26,650
Grandpa.

394
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,240
Mom told me that

395
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,160
you chose to stay safe alone

396
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,650
for Dad and Grandma, right?

397
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,100
You said I'm the most important.

398
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,360
I think so too.

399
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,430
So so far,

400
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,180
my body has made

401
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,680
the most comfortable choices very honestly.

402
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,290
Ignoring those things

403
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,710
makes me feel bad.

404
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,600
If I am the most important,

405
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,360
I shouldn't let myself suffer, right?

406
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,440
You used to scold me when I was little that

407
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,900
the handwriting I wrote

408
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,040
was just copying and I didn't use my heart.

409
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,800
Now I know it's really fun

410
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,150
to write characters wholeheartedly.

411
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,880
Grandpa,

412
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,430
I'm different from you.

413
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,350
I have a doctor and a policeman around me.

414
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,080
So don't worry.

415
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,960
I'll deal with the old lady who keeps pestering you.

416
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,980
If she bothers you again,

417
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,060
give this to her.

418
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,870
Hey, old lady.

419
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,390
First,

420
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,420
I'm going to use that wish now.

421
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,520
I want my grandpa to realize

422
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,880
what he really wants to do

423
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,940
and what makes him happy.

424
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,510
I always asked you to let me die.

425
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,450
Now it's the opposite.

426
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,340
Yiyong makes the class average

427
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,210
rank the last every year.

428
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,360
He is obviously smart.

429
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,820
He cheated.

430
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,730
If you leave like this,

431
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,000
won't you worry about him?

432
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,710
You said that he was different from me.

433
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,980
He's much better than me.

434
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,590
I don't want to apologize to you.

435
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,970
I don't know

436
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,600
if we can meet again.

437
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,130
Let me

438
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,520
see my brother, OK?

439
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,880
Your brother

440
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,180
won't leave obsession

441
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,800
for a murderer like you.

442
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,780
Pu Yiyong!

443
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,500
Zhuang Hezhen!

444
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,580
Don't move.

445
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,030
My other colleagues are already here.

446
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,230
Please don't move.

447
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,240
No!

448
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,960
Let me tell you the second thing.

449
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,540
You shouldn't let Chuying see what she shouldn't see.

450
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,650
But since things have come to this,

451
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,940
let’s give Chuying a promotion gift together.

452
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,050
You catch a current offender right after you get transferred.

453
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,720
I told you

454
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,550
you would not be just a   "three in a line".

455
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,870
Chuying, outside!

456
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,320
Hang in there.

457
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,699
13, 14, 15, 16.

458
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,210
Xu,

459
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,159
divide them into two teams and go up from the left and the right.

460
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,250
Send an ambulance to the front entrance of the science museum.

461
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,100
Someone fell from a building.

462
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,250
I told you to sit when you have a seat.

463
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,370
You still need to stand for a long time.

464
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,180
It's okay if you don't want to sit.

465
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,780
Lean on it.

466
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,680
It's strange.

467
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,050
Your mom insisted on cutting me like this.

468
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,590
It's better than me.

469
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,510
She dyed me like that.

470
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,520
Then I was treated like a hooligan at school.

471
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,360
Will you always be there?

472
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,170
I'm always here.

473
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,910
I know you've helped a lot of people.

474
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,750
Are you an obsession

475
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,550
like them?

476
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,850
Yiyong has grown up.

477
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,990
You can use such a difficult character.

478
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,860
So do you hope so?

479
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,130
I hoped

480
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,420
you could leave obsession

481
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,000
like them,

482
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,180
Then I could see you.

483
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,560
But later, I didn't hope that way.

484
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,160
Why?

485
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,700
Obsession is scary.

486
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,370
Missing,

487
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:56,870
sadness,

488
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,820
hatred,

489
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,410
envy...

490
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,420
I don't want you to be like them.

491
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,570
Do you remember

492
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,390
what you said to the father

493
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,000
whose kid died?

494
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,500
But don't just feel guilty.

495
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,080
Leave some space

496
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,460
to other good memories.

497
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,960
There is my obsession here.

498
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,660
My obsession is also on the floor,

499
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,720
on that door,

500
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,350
on this window,

501
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,850
on the dining table,

502
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,460
on your champion wall,

503
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,030
in the calligraphy classroom and everywhere.

504
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,820
But the most

505
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,930
is here.

506
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,280
And...

507
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,360
here,

508
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,180
Merry things,

509
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,750
happy things,

510
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,230
and funny things

511
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,490
are all obsessions.

512
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,050
We cherish them.

513
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,390
How could they be scary?

514
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,610
Is the sense of guilt an obsession too?

515
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,910
Yes.

516
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,560
Dad.

517
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,540
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,940
I was drawing comics all night,

519
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,350
so I overslept in the morning.

520
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,520
So you and Grandpa got on the bus

521
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,720
because of me.

522
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,170
I'm sorry.

523
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,500
It turns out that you wanted to draw comics...

524
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,270
I don't want to draw anymore.

525
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,740
I don't want to...

526
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,860
9, 10, 11, 12.

527
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,650
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

528
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,370
No.

529
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,790
Enough.

530
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,710
No.

531
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,710
Enough.

532
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,100
Enough.

533
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:17,760
No.

534
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,370
Enough!

535
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,330
Pu Yiyong...

536
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,070
You know people who give up for randomly chosen reasons

537
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,960
are idiots.

538
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,370
Grandpa is right.

539
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,330
You are

540
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,350
the most important.

541
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,760
Do whatever

542
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,370
your heart asks you to do.

543
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,450
I want

544
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,440
you to stay.

545
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,430
I am.

546
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,490
I stay here

547
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,100
and there at the same time.

548
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,290
Can we drink it aboveboard this time?

549
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,150
Is it good?

550
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,500
No.

551
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,000
It's bitter.

552
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,600
I think so too.

553
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,760
But your mom likes it.

554
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,500
She always forced me to drink with her.

555
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,710
Have another sip.

556
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,660
This comic

557
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,070
is not only about my high school life,

558
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,070
but also about my heart.

559
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,170
I'm really touched.

560
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,770
So please bless...

561
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:04,980
Ma'am,

562
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,610
it's not decent for you to act like this every time.

563
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,120
No.

564
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,720
But his drawing is really stupid.

565
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,810
I'll be back again.

566
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,050
Please bless Guangyan too.

567
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,380
Make Guangyan look more energetic.

568
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,170
Don't be discouraged anymore.

569
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,450
Guangyan insisted on going with me

570
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,810
to visit Grandpa and Dad today.

571
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,710
Chuying wanted to go too.

572
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,250
But she said a wanted man showed up,

573
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,480
so she wouldn't come.

574
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,700
Get up early.

575
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,960
Don't let those two

576
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,620
have a big rock on their backs.

577
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,190
They can't even straighten their backs.

578
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,290
I can't straighten my back.

579
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,990
Didn't I tell you about a wanted man last time?

580
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,230
The one who drove over and robbed someone.

581
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,130
Let me tell you.

582
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,440
We've been undercover for days and finally caught him.

583
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,730
If Cui Zhaowan hadn't blocked the way,

584
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,790
he wouldn't have kicked my waist.

585
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,170
Why did I rush to join the investigation team at that time?

586
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:05,940
And let me tell you.

587
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:07,090
My performance is obviously higher

588
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,120
than those seniors.

589
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:09,440
They are still there

590
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,860
calling me "one-per". What do they mean?

591
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,710
Do you remember

592
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:26,890
the origin of "one-per"?

593
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,550
Alright.

594
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:31,700
I'm afraid you'll forget.

595
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:32,780
I'll make an exception and say it again.

596
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,690
We have to pass the special exam after we graduate from a police major

597
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,430
before we officially become police officers.

598
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,910
There are only three chances.

599
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,690
99 percent of people pass this.

600
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,800
[2016 Civil Service Special Examination General Police Personnel Examination First Test Result Notice]

601
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:52,900
It's abnormal.

602
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,270
Yes, abnormal.

603
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,570
You still have two chances.

604
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:56,990
You will make it next time.

605
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:57,900
Come on.

606
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,180
You're dead.

607
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,240
99% of people will pass. You...

608
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,670
You're really a weirdo.

609
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,220
You only have one chance.

610
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,350
You're really dead.

611
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,880
On the first day of registration,

612
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,850
everyone including the officer called me "one-per".

613
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:13,260
I'm sorry.

614
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:15,590
It turns out that Cui Zhaowan told them.

615
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,190
His previous encouragement was fake.

616
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,270
He treated me like a joke.

617
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,910
The doctor said you have a 10% chance to wake up.

618
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,810
I, "one-per", can even join the investigation team.

619
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,930
You're ten times more than me.

620
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,120
You'll definitely wake up.

621
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,060
Director wants his cup from you.

622
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,270
He said he wouldn't take it from me.

623
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,320
He asked you to return it to him personally.

624
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,210
He's still waiting to scold you.

625
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,920
I've read all the comics in your room.

626
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,660
Every comic you bought has an ending.

627
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,660
But what should I do?

628
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,120
The comic I want to read the most

629
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,440
is not half-finished yet.

630
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,120
And we have to discuss

631
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,330
my career plan together.

632
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,840
But I just start to work as an intern in the hospital this year,

633
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,680
so I still have time to wait for you.

634
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,790
But I can't wait for the comic.

635
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,860
Your story stuck at that place.

636
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,750
You went too far.

637
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:01,670
Get up and finish it.

638
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,710
You have a weird taste.

639
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:07,630
Brother Yong.

640
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,920
Brother Yong.

641
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,110
Aren't you a scholar?

642
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,870
Why do you like Brother Yong's paintings?

643
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:14,870
Can't I like it?

644
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,510
That's why I said if people study too much,

645
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,560
they will have vision problems.

646
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,280
-Brother Yong, it's time to eat. -Brother Yong, it's time to eat.

647
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,310
I told you not to do this.

648
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,570
Put your hands down and don't worship.

649
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,300
-Let’s eat. -Let’s eat.

650
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,400
Someone is waiting downstairs.

651
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,100
When will your dad's stall open?

652
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,030
I don't know.

653
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,370
[Mr. Cao's Bar]

654
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:54,820
Ms. Zeng Jiang,

655
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:57,730
I'm here to inform you that

656
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,930
the house has been demolished,

657
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,910
but we couldn't find what you said.

658
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,320
I remember the bottom seat I broke when I was young

659
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,640
was hidden there.

660
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,100
They're all ordinary stones.

661
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,790
There's no lotus constellation you mentioned.

662
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,930
It's a 1000-year-old Guanyin.

663
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,610
How can I face my parents in the future?

664
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,770
Second,

665
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,390
I'll answer your wish now.

666
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,370
If someone doesn't help you, you'll make him a vegetable.

667
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,770
Are you a hooligan?

668
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,310
Solve your own problem by yourself.

669
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,990
I'm not just a hooligan,

670
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,290
but also a rascal.

671
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,930
I'll wait for you to wake up.

672
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,050
Wake up, Brother Yiyong.

673
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,720
Have you found out the writing thing?

674
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,230
It's too lazy to lie in bed all the time.

675
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,740
Can you be polite

676
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,730
before you ask for help?

677
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,350
You keep calling "you".

678
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,510
Are you stupid?

679
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,440
Don't think you're smart.

680
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,600
Do you have to be knocked a few times?

681
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,670
I'm warning you.

682
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,680
The longer you sleep, the more stupid you become.

683
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,370
One more thing.

684
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:13,590
Don't forget that

685
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,000
you haven't taught my kid how to write calligraphy.

686
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,680
Don't think you don't need to pay it back if you are like this.

687
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,400
Can you take a few steps back?

688
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:23,990
Why do you keep stepping on our faces?

689
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,340
Did I scare you because I am beautiful?

690
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,860
No.

691
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:40,890
But I'm sorry.

692
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,180
No matter how much you like my face,

693
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,840
I won’t leave Mr. Xiaochuan.

694
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,460
So go back.

695
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,130
That policeman is not bad.

696
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,330
Go back to her.

697
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,220
Didn't I tell you many times?

698
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,760
You narcissistic.

699
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,190
Are you listening to me?

700
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,580
Didn't you already...

701
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,080
Why did you...

702
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,700
I was afraid that my original look may scare you.

703
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,860
The current look is not scary.

704
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:30,390
Really?

705
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,980
Do you remember that I talked about

706
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,050
the power of human heart?

707
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,130
I'm free.

708
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,460
But I often remember

709
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,330
when I was led by human hearts.

710
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,850
I especially miss you.

711
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,770
The Yiyong at that time

712
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,320
was the Yiyong I like.

713
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,990
You should go back to your old self.

714
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,120
Other than us,

715
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,850
many people are waiting for you.

716
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,900
So now,

717
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,140
close your eyes

718
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:24,750
and wake up.

719
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:27,870
Pu Yiyong.

720
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,580
Help me.

721
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,590
[The End]
