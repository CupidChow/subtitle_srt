00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,600
So what?

382
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,460
You have hit me for half a year to let me pay for it.

383
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,710
Do you want to start it or not?

384
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,590
Yes.

385
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,110
Why did you erase it?

386
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,810
It says on it.

387
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,230
Dream...

388
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,940
So I asked you why you erased it.

389
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,790
That happened to my family because of me,

390
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,820
but I didn't die.

391
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,240
After I woke up, I could live in a house

392
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,440
bought with the compensation.

393
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,870
I'm lucky enough

394
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,780
compared to you living with an alcoholic old woman.

395
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,570
If I am so greedy

396
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,460
as to ask for dream and be so luxurious,

397
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,900
I'll be beaten to death by ghosts on the road.

398
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,510
Didn't you teach another man

399
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,500
how to allocate brain space?

400
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,420
But don't just remember the sense of guilt.

401
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,550
Leave some space

402
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,020
to other good memories.

403
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,490
I made the class average the lowest.

404
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,120
How much brain capacity can I have?

405
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,690
Most people only develop 10% of their brain.

406
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,920
It looks like you have developed less.

407
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,160
So you have more space than others.

408
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,240
But it's good to be practical.

409
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,810
Actually, I've thought about many things

410
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,980
according to your specialty.

411
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,050
Really?

412
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,050
First,

413
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:54,770
Tongji.

414
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,300
Don't you like it?

415
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,690
Okay, I'll continue.

416
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,470
Second,

417
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:02,600
huckster.

418
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,080
Although this is controversial,

419
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,540
you can make a lot of money.

420
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,640
Don't you like it?

421
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,070
Third,

422
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,960
abbot.

423
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,030
This is really good.

424
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,940
It is the top person in charge of the temple

425
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,920
It requires enough cultivation.

426
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,570
You need this originally.

427
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,070
You may start from a little monk, the grassroots,

428
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,490
but this job has a high position.

429
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,110
Don't you like it?

430
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,150
Or do you believe in Western religions?

431
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,720
You can also be a priest.

432
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,180
Otherwise, there is also a psychic.

433
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,260
But it goes back to the first option.

434
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,730
Screw your abbot and psychic.

435
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,050
Bastard Yan.

436
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,630
He was making fun of me.

437
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,710
It was fine that he didn't like them.

438
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,570
How could he hit me?

439
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,650
-He is bullying me! -He is bullying me!

440
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,600
Chuying, I am Guangyan.

441
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:30,530
Yes.

442
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,030
Pu Yiyong didn't take his phone.

443
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,620
I don't know.

444
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,190
Maybe he is in his room.

445
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,630
What did he want to see?

446
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,610
Are you sure?

447
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,660
I object.

448
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,900
What are you against?

449
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,080
What's the use of watching it?

450
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,540
There are two things that I want to confirm:

451
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,590
if my grandpa fainted before the accident

452
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,820
like the airline company

453
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,850
has said,

454
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,350
and

455
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,320
I want to see my dad.

456
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,420
Slow down, and let me see.

457
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,380
The airline company said...

458
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,010
It is true that he was already in a coma.

459
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,400
What's wrong?

460
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,920
He's a selfish person.

461
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,960
I won't let him go.

462
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,990
Who are you?

463
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,590
Pu Yiyong?

464
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,320
I'm sorry.

465
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,700
I'm sorry.

466
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,690
Go home first.

467
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,350
Tell me what's wrong with you.

468
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,420
Did you see anything?

469
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,260
What did you see?

470
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,610
Go back first.

471
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,310
I'll find you after I figure it out.

472
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:39,060
[Are you okay?]

473
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,700
What are you doing?

474
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,310
It is strange.

475
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,070
Who is he talking to?

476
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,290
You.

477
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:53,640
Are you okay?

478
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,860
How did you get in?

479
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,850
How could anything happen to me with your strength?

480
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,280
Where are you going?

481
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,470
What are you doing?

482
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,490
Don't use my quilt.

483
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,050
I'll sleep here today.

484
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,050
Why?

485
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,170
Then we don't need to turn on the video.

486
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,140
Sorry.

487
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,310
You can help me.

488
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,540
Please help me.

489
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,210
Help me!

490
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,250
Help me.

491
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,240
Help me.

492
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,440
Please help me.

493
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,230
A selfish person,

494
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,700
I won't let you go.

495
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:23,540
Grandpa!

496
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,840
He won't turn back.

497
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,070
He's cold-blooded.

498
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,820
He didn't even save the living.

499
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,850
Do you want to be like him

500
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,030
or choose differently?

501
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,640
The plane, the bus, my grandpa,

502
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:41,660
and my dad...

503
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,440
Did you do it?

504
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,270
Every time I begged him,

505
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,890
he only answered that sentence.

506
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:57,370
Preserve one's own purity and integrity...

507
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:58,370
I'm asking you.

508
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,130
But I think you are different.

509
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:06,950
Don't let me down.

510
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,370
Pu Yiyong.

511
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,490
Pu Yiyong!

512
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,330
What does "to preserve one's own purity and integrity" mean?

513
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,440
What do you mean?

514
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,310
To preserve one's own purity and integrity.

515
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,160
It was not derogatory before.

516
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,790
It means cultivating oneself.

517
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,090
It doesn't mean well now.

518
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,420
It means that people only care about themselves.

519
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,500
No wonder.

520
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,860
Did you dream of taking Chinese exams?

521
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,340
What other questions did you dream about?

522
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,840
Tell me.

523
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,780
I can answer them for you.

524
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:53,770
Wait for me.

525
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:54,850
I'll get some paper and a pen.

526
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:39,420
[In the next episode]

527
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,290
What are you afraid of?

528
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,050
Even if you don't help them,

529
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,290
they can't do this to you.

530
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,610
Well...

531
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:43,300
the kid...

532
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,290
She is my daughter.

533
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,170
She was kidnapped seven years ago.

534
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,620
She was missing.

535
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,750
These people were interrogated at that time.

536
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:51,570
I don't want to be trapped there.

537
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,600
Find her daughter,

538
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,120
and let me go.
