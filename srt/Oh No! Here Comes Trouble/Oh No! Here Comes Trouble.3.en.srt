It's already the fifth time.

377
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,410
From now on, don't sign for anything

378
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,800
that comes from Chen Ying or something.

379
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,520
You got it almost two years ago.

380
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,500
Who gave it to you?

381
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,680
He was very old.

382
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,800
Much older than me.

383
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,360
Two years ago.

384
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,660
Very old.

385
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,420
Was that the old woman?

386
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,360
Who's the old woman?

387
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,910
This is mine.

388
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,450
It's going to be cold tonight.

389
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,230
I don't know why.

390
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,430
I think this dress suits him so well.

391
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,540
I don't think you should

392
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,720
give my clothes to it anyway.

393
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,150
Show some respect to him.

394
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,520
It's cold. Let's go eat something hot.

395
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,660
Sure, sure.

396
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,380
I'd love some soup.

397
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,640
Oden.

398
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,630
I'll have the pig's blood cake.

399
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,850
I'll take the call.

400
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,550
I'll see you later.

401
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,450
We'll wait for you then.

402
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,710
It's okay. You guys go ahead.

403
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,550
Let's go.

404
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,000
I'll wait for him. You can go first.

405
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,510
Let's go.

406
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,380
I'm so annoyed.

407
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,730
They have to eat, go to the bathroom and do everything together.

408
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,080
Dad.

409
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,090
I'm sorry I didn't get it because of the noise.

410
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,460
It's okay now, you can say it.

411
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,630
Unemployment?

412
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,530
Saying you're not worried,

413
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,739
do you really mean it?

414
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,870
Five years of tuition.

415
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:42,080
[Tuition fee, maintenance fee, life, scholarship] All

416
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,889
Tuition fees and living expenses.

417
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,889
And then the scholarship.

418
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,260
Senior.

419
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,400

421
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,410
It's the same for you.

422
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,180
Be sure to check out if there is anyone before you leave.

423
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,280
Good.

424
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:11,990
I'm sorry.

425
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,460
I knew you couldn't come in as a second-year.

426
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
But thank you for your kindness.

427
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,800
I'm so grateful.

428
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,880
I'll go first.

429
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,680
I'm sorry.

430
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,860
Why are you apologizing?

431
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,060
You have to live with the landlord.

432
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,000
It's not easy.

433
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,000
Isn't the rent much lower than before?

434
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,210
That's not a problem anymore.

435
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,320
Guangyan.

436
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,060
Didn't I tell you to live in the big room?

437
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,590
Why did you move to the smaller room?

438
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,740
If you want to work at home afterward,

439
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,410
you'll need space to work.

440
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,580
No need.

441
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,970
I'll find a publisher then.

442
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,820
That's impossible.

443
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,460
They won't want you

444
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
with your seniority and experience.

445
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,120
The publishing industry is having a hard time on its own.

446
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,000
They can't afford to hire senior people like you.

447
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,130
So it's most likely for you to do outsourced work at home.

448
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,610
I'll take you to the next door to say hello to the neighbors.

449
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,290
That's okay.

450
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,280
We have to unpack first.

451
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,720
I'll never be able to see her again.

452
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,760
What about her?

453
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,830
What? What about her whole life?

454
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,320
Come on.

455
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,050
Come here.

456
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,230
You’re going to her house before you finish.
Come on.

460

It's unused anyway.

461
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,750
That's good.

462
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,480

Yes, I just heard her say it's free.

526

The most important thing is that he charged a reasonable fee.

00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,940
Why didn't you let me know when you woke up?

564
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,870
Yong, let me see.

565
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:04,740
Let me see.

566
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,990
Yong.

567
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,100
Are you all right?

568
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,370
My mother said you visited me often.

569
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,670
Don't come anymore.

570
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,900
You come twice a week.

571
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:19,850
Don't you have to prepare for the college entrance exam?

572
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,120
Yes.
Yes.

573
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,910
His time is suspended.

574
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,620
But yours are not.

575
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,510
After the exam,
If he is still unconscious,

576
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,930
none of you should come anymore.

577
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,480
I don't want to.

578
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:36,680
I don't want to either.

579
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,010
Seeing Yiyong like that,

580
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,020
how can you feel good?

581
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,100
This would be like a big stone.

582
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,000
Don't put this

583
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,680
in your hearts.

584
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,980
Think about your own life.

585
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,460
That's why we visited you

586
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,280
before the exam for the last time.

587
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:11,860
Yong, are you still painting?

588
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:15,350
Thank you.

589
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,740
You've been paying for the subscription, right?

590
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,300
My comics.

591
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,620
Ah.

592
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,270
Actually, you don't have to both subscribe to it.

593
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,050
No.

594
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,190
We should pay for it.

595
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:30,890
We should.

596
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,710
What are you doing these days?

597
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,640
You haven't resumed school?

598
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,000
Besides taking care of my grandfather,

599
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,240
I have to find a job.

600
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,460
I've applied for some jobs recently.

601
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,720
None of those bastards informed me.

602
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:43,910
He's making money from YouTube.

603
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,770
I did it.
It's not good.

604
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,730
I'm doing an internship.

605
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:48,910
Yong.

606
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,470
We pay well there.

607
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,580
I can recommend you to our boss.

608
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:53,660
Thanks, Dongjun.

609
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,150
What kind of creator are you on YouTube, Li Can?

610
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,010
Beauty.

611
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,540
Do you have another subscription

612
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,010
to the comics?

613
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,090
No.

614
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,380
We put 35 yuan together.

615
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,810
I didn't expect

616
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,770
other people

617
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,060
to be willing to pay for Yong's comics.

618
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,400
I want to see what that person looks like.

619
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,030
It's good that Yong is awake.

620
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:46,010
[Hikaru, Autopsy Room, please.]

621
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:09,730
I'm sorry.

622
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,800
Is this mine?

623
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,130
Why is there no sauce?

624
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,420
Do you know what this is?

625
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,330
Why are you asking me here?

626
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,910
Where else should I ask?

627
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,690
It's a bit sudden.

628
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,720
So, is today our first day together?

629
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,670
I'm asking you what this is.

630
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,910
A loving heart.

631
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,010
Help me see what this is.

632
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,050
Don't do this to us.

633
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:43,860
We'll

634
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,900
flutter.

635
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,740
Guangyan, I can't stand it.

636
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,870
Idiot.

637
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:49,940
Guangyan, take me home.

638
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,180
Guangyan, take me home.

639
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:51,980
Shut up.

640
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,410
Guangyan.

641
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,380
Can you help me see what this is?

642
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,410
The floor?

643
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,240
No, it's this.

644
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,680
Your foot?

645
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:30,860
Wow.

646
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,900
Great!
Thank you, Mr. Cao.

647
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,120
You're welcome.

648
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,410
Mom.

649
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,480
Do the guests and the owner's family

650
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,520
have to sit at the same table?

651
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,170
Dad.

652
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,760
As the boss, can't we choose our guests?

653
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,400
I'm sorry.

654
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,670
I think Guangyan is still confused

655
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,210
from the class today.

656
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:10,320
No.

657
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,400
I'm sorry.

658
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,530
Don't mind this guy.

659
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,620
You have no manners.

660
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:01,960
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

661
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,950
Should I help you with the dishes then?

662
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:06,950
You saw it.

663
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,700
I didn't see it.

664
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,480
If you answered so quickly, then you did.

665
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,370
I told you I didn't.

666
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,960
You did.

667
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,690
I really didn't.

668
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,260
You did.

669
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:12,990
I didn't.

670
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,590
I found you.

671
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,710
[In the next episode]

672
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,370
Help me.

673
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:31,920
Here comes another one.

674
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,060
I want to help the girl.

675
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:33,730
You should come along.

676
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:36,660
Are you messing with me?

677
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,040
Please help me find the name of that man.

678
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,900
He didn't even say his name?

679
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,600
For people who live in the street,

680
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,980
who doesn't have a story?

681
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:46,730
Can't you see?

682
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:48,590
Help me.
