4
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,210
You scared me to death.

5
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,400
You scared me to death.

6
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,660
What are you doing?

7
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,870
Grandpa's stuff is mixed with mine.

8
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,670
What's in your hand?

9
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,140
Ink stick.

10
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,460
Come down and have night snack with me.

11
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,960
Sorry, traffic control in front.

12
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,160
Senior, there's nothing.

13
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,640
Senior.

14
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,290
The bike owner is a man.

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,640
He was 34 years old, called Zheng Lisong.

16
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,690
But we don't know if he drove it himself.

17
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,910
It looks like it fell off the bridge.

18
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,030
We're already searching.

19
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,540
It's strange. The range is not wide.

20
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,930
Why hasn't there been any news yet?

21
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,680
Is this considered a find?

22
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,500
There are no traces of dragging.

23
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,880
Impossible.

24
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,610
Didn't you say to have night snack?

25
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,830
This also counts.

26
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,090
I don't really want to...

27
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,060
Here.

28
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,250
This expired nearly two years ago.

29
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,230
I used to be

30
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,790
as embarrassed to talk as you were.

31
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,910
But once,

32
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,630
my dad gave me some alcohol.

33
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,420
Then we drank and talked.

34
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,680
The principal gave it to me.

35
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,480
It's not beer.

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,640
I'm only 17.

37
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,090
Your stupid homeroom teacher

38
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,450
must be afraid of parents complaining

39
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,829
that he encourages underage drinking.

40
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,410
So, that day,

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,990
I called him and told him.

42
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,360
Your dad

43
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,570
looked forward to it.

44
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,190
We still didn't know

45
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,120
what you want in the future.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,210
I don't want any future.

47
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,040
Is it so hard to say it loud?

48
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,000
Anyway, I'm warning you.

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,980

Yes. You have the physique of a swimmer.

It's calligraphy.

112
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,830

First of all,

124
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,180
I'm not asking you to curse anyone.

125
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,050
Imagine someone you know

126
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,480
is dead.

127
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,770
Write an elegiac couplet for him.

128
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,090
Should I choose the principal or Mr. Chen from Class 1?

129
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,680
Then...

130
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,330
the principal.

131
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,620
How many characters?

132
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,670
Not limited.

133
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,290
The first word is?

134
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,820
Do I have to tell you everything?

135
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,510
Forget it.

136
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,390
The other shops didn't lie to you.

137
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,030
The form has really changed.

138
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,130
And it has long been changed.

139
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,800
They're all shown on a big screen now.

140
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,360

141
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,220
and send it out.

142
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,320
Even if they're not typed,

143
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,010
They all follow the same pattern.

144
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,200
The ones produced in factories are also similar.

145
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,360
It's just a formality.

146
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,710
Is there people who want them handwritten?

147
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes.

148
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,190
Then, I can write.

149
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,730
I write faster than my grandpa.

150
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,800
The whole Heart Sutra will only take me less than 20 minutes.

151
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,610
Is it a race?

152
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,140
I didn't invite Mr. Pu

153
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,570
to write anything polite

154
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,510
or perfunctory.

155
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,670
It's about something between the family and the dead.

156
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,830
Let me put it this way.

157
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,030
The family told us many things about the dead.

158
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,200
After Mr. Pu thought about it,

159
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,240
the elegiac couplet he wrote

160
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,540
is unique.

161
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,210
It can also be said that he helped the family

162
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,350
express what they wanted to say to the dead

163
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,350
and their gratitude.

164
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,000
Your grandfather's work

165
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,310
is not mass production.

166
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,550
Every word he wrote can express his good will.

167
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,320
It wasn't just a mourning to the deceased.

168
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,060
He also comforted the living.

169
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,320
Mr. Pu is different.

170
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,610
He's irreplaceable.

171
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,780
He's indeed Mr. Pu's grandson.

172
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,220
Looks like he understood.

173
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,740
That bald guy just thinks I'm not well-educated.

174
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:30,440

179
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,460

Help me.

182
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,860
Please don't.

183

Help me.

184
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,420
What are you doing? What do you need help with?

185
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,050
I don't know.

186
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,030
Or...

187
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,030
Or do you want me to call you a doctor?

188
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,030

Excuse me.

Why did you come to me?

191

I don't know.

192
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,790
I came to you as soon as I could move.

193
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,140
Are you going to use my body?

194
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,350

not.

Or do you want me to kill someone to avenge you?

You won't do anything to my mom, will you?

206
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,690
Help me.

I can't ring the doorbell either.

269

He wanted me to help him.

351
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,400
I thought if I didn't help him,

352
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,390
he might hurt my mom.

353
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,220
That's why I asked him to take me

354
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,070
to the place he died.

355
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,380

358
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,750
Because in the comics...

359

360
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,360
For some reason,

361
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,670
you took this person to your house.

362
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,270
Whether he was alive or not,

363
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,630
you just dismembered him

364
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,670
and threw him under the bridge.

365
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920

366
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,530

Yes, there was no body.

373
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,010
In this case, we can't even confirm

374

what he is suspicious of.

375
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,650
Yes, there's no body.

376
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,030
Am I a bigger suspect?

377
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,560
What should I do?

378
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,320
The director is coming.

379
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,440
If he finds out I'm doing this to a civilian

380
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,740
in the middle of the night, I'm dead.

381
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,770
Why is she checking the time?

382
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,940
She must be impatient.

383
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,900
What will she do to me?

384
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,350
Name, phone number, and address.

385
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,870
I'll sue you for forgery documents, if you make things up.

386
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,750
Go back first.

387
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,890
I'll call you again.

388
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,480
Are you going to work?

389
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,150
Weren't you...

390
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,500
Where did you go?

391
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:48,680
I went running.

392
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,110
Wearing a coat?

393
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,400
Then I don't need to warm up.

394
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,570
What are you talking about?

395
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,780
Keep moving.

396
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,670
He's upstairs.

397
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,810
[Night Freak]

398
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,970
Zheng Lisong.

399
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,060
Mr. Zheng Lisong?

400
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,860
Probably.

401
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,580
I didn't ask you.

402
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,550
Can you stand up?

403
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,060
Help me.

404
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,460
Police!

405
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,320
Hit the police!

406
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,330
Help me!

407
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,730
What is it?

408
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,170
I told you, but you didn't believe me.

409
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,760
Don't come any closer.

410
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,050
If you come any closer, I'm going to kill him!

411
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,000
Who is this?

412
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,570
Although your face is rotten like this, I can still see it's you.

413
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,100
No.

414
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,670
It's you.

415
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,800
Not me.

416
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,390
It's you.

417
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,480
Not me.

418
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:01,880
It's you.

419
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:02,790
Not me.

420
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,260
Forget it.

421
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,840
Let me introduce.

422
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,520
This is

423
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,650
Chen Chuying,

424
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,350
a police officer.

425
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,770
This must be the victim.

426
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,020
Okay.

427
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,020
You can leave now.

428
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,740
Aren't you looking for help?

429
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,670
Although she doesn't look like one,

430
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,430
she is really a police officer.

431
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,830
Let's go. I'll walk you out.

432
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,670
No. -No!

433
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,770
Why not?

434
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,970
Because he... -I'm not asking you.

435
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,080
I don't know.

436
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,390
Why again?

437
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,100
What do you know?

438
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,830
I know I'm not that person

439
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,080
and I won't leave you.

440
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,460
I want to report a case to you.

441
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,250
I can't accept it now.

442
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,190
It can't be seen.

443
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,080
Don't let them find my body.

444
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,850
You mean that dead man?

445
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,739
Please wear his body and walk around.

446
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:44,630
Who are you?

447
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,699
Kappa!

448
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,810
I'm a kappa!

449
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,719
I don't care what you are.

450
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,139
Give the body back to the deceased.

451
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,270
He has a family.

452
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,370
I can't.

453
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,270
Why?

454
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,410
The strength of human heart

455
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,820
is much stronger than skin, bones and flesh.

456
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,680
That's why I can't.

457
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,050
Luckily, I have this body,

458
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,600
so I can come to you.

459
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,930
So what do you want from me?

460
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,950
Help me.

461
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:20,860
With what?

462
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,660
I don't know.

463
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:22,710
Again?

464
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,920
This motorbike is registered

465
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,710
under Zheng Lisong, a 34-year-old man.

466
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,090
There are signs of high-speed collision in the lower half of the guardrail.

467
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,570
There's a piece of scalp tissue on the bike lane.

468
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,660
After the collision, the rider fell off the bridge.

469
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,770
But the rider who should have died

470
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,780
is missing.

471
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,990
We've compared.

472
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,280
The blood and tissue are consistent with the owner Zheng Lisong.

473
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,860
He had no criminal record.

474
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,000
He lived with his parents.

475
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,010
He had no siblings.

476
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,240
He entered the medical center a year ago.

477
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,660
First, he was a clinical pharmacist.

478
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,660
Then he became a pharmacist.

479
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,750
His colleagues said they were not familiar with him.

480
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,910
Do you have any questions?

481
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,790
One-per.

482
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,730
One-per.

483
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,170
Excuse me.

484
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,780
Let me see who's so rude

485
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,930
to call your team leader One-per?

486
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,140
One-per.

487
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,270
When your director told me,

488
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,660
I only believed 80% of it.

489
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,550
But you've really been wandering around all day long.

490
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,640
Where did you go?

491
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,800
Senior, please continue.

492
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,350
First, it's a small matter.

493
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,950
We suspected

494
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,840
if he had a sudden relapse

495
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,800
that caused the accident?

496
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,170
Based on his medical record,

497
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,470
he's basically healthy.

498
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,660
But he had high blood pressure.

499
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,250
Even his parents didn't know.

500
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,970
And they didn't believe it.

501
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,140
A 34-year-old with high blood pressure, was he born with it?

502
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,810
No.

503
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,790
But he's been going to the doctor and taking medicine.

504
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,750
It's not a problem.

505
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,180
That's why I said it's a small matter.

506
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,070
But there's another point.

507
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:54,470
He has insurances.

508
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,360
And he insured with a few companies.

509
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,790
They are all high compensation insurances.

510
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,570
You were there at the accident scene.

511
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,700
You also checked the motorbike.

512
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,540
There was no trace of hit-and-run by another vehicle.

513
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,620
Judging from the amount of bleeding,

514
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,200
there is a high probability that

515
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,770
the insurance company will judge death.

516
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,410
But he studied medicine.

517
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,420
So we... -Did he fake his death?

518
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,650
Fake death?

519
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,010
Can he do that?

520
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,780
Impossible.

521
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,780
Senior, let me ask you.

522
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,830
If you die...

523
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,310
One more time.

524
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,630
Why did you knock four times?

525
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,220
The last one is on the house. Whatever.

526
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,260
I wanted to ask you.

527
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,420
If you die,

528
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,170
and you don't want your body to be seen,

529
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,460
Why?

530
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,090
If I die,

531
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,000
I would still be handsome.

532
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,960
I'll just let others find me and watch.

533
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,230
I don't care.

534
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,700
But others might not think so.

535
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,480
Didn't our team handle

536
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,140
a motel case before?

537
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,560
It made us blush.

538
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,690
If I were him,

539
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,350
I wouldn't let others see me die like that.

540
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,450
Why do you know so much?

541
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,770
If you want to transfer to the Investigation Team, take the exam.

542
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,900
I forgot.

543
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,620
You're One-per.

544
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,310
Come on.

545
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,710
One-per. Good luck in the exam. -Go to hell, Cui Zhaowan!

546
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,010
[Investigation Team]

547
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,540
Who would get promoted

548
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,540
with a lame exam?

549
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,720
It's even more awesome to get a reward for solving cases.

550
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,240
So Cui Zhaowan, die!

551
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:55,800
Lie in here.

552
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,200
Again?

553
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,990
I'm not lying this time.

554
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,460
Hide here.

555
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,670
Let me check if they'll find out.

556
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,410
And it wasn't a lie last time.

557
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,500
You can't go down.

558
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,540
My mom won't come up either.

559
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,310
Even if she finds out,

560
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,800
you look better in this.

561
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,770
Does it hurt?

562
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,620
Not you.

563
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,760
The owner of your body.

564
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,050
When he was hit,

565
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,890
did it hurt a lot in that second?

566
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,360
Would you know?

567
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,120
No.

568
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,490
You made an appointment with me?

569
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,060
How is that possible?

570
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,010
Mom.

571
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,870
Do you have any photos or videos from that time?

572
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,480
Not the ones from the news.

573
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,910
Photos of the people

574
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,620
on the bus.

575
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,490
What do you want?

576
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,700
I want to see.

577
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,130
I don't have them.

578
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,780
I won't allow you to ask others for them.

579
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,150
You've seen them, haven't you?

580
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,460
Dad.

581
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,140
Did they say

582
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,880
he...

583
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,190
Or...

584
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,480
I won't say would or would not,

585
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,260
did or did not irresponsibly.

586
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,380
Only he knows.

587
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,070
It's useless to keep guessing or looking into it.

588
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,580
Because there won't be an answer.

589
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,860
Baosheng, you have a customer.

590
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,840
Don't think too much. You'll be bald.

591
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,960
Hello, I'm Baosheng.

592
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,280
What hairstyle do you want to do today?

593
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,240
I want to cut it short.

594
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,430
Do you have high blood pressure?

595
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,800
Why do you ask?

596
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,560
Is there any bad news?

597
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,500
That's not what I meant.

598
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,330
I just want to know

599
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,070
if Mr. Zheng's high blood pressure is genetic.

600
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,040
His father and I have normal blood pressure.

601
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,360
Later we thought,

602
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,830
his job was to prescribe medicine for patients.

603
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,560
He can't make any mistakes.

604
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,760
Did his blood pressure go up

605
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,230
because of stress?

606
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,150
Did you know

607
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,070
Mr. Zheng insured a few

608
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,890
high compensation insurances before?

609
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:35,870
Yes.

610
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,990
But we strongly disagreed.

611
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,520
We don't like insurance.

612
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,090
It's bad luck.

613
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,180
When he's gone,

614
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,420
what's the use of money?

615
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,880
Lisong said

616
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,130
he has seen too many cases in the hospital.

617
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,440
He's our only son.

618
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,310
He's worried that when something bad happens,

619
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,640
no one will take care of us in the future, so...

620
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,040
That's why I said it's bad luck.

621
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,140
He shouldn't have insured.

622
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,450
He's cursing himself.

623
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,850
We just mentioned the hospital.

624
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,510
Did anyone from his hospital

625
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:11,990
or anyone who is close to him contact you?

626
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,470
No.

627
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:15,860
They probably don't want to disturb us.

628
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,870
He said his colleagues in the hospital

629
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,100
treated him well.

630
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,000
But he didn't mention who they were.

631
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,960
I heard him talk everyday about

632
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,380
what he had for lunch

633
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,360
and which restaurant is good.

634
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,090
They would ask him out after work.

635
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,560
But he thinks it's a waste to have too many parties.

636
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,740
So he insisted to go home and eat with us.

637
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,860
He often cooked for us.

638
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,540
Actually,

639
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,620
he only knew how to cook curry.

640
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:54,700
Miss.

641
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,360
You couldn't find him.

642
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,360
Does it mean he's still alive?

643
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,480
We'll do our best.

644
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:20,950
That's strange.

645
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,240
Right?

646
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,520
The insurance money is the problem.

647
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,240
I'm not talking about insurance.

648
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,740
I remember you said

649
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,070
his colleagues in the hospital said they were not close to him.

650
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,310
That's what my senior said.

651
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,690
They were not close, but they have lunch together every day.

652
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,860
When you came last time,

653
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:39,650
you already asked.

654
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:40,780
I said

655
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,130
I don't know him well.

656
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,870
But his mother said

657
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,990
he would go out to

658
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:46,910
have lunch with colleagues.

659
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,440
They even invited him to parties at night.

660
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,520
I met this kind of people from elementary school to high school.

661
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,710
When their parents asked about the school,

662
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,980
they said the same thing.

663
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,650
They would have lunch with their friends,

664
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,270
or hang out after class.

665
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,240
But if you ask those friends,

666
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,390
they will say

667
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,810
I bring my own lunch.

668
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,320
I'm not going out with anyone.

669
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,040
So I'm not sure.

670
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,230
I don't understand.

671
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,530
They were bullied.

672
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:17,800
What happened?

673
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,000
Why didn't the numbers change?

674
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,600
[Ward Medicine Collection Office]

675
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,460
Sorry.

676
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,550
I have work to do.

677
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,560
So,

678
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,620
when the parents or people from the education bureau

679
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,920
come to investigate,

680
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,200
you'll see those bullies

681
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,710
keep an eye on each other and see if anyone said anything.

682
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,170
What do you think? Strange atmosphere, right?

683
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,270
But normally,

684
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,550
a coward

685
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,290
who doesn't dare to do anything.

686
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,230
This kind of person is...

687
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,110
When something goes wrong,

688
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,530
as long as someone starts,

689
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,140
he would hide behind and bark.

690
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,850
He's a loser with a sense of justice.

691
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,050
Are you scolding or complimenting?

692
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:17,340
But how are we going to find that loser from here?

693
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:22,780
I know.

694
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:23,550
Let's go.

695
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,480
Where?

696
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,390
What are you doing?

697
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,780
You're amazing.

698
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,120
I didn't expect you,

699
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,440
a rogue with low IQ on the outside,

700
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,340
to be quite sharp.

701
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,130
Are you scolding me or complimenting me?

702
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,420
How come?

703
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,970
Every year, I was asked by the school

704
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,060
if I bullied them.

705
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:54,120
Mom, the police is catching the bad guy.

706
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,310
Don't talk nonsense.

707
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:55,960
Go.

708
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,370
Stay away from me.

709
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,380
All right.

710
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,570
Grandpa, let me help you exercise your right foot.

711
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,230
That's your left foot.

712
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,450
Where did you get those?

713
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,950
It's okay that you can't tell right from wrong,

714
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,480
but how come you don't even know whose stuff this is?

715
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,340
Aren't you from the hair salon?

716
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,050
I'll go home and get it.

717
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,230
Where?

718
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,620
Up there. What are you doing?

719
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,610
The passionate nurse said

720
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:51,990
besides talking to grandpa,

721
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,850
we can also bring some  of grandpa's favorite

722
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,630
an most familiar things here.

723
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,240
This is also a kind of stimulation.

724
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,330
You went up there?

725
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,490
Yes.

726
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:01,650
You bastard!

727
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,230
You don't have to do the laundry,

728
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,930
so you threw the coat on the floor.

729
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:05,880
I'm not done yet.

730
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:07,860
It's all your fault.

731
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,110
He's about to fall apart.

732
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,110
He lost the strength to

733
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,590
hold on to me.

734
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,080
Characters with the power of human heart.

735
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,290
Hit it.

736
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,500
No one

737
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,970
wants to see it, right?

738
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:55,320
Hello.

739
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:56,530
I just moved in.

740
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,050
Why are you here?
