191
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,400
I miss you so much.

192
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,640
Chief, please calm down.

193
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,070
He won't hurt him. Trust me.

194
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,280
He really won't hurt him.

195
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,440
Calm down, sir.

196
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,420
He's not Shang Wu.

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,570
Calm down, sir.!

198
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,760
I think you should take a year off.

199
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Blue, red.

200
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,600
Promise me.

201
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,090
You must be fully prepared

202
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,320
before you watch it.

203
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,740
I promise.

204
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,400
You promise?

205
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,330
I promise.

206
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,800
You swear?

207
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,710
I swear.

208
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,350
Are you sure the kid is missing?

209
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,350
I think he ran away from home.

210
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,050
You have such poor judgment.

211
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,530
I guess you'll be a quack too.

212
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,020
I don't think a patron saint

213
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,260
shouldn't at like this.

214
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,980
Who cares about you?

215
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,370
I'm only responsible for protecting children.

216
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,640
How old are you?

217
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,790
Would you please stop it?

218
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,450
Pu Yiyong…

219
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,600
I remembered that I saw your child

220
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,700
on my way back.

221
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,430
Really?

222
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,450
Where?

223
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,480
Across from the school.

224
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,190
Does he look like this?

225
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,720
He said it. Why is it my house that's being destroyed?

226
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,920
His house is next door.

227
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,780
Although it's rented,

228
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,680
you can break it down and make him homeless.

229
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,380
Isn't this better for all of us?

230
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,540
Let's go next door, okay?

231
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:07,910
Look what you've done.

232
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,030
Pu Yiyoung is broken.

233
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,800
This quack may be right.

234
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,160
He ran away from home.

235
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,060
The child is too young.

236
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,260
He couldn't move by himself.

237
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,000
But the abductor provided him with something.

238
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,300
So he grabbed it and left,

239
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,130
and was turned into a different person.

240
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:37,860
No wonder I couldn't find him.

241
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,930
What is it?

242
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,570
Bring me some water.

243
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,510
I'll do it.

244
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,990
This is the abductor.

245
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,640
This is the thing.

246
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,370
This is my child.

247
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,830
Oh, I see.

248
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,380
I don't know what the abductor

249
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,280
has taught my child.

250
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,720
It's been a while.

251
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,470
It is.

252
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,150
This is his daily route to and from work.

253
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,300
I'll have an almond tofu cactus.

254
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,000
What are you doing?

255
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,080
I think we've done our part.

256
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,710
He passes over your head every day.

257
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,440
You can just block him

258
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,790
and bring your child back home, that's all.

259
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,880
Do you want to order together?

260
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,150
I've been wanting to say it.

261
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,780
You order nothing and keep sitting in our seats.

262
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,690
Officer Chen, do you want the same?

263
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,610
Let me see.

264
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,890
Though humans may be stupid and slow,

265
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,360
I have to admit,

266
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,930
the power of the human heart is very strong.

267
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,660
As invincible as I am,

268
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm made from the human heart.

269
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,220
Does the human heart refer to obsession?

270
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,820
Such as

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,120
longing, sorrows, and regrets.

272
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,270
I was right about you.

273
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,710
You are the smartest of all of you.

274
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,460
That guy held him with obsession.

275
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,550
If he won't let him go, my child can't come back.

276
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,170
You have to find a way to make that guy let go.

277
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,650
Shang Wu.

278
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,760
Are you bored at home alone?

279
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,780
Dad bought something I've been wanting for a long time.

280
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,570
Guess what's wrapped in here?

281
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,890
It's not just a pudding.

282
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,840
It's ice cream inside.

283
00:16:59,540 --> 00:16:59,990
How about this?

284
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,040
We don't cut it up piece by piece

285
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,390
after dinner.

286
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,329
-We'll just scoop it up with a spoon and eat it. -I'll have three quarters

287
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,869
and you'll take a quarter.

288
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:09,910
How is that?

289
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,319
Why is it not good?

290
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,130
Right, I forgot.

291
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,160
I agreed to

292
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,630
use a spoon.

293
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,069
We'll see who has the bigger spoon.

294
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,550
Whoever holds the bigger spoon can eat more.

295
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,970
What does that mean?

296
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,190
Their lunch is on us.

297
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,520
That'll give you a favor.

298
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,190
No need.

299
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,860
Guys, your lunch is on me and one-per.

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'll give it out.

301
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,770
I'll do it.

302
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,470
How could this happen?

303
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,440
I said one-per should join our group.

304
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,270
When?

305
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,250
When you were not here.

306
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,380
Everyone, come and get it.

307
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,220
One-per.

308
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,160
And me.

309
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,560
Zhao Wan.

310
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,730
One-per.

311
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,260
One…

312
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,650
It's from my friend's father's store.

313
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,440
It's extra-large.

314
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,220
This is lunch.

315
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,510
There are red beans in it.

316
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,410
There is a cold snap today.

317
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,760
Should we close the window?

318
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,760
I want to order hot noodles in soup.

319
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,900
Does anyone want to join me?

320
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,300
Don't order.

321
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,860
Let's go eat hot pot.

322
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,690
Let's go.

323
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,130
You're not going?

324
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,260
Don't you need to see me?

325
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,060
What if a child

326
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,460
was abducted by a stranger

327
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,500
and wouldn't leave

328
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,750
even if his parents found him,

329
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,370
so the parents couldn't force the child to leave

330
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,570
unless the stranger was willing to return him?

331
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,010
You're talking about that movie, right?

332
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:31,830
Which one?

333
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,320
The one where you cried so hard that you choked and coughed,

334
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,240
making people stare at you?

335
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:35,860
I didn't cry.

336
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,650
Did you get a kidnapping case?

337
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,660
If so, you should hand it over.

338
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,630
No kidnapping cases.

339
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,600
I'm just curious.

340
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,110
Do you have any way

341
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,170
to make the stranger

342
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,140
willing to

343
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,020
let the child go?

344
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,290
We abide by the law.

345
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
That is, to punish him by law.

346
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,600
Do you want to hypnotize him?

347
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,930
Otherwise, why do you wear the uniform?

348
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,980
Punish him by law.

349
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,720
Wait a minute.

350
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,550
This is not your job description.

351
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,250
I think most of your duties are

352
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,250
about traffic.

353
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,340
That's right.

354
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,620
It's traffic related.

355
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,700
I have to go.

356
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,300
Eat it while it's hot.

357
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,660
One-per.

358
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,480
One-per.

359
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:23,870
One-per.

360
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,610
I'm warning you.

361
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,840
Don't hide the case just to get credit.

362
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,860
The pharmacist and the unidentified body are serious.

363
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,720
It's not like the kidnapping case.

364
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,530
Don't mess around.

365
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,320
I swear, senior.

366
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,790
There's no such thing as human kidnapping.

367
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,190
Okay, I'll go by myself. Don't see me off.

368
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,020
Go back and eat.

369
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,960
It's not good if it gets cold.

370
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,430
There's no human kidnapping case?

371
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,550
Then if I beat him up,

372
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,860
will he

373
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,290
be willing to let the kid go?

374
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,530
No.

375
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,730
Then scare him.

376
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,930
Make him feel scared.

377
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,480
He'll be willing too, right?

378
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,070
No.

379
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,250
It seems I can do nothing to him then.

380
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:03,950
Let me tell you.

381
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,420
I didn't graduate from high school.

382
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,410
And I'm not an expert negotiator.

383
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,120
I can't make him willing to

384
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,200
give you back your child.

385
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,750
You may look like an imbecile.

386
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,710
But your smell and the shredded paper

387
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,690
are very much alike.

388
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,650
You have to have faith.

389
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,700
Don't always think of yourself as an idiot.

390
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,790
I don't think I ever said that.

391
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,650
I thought the guy passed here at this time every day.

392
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,920
Are you hungry?

393
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,080
Come on.

394
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:48,920
Where are you going?

395
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,230
To kill Pu Yiyong.

396
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,030
Hello, Grandma Zeng Jiang.

397
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,920
He wasn't like this before.

398
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,480
At least not before we moved here.

399
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,180
That's why I said we have good feng shui here.

400
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,010
This is the Shangcheng Police Station.

401
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,440
Yes.

402
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,110
Yes.

403
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:21,900
And the address is?

404
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,510
I see.

405
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,580
Chief, I'm going out on duty.

406
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:50,870
With whom?

407
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,040
With myself.

408
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,910
You're unbelievable.

409
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,440
Do you take me as a delivery boy?

410
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,220
None of my business.

411
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,440
I ordered it.

412
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,830
What did you get?

413
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,250
Burgers and coffee.

414
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,200
Burgers are easier to eat.

415
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,590
Coffee is for your potential staying up.

416
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,490
And you should be very tired after staying here all day.

417
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,740
They look familiar.

418
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,390
I didn't buy your share.

419
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,850
It's okay, I've already eaten.

420
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,620
Some people have reported

421
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,640
suspicious men

422
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,590
loitering here for several days.

423
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,950
You're suspected of being burglars.

424
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,260
Some people also report that you may be here to take pictures.

425
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,110
So please

426
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,290
come back to the bureau with us.

427
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,730
Did you take pictures?

428
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,360
I…

429
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,420
I didn't.

430
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,210
Ask him if you don't believe me.

431
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,750
Thank you for your cooperation.

432
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,570
I told you not to do stupid things.

433
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,240
I will persuade Pu Yiyong to change.

434
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,300
We'll save some effort

435
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,830
if we have more people like you in society.

436
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,410
Thank you, Fang.

437
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,830
Can I go to that table now?

438
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,030
One-per.

439
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,690
Yes.

440
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,640
How's it going?

441
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,540
No problem.

442
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,200
Come on, please.

443
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,300
Yes, thank you.

444
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,790
Why don't you check his phone?

445
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:38,620
He's your friend?

446
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,270
I'm sorry.

447
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,870
I'll talk to him again.

448
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,640
Is his kid dead?

449
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,320
I was just taking a chance

450
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,460
to see if he had any criminal record.

451
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,650
He had no criminal record.

452
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,750
But a year ago there was a report of a crime.

453
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,120
Yu Zhenyuan's child

454
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,640
died in an accidental fall.

455
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,940
Even if that's the case,

456
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,530
he can't just take away other people's child.

457
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,290
Theoretically.

458
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,750
Can we call it “a child”?

459
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,560
Do you have to take it back?

460
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:09,820
I'm sorry.

461
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,270
So what do we do now?

462
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:16,920
Punish him by law.

463
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,570
This is all I can do.

464
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,910
This is what my uniform is for.

465
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,390
I'm going to do the horribly boring patrol check-in.

466
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,910
And I'll be kind enough to take you back.

467
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,250
Go over there and distract her or stall for a while.

468
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,920
What do you want?

469
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,970
Are you aware

470
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,240
that you sound like a criminal already?

471
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,120
Come on.

472
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,870
What are you doing?

473
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,290
It's airier this way.

474
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,180
How do you want me to drive

475
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,670
if you don't close the door?

476
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,770
You can't drive if I close the door

477
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,860
because of the carbon dioxide.

478
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,050
I study medicine.

479
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,640
Believe me.

480
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,650
I noticed that the cop's computer was still on.

481
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,550
Go and memorize Yu Zhenyuan's address.

482
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,670
Are you ordering me around?

483
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,490
I'm sorry, please.

484
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,970
Watch out for your head.

485
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,580
-Sir, please sit down. -Thank you.

486
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,200
When I took the special exam,

487
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,970
I filled my Question 2 answer sheet with Question 1's answer,

488
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,830
and Question 3 answer sheet with Question 2's answer,

489
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,730
-and Question 4 answer sheet… -With Question 3's answer.

490
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,150
What do you want to say?

491
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:57,950
With Question 5's answer.

492
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,700
Did you have an eye problem?

493
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,370
Shut up.

494
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,050
What I mean is

495
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,770
sometimes we just miss the test.

496
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,370
Don't blame yourself so much.

497
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,040
You'll get so stressed out that you'll go crazy.

498
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,190
Am I right?

499
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,100
I didn't.

500
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,930
Did I ask you?

501
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,580
Am I right, Guangyan?

502
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,680
I didn't either.

503
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,740
He did.

504
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,560
Lane 37, Sec. 2, Wanji Road, Taipei City.

505
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,320
[Inquiry record]

506
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,970
Lane 37, Sec. 2, Wanji Road,

507
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,840
Seventh Floor, No.4-1, Lane 37.

508
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,560
Lane 37, Sec. 2, Wanji Road,

509
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,370
Seventh Floor, No.4-1, Lane 37.

510
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,410
You've been promoted.

511
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,830
I thought you were incapable.

512
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,060
Please.

513
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,880
No. 1, Lane 37, Lane 4, Wanan Street, Taipei City.

514
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,420
Wanan Street?

515
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,860
May I ask what you want from

516
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,140
Chief Yu, please?

517
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,120
I made it very clear yesterday.

518
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,810
It was a misunderstanding on our part.

519
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,600
And we've canceled the report.

520
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,930
Report?

521
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,120
What happened yesterday that you want to report?

522
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,230
It's okay.

523
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,740
I can check it out when I go back to the bureau.

524
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,700
Maybe you can't just cancel it.

525
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,160
unilaterally.

526
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,200
Are you really going to be a criminal?

527
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,050
You made me count wrong again.

528
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,220
And you're a low-IQ criminal.

529
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,140
Forget it.

530
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,420
Sidewalk Kid!

531
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,770
What are you doing?

532
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,910
What are you afraid of?

533
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,170
The guy's at work and he's not home.

534
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,510
Did he quit?

535
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,090
I haven't agreed yet.

536
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,630
He's on leave without pay.

537
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,780
I'm thinking about

538
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,770
how to explain it to the leaders.

539
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,540
The chief said

540
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,520
he worked in a factory.

541
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,370
Every year, he received so many off-campus teachings.

542
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,050
But Shang Wu

543
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,510
never had the chance to visit it.

544
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,220
This is our tour line.

545
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,400
I shouldn't have let him see those kids.

546
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,850
Actually, it took less than 30 minutes.

547
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,370
The guards noticed something strange later.

548
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,830
He called the police and also contacted me.

549
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,250
I told the police that it was a misunderstanding.

550
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,400
Nothing was stolen or damaged.

551
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,020
Then it was not a public charge.

552
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,310
Since the people involved were not pursuing the case,

553
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,510
they left.

554
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:29,970
Officer Chen.

555
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,790
I hope that's enough.

556
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,790
Chief Yu,

557
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,880
experienced an accident at home one year ago.

558
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,520
I know this.

559
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,890
I can understand…

560
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,520
No way.

561
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,100
You can't understand

562
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,790
what the parents feel like

563
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,010
when something happens to their children.

564
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,230
No one can understand.

565
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,340
Other people can just try to imagine.

566
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,880
Empathy is just

567
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,420
the magnification of sympathy.

568
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,260
I've told you before.

569
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,760
Don't feel sorry for others with your thoughts.

570
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,450
An acquaintance of mine

571
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,680
said something similar to you.

572
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,660
It seems we don't need to get involved.

573
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,350
Say it again.

574
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,570
What's that green sidewalk called?

575
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,510
Marked crosswalk.

576
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,920
Please stop shouting.

577
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,780
Marked crosswalk. Your father is looking for you!

578
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,230
Why is he home?

579
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,340
With your thinking logic,

580
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,570
You're going to sneak up there now, aren't you?

581
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,950
You must have brought tools to break into their house too.

582
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,050
If I get caught,

583
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,840
I'll confess that you forced me to do this.

584
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:47,560
Let's go now.

585
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,130
Why?

586
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,980
Aren't we going?

587
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,010
Let's go.

588
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,500
I'm sorry.

589
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,700
You can't get me.

590
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,530
The kid is next to him, right?

591
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,960
What does he look like?

592
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,430
Draw it and let me see.

593
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,380
I'll grind some ink when the light turns red.

594
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,750
The light is about to turn red.

595
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,000
Catch the one behind.

596
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,910
Is there a blue one?

597
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,020
Okay, go down.

598
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,710
You got it.

599
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,670
Good for Shang Wu.

600
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,210
Look.

601
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,400
Do you like it?

602
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,000
Here you go.

603
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,740
Let's go to the machine.

604
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,370
I hate this place. It's a waste of time

605
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,550
and money.

606
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,280
I can't believe I can't get it.

607
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,170
Why are you taking my money?

608
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,770
It won't work.

609
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,490
This is a scam.

610
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,220
Thank you.

611
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,530
This is for 200 yuan.

612
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,540
What can I get you?

613
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,520
I'm not hungry.

614
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,490
You can order it.

615
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,430
The minimum charge is one drink, sir.

616
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,620
I have this.

617
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,160
Thank you.

618
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,290
What kind of fruits are in

619
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,260
fruit yogurt salad?

620
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,060
Please enjoy the children's meal.

621
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,510
Thank you.

622
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,590
Gentleman,

623
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,890
your Paris Express has arrived.

624
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,090
Please enjoy it.

625
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,280
You can order it too.

626
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,680
I'm not hungry.

627
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,090
Four full tickets?

628
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,620
Yes.

629
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,050
Here. Four full tickets here.

630
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,920
Thank you.

631
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,900
Hello, one adult and one child.

632
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:00,570
Okay.

633
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,230
Let's get the tickets.

634
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,290
To go to this place with you?

635
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,680
What's wrong with that?

636
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,560
Hurry up, I don't have my wallet.

637
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,389
I hate these places that waste time.

638
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,969
But we all received off-campus teachings in elementary school.

639
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,130
I always took time off.

640
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,330
What's the value of teaching here?

641
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,130
Let me check your ticket.

642
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,360
One full ticket, one ticket.

643
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,810
Are there any children here?

644
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,239
Yes.

645
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,190
Excuse me.

646
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,170
Do you have any stickers

647
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,699
for children?

648
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,270
Yes.

649
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,739
Here, help me choose one.

650
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:33,489
Which one do you like?

651
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,310
This one is good. Thank you.

652
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,139
Let's go.

653
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,800
Sir.

654
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,040
You can have both of them.

655
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,610
Thank you.

656
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,320
Please come in.

657
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,340
We came together.

658
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,429
Okay, you can go in now.

659
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,790
Do you have a sticker?

660
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,900
No, it's just for kids.

661
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:52,909
But I just bought the ticket.

662
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,960
-I can't go against the company rules. -Are you going or not?

663
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,400
Please come in.

664
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,880
I've got the ticket. I should have been able to take it.

665
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,830
Why do you need those stickers?

666
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,030
I bought the tickets.

667
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,700
Shut up.

668
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:14,870
Come on.

669
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,470
I still don't understand

670
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,280
what's so fun about the wiggly thing.

671
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,760
It's so much fun!

672
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,820
It's not fun. It's a waste of time.

673
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:49,980
Turn back.

674
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,010
Turn back.

675
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,390
Where is he?

676
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:54,980
Over there.

677
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:56,610
Turn back.

678
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,400
Excuse me.

679
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,350
Excuse me.

680
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,420
Did you see the Ferris wheel?

681
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:06,620
The Ferris wheel.

682
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,240
Here we are.

683
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,970
The river we just passed

684
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,750
is right there.

685
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,990
We've ridden bikes there before.

686
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,920
Give me back my phone.

687
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,500
I have to delete them.

688
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,540
Have you seen Yu Zhenyuan?

689
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,570
Why is that cup faster than us?

690
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,160
You want it to be faster, don't you?

691
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,050
Faster!

692
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,830
Faster!

693
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,560
I thought you wanted it to be faster.

694
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,350
No way.

695
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,560
Did you forget?

696
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,330
You used to throw up on

697
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,220
this coffee cup.

698
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,600
Do you want to throw up again?

699
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,760
Thank you.

700
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,740
Don't worry, I'll get it for you.

701
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,250
Go on.

702
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,850
Let's go find a seat.

703
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,810
Hello. What can I get you?

704
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,550
I've just thrown up and had no appetite.

705
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,050
Then you don't have to buy anything.

706
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:32,940
I'll have vanilla.

707
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,880
Chocolate.

708
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,310
Or mango?

709
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,960
Or grilled squid?

710
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,010
Two iced coffees.

711
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:44,420
Okay.

712
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,950
Look at all the food on your hands.

713
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,820
This one too.

714
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,420
Come on, I'll wipe it for you.

715
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,310
Can you draw now?

716
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,360
Where did you get this?

717
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,600
I bought it at the gift store.

718
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,710
You went to the gift store?

719
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,560
Just draw it.

720
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,960
Wipe your mouth here.

721
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,350
Here.

722
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,430
No.

723
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:10,720
Why?

724
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,160
Don't you always draw for us?

725
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,620
The child is a fake.

726
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,160
There's no point in drawing him.

727
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:25,900
You're back.

728
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,420
Yiyong.

729
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,890
Last time you asked me

730
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,010
if I might have written a book with your father.

731
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,600
I asked my former colleagues.

732
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,200
I did.

733
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,560
This is the book.

734
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,500
What book?

735
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,430
This one.

736
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,720
“The way to open a successful business even at the age of five”.

737
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,270
Why did you come back together?

738
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,440
Did you meet after class?

739
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,640
We didn't go to class.

740
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,050
We went to the amusement park.

741
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,010
With Yiyong?

742
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,800
I'm going to take a shower first.

743
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,060
Good.

744
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,510
I can't believe Guangyan skipped school

745
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,620
and went to the amusement park with Yiyong.

746
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,720
You've grown up.

747
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,280
Thank you.

748
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,690
Cheers.

749
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,710
I heard from Guangyan's father

750
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,550
that he skipped school

751
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,910
and went to the amusement park with you today.

752
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,710
It's not good to skip school, right?

753
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,150
That's great.

754
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,920
-Even if it's someone else's son, how can you... -No, no.

755
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,420
I didn't say that.

756
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,190
His father did.

757
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,810
He said he was relieved.

758
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,900
Because Guangyan has never seemed to lose control or make mistakes like this

759
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,470
since he was a child.

760
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,110
So he should thank you.

761
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
What's wrong with him?

762
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,930
He's strange

763
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,280
like my father.

764
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:29,920
What are you doing?

765
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,270
Are you going to throw up after a little drink?

766
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,030
If you want to throw up, go to the toilet.

767
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,820
Don't throw up here.

768
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,890
I finally know why

769
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,810
I've been so upset lately.

770
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,740
I thought it was because Cao Guangyan was bothering me too much.

771
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,990
Dad is so tired.

772
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,320
I can't walk anymore.

773
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,630
Why don't you carry me?

774
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,850
Or you can be my crutch like before.

775
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,460
Are you happy?

776
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,310
Are you happy?

777
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,980
You can press the code today,

778
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,710
like playing video games.

779
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,130
Didn't you always argue to press the code?

780
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,060
You said it was the past.

781
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,170
Return the child.

782
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,550
Return the child.

783
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,230
Get in.

784
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,160
Don't come any closer, I'll call the police.

785
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,530
See what the kid looks like.

786
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,100
Yu Jinyuan.

787
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:42,880
Yu Jinyuan.

788
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,540
If I died

789
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,960
and my dad found someone to replace me,

790
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,760
I'd be super upset.

791
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,240
Open the door!

792
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,110
Return the child!

793
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,640
The fever's gone.

794
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:17,630
I've taken

795
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:19,870
Shang Wu home.

796
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,810
Wait a minute.

797
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,900
Shang Wu, mommy wants to talk to you on the phone.

798
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,400
Shang Wu.

799
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,620
Shang Wu.

800
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,780
Although you've already taken a bath,

801
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,150
do you want to go to your favorite place

802
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,740
you used to go?

803
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,110
I used to take you to the department store,

804
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:00,790
to the amusement park,

805
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,120
to ride a bicycle

806
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:03,870
and play games.

807
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,820
At the end of the day, you'd always say

808
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,180
you wanted to come here.

809
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,690
You thought it was the most fun.

810
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,480
Your mom and I were angry

811
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,030
because we thought we could have saved

812
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,970
all the money

813
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:24,960
with which we took you to those places.

814
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:29,980
Shang Wu.

815
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,110
You're eight years old too, right?

816
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,750
Thank you.

817
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,670
Thank you for going to so many places with me

818
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,530
and eating so much food.

819
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,340
It made me feel like

820
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,080
I was spending more time

821
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:24,920
with Shang Wu.

822
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,800
I'm sorry.

823
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,810
I thought you were Shang Wu.

824
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,990
That young man was right.

825
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,130
I should let you go.

826
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,420
If only Shang Wu

827
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,370
wasn't a fragile flesh and blood body like you're.

828
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:29,960
Let's go.

829
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:34,800
Please do one thing for me.

830
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,570
What did you see?

831
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,640
[Next Episode Preview]

832
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,550
It's like a dream, but it's not.

833
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:22,110
You and Yiyong are becoming more and more alike.

834
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,050
I'll plan your career.

835
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,040
Did you do this to me?

836
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,950
I can't forgive myself.

837
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,990
Do you want to be like him?

838
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,260
Or will you choose differently?

839
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,730
I won't let him go.
