It closed down again, Mr. Cao?

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,870
So I decided to

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,480
take a stab at a different field.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,420
That's great.

Wow, this.

How is this? Not bad, right?

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,990
What's that sound?

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,740
Yiyong, you brat.

His foot has been injured before,

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,870
so it's dangerous for him to take the stairs.

No, Director.

Which one?

It doesn't matter what movie it is.

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,550
It says in the movie that

No, Director.

00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,670
He... He had a situation.

He's an adult, right?

52
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,350
Don't commit a crime.

53
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,980

54
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,760

Officer Chen, thanks for your work.

61
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,820
Well, it's just a little annoying.

62
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,400
You made the cops

63
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,170

64
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,079

It's a woman.

It's true.

She's not scary.

174
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,680
Instead, she's quite

175
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,760
pretty.

176
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,780
I said

177
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,660
I wasn't afraid.

178
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,140

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,060
Exchange what?

194
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,180
You got it too, right?

195
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,790
A piece of paper from the old lady.

196
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,710
Why should I give it to you?

197
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,100
Didn't you want my writing?

198
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,190
Give it to me.

199
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,510
I don't want your writing.

200
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,140
Then you should leave.

201
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,370
Go.

202
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,460
Let's go to your place and sleep.

203
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,070
Why?

204
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,530
Give it back.

205
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,630
Why are you so mean to her?

206
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,810
She's a girl after all.

207
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,860
That's not a girl.

208
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,000
So annoying.

209
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:51,920
She's really gone.

210
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,340
I know where she is.

211
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,830
Are you going to help her?

212
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,660
You needn't go to school today?

213
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,680
I get good grades. It doesn't matter if I don't go to school.

214
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,610
Don't be smug.

215
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,960
You asked me.

216
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,520
Let's go.

217
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,520
27.

218
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,950
Give him 27 yuan.

219
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,230
You're a liar.

220
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,470
I help them before I make money?

221
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,359
I'm not that nice.

222
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,880
When are you going to see her, exactly?

223
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,180
Now.

224
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,440
Delivery.

225
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,570
You really are a liar.

226
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
I'm not lying.

227
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,750
I was gonna stop by anyway.

228
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,680
I'm just dropping this off on the way.

229
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,760
Ms. He,

230
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,220
Ms. He,

231
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,750
Ms. He,

232
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,470
The man I was talking about is here, Ms. He.

233
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,280
Thank you so much.

234
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,590
You're welcome, Ms. He.

235
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,940
Just scream if something happens.

236
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,130
Remember it.

237
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,410
Okay.

238
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,180
Bye.

239
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:01,940
Bye.

240
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,390
Sorry.

241
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,830
I know it's a little weird.

242
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,550
My surname is He.

243
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,190
I'm He Shoutang.

244
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,040
That's...

245
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,680
Miss Su.

246
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,120
She told me about you.

247
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,940
So I really want to meet you.

248
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,480
But the delivery company won't give us the information.

249
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,770
So she kept ordering takeout

250
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,900
to see if she can run into you.

251
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,320
I didn't expect you to actually show up.

252
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,330
That's why I...

253
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,990
I'm really sorry.

254
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,340
That doll...

255
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,530
What's wrong with that doll?

256
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,810
Where have you seen her?

257
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,340
Is she a real person?

258
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,600
She's my daughter.

259
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,080
Where is she?

260
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,380
She was kidnapped seven years ago,

261
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,890
and went missing.

262
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,220
Did you call the police?

263
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,950
I didn't dare at first.

264
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,650
When we didn't hear from them again after the money was paid, we called the police.

265
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,970
It's been seven years. So please...

266
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,590
Why did you leave that day and then come back?

267
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,860
Did you ever see her or...

268
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,630
Do you know

269
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,470
a girl who looks just like her?

270
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,620
It's because he...

271
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,590
It was only because I had never seen a doll

272
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,760
that looked so much like a real person.

273
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,700
So I was curious

274
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,720
and took a few more looks.

275
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,820
Oh.

276
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,780
Was this a toy store or something?

277
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,660
No.

278
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,060
It's not a toy store.

279
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,380
The goods sold here are not fixed.

280
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,160
I majored in sculpture,

281
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,940
craft design.

282
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,160
So these are usually

283
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,470
the handmade products that people want.

284
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,920
Is it the same with dolls?

285
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,050
It was my first time making a doll.

286
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,250
Isn't the doll cute?

287
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,780
My daughter is just a little fat.

288
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,040
Fat?

289
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,980
No.

290
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,100
Isn't she tall and thin?

291
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,830
Do you have time

292
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,800
to stay a little longer?

293
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,550
[Missing Person: Xie He'an]

294
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,580
This is my daughter.

295
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,760
The day she disappeared,

296
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,680
she was wearing this pair of hairpins.

297
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,210
Did you make the hairpins too?

298
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,820
She loved them.

299
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,830
She wore them every day.

300
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,810
May I ask, how old was she?

301
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,760
Nine years old.

302
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,750
So young.

303
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,090
Do you sleep here all the time?

304
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,920
Most of the time.

305
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,950
I'm really sorry

306
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,820
to have to tell you so much.

307
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,270
One.

308
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,160
Three.

309
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,150
Four.

310
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,530
Ms. He,

311
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,320
are there seven dolls?

312
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,160
There isn't just one doll, right?

313
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,430
Seven.

314
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,110
Every year

315
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,940
I'd imagine how she'd look a year older

316
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
and make a doll.

317
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,810
I hope that there'd be someone who'd walk by the window

318
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,430
and tell us that

319
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,480
he saw a little girl who looked the same somewhere.

320
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,520
But my husband didn't want to.

321
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,120
So I just kept them all in there.

322
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,750
We're leaving now.

323
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:35,980
Will you be here

324
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,660
again?

325
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,130
You'll come here again, right?

326
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,750
The ground was covered with dust.

327
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,870
Everyone who lives there gets sick.

328
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,190
Why didn't you tell Ms. He you saw her?

329
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,480
Don't give hope to people

330
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,850
who have lost their family members.

331
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,200
License.

332
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,670
Isn't it too sweet?

333
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,030
No.

334
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,990
It's delicious.

335
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,970
Do you have any black coffee?

336
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,500
I have water from the ditch. Want that?

337
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,440
You gonna help me shine a light on it or not?

338
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:37,740
Below.

339
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,390
Below.

340
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,070
I asked you to shine a light on it, but you didn't.

341
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,570
And you're eating cake.

342
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,660
It's hooked.

343
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,270
It's sweet, right?

344
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,160
So it's not my problem.

345
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:23,930
It's really sweet.

346
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,710
I think you have a problem with your taste, too.

347
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,670
Who's it from?

348
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:28,880
Wasn't I

349
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,280
assigned by the director

350
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,110
to support the youth project?

351
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,610
How'd we know?

352
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
Anyway, at that event

353
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,930
I met a cake maker.

354
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,510
He took the cakes to the station

355
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,500
and said they were low in sugar.

356
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,190
Are the police allowed to accept gifts?

357
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,060
What gift?

358
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,650
Just a taste test.

359
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,090
Isn't it said that eating sweet things would make your mood better?

360
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,200
-Because a rapid rise in blood sugar stimulates insulin... -Just say yes.

361
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,250
Have some, punk.

362
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,600
I can't help it.

363
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,070
Just take it as medicine.

364
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,100
Guangyan.

365
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,450
Hold him down.

366
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,000
Okay.

367
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,390
Take a big bite.

368
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,430
Childish.

369
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,330
Why are you blushing?

370
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,500
So that woman

371
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,060
made me according to how her child looked like.

372
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,900
Why?

373
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,060
What?

374
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,690
I'm not her daughter.

375
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,330
Why should I accept

376
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,840
that woman's feelings and emotions?

377
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,370
You wouldn't be here without her.

378
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,240
Did she ask me?

379
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,390
I didn't want to be born as a substitute.

380
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,330
I don't want to be stuck there.

381
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,910
That woman made me miserable and confused.

382
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,660
I'm not even sure what I look like.

383
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,760
I can't even get rid of this annoying hairpin.

384
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,560
How can we help you?

385
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,560
Find her daughter

386
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,760
and let me go.

387
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,370
We're already working on it.

388
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,420
A kidnapping case from seven years ago

389
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,350
is hard,

390
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,420
very hard.

391
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,430
But the harder the case, the bigger the credit.

392
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,460
Good things happen when I'm with you.

393
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,080
Senior.

394
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,750
I'm One-per.

395
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,980
No, I'm Chuying.

396
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,810
I have a favor to ask you.

397
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,410
Yes.

398
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,350
She didn't mean that.

399
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,680
Does it matter if she meant it or not?

400
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,740
The end result is the same anyway.

401
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,510
Yes.

402
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,340
You'll do anything

403
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,430
to get what you want.

404
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,030
Turn away.

405
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,320
With your head!

406
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,240
I found it.

407
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,450
They only reported the case afterwards.

408
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,510
The clues were really insufficient.

409
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,910
And it's been so long.

410
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,740
Maybe it's just that it's taken so long

411
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,530
for so many things to come to light.

412
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,710
Whatever.

413
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,870
Let me take a look first.

414
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,900
Promise me,

415
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,820
just look at it, don't think of taking it away.

416
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,700
You're not taking it seriously.

417
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,230
She looks like a cop.

418
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,070
She really does.

419
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,890
I wasn't so hopeful just by looking at her face,

420
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,850
but now it looks like something.

421
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,250
Sometimes, when I see her in her police uniform, I would think

422
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,570
she's just role-playing.

423
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,540
But where did she get the whiteboard from?

424
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,820
This is from our calligraphy classroom.

425
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,660
Why are you whispering so loud?

426
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,090
I risked my life

427
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,990
to get you these files.

428
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:53,560
Fine.

429
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,540
Don't look into anything.

430
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,870
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,580
Xie He'an.

432
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,390
She's nine years old

433
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,450
and in the third grade of primary school.

434
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,960
She walked to and from school.

435
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:07,850
Every day after school,

436
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,650
she would go to He Shouzheng's studio.

437
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,400
The time was not fixed.

438
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,490
But she would arrive by three o'clock at the latest.

439
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,600
Mom, I'm back.

440
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,290
Why didn't you come straight back home?

441
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,440
Where did you go?

442
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,590
Hello.

443
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,840
On the evening of the kidnapping,

444
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,990
He Shoutang got a call with a voice changer,

445
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,880
claiming that Xie He'an had been kidnapped by them,

446
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,100
and they're asking for a ransom of 5 million.

447
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,580
And he threatened to kill her child immediately

448
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,430
if they call the police.

449
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,230
Proof of the child's possession

450
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,110
was the doll charm

451
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,350
[The only exhibit]

452
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,250
from Xie He'an's backpack that

453
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,480
dropped off in the studio's mailbox.

454
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,080
He Shoutang and her husband, Xie Hui

455
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,270
only raised 3 million

456
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,420
in two days.

457
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,330
After bargaining with the kidnappers,

458
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,410
the ransom money

459
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,490
was placed on this road.

460
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,680
The kidnappers agreed to release Xie He'an

461
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,180
after they received the ransom

462
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,760
and made sure they didn't call the police.

463
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,540
But after that, they haven't heard from them.

464
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,640
Only then they called the police.

465
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,160
Since they didn't call the police,

466
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,270
within a week of the incident,

467
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,200
the investigating police had very few leads

468
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,850
about the kidnappers.

469
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,070
These are all the people who were interviewed at the time,

470
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,060
including Xie He'an's parents.

471
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,640
They were all questioned at the time.

472
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,920
Why?

473
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,980
We can't rule out that they're putting up a show for this child abuse.

474
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,570
These two are He Shoutang's employees.

475
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,550
One was a fine arts undergraduate at the time.

476
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,900
One was a single mother

477
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,550
with a teenage daughter.

478
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,990
Her daughter was Xie He'an's senior at school.

479
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,110
Xie Hui's coworkers and their neighbors

480
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,060
have all been investigated.

481
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:17,770
Guangyan.

482
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,230
Guangyan.

483
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,990
Cao Guangyan, what are you doing?

484
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,090
I'm more used to reading words.

485
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,160
Case files are classified. I don't even have access to them.

486
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,390
How can you

487
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,540
go through it casually like this?

488
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,160
Besides, the group leader is speaking.

489
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,330
Do you, a group member, have any manners?

490
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,440
What group member? What are you talking about?

491
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,040
And if you couldn't get it, why did you have it?

492
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,120
Turn away.

493
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,800
Why are you asking so much?

494
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:54,970
Who is this person?

495
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:56,860
Zhao Baisi.

496
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,850
He's Xie He'an's father's colleague.

497
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,980
On the day of the kidnapping,

498
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,540
he had dinner with the craft store employee, Lin Jingmei,

499
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,920
the single mother

500
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,820
with a daughter

501
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,150
we were talking about.

502
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,350
He's a witness of Lin Jingmei's alibi.

503
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,230
You memorised it so fast?

504
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,760
I've seen this person a few times.

505
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,620
In the shop?

506
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,660
No.

507
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,850
So...

508
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,320
Is there any news on what happened to He'an?

509
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,810
So far we've just reviewed the documents.

510
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,240
I hope we can find a new direction.

511
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time

512
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,130
for something that happened so long ago.

513
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,700
You must be very busy at work.

514
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,320
You don't have to say that.

515
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,880
I do business so my time is more flexible.

516
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,410
Being able to help

517
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,500
is the only thing I hope for.

518
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,330
Have you contacted him

519
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,700
after Xie Hui resigned?

520
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,660
Occasionally.

521
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,400
It's said in the records that

522
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,950
you were a frequent visitor to his wife's craft store

523
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,640
before the incident.

524
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,400
On holidays,

525
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,180
I used to go look for Xie Hui in the store quite often.

526
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,360
I'm jealous.

527
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,550
He must be very nice.

528
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,130
Otherwise, who'd want to see

529
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,670
their boss when they leave the office?

530
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,190
Have you been there recently?

531
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,210
The craft store.

532
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,580
He's been there a lot

533
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,170
since He'an's incident.

534
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,140
And then

535
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,030
you stopped going for good?

536
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:41,570
No.

537
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,640
How many times has he been there?

538
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,380
And when?

539
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,200
I mean,

540
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,960
staring at you out there like that.

541
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,010
Three times.

542
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,290
I can't remember.

543
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,330
But the most recent one was a few days ago.

544
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,130
Were you there a week ago?

545
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,810
A week ago,

546
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,850
what brought you to his store?

547
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,620
You don't have to clean up.

548
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,840
I didn't invite you

549
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,670
here

550
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,010
to do this for me.

551
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,250
This really puts me on the spot.

552
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,560
Please stop cleaning.

553
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,000
You gotta clean this up,

554
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,600
or you'll get sick.

555
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,420
That's what the doctor said.

556
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,170
I'm not one yet.

557
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,260
Besides, we should be the one feeling embarrassed

558
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,710
in shower caps.

559
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,290
This.

560
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,060
Where could we have found a cooler looking bandana

561
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,510
so last minute?

562
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,800
Cool bandana？

563
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,280
What does it look like?

564
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,400
Add facial features or I can't understand.

565
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,210
Draw it more detailed or I can't understand.

566
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,720
Add a body or I can't understand.

567
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,950
What exactly are you trying to understand?

568
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,330
Ms. He,

569
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,460
can I have this one?

570
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:33,980
Sure.

571
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,520
It's almost done.

572
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,750
Thank you.

573
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,480
But the bottom has not been cleaned.

574
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,120
It doesn't matter.

575
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,580
Take a break first.

576
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,590
I'm sorry.

577
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,830
I contacted Hui as an emergency

578
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,210
because I thought there was some progress on He'an's case.

579
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,810
Am I not supposed to...

580
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,740
It's okay. It's okay.

581
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,790
Any news?

582
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:11,870
It's okay.

583
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,480
Don't worry, Hui.

584
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,490
Officer Chen just wants to

585
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,890
sort out He'an's case

586
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,570
to see if there is anything she missed.

587
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,570
Yes.

588
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,290
As I mentioned,

589
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,510
Mr. Zhao went to

590
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,770
He Shoutang's craft store a week ago.

591
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,820
Actually, I was just passing by.

592
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,340
Passing by?

593
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,230
I have clients over there.

594
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,040
I know that.

595
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,840
Zhao did call me and told me

596
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,610
that my wife has...

597
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,070
What's wrong with her?

598
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,520
She made the doll...

599
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,690
What are you doing?

600
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,530
There's no difference between ten and nine, right?

601
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,660
What are you doing?

602
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,520
People say

603
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,330
people don't normally look like how they look in photos and videos.

604
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,730
I want to make her for the window.

605
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,350
It would leave people passing by

606
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,070
a stronger impression

607
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,170
than the photo on the leaflet.

608
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,820
What if someone saw her where she was...

609
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,910
What are you doing?

610
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,650
I said I was making a doll that looks like her at ten years-old...

611
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,510
Don't!

612
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,700
Don't do it.

613
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,270
Don't make Xie He'an like that.

614
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,390
I did it anyway.

615
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,400
He felt like it was cruel.

616
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,530
I thought it was a hope.

617
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,190
We fought a lot after that.

618
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,210
Seeing each other

619
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,290
made us more miserable.

620
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,120
It's better

621
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,040
not to see each other like this.

622
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,320
So...

623
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,390
And if Xie He'an ever comes back,

624
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,580
there would be at least one person

625
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,980
waiting at the door, either at home or here.

626
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,810
That's why

627
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,320
I live here alone.

628
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,390
Sorry, Ms. He.

629
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,120
You don't have to answer

630
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,390
such a rude question.

631
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,660
I kept kicking him in the shin just now.

632
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,500
Yet he kept asking.

633
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,380
I thought you were shaking your leg.

634
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,360
Who knows what you're up to?

635
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,080
It doesn't matter.

636
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,760
It's not that hard to tell.

637
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,630
When you talk about it, it feels like...

638
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,240
I called you here today

639
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,660
because I wanted to ask you something.

640
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,690
I was wondering if you saw...

641
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,060
I want to hear

642
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,240
what you think of the doll I made.

643
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,020
I grew up

644
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,700
only reading comics,

645
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,370
not dolls.

646
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,760
You should ask him.

647
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,570
He had no friends when he was young.

648
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,920
So he must've grown up playing with dolls,

649
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,180
and is more knowledgeable.

650
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,510
Ms. He,

651
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,690
don't listen to his baseless incoherence.

652
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,310
But...

653
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,880
I don't know anything about dolls,

654
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,080
but that doll is very realistic.

655
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,230
The first time I saw it,

656
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,900
it reminded me of

657
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,520
the vice monitor of my fourth grade class.

658
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,470
Of course, I was class monitor at the time.

659
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,350
That's what you want to tell us, right?

660
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,600
What's so great about being the class monitor?

661
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,650
What about you?

662
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,300
I was a sports head once.

663
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,280
No, I mean the doll.

664
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,450
That doll is very realistic.

665
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,840
The first time I saw it,

666
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,620
I remembered the girls in my high school class.

667
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,650
What high school?

668
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,770
Your judgment is slipping again?

669
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,730
And your thoughts were literally copied from mine.

670
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,130
It's not.

671
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,600
Can you draw it for me?

672
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,470
Draw what?

673
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:45,980
The doll.

674
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,390
Why?

675
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,800
Ms. He's husband came too?

676
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,800
According to her husband,

677
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,960
he had objected to He Shoutang making the doll.

678
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,660
They often quarreled bitterly about it.

679
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:04,620
Yes.

680
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,460
We just heard Ms. He talk about it.

681
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,200
It's fine if she just made the doll.

682
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,760
Xie Hui never allowed his wife

683
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,900
to put the doll in the window,

684
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,550
where passers-by would point at it as an anecdote.

685
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,210
Later, she took into consideration of her husband's feelings

686
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,070
and put them away.

687
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,980
But a week ago,

688
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,530
when Zhao Baisi was visiting a business partner,

689
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,510
he saw it was put out again.

690
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,340
He got angry and told Xie Hui.

691
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,240
It's none of his business.

692
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,020
He said he was sorry for

693
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,990
what had happened to his family.

694
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,520
But he also thought it was too morbid

695
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,660
to make her daughter into a doll.

696
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,520
He's purely defending his friend.

697
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,160
That's why my doll saw

698
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,310
Zhao Baisi looking at him with a horrible expression.

699
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,940
What "my doll"?

700
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,750
He just saw the doll being put out.

701
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,870
Why was Zhao so angry?

702
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,310
I still think it's none of his business.

703
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,190
That's right.

704
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
That's what I asked Zhao Baisi.

705
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,210
Did you tell him "it's none of your business" too?

706
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,210
I'm not him.

707
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,210
I'm very tactful.

708
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,590
It's none of your business.

709
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,480
You two heard me wrong.

710
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,800
I just said

711
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,080
why were you so empathetic of Xie Hui?

712
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,760
It's his family matter after all.

713
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,440
You may not know much about it.

714
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,280
We do business.

715
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,830
If there's nothing, it's nothing.

716
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,070
But if the performance is not up to par,

717
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,710
our supervisor would cuss us out.

718
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,490
You will feel like you're not a human.

719
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,860
It was only when I transferred to be under Hui

720
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,460
that I began to feel a little dignified.

721
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,250
Otherwise, I wouldn't have made it this far.

722
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,890
Isn't that what most people do in this business?

723
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:36,920
Because my cousin is also a businessman, so...

724
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,520
So I'm especially thankful of Hui.

725
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
I'm not that great.

726
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,900
Isn't that what you're doing for Mei?

727
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,480
Mei?

728
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,960
His wife.

729
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,320
I introduced them to each other.

730
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,830
Mei is Lin Jingmei.

731
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,650
She's He Shoutang's former employee.

732
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,890
They got married?

733
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,650
After the kidnapping.

734
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,880
You don't remember who Lin Jingmei is?

735
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,850
The one with a daughter.

736
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,180
I still don't think

737
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,850
it's his business.

738
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,090
Why are you still talking about that?

739
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,710
Actually, I also think something is weird.

740
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,230
But I can't tell.

741
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,120
This is Lin Jingmei's daughter, Lin Xin.

742
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:41,860
She's in 12th grade now.

743
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:42,760
Go talk to her.

744
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,100
Why?

745
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,930
You're more handsome.

746
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:45,900
No, I mean why...

747
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,310
Then you go to her store.

748
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:49,470
Why?

749
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,590
You're uglier.

750
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,350
Sorry. Sorry.

751
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:55,920
The conference room is occupied.

752
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,280
Sorry. Excuse me.

753
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,160
Hey.

754
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:17,220
You're the cop.

755
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,190
Why the two of us?

756
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,990
Yes, why?

757
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,890
It's exactly because I'm a cop that

758
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,660
it's inconvenient.

759
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,500
Are you two disobeying orders?

760
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,430
One-per.

761
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:24,920
This address.

762
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,590
Why does he always call you One-per?

763
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,200
Shut up. Let's go.

764
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,340
Explain it, One-per.

765
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,240
Director.

766
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,430
Pu Yiyong came to return the cup.

767
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:34,840
Where is the cup?

768
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:36,420
He forgot it.

769
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:39,450
Well...

770
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,120
Come here.

771
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,110
From tomorrow onwards,

772
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,770
you switch with One-per.

773
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,060
She's in my team.

774
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,050
Yes, Director.

775
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,770
No.

776
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,740
I have something to do.

777
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,890
I have long wanted to ask her why her name was One-per.

778
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,180
But I kept forgetting it.

779
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,750
I don't know.

780
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,090
Maybe it's because of her IQ.

781
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,480
Heh.

782
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:57,750
Right.

783
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,190
Who are you to laugh at her?

784
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:02,960
Let's go.

785
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:05,500
Hurry up.

786
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,190
Why do you hate me so much?

787
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,280
I don't hate you.

788
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,260
I hate you guys.

789
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,670
What us?

790
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,330
You haunt everyone who can see you.

791
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,140
If we don't help you, you hurt people.

792
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,080
I've never hurt anyone.

793
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,590
Who knows?

794
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,570
Then why did you help me?

795
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,530
I just feel sorry for Xie He'an.

796
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:48,910
I'm helping her,

797
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,280
not you.

798
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,490
Xie He'an?

799
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,850
Xie He'an again.

800
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,670
It was me in the window.

801
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,670
I was the one sitting there the whole time.

802
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,690
Is this seat taken?

803
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,830
I told you.

804
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,480
Remove your jewelry.

805
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:25,690
I'm not wearing any.

806
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,180
I'll put it away.

807
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,520
[Preview of the next episode]

808
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,930
There's something that others have, but you don't.

809
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,410
Jealousy.

810
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,310
I was the one sitting there the whole time.

811
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:06,510
Where did you get it?

812
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,260
Something must have happened

813
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:09,830
to the child.

814
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,700
I didn't kill Xie He'an.

815
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,530
Look a little closer.

816
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,130
What does the doll look like?
