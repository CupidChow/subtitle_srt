[Episode 5]

4
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,100
Drive.

5
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,620
Turn right in any alley ahead.

6
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,660
145 yuan.

7
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,170
Please take a look, do you know this person?

8
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,020
Take a look.

9
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:58,900
145 yuan.

10
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,320
You used to work in Del, right?

11
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,630
He may have worked in your company in 2000.

12
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,100
Did Del ask you to come here to talk or to conciliate?

13
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,860
I have nothing to do with Del.

14
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,370
Get off!

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,280
I just want to ask if you know him.

16
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:14,980
No, I don't.

17
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,360
Go back and tell them

18
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,250
I won't drop the charges.

19
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,740
If you don't give me 145 yuan,

20
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,500
I'll sue you too.

21
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,160
Driver!

22
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,770
Get off.

23
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm going to call the police.

24
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,600
I'll call the police for you later.

25
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,600
Take a look at this person.

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,750
He became a homeless

27
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,320
and died in a staircase somewhere.

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,730
He's still a nameless corpse

29
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,780
lying in the school.

30
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,500
Sir.

31
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,090
Yes, I am.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,829
Yes, I know him.

33
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,550
People can't do bad things.

34
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,390
I just asked you to help me a few times.

35
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,710
This is repayment.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,650
Repayment.

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,160
It's not too late to send it back now, right?

38
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,230
Senior.

39
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,630
You've done the home visit before the body donor was used, right?

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,930
Of course.

41
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,740
Right?

42
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,670
For seniors,

43
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,160
after home visits,

44
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,530
they are not just body donors

45
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,640
we met in class.

46
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,760
They are also

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,540
someone's brother, sister, dad, mom or child.

48
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,750
But there is a rumor that

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,680
this body donor is just a gangster.

50
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,230
Wow.

51
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,510
A miracle that it can be used for seven years.

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,010
I thought name was just a code.

53
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,940
But I didn't expect

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,820
after he lost his name,

55
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,380
he even lost

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,370
the life he lived.

57
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,280
Before he disappears completely,

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,790
we have to give him back his name.

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,240
Think of it as a home visit seven years late.

60
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,640
Guang.

61
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,690
You've changed.

62
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,260
You've become more sincere.

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,440
I'll be killed by your sincerity.

64
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,420
Let's go.

65
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,640
You used the elevator as a room, do you have any civic virtue?

66
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,440
I heard everything you said

67
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,360
in the elevator.

68
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,140
I know why we need to get his name back.

69
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,960
But why do I have to do it?

70
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,760
Oh, right.

71
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,990
Why?

72
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,159
Because I'm...

73
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,950
Senior, I... -Shut up. Stop talking.

74
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,550
I don't want to know.

75
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,020
I'm Chen Chuying from Shangcheng Police Station.

76
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,590
Are you okay?

77
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,610
The other one is not okay.

78
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,260
Let me warn you.

79
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,730
Don't think you can turn a major accident as a minor one.

80
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,610
Why settle?

81
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,850
It's fraud that he took the taxi without paying.

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,150
It's robbery that he snatched my bat.

83
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,770
I must sue that man.

84
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,950
You have to pay for every stitch.

85
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,760
I'm so unlucky.

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,760
Excuse me.

87
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,130
Thank you, young man.

88
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,600
Here are your chopsticks. Enjoy.

89
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,960
The dishes are good today.

90
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,260
Sister, you've had a long day.

91
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,870
Have you eaten?

92
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,700
Thank you.

93
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,440
Be careful with fish bones.

94
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,140
Thank you.

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,450
Will the company add more?

96
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,240
Yes.

97
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,060
Miao. Do you want to go with me?

98
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,500
Yes.

99
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,150
Let's go.

100
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:39,940
What do you want to eat?

101
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,720
Hot-fried dishes.

102
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,460
I want to go too.

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,460
Me too.

104
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,420
Yonghua is going too?

105
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,630
Chief, do you want to join us?

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,700
Dinner?

107
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,010
Sure, let's go together.

108
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:49,950
Let's have a drink.

109
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,550
Really?

110
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,800
Let me propose a toast.

111
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,440
Guo, finish it.

112
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,230
Drink up.

113
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,820
Guo, drink up.

114
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,670
Stop shouting!

115
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,370
Cheers.

116
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,080
Really?

117
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,800
Come again.

118
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,620
Don't you think he's weird?

119
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,480
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,250
No.

121
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,680
He never talks to anyone

122
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,960
in the office.

123
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,020
Every time we had dinner together, he insisted on coming.

124
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,020
When he's here, he just sits there, doesn't talk,

125
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,590
and makes everyone uncomfortable.

126
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,890
Once, when I went back to the company after seeing a client,

127
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,140
everyone left.

128
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,420
He's the only one there.

129
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,800
I saw that he was already packing.

130
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,120
But when he saw me coming in,

131
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,170
he stayed in his seat

132
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,840
doing nothing.

133
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,440
He won't get a raise even if he leaves last.

134
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,730
He didn't disturb anyone.

135
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,650
He didn't bring any trouble at work.

136
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,340
You're exaggerating.

137
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,330
Liver detoxification.

138
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,030
Do you know what a bitter face is?

139
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,340
Your face.

140
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,920
You're so mean, Chief.

141
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,810
You're an uncontaminated member of our team.

142
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,260
You are.

143
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,650
No.

144
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,130
I was also surprised

145
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,110
to see him with a bunch of homeless people.

146
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,230
But he didn't disturb anyone.

147
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,420
Homeless people?

148
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,080
Don't tell them,

149
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,510
in case they think too much.

150
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,390
Why are you still here?

151
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,360
If I leave you here, I would feel sorry for you.

152
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,930
He became a homeless

153
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,410
and died in a staircase somewhere.

154
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,270
He's still

155
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,910
a nameless corpse lying in the school.

156
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,720
I'll get you some chopsticks and eat slowly, okay?

157
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,780
Yes. Thank you.

158
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,730
[Shangcheng Branch of Taipei City Police Station]

159
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,840
It's okay.

160
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,440
I'm still pretty,

161
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,450
much prettier than you.

162
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,990
I'm going to jail anyway.

163
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,600
I will definitely be sued.

164
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,840
Since I have to go to jail,

165
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,340
I'll go find Xu and beat him

166
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,210
until he tells me.

167
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,160
Take this.

168
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,520
I'll give you the name later.

169
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,760
When did you...

170
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,720
You stole it?

171
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,680
This is the draft he drew.

172
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,970
Can he do this?

173
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,900
No.

174
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,660
Now we have recovered the stolen goods from you,

175
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,580
I'll arrest you according to the law.

176
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,530
You can remain silent.

177
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,770
Now that you've seen it.

178
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,280
Give it back.

179
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,140
I could have looked like this?

180
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,670
One-per.

181
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,210
What big case?

182
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,350
Director.

183
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,000
The three citizens are lost.

184
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,030
I'm drawing a map for them.

185
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,240
Three?

186
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,950
Your citizen friends have bad senses of direction.

187
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,670
Your own calculations and vision...

188
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,550
Shangcheng Police Station.

189
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes, I am.

190
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,050
The other party said he won't sue you anymore.

191
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,790
He asked us to give this to you.

192
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,150
Just one sentence.

193
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,090
I didn't expect

194
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,390
a casual sentence

195
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,590
can change someone's life.

196
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,730
A homeless man?

197
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,450
Everyone is saying that.

198
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,480
You're the only one who doesn't know.

199
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
Even if he's with a homeless man,

200
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
the company didn't say no, right?

201
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,310
No.

202
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,250
But I've read his profile, and he's not that good.

203
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,160
Isn't it enough to ask him

204
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,570
to leave with this reason?

205
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,550
Is he indispensable in your team?

206
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,170
No one responded.

207
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,050
I thought he was in his early 20s.

208
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,750
He should be able to find a new job.

209
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,480
I used to be his boss.

210
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,950
He lost his job because of me.

211
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,180
So I went to his house.

212
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,380
I ran into his neighbor that day finding people

213
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
to forcibly remove all the stuff in front of his house.

214
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,120
I found out from the neighbour that he wanted to be a teacher.

215
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,200
[Taipei Normal University Admission Certificate]

216
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,880
I passed!

217
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,130
Great!

218
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,890
Stop it.

219
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,910
Stop! -That's enough, mom.

220
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,570
But his mother passed away when he got into the normal university.

221
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,780
And his father died suddenly three years later.

222
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,400
So he didn't go to university.

223
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,670
Mom likes blue.

224
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,330
But the clerk said the one with small flowers is pretty too.

225
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:50,900
So I bought both.

226
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,770
The neighbour told me

227
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,670
he lived alone,

228
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,620
but sometimes he heard him

229
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,900
talking to someone.

230
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,630
I saw our female colleagues tie this.

231
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,770
Everyone said she's very good at dressing up.

232
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,800
So I bought three.

233
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,450
Is that female colleague

234
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,860
prettier than me?

235
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:19,870
So sweet.

236
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,250
Mom and dad will like it.

237
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,800
I really have no choice.

238
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,180
Isn't dessert supposed to be sweet?

239
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
What kind of dessert is it if it's not sweet?

240
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,520
They will argue with me with that.

241
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,810
But I have no choice.

242
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,380
I'm on their side this time.

243
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,460
Isn't it comfortable?

244
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,050
My dad wanted a new one long time ago.

245
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,510
But he didn't want my mom to say he was wasting money.

246
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,280
We wanted to

247
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,310
switching the old quilt.

248
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,460
But we still didn't have the guts.

249
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,910
I always thought

250
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,620
if we really did that,

251
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,860
would she find out.

252
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,430
I should've tried.

253
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,630
It's fun just thinking about it. -It's fun just thinking about it.

254
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,200
I just got scolded by the neighbors.

255
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,690
I bought these things again.

256
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,940
I forgot they were dead again.

257
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,000
I ran away before I saw him.

258
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,120
I was scared.

259
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,810
It has been more than 20 years.

260
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,550
If it weren't for you, I would have forgotten this person.

261
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,780
That job

262
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,110
may have been the last chance

263
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,910
for him to stay in the crowd.

264
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,010
But

265
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,080
because of what I said.

266
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,260
You hit me.

267
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,190
Just treat it as my apology to him.

268
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,620
I know it's far from enough, but...

269
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,190
Ouch!

270
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,370
Mom.

271
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,400
I've always wanted to see his face.

272
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,370
So,

273
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,440
you can't see him.

274
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,090
He's pretty.

275
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,540
We look good together.

276
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,100
Thank you.

277
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,260
Thank you.

278
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,790
Pu Yiyong.

279
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,940
[If the living don't forget, then the dead will still be here. ]

280
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,270
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,300
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,470
It's been seven years.

283
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,810
You still look the same.

284
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,050
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,790
It's been 22 years.

286
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,970
Mr. Yan Genshu.

287
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,790
Mr. Bai Huilang.

288
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,760
Mr. Zhu Xinming.

289
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,990
Ms. Sun Zhang Chunlan.

290
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,320
Mr. Zeng Shaonan.

291
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,880
Mr. Lin Yongchuan.

292
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,690
Family members, please stand up.

293
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,720
Thank you

294
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,820
for your teaching.

295
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,090
Salute.

296
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,660
He finally became a teacher.

297
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,430
Uncle.

298
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,960
After you left that day,

299
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,800
I also left.

300
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,750
I found my old friend

301
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,970
and told them about him.

302
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,250
I told you.

303
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,140
What do people like us

304
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,430
need names for?

305
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,200
I was wrong.

306
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,850
People like us who have nothing

307
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,820
should at least leave a name.

308
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,440
Yao Gongliang.

309
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,080
My name.

310
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,390
Which Gong?

311
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,250
I'm not smart.

312
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,220
I can't remember it forever.

313
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,130
Uncle, what about your name?

314
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,270
I'll do it.

315
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,980
You always go first.

316
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,290
What kind of occasion is this?

317
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,060
No.

318
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,420
I want to draw you down.

319
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:41,800
Otherwise,

320
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,710
I'll forget who is who. -Get in line.

321
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,240
Take your time.

322
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,890
Okay, line up.

323
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,270
Line up.

324
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,700
Why can't I sit in the front?

325
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,870
You may sit in this car often in the future,

326
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,930
so I'm letting you get used to it.

327
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,150
Why do you say inauspicious things?

328
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,230
You stole and hit people.

329
00:23:59,250 --> 00:23:59,940
You wanted to commit robbery.

330
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,680
I didn't.

331
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,390
I'm a police officer.

332
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,240
There might be some investigation secrets inside.

333
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,950
Not only did you rob, you tore it randomly.

334
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,020
The witness

335
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,270
is right next to you.

336
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,010
How dare you deny it?

337
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,130
He just issue tickets.

338
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,790
What secret is so great?

339
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,640
He's painting you, don't move your head.

340
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,730
You're artistic.

341
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,790
Have you considered setting up a stall?

342
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,360
What?

343
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,210
I'm afraid there will be

344
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,890
people with tattoos or in ancient costumes

345
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,540
came to ask me for names.

346
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,540
I didn't say anything.

347
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,590
Why are you getting chills?

348
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,600
I'm testifying against the suspect.

349
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,660
What are you doing?

350
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,930
Both of you, get off!

351
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,460
I still don't understand

352
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,810
why Mr. Lin Yongchuan would

353
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,830
hang out with the neighbor uncles?

354
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,560
He has a home.

355
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,210
Mr. Li has said the answer.

356
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,380
A citizen called the police every other day.

357
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,620
Once she called,

358
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,100
we had to go to her house to confirm.

359
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,350
After confirming that she's okay, we were about to leave.

360
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,150
Then she would offer food and drinks

361
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,570
to make us stay.

362
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,180
There's another citizen.

363
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,910
He almost went to the station every night.

364
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,770
He kept rambling and didn't want to leave.

365
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,460
It didn't matter if we ignored him.

366
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,410
He just sat there quietly.

367
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,270
Every police station I was in,

368
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,400
there was people like this.

369
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,590
And they all have a home.

370
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:06,610
Why?

371
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,100
They didn't want to be alone.

372
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,210
I suspect hoarders are the same.

373
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,130
If the house is stuffed,

374
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,450
it won't be so empty.

375
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,380
So if you stab someone in the back,

376
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,510
you won't be alone anymore.

377
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,390
Someone is coming.

378
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,830
He's different.

379

You can help me. Why don't you help me?

[Stay safe]

381
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,210
Help me.

382
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,710
Help me.

383
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,030
That's how your grandpa is.

384
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,960
Because of this,

385
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,380
I knew I had to find you.

386
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,660
The first thing he said to me

387
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,870
gave me life.

388
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,160

390
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,210
About two years later,

391
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,920
I saw this power again.

392
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,230
Who gave it to you?

393
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,330
I don't know.

394
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,150
I just felt that he was very old.

395
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,890
He made me feel a little scared.

396
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,430
Why didn't you get me a taxi?

397
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,330
Are you still talking about this?

398
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,650
I have something to ask you.

399
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,350
Ask me if you have the strength.

400
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,730
Why can see those things?

401
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,950
Why can you show us

402
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,200
after drawing?

403
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,360
Why do the words you write

404

have such power?

405
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,540
It's hereditary.

The Great Demon is reincarnated every other generation.

You're really an idiot.

Can you make it easier for me?

426
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,670
I've wanted to talk to you about this for a long time.

427
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,700
You wore ancient clothes,

428
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,440
so you can speak and act so slowly?

429
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:18,660
Continue.

The embodied lives that are reflected

431
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,550
are like the dolls you played with as a child.

432
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,130
I've never played with dolls.

433
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,450
It's like you have someone you miss very much.

434

You will also have missing feelings

439
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:46,700
Maybe.

440
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,710
But you...

441
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,970
It's a bit strange for me to ask,

442
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,130
but aren't you afraid?

443
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,720
It's such a hassle

444
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,290
to have such a power.

445
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,080
But when I see things like you,

446
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,840

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,490
one day,

448
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,400
maybe I can see the person I want to see.

449

For some things,

450
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,130
it's better not to know too much.

451
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,590
Do you want to know

452
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,520
what Santa Claus is?

453
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,550
I already know what Santa Claus is.

454

You're more suitable.

I'm not qualified.

465

Why?

00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,950
I'm nothing.

467

He has been a teacher

474
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,870
in our college for seven years.

475
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,050
So don't worry.

476
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,500
It's because you're petty.

477
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,990
What time will it be when we're there?

478
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,830
There must be no car when we get down.

479
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,090
Now we're in a car.

480
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,670
I called this car.

481
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,960
Shut up!

482
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,110
When you said you wanted to go,

483
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,970
I knew

484
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,040
it would be such a mess.

485
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,710
I can investigate.

486
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,430
But you have to tell me

487
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,050
what you're going to do.

488
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,680
He's already a teacher.

489
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,770
Who knows if he'll meet his parents?

490
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,690
I want to tell them for him.

491
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:14,700
Sure.

492
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,640
There's one more thing I want you to find for me.

493
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,200
Did you find it?

494
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,890
The thing I asked you for.

495
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,100
Not yet.

496
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,770
Chuying, take me home.

497
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,550
There is still some distance from home.

498
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,960
Do you really think I'm a taxi driver?

499
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,160
The hospital is just behind us. Walk yourself.

500
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,860
You can't stop here.

501
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,400

502
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,130

503
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,969

504
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,080
Come out!

505
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,020
What are you busy with?

506
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,060
I may know.

507
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,840
What do you know?

508
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,130
I'm not sure.

509
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,640
Guangyan told me.

510
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,140
That traitor.

511
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,840
What traitor?

512
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,680
He seems to be afraid that I would misunderstand.

513
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,720
He said it when I forced him to answer.

514
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,130
His speech was very organized.

515
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,210
But the content was in an awful mess.

516
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,710
I didn't understand most of it.

517
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:52,990
Forget it.

518
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,690
Anyway, I know you're not doing anything bad.

519
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:57,730
Mom.

520
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,490
Do you believe him?

521
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,130
Of course I do.

522
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,000
He's not you.

523
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,720
No.

524
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,240
Most people wouldn't

525
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,900
believe what I met.

526
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,610
Why do you need most people to believe it?

527
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,410
You know

528
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,620
I was also a student in grandpa's calligraphy classroom, right?

529
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,460
I think I know.

530
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:16,830
But

531
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,100
I didn't believe it.

532
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,820
Come in.

533
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,980
No.

534
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,150
You should learn.

535
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,020
Hey.

536
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,970
You hit people at school.

537
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,310
You need to behave properly to cultivate yourself

538
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,180
and change your temper.

539
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,910
Why do I have to learn?

540
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:31,850
Yes.

541
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,270
Learning calligraphy can help you behave properly to cultivate yourself.

542
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,980
Then you'll be calm after you learn it.

543
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,020
If the school asks you to go,

544
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,270
you wouldn't be so angry.

545
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,770
Shouldn't you learn?

546
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,770

547
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,170

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,450

549
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,440
It's her. -It's her.

Hang in there.

556

557
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,330
Did I win?

558
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:27,290
No.

559
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,200
But just one.

560
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,210
Here.

561
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,450
Take a look at what I wrote. Was I any good?

Keep it then.

00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,570
Okay.

00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,790
Do you know what I wanted to say?

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,610

568
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,060
Why did you hit me?

569
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,670

00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,260
But I met mine.

572
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,670
Who cares if others believe it or not?

573
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,290
I see.

574
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,540
But don't give me such a disgusting example.

575
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,660
Disgusting?

576
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,470
Every thing exists in this world

577

00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,550
How could I say something so good?

581
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,860
I'll write down what I just said.

Do you have a pen?

583
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,320
You should go home.

584
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,180
I dreamed of you.

585
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,410
You're just like me, right?

586
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:53,900
No.

587
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,510
It should be I'm just like you.

Cao Guangyan asked me.

593
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,750
Guangyan is a nerd living next door.

594
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,390
He asked me what those things were.

595
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,970
But I don't understand either.

596
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:24,990
Anyway,

598
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,690
You have to take responsibility for this too.

599
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,170
Someone has to teach me.

600
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,720
Can I get through?

601
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,760
Yes.

602
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,430
It's already dry.

00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,030
Are you okay?

604
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,590
It's strange.

606
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,800

Okay.

608
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,820
Will it be cheaper this time?

609
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,180

Why did your noodle shop close so fast?

613
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,450
Because I know nothing.

614
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,710
How can an adult say that about himself?

615
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,250
Did Guangyan tell you

616
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,300
what I used to do?

617

No.

618
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,300
I was a proofreader in a publishing house.

619
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,100
It must be boring

621
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,620
It's not boring.

622
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,690
I liked it.

623
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,400
Otherwise, how could I do it for my whole life?

624
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,840
I only did this for my whole life.

625
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,420
So I can't do anything else.

626
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:52,300
What about you?

627
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,450
Have you ever wanted to do anything?

628
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,080
I did.

629
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,780
What do you mean?

630
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,200
Because I didn't think I should.

631
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,080
Should you...

632
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,270
Should you send the manuscript to print after proofreading?

633
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,410
Not so soon.

634
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,610
We have to go through art design

635
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,780
and the layout.

636
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,080
The last step is printing.

637
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,550
My dad used to be an art designer

638
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,720
in the printing factory.

639
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,140
Later, he became a business manager.

640
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,150
But he often went to the front line to check colors.

641
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,650

It's possible.

644

Because I did it for 30 years.

645
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,600
It's definitely possible.
