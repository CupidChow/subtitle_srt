[Oh No! Here Comes Trouble]

3
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,430
[Episode 9]

4
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,420
Come on, report.

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,480
Guangyan, have you succeeded in hitting on Lin Xin?

6
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,100
Actually, she hit on me first.

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,290
[Hello]

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,850
I guess I was right to send the best-looking guy.

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,110
No, it's not like that.

10
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,320
-It's because I'm a medical student. -All right.

11
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,790
I know you're good-looking and talented, so stop showing off.

12
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,680
Did you get anything?

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,700
[Are you a medical student?]

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,500
[Can I ask you a question?]

15
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,480
I didn't want to ask too many questions at our first meeting.

16
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,120
I'll see her tomorrow.

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,100
That's good.

18
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,250
And you?

19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,890
Have you had dinner?

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,100
Yes, thanks.

21
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,039
I have too.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,020
Who cares?

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,420
I haven't yet.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,160
I've been sitting over there all day.

25
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,100
The clerk kept looking at me.

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,560
I had to keep refilling the cheapest coffee.

27
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,330
Now that I've spent all my money,

28
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,420
I haven't had a single grain of rice.

29
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,250
I thought you said you'd buy steak or beef noodles.

30
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,710
What's the situation?

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,200
I've been watching it all day.

32
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,450
The oldest woman must be Lin Jingmei, right?

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,740
So you stayed there all day

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,110
just to tell if the woman was Lin Jingmei?

35
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,690
Don't you have a photo?

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,890
It was shot seven years ago.

37
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,610
Who knows

38
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,160
if she's gotten fatter, thinner, older, or younger.

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,120
No.

40
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,810
Nothing strange

41
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,979
leaned over

42
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,410
and told you the secret of Lin Jingmei?

43
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,240
He didn't bring a brush.

44
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,050
You should bring your four treasures of the study

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,320
here for another day.

46
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,500
You can drink coffee while you write.

47
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,460
Remember to

48
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,620
attract something strange.

49
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,820
Right.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,230
Maybe those teapots, cups, and creamer balls

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,600
will tell me Lin Jingmei's secret.

52
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,770
What do you take me for?

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,410
It's hard to say.

54
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,900
The sidewalk came to see you.

55
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,340
There is something weird.

56
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,810
The coffee shop.

57
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,010
Where?

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,940
It's the coffee shop.

59
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,780
The shop itself?

60
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,670
What's weird about it?

61
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,329
I've been sitting there all day.

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,340
The longer I sat there, the more I felt something strange.

63
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,030
Chuying.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,910
I think you said something similar yesterday.

65
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,490
It's when Zhao Baisi and Xie Hui

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,570
were talking,

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,800
I felt that there was something wrong.

68
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,920
Something wrong?

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,470
But they said the truth and didn't lie.

70
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,010
So...

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,480
Is there any news about He'an?

72
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,370
We're just re-reading the information

73
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,780
for a potential new clue.

74
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,010
Your colleague called you a few times.

75
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,770
You didn't hear them.

76
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,540
But

77
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,740
what does “one-per” mean?

78
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,240
Nothing. Stop asking around.

79
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,740
I shouldn't have come here by myself,

80
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,110
right?

81
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,720
The director warned me

82
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,570
that I couldn't have outsiders in the office anymore.

83
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,470
Unless you're a suspect.

84
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,600
What can I do for you?

85
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:15,760
This is for you.

86
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,060
Again?

87
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,570
No.

88
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,100
I didn't mean it was too sweet.

89
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,760
It's because a friend of mine who studied medicine said

90
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,280
too much sugar

91
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,520
can damage the brain and weaken cognitive ability.

92
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,900
So...

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,600
I'm sorry

94
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,250
for causing damage to your brain.

95
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,690
It's strange how someone can write calligraphy here.

96
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,180
If it doesn't work, you're going down.

97
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,240
What should I write?

98
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,470
No matter how hard I try to focus on their conversation,

99
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,720
I still can't figure it out.

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,480
So I need brain power now.

101
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,630
I don't want to eat anything sweet for now.

102
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,710
For now.

103
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:04,870
That's it.

104
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,930
Can I listen to it?

105
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,740
The recording.

106
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,790
No, you can't.

107
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,530
I was wrong again.

109
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,570
Wrong about what?

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
You're an outsider and you don't know the rules of the police.

111
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,230
An outsider?

112
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,430
Okay, listen to it.

113
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,670
No.

114
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,660
I just mentioned it without thinking.

115
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,560
Don't be so nosy.

116
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,320
You don't know anyone in the recording.

117
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,320
It's better to judge by feeling.

118
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,890
I'm just an ordinary person,

119
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,960
not as good as the police.

120
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,570
I know.

121
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,070
But there is something

122
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,830
I'm not sure whether I should call it strange or not.

123
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,570
Tell me about it.

124
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,020
But I'm just an ordinary…

125
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,470
Ordinary people. I know.

126
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:58,980
Say it.

127
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,650
Mr. Zhao

128
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,090
reminds me of my elementary school tutor.

129
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,500
That tutor was usually very indifferent to me.

130
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,980
But whenever my parents came to school,

131
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,920
she would keep calling my name

132
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,100
in front of them,

133
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,020
as if the more times she called my name,

134
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,730
the more she cared for me.

135
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,750
And?

136
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,520
If it were me,

137
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,260
I wouldn't

138
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,910
keep mentioning the kid's name.

139
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,520
Why?

140
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,150
Since it's related to the police,

141
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,950
something must have happened

142
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,760
to the kid.

143
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,409
My brother died when I was a teenager.

144
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,510
Not to mention me,

145
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,210
even my parents tried not to

146
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,740
mention his name in front of each other,

147
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,800
even when discussing him.

148
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,730
But as for Mr. Zhao,

149
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,250
the child's father was right next to him but he kept…

150
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,560
But maybe my family is strange.

151
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,450
Or maybe

152
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,180
Mr. Zhao

153
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,360
values personal feelings

154
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,100
and is very emotional.

155
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,340
If that's the case,

156
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,850
Mr. and Mrs. Xie Hui were his and his wife's introducers.

157
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,010
He would have mentioned this.

158
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,590
But he only mentioned

159
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,650
Xie Hui's help at work.

160
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,030
Thank you for that.

161
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,659
I'll have to…

162
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,090
Wait a minute.

163
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,140
So this…

164
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,040
I'll take it to

165
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,909
a friend who has a bad brain.

166
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,290
Thank you.

167
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:46,990
Okay.

168
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,210
I don't know.

169
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,080
Just put your heart into it.

170
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,050
Write a few words.

171
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,210
Senior, yes, please take a look.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,400
-So Cao… -I can't talk on the phone right now.

173
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,250
Anyway, if you put your mind to it, you'll have power.

174
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,480
You can write whatever you like.

175
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,680
I just have to put my heart into it, right?

176
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,230
[Chen Chuying, Cao Guangyan, go eat shit]

177
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,010
Are you human?

178
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,520
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,980
I've told you many times before.

180
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,270
We're closing now.

181
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,410
This better works.

182
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,670
They just keep asking me to write.

183
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,140
Well.

184
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,910
Can you turn off the lights again?

185
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,210
We're closed.

186
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,310
Please check your things.

187
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,360
Don't forget to take it with you.

188
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,970
I love you so much.

189
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,470
Come out.

190
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,190
Come on out.

191
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,180
He's cursing again.

192
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,400
No way.

193
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,730
What?

194
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,640
It's not going to kill you.

195
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,630
Do you want to scare the woman to death?

196
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,010
Ms. He?

197
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,310
I don't care about her.

198
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,820
I'm afraid she'll think

199
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,480
someone's trying to steal her baby doll

200
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,400
and she'll hug me and cry again.

201
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,720
It's so annoying.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,640
I didn't ask you.

203
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,020
Come with me to a place.

204
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,120
Where to?

205
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,450
You believe

206
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,010
what I just said, right?

207
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,710
It's true. I don't care about the woman.

208
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,580
So you had four interviews in the first place?

209
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,430
Your grades don't sound like a problem.

210
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,530
Don't be so anxious.

211
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,250
I have no problem with

212
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,650
the written test and the run-through you just mentioned.

213
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,230
But my PBL sucks.

214
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,970
Just remember that during the group discussion,

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,350
don't just say whatever comes to mind.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,270
Wait a few seconds to organize the argument before speaking.

217
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,610
It's better to somehow manage to be

218
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,060
the leader of the group.

219
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,620
It's hard.

220
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,020
Why do you want to go to medical school?

221
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,940
Are any of your parents doctors?

222
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,970
Anyway, the bottom line of the test is

223
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,370
not to keep silent,

224
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,230
or try to steal the show.

225
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,560
You'll give the professor a bad impression.

226
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,650
Because it's the best way to show off.

227
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,200
I thought you just taught me

228
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,710
to wait a few seconds to think about my answer.

229
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,170
You really thought about your answer?

230
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,700
It's my mom.

231
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,970
Your mom?

232
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,520
Actually,

233
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,300
it doesn't matter where I get into.

234
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,190
I just think

235
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,840
as long as I get into medical school,

236
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,930
my mom

237
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,400
won't compare me with others anymore.

238
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,820
That's why I'm saying this.

239
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,510
Don't say that to the professor

240
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,060
in the interview.

241
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,550
Why would the cop and the medical student

242
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,230
hang out with people like you?

243
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,540
What's wrong with me?

244
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:13,970
Are you watching?

245
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,110
Remind me if someone's passing by.

246
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,240
Is it like what I said?

247
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,650
So disgusting.

248
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,910
The apron is the same,

249
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,510
only in a different color.

250
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,610
This is exactly the same as Ms. He's shop.

251
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,580
Pervert.

252
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,260
Could that woman's kid be here too?

253
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,760
What do you mean? Whose kid?

254
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,560
Can't you see it here?

255
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,640
Why can I see it?

256
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,340
Let's go to the police first.

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,760
You have a single parent?

258
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,460
I live with my dad.

259
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,580
Me too.

260
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,620
But my mom married my stepfather a long time ago.

261
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,290
So my family doesn't feel like a single-parent one.

262
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,280
What kind of person is your stepfather?

263
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,310
He's very nice.

264
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,630
A poor guy.

265
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,550
A poor guy?

266
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,040
It's the same for him.

267
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,260
My mother compares everything with others.

268
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,770
What do you mean?

269
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,550
-It's just… -Hello, readers.

270
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,860
The library is open until 10:00 today.

271
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,550
It's so late.

272
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,460
Please don't forget your belongings when you leave.

273
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,170
They're closing.

274
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,340
Where did you get that?

275
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,340
Why won't he read or reply to my message?

276
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,760
You can't get away with this.

277
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,540
I've called the police.

278
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,500
Here comes the police. Tell them.

279
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,230
I was talking about Chen Chuying.

280
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,910
Ms, did you call the police?

281
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,680
Yes.

282
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,760
I am the owner of the house.

283
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,700
This man broke the lock of my door.

284
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,450
He's a thief.

285
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,150
No, I'm not.

286
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,340
I didn't steal anything.

287
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,290
Take him to the police station first.

288
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,560
Please cooperate with us.

289
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,910
700, 700.

290
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,920
705 calling.

291
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,020
700 responding.

292
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,770
705 has arrived at the scene

293
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,570
and is in the process of understanding the situation.

294
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,540
700. Roger that.

295
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,420
Are you Ms. Lin Jingmei?

296
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,180
Yes, I am.

297
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,120
Can you come with us to the police station?

298
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,850
I'm the one who reported the case.

299
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,960
It's about a different case.

300
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,230
We have a few questions to confirm with you.

301
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,970
Would you be too preconceived?

302
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,470
He kept mentioning Xie He'an

303
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,530
and thanking Xie Hui for his help in the workplace.

304
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,850
He was so angry even about

305
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,760
the doll He Shoutang put in the window.

306
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
He's so emotional.

307
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,040
He talked about everything else but that person.

308
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,960
The moment Xie Hui mentioned her,

309
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,760
the topic was led somewhere else.

310
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,150
Now I think

311
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
that makes sense.

312
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,730
Was he trying to conceal it?

313
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,480
If you won't do it now,

314
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,109
we'll come back tomorrow

315
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,440
and can take you there.

316
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,470
Or

317
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,980
we can also come to your store during the day tomorrow.

318
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,710
You're done with the art store for 2015.

319
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,200
Why did you have so much money coming in 2016?

320
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,330
At that time, I was ready to open a store.

321
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,840
My husband and my mother both

322
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,780
invested in it.

323
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,000
Cash?

324
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,100
I guess so.

325
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,400
They don't have so much money now,

326
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,760
not to mention at that time.

327
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:57,970
What do you mean?

328
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,130
Your mother said so.

329
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,430
I don't think your mother would provide you with capital

330
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,510
from the way she acted.

331
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,370
Besides, your husband's previous job as a salesman

332
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,600
wasn't successful.

333
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,560
He had no savings.

334
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,680
He couldn't just

335
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,350
provide 300,000 to 400,000 yuan,

336
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,110
and not by remittance.

337
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,300
It was cash.

338
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,760
Do you want to think again

339
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,620
where the deposits made one after another,

340
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,180
adding up to almost three million yuan,

341
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,990
come from?

342
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,480
Excuse me.

343
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,440
Is it a crime to not remember what happened six years ago?

344
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,760
I'm already very cooperative

345
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,830
in answering these questions.

346
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,320
Besides, I'm the one who suffered from shoplifting.

347
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,100
Instead of asking the thief,

348
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,050
you're here asking me about something that happened long ago.

349
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,380
Ms. Lin, I'm sorry.

350
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,100
What happened to your store is already being handled.

351
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,000
But there are still a few things

352
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,820
we want you to clarify.

353
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,830
So

354
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,390
I hope you'll understand.

355
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,410
So now...

356
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,550
Yes.

357
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,700
I think his mental condition…

358
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,240
He talks to the air

359
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,130
No.

360
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,830
No stolen property on him.

361
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,040
There is no property missing from the shop.

362
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,490
Yes.

363
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,620
I'm sure.

364
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,240
It's…

365
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,640
Good.

366
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,520
Thank you, prosecutor.

367
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,670
You can go now.

368
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,330
Why?

369
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,830
Why what?

370
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,150
You like talking to the prosecutor, don't you?

371
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,490
No.

372
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,570
That's all?

373
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,740
You broke into a store. It's trespassing.

374
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,780
No trial without complaint.

375
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,590
I don't understand.

376
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,770
That is, if the other party files a lawsuit,

377
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,080
you'll still have to appear in court to go through the judicial process.

378
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,590
You can't just leave today and be fine.

379
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,510
Then I'll be fine this way?

380
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,540
Is this the same as yours?

381
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,900
Why don't you answer the phone?

382
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,020
And your mother still thinks you're at my house

383
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,240
Forget about it.

384
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,170
What's this hairpin?

385
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,480
It's a good thing she still has something from elementary school.

386
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,990
Hello, readers.

387
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,430
It's so late.

388
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,000
They're closing up.

389
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,480
Where did you get that?

390
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,030
Was it a hairpin?

391
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,730
How do you know?

392
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,920
A friend of mine from elementary school

393
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,680
wore it every day.

394
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,510
How did you know it was a hairpin?

395
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,090
My friend has a similar one.

396
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,550
Is your friend's name Xie He'an?

397
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,910
No.

398
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,500
No.

399
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,910
Anyway, I thought this was pretty when I was a kid.

400
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,480
Since it's a pair,

401
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,860
I asked her for one.

402
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,130
But she said

403
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,350
her mother made her this.

404
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,140
She couldn't give it to me.

405
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,660
Then why do you have it?

406
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,030
Actually, I forgot about this.

407
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,090
But I can vaguely recall it.

408
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,570
I think I found it at our house.

409
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,230
She didn't come to our house.

410
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,650
What happened to your friend?

411
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,890
My mom said she changed schools.

412
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,920
What's your friend's last name?

413
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,620
Maybe she changed her name.

414
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,610
Didn't your mother say anything when she saw you wearing this?

415
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,100
I didn't wear it.

416
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,490
How could I let her see this?

417
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,590
She forbids me to ask people for things.

418
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,750
And I've always liked the decoration,

419
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,810
not the hairpin.

420
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,410
Isn't there a class in home economics called

421
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,760
“Reusing Costume Resources”?

422
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,630
I did it in that class.

423
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,590
This is evidence, right?

424
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:06,950
Yeah.

425
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,460
Can we use this to arrest her?

426
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,490
If I could, I would have shown her

427
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,640
the picture of the hairpin.

428
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,010
I was afraid she would grab it when she came back.

429
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,850
Anyway, we're continuing to investigate

430
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,510
her unidentified assets.

431
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:20,940
I think

432
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,770
it's right.

433
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,000
Where's Lin Jingmei?

434
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,500
She was just released.

435
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,630
What do you want?

436
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,330
Why did you throw it away?

437
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,690
Her mother can't even see

438
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,810
what her child looks like when she grows up.

439
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,320
It's you again.

440
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,460
Since you can't steal it, do you want to rob it now?

441
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,330
Auntie Mei.

442
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,660
What can she do to her?

443
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,820
I am Lin Jingmei.

444
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,170
Mr. Xie Hui said

445
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,730
he'd go to identify and confirm

446
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,660
the body first.

447
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,480
You just have to decide whether you want a biological identification.

448
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:15,920
Be careful.

449
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,110
I think we…

450
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:48,990
Mr. Xie.

451
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,700
Ms. He, be careful.

452
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Xie He'an.

453
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,580
We're going home.

454
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,710
Do you know what this is?

455
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,820
Yes, I do now.

456
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,260
It's your daughter Lin Xin's.

457
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,290
Of course, the original owner was her friend

458
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,270
Xie He'an.

459
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,720
I forbade her to

460
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,720
ask He'an for it.

461
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:55,670
Why not?

462
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,330
Isn't it shameful to ask for something?

463
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,500
Kids ask each other for things they like.

464
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,750
There's no shame in that.

465
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,500
It's shameful for adults to get what they want

466
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,700
with terrible tricks.

467
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,620
Your daughter didn't ask for this.

468
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,800
She found it at home.

469
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,110
I didn't kill Xie He'an.

470
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,810
Xin.

471
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,210
I took the afternoon off and I'll be back around 3:00.

472
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,730
I've already told Ms. He.

473
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:51,930
Okay.

474
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,900
What the heck?

475
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,650
It's really beautiful in blue.

476
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,310
What about the roof?

477
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,220
You're stealing?

478
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,310
Auntie Mei.

479
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,770
These are all things from the store, aren't they?

480
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,870
It's okay.

481
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,230
Who were you talking to?

482
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,360
Is Lin Xin here too?

483
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,780
No, she doesn't know this place.

484
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,790
How long are you going to play?

485
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,570
It's dangerous to be here alone,

486
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,910
you know?

487
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,820
I want to take this back after I finish it.

488
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,680
It's old and dirty.

489
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,420
Your mother won't allow it.

490
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,190
Your mother

491
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,170
will make you an expensive and beautiful dollhouse

492
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,980
with many

493
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,390
miniature porcelain furniture inside.

494
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,780
Yes.

495
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,530
She already made it for me.

496
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,000
Did Lin Xin ask you

497
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,670
for a hairpin before?

498
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,860
I asked my mom.

499
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,760
But she didn't want me to give it to others.

500
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,010
Okay.

501
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,350
Auntie Mei, close the door for me.

502
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,500
Close the door for me.

503
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,520
It can be closed.

504
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,530
Just right.

505
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,120
It's so beautiful here.

506
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,360
-I was thinking... -Sorry.

507
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,390
I don't feel well.

508
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,960
I need to go to the bathroom.

509
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,700
Are you okay, Jingmei?

510
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,060
What nonsense!

511
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,200
She still claimed she didn't kill her.

512
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,360
It's like asking for ransom after the hostage is dead.

513
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,100
Would that kill her?

514
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,280
If she was extremely nervous because of fear,

515
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,740
she might hyperventilate.

516
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,310
And she was locked up in such a small, confined space,

517
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,590
if she breathed in too much carbon dioxide…

518
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:44,820
Why?

519
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,190
Just for a hairpin?

520
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,700
Because she didn't like it.

521
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,910
She didn't like a kid?

522
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,490
He Shoutang.

523
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,860
The art store.

524
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,210
Xie Hui's college student colleague.

525
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,210
Maybe even the customers.

526
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,460
Everything.

527
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,340
I don't understand.

528
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,930
There is something others have but you don't.

529
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,360
You want it so much

530
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,650
that you even start to resent

531
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,570
the person who has it.

532
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,940
You have these moments too, right?

533
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,040
Jealousy.

534
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:31,860
You've experienced it, right?

535
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,040
Others are jealous of me.

536
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,350
Anyway,

537
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,930
this is what she said.

538
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,160
Just because she mastered some handicrafts,

539
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,120
she could open a beautiful store,

540
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,600
selling something of no use.

541
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,890
It was just because her husband could make money.

542
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,750
And what's her name, the college student,

543
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,900
she changed her boyfriends all the time.

544
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,800
Her living expenses and tuition fees were paid by the family.

545
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,890
This store

546
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,330
is just a hobby and accomplishment to them.

547
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,880
It's just the money of a pack of popcorn when going to see a movie.

548
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,010
Those who

549
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,090
work harder

550
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,480
should get the benefits, don't they?

551
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,740
Even to Zhao Baisi, who was pursuing her, she…

552
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,710
Mei.

553
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,040
This is my colleague.

554
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,120
Zhao Baisi.

555
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,710
-Hello. -Hello.

556
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,320
This is Ms. Lin Jingmi.

557
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,690
Ms. Lin.

558
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,980
Thank you, Hui.

559
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,010
I'll go find a place to put it first.

560
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:48,890
Hello, Ms. Lin.

561
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,120
Hello.

562
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,960
[Businessman Zhao Baisi]

563
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,080
Xie Hui is my boss.

564
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,890
He takes good care of me.

565
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,430
I'll go on ahead.

566
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,290
Yes, please.

567
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
She didn't even notice

568
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,500
that she had copied the same art store.

569
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,160
She was obsessed.

570
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,590
So she took the hairpin unconsciously.

571
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,150
I don't understand.

572
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,580
Forget it.

573
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,000
Get your brush.

574
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,450
At first, it was just a small black dot.

575
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,440
This is jealousy.

576
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,830
[Ms. He]

577
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,950
Then why are you afraid to answer the phone?

578
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,590
Why?

579
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,720
Didn't you hear what I just said?

580
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,360
That's why I asked you why.

581
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,270
Is it because you don't know what to say?

582
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,710
Or is it because you are afraid to see Ms. He is in pain

583
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,670
but you can't help?

584
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,170
Both.

585
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,980
People who don't know about our family

586
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,640
have talked to me

587
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,640
these years.

588
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,530
Hearing about what happened to our family,

589
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,470
they looked embarrassed and said,

590
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,110
“I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked.”

591
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,600
“I'm sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned it.”

592
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,300
When I saw their faces,

593
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,120
I realized

594
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,340
that saying it

595
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,850
would make them feel sorry and embarrassed.

596
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,140
Later, when someone asked me again,

597
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,420
the fact they might have the same reaction

598
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,610
would make me feel sorry for them instead.

599
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,460
I couldn't say it.

600
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,240
But you know what?

601
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,730
When I said it,

602
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,250
the thing that was choking here

603
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,310
became a little bit less.

604
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,320
Ms. He seems to have said something similar.

605
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,760
Even if this is

606
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,650
only temporary

607
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,550
for her to breathe.

608
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,340
I'm sorry

609
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,140
for keeping calling you.

610
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,090
I'm sorry.

611
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,560
I didn't answer them on purpose.

612
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,910
Then why are you still coming?

613
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,020
I want to feel less choked.

614
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,610
Then you can tell me

615
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,570
what the doll in the window looks like?

616
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,370
Why do you always have to ask?

617
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,160
I said

618
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,560
you did a great job last time.

619
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,870
It's okay, tell me

620
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,050
what the doll looks like.

621
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,110
-But Cao Guangyan always said I didn't have enough vocabulary... -Please.

622
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:50,550
She's about

623
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,690
this tall.

624
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,360
And the hair is this long.

625
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,550
Here's a hairpin.

626
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,590
She wears a high school uniform.

627
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,040
The skirt is up to here.

628
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,030
It's a little short.

629
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,840
But everyone wears it like this.

630
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,590
Her face is this big, and her eyes are this big.

631
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,460
I think the eyes are a little too big.

632
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,230
And the mouth.

633
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,330
I also think her mouth is a little too big.

634
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,940
And she looks arrogant.

635
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,080
I don't know what she's arrogant about.

636
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,710
Anyway, she's a 16-year-old

637
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,310
as you imagined.

638
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,480
Come with me.

639
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,390
Look closely.

640
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:51,940
You've changed it?

641
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,710
There is only one.

642
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,170
I only made one.

643
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,800
My daughter is just a bit chubby.

644
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:08,590
Chubby?

645
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,110
How?

646
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,990
Isn't she tall and thin?

647
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,370
When I first saw her,

648
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,340
she reminded me of the girls in my high school class.

649
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,030
What high school?

650
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,020
Have you lost your judgment again?

651
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,940
I think Xie He'an is tragic.

652
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,420
I'm helping her,

653
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,660
not you.

654
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,240
It's Xie He'an again.

655
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,850
I'm the one in the window.

656
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,050
I'm the one sitting there all the time.

657
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,060
She prevented me from seeing Xie He'an.

658
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,200
She's been chubby since she was little.

659
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,530
Will she get thinner?

660
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,940
Will she get taller?

661
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,140
Will she prefer long hair or short hair?

662
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,580
Skirt or pants?

663
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,180
Will the freckles still be there?

664
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,250
I can't imagine.

665
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,250
I can't even imagine how she'll look when she grows up.

666
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,200
I dare not tell anyone, including my husband.

667
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,500
I can't even imagine what my daughter will look like

668
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,490
when she grows up.

669
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,210
I am a very bad mother.

670
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,150
When I first met you,

671
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,620
you told me what she looked like.

672
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,790
I knew

673
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,600
you saw what I couldn't see.

674
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,480
At that time, I thought to myself,

675
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,500
“Of course she's dead.”

676
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,600
So people grow up in that world too.

677
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,210
I don't know how many times

678
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,430
I imagined that she was actually dead.

679
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,470
As a mother,

680
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,030
the only thing I could imagine

681
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,690
was her…

682
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:35,540
Her body.

683
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,840
I'm sorry.

684
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,040
I'm sorry.

685
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,220
I'm sorry.

686
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,100
I'm sorry.

687
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,230
You're not the one who has to say sorry.

688
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,360
It's the murderer who kept you from seeing

689
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,900
your daughter grow up.

690
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,150
I still can't figure out

691
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,610
[Next episode preview]

692
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,460
what obsession is.

693
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,910
How many cruel things will you see

694
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,160
if you live without end?

695
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,520
I want to make that selfish person

696
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:40,980
suffer as much as I do.

697
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:42,670
Yiyong,

698
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,430
when you see pity,

699
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,490
interfere.

700
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,160
You'll be in danger.
