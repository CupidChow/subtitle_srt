00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,200
Why did you have to let the woman see me?

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,430
You're here.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,620
Didn't she already find her daughter?

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,780
I think that's enough.

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,720
I didn't want her to see you.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,870
I wanted you to be seen by her.

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,510
What do you mean?

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,570
It's the same thing.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,420
Ms. He has found her daughter,

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,120
although she was found in that way.

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,690
But she still found her.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,440
What about you?

14
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm the one who's been sitting here.

15
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:26,840
I still can't figure out

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
what obsession is

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,510
that you've been talking about.

18
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,710
I don't know

19
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,789
if Ms. He will still hold any obsessions

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,750
after she found her daughter.

21
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,180

Xie He'an, right?

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,050
I'm not.

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,750
I was just thinking about what you said before,

25
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,160
to accept those feelings and emotions.

26
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,900
But it was in terms of other people.

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,340
But if you say no, then no.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,479

I can set you free.

31
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,260
Haven't you always wanted to leave Ms. He?

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,740
This is for you.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,980
After you write it,

34
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,160
what will happen to me?

35
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,160
I don't know.

36
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,750
I won't explode or disappear, will I?

37
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,360
There was a tattoo

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,829
which melted and then disappeared.

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,730
How can you do this?

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,130
You should check it out first.

41
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,670

42
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,260
-Then… -Let's forget about it for today.

43
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,000
-You… -You should check it out and let me know.

44
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,980
But I...

45
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,100
There is something others have but you don't.

46
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,450
You want it so much

47
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,750
that you even start to resent

48
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,810

49
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,380

Shut up.

123
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,610
It's not about the money.

124
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,210
It's the sense of accomplishment.

125
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,150
The sense of mission.

126
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,520
The sense of accomplishment.

127
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,580
You're repeating yourself.

128
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,620
Am I?

129
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,370
I don't care.

130
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,930
Anyway, you know what I'm usually up to?

131
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,490
Car accidents, traffic violations, inspections.

132
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,720
Drunken roadkill, drunken assault.

133
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,820
Drunkenly vandalizing public property.

134
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,570
Taking lost people and children home.

135
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,870
Helping tourists find their cell phones.

136
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,680
I even went to support

137
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,110
the youth project crime prevention advocacy last time.

138
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,960
The most terrible thing is the patrol sign-in.

139
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,390
It's pointless.

140
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,320
It's not like I took the police exam to do this.

141
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,980
Then what should you do?

142
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,680
I should be

143
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,900
a partner of justice,

144
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,410
a fighter of crime

145
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,180
to keep the peace of Gotham City and so on.

146
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,360
Isn't that what you just said?

147
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,920
They're chores.

148
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,250
They're petty.

149
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,750
Just like you went to medical school

150
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,800
to be a doctor and save lives.

151
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,480
But somehow you ended up...

152
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,790
What?

153
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,600
To be a

154
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,940

155
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,630
Next to us is the bureau.

156
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,120
I am in the office.

157
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,420
The wall

158
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,490
represents different classes and work.

159
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,730
I want to break the wall.

160
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,080
Anyway, I don't want to be stuck on the front line anymore.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,460
I want to work on cases, investigate cases, and solve cases.

162
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,530
If you find out a problem on the front line

163
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,750
and prevent it from

164
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,880
getting any worse,

165
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,560
isn't that good?

166
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,460
The only good thing is that I met you.

167
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,270
If it wasn't for your reincarnation of the devil,

168
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,760
how could I have gotten such a great case?

169
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,120
Prepare for electric shock.

170
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,400
150 joules.

171
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,710
What are you doing?

172
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,750
Get the family out of here.

173
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,450
Did Pu Yiyong just get a DUI?

174
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,780
Is that all you have to say?

175
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,710
And no.

176
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,400
He didn't drink a single sip.

177
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,640
I shouldn't mention the devil thing, should I?

178
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,350
But that's what he told me.

179
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,890
Or should I say the angel?

180
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,010
It's not about that.

181
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,700
You don't know what he's upset about?

182
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,370
The only good thing is that I met you.

183
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,610
If it wasn't for your reincarnation of the devil,

184
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,270
how could I have gotten such a great case?

185
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,260
Did he think

186
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,690
I had a feeling…

187
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,340
And then he heard

188
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,350
I was just thanking him for the case…

189
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,360
Now I don't understand what you're talking about.

190
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,140
It didn't mean to harm him

191
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,570
but to save him?

192
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,770
You scared me.

193
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,260
You scared me.

194
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,740
Why is there no beer?

195
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,780
Why would there be beer in the hospital?

196
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,510
After you.

197
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,180
After you.

198
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,870
You're scared, right?

199
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,890
About what happened just now.

200
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,940
The nursing staff asked me

201
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,180
if we would give up the emergency.

202
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,600
What does that mean?

203
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,140
Just like that.s

204
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,570
Every time they did that, Grandpa would suffer more.

205
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,440
Prepare for electric shock.

206
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,380
150 joules.

207
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,230
What? What?

208
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,210
Why put the long face?

209
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,470
Don't worry.

210
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,330
Grandpa already told us the answer.

211
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,370
Don't you believe it?

212
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,530
He restored his heartbeat on his own.

213
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:29,990
Mom.

214
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,970
I want to go upstairs.

215
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,440
Of course, you can.

216
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,200
But not with this face.

217
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,450
Let's go buy some beer

218
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,950
and hide it under Grandpa's blanket.

219
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,240
You'll be kicked out sooner or later.

220
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,190
I don't think so.

221
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,950
Grandpa may be very happy, okay?

222
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,200
[Pu]

223
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,110
It's so late. Are you still delivering cakes?

224
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,460
Not today.

225
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,730
It's a pity.

226
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,480
Next time.

227
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,200
Good.

228
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,470
Hi.

229
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,590
What did you ask me to pick up?

230
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,810
A gift.

231
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,290
A gift?

232
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,400
What for?

233
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,250
We've solved the case.

234
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,920
You helped me,

235
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,110
though a little bit.

236
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,750
So...

237
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,590
Here is the gift.

238
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,750
You're so nice.

239
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,830
Then I'll open it.

240
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,310
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,140
I've had one.

242
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,510
You can have this one too.

243
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,300
Congratulations on solving the case.

244
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,310
And I'm being transferred to the investigation team.

245
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,339
Is that a good thing?

246
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,869
It is.

247
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,530
No more roadside sobriety tests.

248
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,089
So...

249
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,140
Congratulations.

250
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,510
You don't want the transfer.

251
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,220
What?

252
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,130
I do.

253
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,810
I want it so bad.

254
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,570
Then why do you look like you don't?

255
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,480
Listen to what I'm going to say.

256
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,310
You want me to listen to it again?

257
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,620
It's not what you think.

258
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,000
How is it?

259
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,160
What's the problem?

260
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,940
The reincarnation of the devil.

261
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,620
What is it?

262
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,460
Nothing.

263
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,590
It's a random nickname.

264
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,250
It sounds to me

265
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,540
your friend should be

266
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,240
very kind.

267
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,200
What do you mean?

268
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,940
I guess

269
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,110
the problem is probably because you said

270
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,040
the word “great”.

271
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,040
The victim is a child, right?

272
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,930
He was totally picking on me.

273
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,450
But actually, this is just my guess.

274
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,320
Anyway, thank you

275
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,870
for everything.

276
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,300
Remember to take the gift.

277
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,570
Chuying.

278
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,010
What?

279
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,200
Do you want me to carry it for you?

280
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,480
No.

281
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,840
I just want to ask you.

282
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,310
What's your relationship

283
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,220
with the friend?

284
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,680
If you don't feel comfortable answering,

285
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,610
it's okay.

286
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,120
They two are my assistants.

287
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,020
I have to go.

288
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,910
So it's not just one person.

289
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,750
There are three of them.

290
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,630
No!

291
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,400
How did it go?

292
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,360
18417

293
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,860
There's a man that looks like a gangster on the Rainy Sound Bridge

294
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,980
who is jumping into the river. Repeat.

295
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,250
No, I saved him.

296
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,940
I'll be a doctor.

297
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,980
So

298
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,700
of course, saving people is my top priority.

299
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,420
Why do I feel

300
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,360
that I was almost killed by you?

301
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:55,960
And

302
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,500
I was just about to say.

303
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,810
It's a wound of less than a centimeter.

304
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,100
Is it necessary to wrap it like this?

305
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,380
It's the left hand that's bad.

306
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,670
Left hand.

307
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,880
Forget about the left hand.

308
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,510
Yi's right hand is more precious since he has to draw…

309
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,260
Nothing.

310
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,050
Sneaky.

311
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,980
Let me organize what you said.

312
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,410
There was a…

313
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,940
The old woman with the powder.

314
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,780
The old lady gave these papers

315
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,710
to those

316
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,200
creatures,

317
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,770
so they can

318
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,640
find you

319
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,010
and ask for your help.

320
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,510
This is the old lady's test for you.

321
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,100
You didn't write this, did you?

322
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,170
No, I didn't.

323
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,460
It's my grandfather.

324
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,530
How do you know?

325
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,470
Look at the changes in the strokes.

326
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,550
At first glance, the strokes are thick but not heavy.

327
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,680
At a closer look, it's as sharp as a sword,

328
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,450
as if it could cut through something.

329
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,180
You are unexpectedly good at this.

330
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,620
Do I have to collect all the Dragon Balls?

331
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,980
What balls?

332
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,290
The pieces of paper.

333
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,550
Once I collect all of them,

334
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,130
I can summon the dragon to make a wish or something like that.

335
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,140
I'm used to you like this.

336
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,360
Could the old lady be your grandmother?

337
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,770
So a quarter of you is not human.

338
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,020
So a quarter of me is not human.

339
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,950
You are not.

340
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,420
It's better. But I don't recognize my grandmother.

341
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,970
This left you no other way.

342
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,760
Next time, be polite when you dream.

343
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,930
Put away your fists.

344
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,870
Ask everything clearly.

345
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,160
Don't grab her collars at every turn.

346
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,550
Chuying said the ruins were going to be demolished.

347
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,200
Why?

348
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,930
In case children get in there again since it's near the school.

349
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,930
The owner of the house is old and doesn't want to deal with it.

350
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,370
Once he heard the government was going to demolish it for free, he agreed.

351
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,710
you're still not answering Chuying's call?

352
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,560
Is there anything left from your father's sale?

353
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,030
Yes, there is.

354
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,660
Although it's not as beautiful as your mom's.

355
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,060
I didn't.

356
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,310
What?

357
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,400
I don't know.

358
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,940
Stealing or something.

359
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,790
Stealing?

360
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,730
I think it's giving.

361
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,280
Let's go.

362
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,020
I'm thirsty.

363
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,590
How stupid was that kid

364
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,340
to dare to go into such a horrible place?

365
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,650
No manners.

366
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,610
You have no manners.

367
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,600
How did you get in?

368
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:21,840
How did I get in here?

369
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,760
I was in...

370
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,230
In that horrible place?

371
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,080
That's right.

372
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,250
Then why all of a sudden?

373
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,400
Did you just say

374
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,660
little girl was stupid?

375
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,170
She was not stupid.

376
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,970
If she was not,

377
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,620
why would she dare to go to a place like that?

378
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,440
I think she was bullied.

379
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,630
Wasn't she chubby?

380
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,160
You know kids are very vicious.

381
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,960
If she saw a classmate who bullied her

382
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,810
on the way out of school,

383
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,230
she would have no choice but to hide inside.

384
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,340
If she was to hide from her classmate,

385
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,210
it'd only take a few minutes.

386
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,650
But the police said she went in several times

387
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,110
and she stayed there for a long time.

388
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,160
Why did she dare to go in alone?

389
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,050
What if someone else was there?

390
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,490
You're the owner of the house, right?

391
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,910
Did you see something?

392
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,560
You are?

393
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,590
What is it?

394
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,580
What took you so long to answer?

395
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,520
I've just been doing a lot of business.

396
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:27,760
Shh.

397
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,430
Nothing.

398
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,620
You can talk now.

399
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,580
I have spare time now.

400
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,120
What? There's someone else?

401
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,280
The ruins.

402
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,600
It's possible that Xie He'an

403
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,300
often met with another person there.

404
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,130
Met with another person?

405
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,160
Who?

406
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,130
I don't know.

407
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,510
Think about it.

408
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,340
She was only nine years old.

409
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,700
How dare she play alone in a place like that?

410
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,230
Don't kids always think of that place

411
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,350
as some kind of secret base?

412
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,740
It's not a foreign movie.

413
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,800
I did it when I was a kid.

414
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:12,890
Where?

415
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,270
Under the desk.

416
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,790
I went to the ruins today too.

417
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,400
What did you do there?

418
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,430
Nothing.

419
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,620
Even I felt a bit scared

420
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,760
in there,

421
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,050
not to mention a kid.

422
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,720
-So… -You suspect after Lin Jingmei left,

423
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,200
a third person came there

424
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,350
and did something to Xie He'an?

425
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,200
That's right.

426
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,560
Why did you bring this up all of a sudden?

427
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,730
What do you mean?

428
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,400
Why did you

429
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,210
say this all of a sudden?

430
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,340
Because

431
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,090
something seems to have seen it.

432
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,090
It's something again.

433
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,480
Where's the evidence?

434
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,010
You don't have evidence.

435
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,880
You want to reopen the investigation

436
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,760
just because something invisible to all of us

437
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,610
claimed she saw something.

438
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,920
The doll

439
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,830
-saw Zhao Baisi… It's different.

440
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,250
What's different?

441
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,880
My personnel transfer time has come out.

442
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,720
I don't want to take the risk.

443
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,090
So the old lady is again…

444
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,200
And she's the one

445
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,460
who has a grudge against my grandpa.

446
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,210
I think so.

447
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Do you believe him?

448
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,110
I don't know about my grandpa.

449
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,920
But about the kid...

450
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,990
Can you see that old lady again?

451
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,740
Ask her all about your grandpa and Xie He'an.

452
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,030
He doesn't have a cell phone.

453
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:15,960
How can I find him?

454
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,020
By calligraphy.

455
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,320
The old lady doesn't do that.

456
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,710
Then dream.

457
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,170
I can't sleep now.

458
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,480
Do you think

459
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,160
I can connect anytime as the Internet does?

460
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,370
I can beat you up.

461
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,620
What's wrong with me again?

462
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,380
I don't know.

463
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,490
But the way you looked at me was very unpleasant.

464
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,130
Look.

465
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,770
The hair on my arms has stood up.

466
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,700
So how are we going to find that old lady?

467
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,310
You can't require seeing that kind of thing.

468
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:51,790
I see it.

469
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:53,840
Where is it?

470
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,130
She's drinking at your father's fish store.

471
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,610
Urine and stool?

472
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,390
It's our landlord?

473
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,250
Do you remember it?

474
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,680
My land is right next to the road.

475
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:10,870
Sir.

476
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,400
Yiyong.

477
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,070
Get up.

478
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,830
I told you to get up, did you hear me?

479
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,950
I have something to say.

480
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,130
-Dad. -No.

481
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,130
He's rude to treat the old lady like that.

482
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,430
Pu Yiyong thinks Grandma Zeng Jiang is drunk.

483
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,790
He decides to persuade her.

484
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,590
Let me introduce to you

485
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,000
This rude student

486
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,600
is my tenant's child.

487
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,730
His last name is Cao.

488
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,670
Cao Guangyan.

489
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,660
He's a doctor.

490
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,160
Did you see that?

491
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,980
She's been drinking more today

492
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,860
and keeps talking to the air.

493
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,870
She drank too much.

494
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,870
It's not good

495
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:47,520
That's right.

496
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,500
Let's go.

497
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,000
You're done? Are you leaving?

498
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,430
Don't drink anymore.

499
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,400
Seeing that means you're going to die.

500
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:10,940
He...

501
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,330
Well.

502
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,710
I can't make it up anymore.

503
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,630
Have you had enough of the tour?

504
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,140
It's poor

505
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,200
and shabby.

506
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,550
You asked to see it.

507
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,490
It's not me.

508
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,340
You know what I want to ask?

509
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,370
It's not me about the plane and the bus.

510
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,200
Even if I wanted to,

511
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,930
I couldn't do something like that.

512
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,680
-Then my grandfather... -It was me.

513
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,090
On the bus, in the hospital.

514
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,219
I'm the one who kept him alive.

515
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,330
But you and him...

516
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,500
I begged him every year to help me.

517
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,840
He ignored me every year.

518
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,650
So yes.

519
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,540
I hate him.

520
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,060
Do I need to ask the next question?

521
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,350
My turn.

522
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,690
You don't want me to help you find

523
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,770
the name of your crush, do you?

524
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,280
I want to ask

525
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,400
if you can let me die.

526
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,480
Like the guy buried at the bottom of the river,

527
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,030
you want to be free?

528
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,220
To die.

529
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,500
Like the Tattoo and its boyfriend,

530
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,900
you want to go to another world?

531
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,720
To die.

532
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,080
My Chinese class was the first class.

533
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,920
That was when I had my breakfast.

534
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,640
Stop babbling. I mean death.

535
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,260
I've lived in this world long enough,

536
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,340
so long

537
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,540
that you can't even imagine.

538
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,680
So you're what those things

539
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:34,310
say is so so

540
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:34,560
old...

541
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,400
I didn't say that.

542
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,540
The only power I have now

543
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,840
is to try to keep my youthful skin.

544
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,920
I've lived too long

545
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,850
and seen too many bad things.

546
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,800
It's painful

547
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,290
to see them

548
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,380
but not able to do anything about them.

549
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,410
Not able to do anything.

550
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,760
Yiyong.

551
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,930
Remember what I say.

552
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,510
Powerlessness is not a shameful thing.

553
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,620
When you see pity

554
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,250
and interfere,

555
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,060
you will be in danger.

556
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,250
You're the most important.

557
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,740
You won't understand

558
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,540
what I'm saying now.

559
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,410
Listen.

560
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,520
Repeat

561
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,560
what I just said.

562
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,880
Powerlessness

563
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,110
is not a shameful thing.

564
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,910
I always thought my grandfather

565
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,540
found out I was drawing cartoons.

566
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,630
But it's unclear

567
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,220
whether he was trying to encourage me

568
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,530
or was being sarcastic.

569
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,470
The result is…

570
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,290
And how many more cruel things will I have to see

571
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,690
if I live without end?

572
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:28,800
So

573
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,990
can you let me die?

574
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,390
This is what you want my grandpa to help you with?

575
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,700
Since you hate him so much,

576
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,860
why did you save him?

577
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,740
I can't let him die.

578
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,200
I'll let him hang on for dear life

579
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,140
but he can't do anything.

580
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,040
I told you.

581
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,560
I'll make the selfish person

582
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,090
as painful as I am.

583
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,070
Aren't you concerned about the child?

584
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,510
I think you're different from your grandpa.

585
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,880
I've told you the truth about the child.

586
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,080
It's your decision.

587
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,870
Do you want to

588
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,940
ignore your grandpa's warning

589
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,450
and get on with it?

590
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,300
One-per, someone wants to see you outside.

591
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,400
I'm sorry.

592
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,950
Because of Pu Yiyong,

593
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,830
the chief only allows me to serve guests with paper cups.

594
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,500
What do you want?

595
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,100
I have to sign in later.

596
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,350
Then I'll speak more efficiently.

597
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,920
As you said last time,

598
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,290
I went to medical school to become a doctor and save lives.

599
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,560
But it'd be a bummer

600
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,260
if I ended up as a health room nurse.

601
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,340
Is that what you meant?

602
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,210
In fact, only part of what you said is true.

603
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,780
I went to medical school to become a doctor, yes.

604
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,280
But not to save lives.

605
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,350
I just want to be a doctor.

606
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,420
Though I don't want to admit it,

607
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,720
I think Pu Yiyong

608
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,580
is more of a cop and a doctor than us.

609
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,810
[Re-investigate]

610
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,010
It's okay.

611
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,660
It's better than both of us getting beaten up.

612
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,250
Sorry, Yong.

613
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,590
My dad said he wanted to borrow it. I had no other way.

614
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,450
Thanks.

615
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,080
I've been asking you to lend it to me for a long time.

616
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,710
I didn't know your dad was a delivery man.

617
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
He got fired.

618
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,590
He even beat up his boss.

619
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,220
What about you, Yong?

620
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,220
Do you want to join me as a beauty Youtuber?

621
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:15,680
No.

622
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,670
My dad's company recently laid off staff.

623
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,140
He also borrowed a car from you?

624
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,110
He's the boss.

625
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,370
The employee who was laid off beat him up.

626
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,250
I just came from the hospital.

627
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,550
It's a tough world to live in, no matter what.

628
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,780
What are you doing?

629
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:46,470
What does this mean?

630
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,070
Yong, I'm honored, but I don't want it.

631
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,380
You don't want what?

632
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,510
I'm asking what that means.

633
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,530
I don't mean that.

634
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:56,670
What?

635
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,670
I want to play too.

636
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,490
He just did this to me.

637
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,790
Yong, I want it.

638
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,350
What do you want or not?

639
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,980
It's so unbelievable.

640
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,960
Especially you, Chen Dongjun.

641
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,470
Yong started it.

642
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,150
So what does this mean?

643
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,990
Write on your back and guess the word.

644
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,440
Yong, you've never played it?

645
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:28,940
No.

646
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,740
Dongjun and I have always played this since we were kids,

647
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:33,950
not just for fun.

648
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,110
We also used it,

649
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,740
not only on multiple-choice questions,

650
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,240
but also on essay questions.

651
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,500
That's why you'd pass the exam?

652
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,160
Because you didn't sit

653
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,250
in the same row as us.

654
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,670
I sat behind you.

655
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:58,490
So...

656
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,000
Shut up.

657
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,090
So Yong, what did you write just now?

658
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,360
I don't know.

659
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,060
Someone else wrote it. I'm not sure.

660
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,180
Who wrote it?

661
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:08,840
Is it a confession? Is it male or female?

662
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:09,490
Go away.

663
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,230
Follow it. You'll know.

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,210
Yiyong.

665
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,380
Remember what I say.

666
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,800
Powerlessness is not a shameful thing.

667
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,720
When you see pity

668
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,100
and interfere,

669
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:49,970
you will be in danger.

670
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,880
You're the most important.

671
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,920
Help my brother.

672
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,700

00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,320
I saw you and your brother at the Biff factory.

Me and my brother?

676
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,990
I got all the pieces of paper.
