I'll do that after the rain stops.

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,890
Alright.

Stop it.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,410
My son got into the university.

15

He got in and you still hit him.

Your mum looked so funny just now.

Why such a hurry?

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,070
I'm full. Why? You expect me to wash your dishes?

25
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,160
You saw it?

26
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,940
I didn't.

27
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,650
You replied so fast. It means you saw it.

28
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,579
I told you I didn't.

29
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,180
You did.

30
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,850
I didn't.

31
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,420
You did.

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,160
I didn't.

33
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,360
I found you.

34
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,080
How dare you?

35
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,870
Luckily, it was just a nightmare.

36
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,030
Did he really say that?

37
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,910
Yeah.

38
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,540
He won't come home even if I asked him to.

39
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,490
He insisted on waiting for Yiyong to wake up.

40
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,510
He said he wanted to check if he had a concussion.

41

Sorry

Didn't you see it?

58

Yes, I did. I saw this.

Hey, tell your mum that I wasn't.

85
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,080

Tell us what exactly you're looking for.

110

But why nothing's here?

I can't see my dad.

116

I had allergies.

123
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,200
What does it have to do with allergies?

124
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,040
What should we have for food later?

125
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,650

You want to go to this restaurant?

129

No need.

Don't go to this restaurant.

133
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,150
It's none of your business.

134

I'll have whatever Guangyan wants.

135

It's gone again.

148

Didn't you see that?

150
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,120
Don't you think it's impossible?

151
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,170
I did.

152
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,380
I saw something more troublesome.

153

Not again.

157

Make a draw.

158
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,460
I'll write whatever you get.

159
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,760
Or tell me what you want me to write.

Just tell me. I'll write it for you.

165
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,690
It's not like that.

166

[His name]

167
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,080
Guangyan, how do you write the "yan" in your name?

168
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,910
No.

169
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,150
It's not his name.

170
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,990
Then whose name is it?

171
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,460
It's his.

172
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,250
Whose?

173
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,430
Forget about it. Just tell me the name.

174
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,580
I don't know.

175
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,620
The name you want me to write down is...

176
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,400
I don't know.

177
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,930
Another one who knows nothing.

178
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,900
What are you doing?

179
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,170
Are you kidding me?

180
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,750
Who are you talking to?

181
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,020
Explain to me what was going on with this.

182
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,730
So annoying.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,970
Don't take this as a treasure.

184
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,040
Didn't you see there's a bunch of them on that woman's head?

185
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,480
What woman?

186
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,220
What does she look like?

187
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,510
She has long hair.

188
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,600
Dressed like Dongfang Bubai in the novel.

189
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,440
Always lying on a plant.

190
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,120
You really don't know many vocabularies to describe her.

191
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,740
What are you doing?

192
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,030
You wanted to see her.

193
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,940
Now here she is.

194
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,790
You saw her?

195
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,560
What did you do to me?

196
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,400
-I just drew... -Stress.

197
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,740
My dad lost his job in late middle age.

198
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,640
So we had to move in

199
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,810
with an elder lady who remembers nothing

200
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,430
but drinking.

201
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,220
And you are the last straw.

202
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,790
We met you, a loser and scumbag

203
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,680
who lives right next door.

204
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,600
All these made me mentally stressed, which caused my illusion.

205
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,850
What illusion?

206
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,790
You're like when you were in high school.

207
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,920
Really annoying.

208
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,490
Did you hear that?

209
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm just a scumbag.

210
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,220
I can't help you.

211
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,910
What do you think, senior?

212
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,420
Indeed, someone who does calligraphy carries a different aura.

213
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,510
Are you coming down or not?

214
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,780
If you don't, I'll stick you inside the case.

215
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,660
Yes, senior.

216
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,710
My friend was born in a calligraphy classroom.

217
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,620
His grandfather was his mentor.

218
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,540
A disciple from a famous calligraphy family.

219
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,560
Yeah, that's kinda the story.

220
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,620
Senior.

221
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,380
I was just asking.

222
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,680
Will his performance

223
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,320
affect my probation result?

224
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,280
I'll take you to the water slide

225
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,280
and swimming pool later.

226
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,060
Almost...

227
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:20,920
What are you doing here?

228
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,870
Help me.

229
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,790
What's wrong with you? Why are you following me?

230
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,550
Please help me to find out about his name.

231
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,620
I said I don't know.

232
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,170
I don't have time to help you.

233
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:39,960
Just leave.

234
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,320
It's no use staring at me like that.

235
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,910
Another dead person who couldn't rest in peace

236
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,570
did that to me already.

237
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:54,950
Okay, whatever.

238
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,110
You'd better just stay here.

239
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,460
You can play with the lights and shake the customers' bed.

240
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,080
Or you can comb your hair in front of the mirror.

241
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,300
This place really suits you.

242
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,150
Whatever.

243
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,730
Sorry, you can come in now.

244
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,680
You said I was just like when I was in high school, didn't you?

245
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,270
I lost my job anyway.

246
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,580
I'll go to your school every day starting tomorrow

247
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,930
and let you experience your high school life again.

248
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,750
What do you want?

249
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,050
I want to help that woman.

250
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,770
With you.

251
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,220
I told you I had an illusion.

252
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,440
It's none of my business.

253
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,860
Since it's your illusion,

254
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,160
why does she keep showing up in front of me?

255
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,900
You brought her back.

256
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,930
Let's deal with her together.

257
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,490
And you'll have to pay me the compensation for being unemployed.

258
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,470
What compensation?

259
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,160
I'm hungry.

260
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,810
Let's go to your dad's place for some noodles.

261
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,890
Why?

262
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,610
Does it embarrass you

263
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,520
to walk with me?

264
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,360
At least take off your hat.

265
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,820
This suit costs more than 2,000 yuan.

266
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,620
I can't refund it.

267
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,620
So I have to wear it more.

268
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,570
Oh, right.

269
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,080
You'll have to pay for this too.

270
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,500
More than 2,000 yuan? How much more?

271
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,760
I forgot.

272
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,910

273
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,460
No.

274
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,930
Three thousand.

275
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,400
Do you remember the career planning class?

276
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,109
What did you fill in that form?

277
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,430
Doctor.

278
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,819
You did turn into a doctor.

279
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,569
All right, let's go.

280
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,870
This is the place where we first found the withered leaves.

281

[Laboratory Building]

282
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,670
Senior.

283
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,890
We could have showed ourselves in.

284
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,880
You came in using my card.

285
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,910
I will be the one in trouble if anything goes wrong.

286
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,950
Mr. John Doe is very famous in our department.

287
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
He was here two years before I entered school.

288
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,780
[Mr. John Doe]

289
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,220
And it's just here.

290
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,350
It doesn't include the storage room.

291
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,530
Seven years? How is that possible?

292
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,520
That's why he's famous.

293
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,600
What's gonna happen to the bodies

294
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,660
after the anatomy class,

295
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,380
do you know that?

296
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,070
What's gonna happen?

297
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,380
The bodies would collapse.

298
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,930
After removing the organs

299
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,070
and the fat,

300
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,830
and after some other operations in class,

301
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,270
the bodies are no longer what you think they are.

302
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,770
But this one is different.

303
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,370
It's kinda exaggerated,

304
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,450
but it's like he can fix himself.

305
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,380
Plus, his identity is a mystery. This is an anonymous body.

306
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,570
People have made up many stories about him during the past seven years.

307
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,820
Most people think he was a gangster.

308
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,270
It's because...

309
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,950
Guang, help me.

310
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,710
Go get the moisturizer.

311
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,300
Okay.

312
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,590
I don't know if it's just me.

313
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,400
I think his condition is worse than several days ago.

314
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,780
When all the flowers wither,

315
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,830
this body will become an ordinary corpse.

316
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,010
Please find out about his name

317
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,240
before that happens.

318
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,170
Can we really find out about his identity?

319
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
He has his way.

320
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,260
Can you make this simple?

321
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,180
And I wanted to tell you this a long time ago.

322
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,600
You are wearing ancient clothes,

323
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,450
is that why you talk so slowly?

324
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,010
Go on.

325
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,180
Your friend is sick.

326
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,390
What will happen if he turns into an ordinary corpse?

327
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,680
I mean an ordinary corpse will...

328
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,250
Be quiet.

329
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,990
That woman said

330
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,600
when all the flowers wither,

331
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,510
he will turn into an ordinary corpse.

332
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,510
What happens to an ordinary corpse?

333
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
They will cremate it at the end of the term.

334
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,320
When is that?

335
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,360

00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:56,580
From the tattoo.

377
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,660
I'm Cao Guangyan.

378
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,950
It means the bright light and the inkstone.

379
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,640
I'm a sophomore in medical school.

380
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,580
She's the girl in the tattoo

381
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,340
on the back of the body of Mr. John Doe in our school.

382
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,220
That's why she's dressed like that.

383
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,010
What's your name?

384
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,930
You're indeed an educated scholar.

385
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,700
So different from the hooligan sitting next to you.

386
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,230
I'm a police, Chen Chuying.

387
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,320
Chuying, please accept my salute.

388
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,100
No need for that.

389
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,320
Part of my name means the heroines

390
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,310
and the rest of it writes as the tree and the person.

391
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,770
My dad said the second part of my name means paper.

392
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,010
Hey, is it your names that matter?

393
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,820
It's the body's name we need to figure out, okay?

394
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
By the way, my name is Pu...

395
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,030
About the name, there's something I have to tell you.

396
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,570
The victim died in 2011.

397
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,340
His body was found less than half a day after his death.

398
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,880
And it was a sudden death.

399
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,140
It didn't affect his appearance.

400
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,370
His photo was disclosed to the public.

401
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,090
The police checked the missing persons.

402
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,730
The prosecutor checked the military records.

403
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,790
But in the past 11 years,

404
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,730
no missing case that fits him.

405
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,130
That's why

406
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,430
it's just too hard.

407
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,030
But we have a witness now.

408
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,730
Yes, we do now.

409
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,820
Since he tattooed your profile,

410
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,160
how come you don't know his name?

411
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,200
Since I had these,

412
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,290
I've never heard him mention his name.

413
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,650
What do you mean?

414
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,210
Since you had what?

415
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,620
Your face?

416
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,410
I do have a pretty and admirable

417
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,460
face, of course.

418
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,620
That's not what I said.

419
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,080
But I mean,

420
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,350
the first time he talked to me,

421
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,020
I started to be able to hear and see things.

422
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,080
What did he say?

423
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,430
I'm sorry.

424
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,070
I'm sorry.

425
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,170
It's been seven years,

426
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,100
but I left you the way you were.

427
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,170
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,820
He felt sorry

429
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,410
because he couldn't finish the tattoo.

430
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,830
But I've always wanted to tell him

431
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,260
that even if it's not finished,

432
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,620
I'm still beautiful.

433
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,960
You don't know his name.

434
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,230
You should at least know his address?

435
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,700
I never thought about paying attention to that.

436
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,010
You don't see what you should have.

437
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,590
Are you a narcissist or what?

438
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,300
Actually, what I wanted to see is...

439
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,490
Do you know where he got the tattoo?

440
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,610
When?

441
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,360
I don't know.

442
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,070
When was the first time he talked to you?

443
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,390
Four years before he died.

444
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,450
Four plus seven

445
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,380
is 12.

446
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,180
It's 11.

447
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,000
Oh.

448
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,730
2,011 minus 11 is 1,999.

449
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,600
It's 2,000.

450
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,840
Calculate it if you can.

451
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
It's 20,000.

452
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,300
It's 2,000.

453
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,720
-Two thousand. -Two thousand.

454
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,680
Oh.

455
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,110
Yeah, it was the year 2000.

456
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,080
At least the tattoo shop was still open in that year.

457
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,160
What if it went broke?

458
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,260
This is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

459
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,840
Officer, we didn't do anything wrong.

460
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,280
Why did you bring us back to the police station?

461
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,890
That's right, officer. We were just

462
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,560
expressing how we truly feel.

463
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,830
Sit down and I'll take your statements.

464
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,960
I've never been here before. I'm very nervous.

465
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,150
Do you have to make a statement?

466
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,010
Or what?

467
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,330
I have to go back and open the shop later.

468
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,300
How long will this take?

469
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,490
You were kicking other's car. And you think we don't need a statement for that?

470
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,630
[Northern District: Labor Committee of Pitchman Association]

471
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,240
That was just an emotional reaction.

472
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,940
Okay, it's okay.

473
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,300
-What questions do you have? -Hurry up. Make a statement.

474
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,770
If you want to file a complaint, do it later, okay?

475
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,610
Okay.

476
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,010
Are you drilling?

477
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,090
She came for me.

478
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,330
Not you. Why are you so scared?

479
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,530
Are you trying to trick me into doing something evil?

480
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,560
It's about something kind.

481
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,330
I've sent it to you.

482
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,940
I'll wait for your message.

483
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,730
Sorry. I'm just being curious.

484
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,250
Bye.

485
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,010
Thank you in advance.

486
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,150
I can help too.

487
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:47,000
[Who did this tattoo? Please spread the word and help to ask. It's not about anything evil.]

488
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,250
I think you were mistaken.

489
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,020
Was he homeless?

490
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,480
He didn't look like he was homeless.

491
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,250
I don't think so either.

492
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,400
Judging from these photos,

493
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,620
it's more reasonable to say it was an office worker who just finished shopping.

494
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,520
He did if you take a quick look.

495
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,330
Don't you think so?

496
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,940
I only showed up when he talked to me.

497
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,830
There was no one else.

498
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,070
He must have wanted to be alone with me.

499
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,130
Just say no you don't know.

500
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,130
Gui, this is Chuying.

501
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,090
Yeah, this is one-per.

502
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,030
Send me all the locations of the homeless people

503
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,010
in your jurisdiction.

504
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,130
Yes, right now.

505
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,520
And the ones crossing into other districts, too.

506
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,760
Are we not doing this with that police officer?

507
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:46,990
Look.

508
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,690
You think they'd want to see the police?

509
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,560
But we're different.

510
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,180
You look like a bookworm with a smart brain and stupid face.

511
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,150
I look like a nice person.

512
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,660
It's more convenient for us to do this.

513
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,270
Don't you think so?

514
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,310
No, I don't.

515
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:00,790
What?

516
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,140
Be polite later.

517
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,020
Don't call them homeless.

518
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,480
Of course not. I'm not stupid.

519
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,410
I think someone

520
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,880
took his space.

521
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,410
Excuse me.

522
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,530
Excuse me, uncle and auntie, who're homeless.

523
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,240
Have you met this person 11 years ago?

524
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,180
Why are you asking?

525
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:21,500
Oh.

526
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,810
He's dead.

527
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,570
I'm sorry, my friend's IQ is a bit...

528
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,560
Sir and Madam,

529
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,510
I'm a medical student.

530
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,210
This is the photo

531
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,810
of Mr. John Doe in our school.

532
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,540
Anatomy?

533
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,190
Yes.

534
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,670
He passed away 11 years ago.

535
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,440
His body was dealt with as an anonymous corpse.

536
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,310
We still don't know his name by now.

537
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,240
We want to help him find his identity.

538
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,900
So we'd like to ask

539
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,590
if you know him from anywhere?

540
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,140
Or do you know anyone who might know him?

541
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,940
Come and help.

542
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,780
Do you know this person?

543
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,090
No.

544
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,130
I don't know.

545
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,390
Go ahead. Keep up the good work.

546
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,680
Keep it up.

547
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:18,680
You...

548
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,180
As to you,

549
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,320
be careful not to become like us.

550
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,600
Let's go.

551
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,430
Let me do it.

552
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,250
Excuse me.

553
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,800
Do you know him?

554
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,290
You just want to hear the compliment.

555
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,670
Shameless.

556
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,770
Are you sure you don't know him?

557
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,360
No, I don't.

558
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,890
Take a closer look.

559
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,950
I don't think there's anyone who looks like him here.

560
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,510
Young man.

561
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,040
He won't talk to you.

562
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,280
He doesn't even talk to us.

563
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,340
Sir.

564
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:03,850
Uncle.

565
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,120
Uncle.

566
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,000
Uncle.

567
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,020
Have you seen this person?

568
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,540
It's been a long time.

569
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,830
Please take a look.

570
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,300
It was about 11 years ago,

571
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,920
There was an ancient girl tattoo on his back.

572
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,610
Have you seen this?

573
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,670
What's wrong with him?

574
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,530
Did he commit a crime?

575
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:46,890
He's dead.

576
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:00,900
Cao Guangyan.

577
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,710
A corpse without identity?

578
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,680
How come?

579
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,710
He was different from us.

580
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,860
Was he up to something?

581
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,390
At first,

582
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,240
everyone suspected him.

583
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,440
How come a man who wore a suit

584
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,300
was willing to know people like us?

585
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,680
So we ignored him.

586
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,110
But he kept coming back and helping us.

587
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,260
Each time he came,

588
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,700
he just sat there

589
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,470
and listened to us.

590
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,830
People living on the street

591
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,350
all had stories.

592
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,780
They complained about the world and society.

593
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,210
They complained, argued, and fought.

594
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,090
But he was always the same.

595
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,630
He never talked.

596
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,500
Just listened.

597
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,320
He had this expression on his face

598
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,060
which was hard to tell.

599
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,170
He seemed to be smiling,

600
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,480
or not.

601
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,010
It seemed like he was sitting there,

602
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,510
but somehow you didn't feel him there.

603
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,219
What are you doing?

604
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,850
You get 73 points every time.

605
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,929
At least fifty-fifty.

606
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,790
People

607
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,770
fought with each other

608
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,250
for a box.

609
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,340
The next day,

610
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:58,210
he brought a few boxes for them to share.

611
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,400
People hurt each other for a sip of drink.

612
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,090
The next day,

613
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,320
he brought everyone a bottle of soy milk.

614
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,560
I thought you would bring some wine.

615
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,660
People need to be healthy to live well.

616
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,710
What about your family?

617
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,030
They're all dead.

618
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,850
After we all slept,

619
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,920
he'd leave by himself.

620
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,780
He didn't do it for one or two days.

621
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,290
He did it for many years.

622
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,170
When did you say

623
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,490
he left? February when?

624
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,280
February 1st.

625
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,530
February 1st?

626
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,730
I only remember

627
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,950
it was the day before Chinese New Year's Eve.

628
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,880
It was said that the cold currents were coming that night.

629
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,860
People were already freezing

630
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,470
during broad daylight.

631
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,690
He told us

632
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,300
he would go home and bring us something to keep us warm.

633
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,110
Before he left,

634
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,060
he

635
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,380
told us

636
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,280
to live well.

637
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,810
I didn't expect that...

638
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,750
Uncle,

639
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:44,920
all those years,

640
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,750
he never told you his name?

641
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,510
Everyone nicknamed him Suit.

642
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,690
People like us

643
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,590
call each other casually.

644
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,920
We don't use names.

645
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,210
Uncle.

646
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,180
What's your name?

647
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,130
Names

648
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,340
are necessary for people like you in society.

649
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,290
It's useless

650
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,660
to people like us.

651
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,910
What do we

652
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,800
need names for?

653
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:57,890
Mr. Cao.

654
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,760
Are you meditating?

655
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,020
No, I'm just thinking

656
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,230
about my sales.

657
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,290
How's business?

658
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,410
There are some regular customers.

659
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,070
That's good.

660
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,390
You've already got regulars.

661
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,900
They are Ms. Zeng Jiang and Yiyong.

662
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,490
Where are you going?

663
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,570
Why don't you greet people?

664
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,010
You're being rude.

665
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,530
Hello, auntie.

666
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,290
Hello.

667
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,000
Are you going to work?

668
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,450
Yes.

669
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,230
Take care.

670
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,600
Okay, I will.

671
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,080
So polite.

672
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,060
I told you I'd give you a ride.

673
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,420
It'll be hard to explain to my mum if she sees it.

674
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,090
No.

675
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,670
She'd kill me before I explained myself.

676
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,280
We can find a place to meet where she can't see us.

677
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,300
Mr. Li.

678
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,060
Hello.

679
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,040
I'm Chen Chuying who called you.

680
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,390
His name is Pu Yiyong.

681
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,310
Hello.

682
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,230
This is Cao Guangyan.

683
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:11,790
Hello, Mr. Li.

684
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,400
But

685
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,060
I think they look different.

686
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,530
You are right.

687
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,920
Do you want to take a look?

688
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,940
I want to tattoo a profile.

689
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,670
Do you have a picture?

690
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,010
Where do you wanna have it?

691
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:51,550
On my back.

692
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,020
All the photos after this page are of human profiles.

693
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,440
See if you're interested in any.

694
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,200
That will do.

695
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,120
Usually, customers who come for tattoos will hesitate.

696
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,960
Sometimes it takes them weeks to choose pictures.

697
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,130
I've never seen anyone like him.

698
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,390
He made me more anxious than he was.

699
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,570
This tattoo will be with you for a lifetime.

700
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,000
It's not that I can't change it in the future,

701
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,450
but...

702
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,280
Are you sure you want this?

703
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,870
Exactly the same one?

704
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,660
I want to change it.

705
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,990
That's right. Go back and think about it.

706
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,010
I want this face

707
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,480
to look more ordinary.

708
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,590
I've never heard of such a request in my life.

709
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,250
What if there would be a dispute?

710
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,100
I told him to go back and think about it carefully before he came back again.

711
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,150
So I told him I didn't work that day,

712
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,640
and forced him to go back.

713
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,370
Did he come back?

714
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,560
-Of course. -Of course.

715
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,650
Why would you want to tattoo a profile?

716
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,840
Because I'm not used to being alone.

717
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,820
You can have a pet.

718
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,090
No.

719
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,820
Why?

720
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,070
It will die before I do.

721
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,620
He promised me

722
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,200
he would come back to replenish colors when he had money.

723
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,900
How much area he'd replenish depended on how much money he had.

724
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,010
Just like that. Bit by bit each time.

725
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,860
We never made any appointment.

726
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,680
But I was expecting him to come in every day.

727
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,620
For money?

728
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,400
I do like money,

729
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,700
but I like him more.

730
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,050
To be honest,

731
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,420
that picture

732
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,590
was just a sample hanging on the wall.

733
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,580
It didn't mean anything.

734
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,510
But after it was tattooed on his back,

735
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,340
it looked

736
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,110
completely different.

737
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,430
I was thinking

738
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,640
why he didn't come back.

739
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,720
Did he have no money?

740
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,930
Or did he ask someone else to take it over?

741
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,510
So when I saw

742
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,630
the message looking for the photo,

743
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,740
I was happy. I was thinking

744
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,180
that the tattoo hasn't changed at all.

745
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,470
But I didn't expect that he's already...

746
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,040
How about his work place, his home address,

747
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,870
his family or friends? Did he ever talk about them?

748
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,590
We wouldn't ask customers that much.

749
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,950
What about a company ID?

750
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,260
Did he ever wear any identification certificate?

751
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:19,920
No, he didn't.

752
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,920
What did he mean by looking ordinary?

753
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,240
He said he wanted to change the face in the tattoo to be an ordinay one.

754
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:28,990
Was the face in the tattoo ugly?

755
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,170
Not really.

756
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,580
The profiles

757
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,620
are usually people like this,

758
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,490
beautiful and sexy.

759
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:00,840
This was the draft he drew.

760
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:01,700
Here.

761
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,430
He asked if I could change it into this.

762
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,670
[Del Consulting Co., Ltd.]

763
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,570
The year 2000? What year is it now?

764
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,410
-The year 2022. -The year 2022.

765
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,430
Of course, I know. So,

766
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,450
how is it possible for me to still keep

767
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,600
the personnel files from 22 years ago?

768
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,220
Not to mention he resigned.

769
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,140
It's legal to keep the personnel files for just 10 years, isn't it?

770
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,620
Was there anyone who quit or got fired

771
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,550
that had a tattoo on his back?

772
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,540
You were not allowed to be naked at work.

773
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,530
So I couldn't see their backs either.

774
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,480
Do you have any employees

775
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,570
who worked here during those several years?

776
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:44,610
Yes, we do.

777
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:47,410
I was here.

778
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,000
It's big trouble for the company to have a police officer here

779
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,710
during working hours.

780
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,050
So, do you have any other questions?

781
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,460
We always get people making trouble here.

782
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:00,970
We're the unlucky ones.

783
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,610
We either lock him up

784
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,550
or pay him some money.

785
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,520
Why didn't you call the police earlier?

786
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,490
[Former employee suing to survive, till you compensate]

787
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,490
[Del Consultation dodged the pension, dismissed employees illegally, odious and unscrupulous]

788
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,490
[Protest against Del Consultation, employees risked their lives for nothing]

789
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,440
The pension?

790
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:10,990
Is he...

791
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:12,810
Is he still here?

792
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,130
It was that taxi driver.

793
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,120
TD2328.

794
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,200
Idiot.

795
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:51,970
Drive.

796
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,540
[Did you get anything?]

797
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:48,540
[In the next episode]

798
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,130
We should give him his identity

799
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,220
before he disappears.

800
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,780
Do you know him?

801
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,260
Aren't you afraid

802
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,730
of having this kinda gift?

803
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,180
Why can you see those things?

804
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,210
Don't you want to figure it out?

805
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,610
One day,

806
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,330
maybe I can meet the person I want to.
