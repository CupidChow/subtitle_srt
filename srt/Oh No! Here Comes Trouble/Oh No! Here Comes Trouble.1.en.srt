00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,860
because the intracranial aneurysm ruptured.

376
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,610
Of course.

377
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,650
If it was the accident

378
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,050
that caused the trauma,

379
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,530
it would be easy and clear to define the responsibilities.

380
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,030
But what caused his unconsciousness first,

381
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,060
the accident or his illness itself,

382
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,350
the real reason means totally different results to our company.

383
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,330
Same with your company, right?

384
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,380
Actually, you could have asked for leave.

385
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,790
I took too many days off.

386
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,940
I need some income.

387
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,610
They are still denying it?

388
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,550
About your father-in-law's case?

389
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,270
They may feel embarrassed.

390
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,890
Okay.

391
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,570
By the way,

392
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,960
well,

393
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,020
I want to talk about the commission.

394
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,720
I'm still angry with the airlines.

395
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,430
Another time.

396
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,880
That's too much.

397
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,630
None of your business.

398
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,989
Grandpa is so much stronger than you are.

399
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,110
You can wake up.

400
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,960
He can too.

401
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,370
What about the calligraphy training center?

402
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:45,120
I forgot to tell you.

403
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,139
We moved.

404
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,210
We moved?

405
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,480
Is that something you can forget about?

406
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,409
Your daughter is getting married.

407
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,389
That's why you are taking the house back?

408
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,450
Yes.

409
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,230
I'm sorry for the last-minute request.

410
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,750
I remember you told me

411
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,630
that you didn't have any kids.

412
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,230
That's why you're buying houses everywhere

413
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,180
to plan

414
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,740
for your life when you are old.

415
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,930
Did I?

416
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,450
When did I tell you that?

417
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,800
1:30 p.m. on March 1st, 2014.

418
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,050
How could you remember it so accurately?

419
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,160
You asked me if I could pay

420
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,500
for half a year's rent,

421
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,060
because you needed the revenue stream.

422
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,630
And because it was my birthday that day,

423
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,130
I paid a lot for it.

424
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,910
So I remember it clearly.

425
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,980
Happy birthday.

426
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,650
Can you tell me the real reason?

427
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,120
Your son and your father-in-law

428
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,600
will not stay in the hospital forever, won't they?

429
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,540
If they were moved back...

430
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,690
You're worried that they may die in the house?

431
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,230
No landlord accepts this?

432
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,980
Or how about you buy one?

433
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,030
So you spent all the compensation?

434
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,120
Now we die if we want to

435
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,840
and we'll die in our own home.

436
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:02,770
No one would dare to badger us.

437
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,090
Excuse me.

438
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,850
Can you not say that word here?

439
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,230
Or you can lower your voice.

440
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,690
Sorry.

441
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,220
Please live a long life.

442
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,680
Besides, if grandpa

443
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,200
wants to continue teaching calligraphy,

444
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,010
there will be a place he can start anytime.

445
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,570
You're right.

446
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,590
You don't have to care about others anymore.

447
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,970
She's right.

448
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,020
Can I go outside now?

449
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,570
It's been almost two years.

450
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,170
It's hard to say if your situation will maintain stability or not.

451
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,020
Don't forget your crutches.

452
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,990
You really don't need your mother to accompany you?

453
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,490
Doctor.

454
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,420
Be brave.

455
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,160
You can do this.

456
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,970
Lend me 500 yuan.

457
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:27,630
700.

458
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,470
Okay.

459
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,050
Is this the right place?

460
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,910
Can you pull over here?

461
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,200
Okay.

462
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,250
Okay.

463
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,160
It's okay. I'll stop the meter.

464
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,330
Take your time.

465
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,950
Pull over here. Thank you.

466
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,570
How much is this?

467
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:01,980
Okay.

468
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,070
Over there.

469
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,350
What do you think?

470
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,440
It's a little complicated.

471
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,600
It's either good

472
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,450
or bad.

473
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,720
What is so complicated?

474
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,320
It's too different from what I expected just now.

475
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,590
Don't ask for trouble.

476
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,420
Mum.

477
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,400
Someone's over there.

478
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:32,830
Who? Where?

479
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:33,980
There. That one.

480
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,460
The one next door.

481
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,770
It seems she's looking at me.

482
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,010
No one's there.

483
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:43,790
There she is.

484
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,900
Don't be silly.

485
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,460
Go inside.

486
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,130
You didn't see her?

487
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,290
No, I didn't.

488
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,190
Oh no.

489
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,460
You bought a house

490
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,440
where an old woman died next door and couldn't rest in peace.

491
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,120
And it cost you so much money.

492
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,030
Who couldn't rest in peace?

493
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,210
I'm sorry.

494
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,110
I was just kidding with my son.

495
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,100
Greet her.

503
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,260

504

Sometimes she can, sometimes she can't.

Hello, Granny Zeng Jiang.

00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,430
I was just joking.

508
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,570
How can you say she couldn't rest in peace?

509
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,830
That's what everyone would think in that situation.

510
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,000

516
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,450
With an ink brush, of course.

517
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,190
What else can I use?

518
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,240
It's used.

519
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,500
I washed it.

520
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,660

521
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,560
I'll write one for him too.

No.

He'll get poisoned.

524

Eat up.

525
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,240
It's very auspicious. Hurry up.

526

how to deal with your belongings,

529
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,100
so I didn't throw away anything.

530
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,570
I put them in the box

531
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,260
and brought them here.

532
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,070

535
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,300
You didn't check my belongings, did you?

536
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,350
No, I didn't.

537
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,910
I kept my eyes closed.

538
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,870

No, I won't.

What do you mean?

543
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,740
Go back and finish high school.

544
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,040
It doesn't matter if I don't.

545
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,680
It's just a graduation certificate.

to get your graduation certificate?

548
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,910
I don't want you

549
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,260
to lose any life experience because of that.

00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,520
