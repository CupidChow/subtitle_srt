1
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:11,010
So, do you like him or what?

2
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:13,758
Not to the point of liking him yet. I just want to get to know him better.

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,100
Do you think Fah knows it’s you?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,945
If it were the real Typhoon, he wouldn’t even be able to talk to P'Fah.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,555
You’re afraid of losing P'Fah.

6
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,874
But aren’t you afraid P'Fah might fall for someone else?

7
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:26,582
Of course I am.

8
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:30,122
What’s wrong with you, Fah? You usually accept things from anyone, don’t you?

9
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:32,274
Because there’s already someone in his heart now.

10
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,197
How could he casually accept things from others?

11
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:35,878
Happy birthday.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,924
Thank you.

13
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:22,016
- Good morning, Doctor Fah.
- Good morning.

14
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:23,761
Here you go.

15
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,997
Here you are.

16
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,019
Happy birthday.

17
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:41,357
You must have received plenty of birthday wishes already.

18
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:44,392
But please allow me to be one more person praying for you.

19
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:45,914
Whether it’s your studies,

20
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:47,318
or your work,

21
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:48,874
you’re already amazing.

22
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,648
I hope you get some time to rest as well.

23
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,188
And be very happy.

24
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:57,758
Because your smile is one of the wonders of this world.

25
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,602
I bought a Polaroid camera as your birthday present.

26
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,611
If it’s not too much trouble,

27
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,842
I’d like to invite you to take photos together.

28
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,801
So we can share photos from our everyday lives.

29
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:11,000
But if it’s inconvenient, that’s totally fine.

30
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:13,687
Just accepting it

31
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,374
already makes me very happy.

32
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:30,117
So, how was it?

33
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,395
Mm.

34
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:33,872
I think it’s the same person.

35
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:40,419
I think I’ve found the person from the letters.

36
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,900
No.

37
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,905
He came to me himself.

38
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,811
Don’t you recognize his handwriting?

39
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:52,860
Phoon’s handwriting didn’t look like this before.
Or did he change it on purpose so I wouldn’t recognize it?

40
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:54,962
But after writing for a while, he must’ve gotten used to it.

41
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:57,222
So when he wrote the birthday card, he slipped up.

42
00:03:58,591 --> 00:03:59,804
What do you think about him?

43
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:06,282
I used to think of Phoon as nothing more than a younger brother.

44
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:09,481
A kid next door I wanted to take the best care of.

45
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,691
But you know he’s never seen you as just a brother.

46
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:14,376
I know.

47
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,312
And I’m sure Phoon knows it too.

48
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:20,337
But after all this happened,

49
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:22,391
it feels like I’ve gotten to know another side of Phoon.

50
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:25,632
A side that’s not just the little brother he’s always been.

51
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,752
So how do you feel about him now?

52
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:31,490
I like the person from the letters.

53
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,487
If that person is Phoon,

54
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,525
then I guess I like Phoon.

55
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:39,691
That’s really all there is to it.

56
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:41,368
Aren’t you mad at him?

57
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:42,985
For not being honest with you?

58
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,577
I—

59
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,911
I’m actually happy.

60
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:48,014
That it’s Phoon.

61
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:50,074
So what are you going to do now?

62
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:54,330
Are you just going to stay the same and wait for him to confess?

63
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:57,893
I—

64
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,425
I used to think I was patient enough to wait.

65
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,050
But now I’m not so sure anymore.

66
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,494
Why is P'Fah so kind?

67
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:14,220
He even remembered.

68
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:15,914
That I’m afraid of the dark.

69
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:21,120
Are you sure you can still tutor like this? You’re really not okay.

70
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,309
I honestly don’t know how I should act.

71
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:26,014
Just act normal.

72
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:28,933
Smile, stay calm, and be normal.

73
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:30,488
Nothing should happen. You can do it.

74
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,992
Stay strong. You’ll get through this. Trust me.

75
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:39,094
- Easter.
- Yes.

76
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:41,906
Shall we go now?

77
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:44,542
Yes, let’s go.

78
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,300
What about Phoon?

79
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:48,460
Are you coming with us?

80
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:52,364
Oh, you guys go ahead. I need to take care of something first.

81
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:56,524
Phoon, where’s the pen you borrowed from me?

82
00:05:56,952 --> 00:05:58,659
The pen I borrowed? Oh, I’ll find it.

83
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:00,773
- Found it.
- Okay.

84
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,921
See you. Bye.

85
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:06,093
- Want this too?
- Just take it.

86
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:07,062
Let’s go.

87
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:09,749
Aren’t we fighting over food now?

88
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,739
P’Gib, here you go.

89
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:16,934
Okay.

90
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:20,958
Hey, don’t go yet.

91
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:24,459
Doctor Fah asked me to make cocoa for someone special.

92
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:25,891
Wait a moment. I’ll make it for you.

93
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,122
Oh, okay.

94
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,967
So?

95
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:33,254
How’s your relationship going?

96
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,164
- It’s good.
- That’s good.

97
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,623
I’ve seen you two exchanging letters for quite a while.

98
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,185
There’s bound to be some progress.

99
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:42,948
Yes.

100
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:56,122
It’s ready. Cocoa for someone special.

101
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,306
Someone special?

102
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:10,631
Well, Typhoon is a special customer of my cafe.

103
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:14,770
I just came to pick something up.

104
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:18,880
- Did he bring it today yet?
- Oh, yeah. He already did.

105
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,976
You’re here at an unusual time today, Fah.

106
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,099
I usually see you in the morning.

107
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:28,518
I just happened to be free.

108
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:33,168
And…

109
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,472
Have you treated him to cocoa yet?

110
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,093
Uh—

111
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,650
Of course I have. I wouldn’t forget.

112
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,688
Phoon’s tutoring with friends at the café today, right?

113
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,309
Oh, yes.

114
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,229
Go with me then.

115
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,925
Okay.

116
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,927
Let’s go.

117
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:14,497
Phoon.

118
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:17,222
Yes?

119
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:18,841
How have you been?

120
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:21,280
I’ve been well.

121
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:23,180
What about you, P'Fah?

122
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,680
I’m doing well too.

123
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,226
If there’s anything at all,

124
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:28,693
you can always tell me.

125
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,656
I didn’t pass the medical school exam.

126
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:38,586
I’m sorry.

127
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:40,594
Why are you apologizing?

128
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:43,171
I mean, you worked so hard tutoring me.

129
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,383
Are you okay?

130
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,906
At first, I was a little disappointed.

131
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:55,097
But now I think maybe this outcome is for the best.

132
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:56,720
Why is that?

133
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,133
I think I’ll take the entrance exam for a faculty I actually like.

134
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:07,990
I just made an important decision in my life, even though I can’t say what it is.

135
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,462
But thinking about you gave me more courage.

136
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:15,417
That’s amazing.

137
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,545
Thank you.

138
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:47,333
Thank you for stepping in to help yesterday.

139
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:50,320
You already thanked me yesterday.

140
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,294
P'Fah…

141
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,634
You even remembered.

142
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:55,863
That I’m afraid of thunder.

143
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,995
And afraid of the dark.

144
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,903
Of course I remembered.

145
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,314
When the power went out,

146
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:06,007
the first thing I thought was, “What about Phoon?”

147
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:07,437
"Where is Phoon?"

148
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:09,482
When I realized you’d gone to the restroom,

149
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,053
I went looking for you right away.

150
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:12,546
P'Fah…

151
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:15,094
Over the past year,

152
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,915
I’ve grown up so much.

153
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,216
I know.

154
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:22,933
You’ve done really well.

155
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,856
Aren’t you going to ask me?

156
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:27,568
About why, back then, I…

157
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,114
Do you want to tell me?

158
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:36,222
If not, you don’t have to.

159
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:37,792
I believe that

160
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:39,939
you must have had your reasons.

161
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,042
Whenever you’re ready,

162
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:42,312
you can tell me then.

163
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:45,096
I'm…

164
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,165
I'm afraid that you're still angry.

165
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:53,136
I’m not angry at you.

166
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:55,765
Don’t overthink it.

167
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:07,669
The shirt is really nice, but it’s too loose. I can’t wear it.

168
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:12,770
What is it?

169
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:15,463
I was just thinking…

170
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:28,882
You really are tiny.

171
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,155
With P'Fah, it’s probably…

172
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:45,785
- Back to how it used to be.
- Like before?

173
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:49,180
I mean, yesterday, P'Fah…

174
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:51,600
patted my head and said,

175
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:53,825
“You’re really tiny.”

176
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:57,401
Wait, isn’t “tiny” just a polite way of saying “short”?

177
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:00,857
North, why are you killing the mood?

178
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:04,613
He meant it affectionately, idiot.
Seriously.

179
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:08,585
Anyway, let’s focus on the “head pat” part.

180
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:09,795
What about it?

181
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,151
Hey.

182
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,510
Why are you making that face?

183
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:20,752
I lied to P'Fah about Fun.

184
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:24,915
If he finds out, he’ll definitely be mad.

185
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:26,426
So you’re going to tell him

186
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:29,551
About P'Fun?

187
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:33,075
I just don’t want to lie anymore.

188
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:37,080
I think that’s good. When you go talk to him,

189
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,502
you can apologize to him again.

190
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:40,918
I think it’ll be fine.

191
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,075
You’re sincere, after all.

192
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:45,032
I guess that’s what I’ll do.

193
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,631
Hey, guys.

194
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:51,130
Today,

195
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,690
let’s go reading.

196
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:54,727
Dao, come with us.

197
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:57,872
No, I’ve got work to do.

198
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:03,110
- I was broke too, and I’m not even taking jobs like that.
- Not working? You used to.

199
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,288
Sure. You just happened to meet P'Jo. Lucky you, that’s all.

200
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,752
Yeah, yeah. It’s your head that’s messed up right now.

201
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,109
Here.

202
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:18,161
I’m still choosing.

203
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,248
What does that have to do with you?

204
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:22,592
Hey, let me see too.

205
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:26,140
North, don’t push. Move.

206
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:28,054
Let me see. Why are you so stingy?

207
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:31,488
Whoa.

208
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,167
Is that a picture of the sun?

209
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:34,882
This is—

210
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:39,071
Isn’t this Phoon’s sky?

211
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:42,648
– North, stop. You’re going overboard.
– Why are you stopping me?

212
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:44,037
Look at how you’re acting.

213
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,231
– Let’s hurry up and eat before P’Fah sees.
– Yeah, hurry up.

214
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:50,180
Eat fast. P’Fah’s coming.

215
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,682
More? Here, take it.

216
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,364
Finish everything.

217
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:55,964
All of it.

218
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,085
– You started it.
– I’m not a dog.

219
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:07,325
– Bye, P’Gib! Bye!
– Bye!

220
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:09,484
I’ll come get a new coupon tomorrow.

221
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:11,931
My cafe’s coupons are almost gone.

222
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:27,340
Fah.

223
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,940
You’ve been coming in the evening for two days now.

224
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:33,171
Were you waiting on purpose?

225
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:34,509
No.

226
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:36,392
I wanted him to leave first.

227
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,722
So we wouldn’t run into each other.

228
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:39,613
Okay, wait a moment.

229
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,503
Okay.

230
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:45,466
Here you go.

231
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,890
Why didn’t you come in the morning like usual?

232
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:50,700
I was going to pick someone up on the way.

233
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:53,653
It’s nothing. I’ll go now.

234
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,349
Pick someone up?

235
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:02,826
Want some?

236
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,290
P’Hill, do you want some?

237
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,053
Hey, Fah. What should we eat this evening?

238
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:23,451
No idea.

239
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,550
You guys aren’t helping at all.

240
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,493
Go ask your wife.

241
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,902
I just saw him wandering around here.

242
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:33,625
He went to the bathroom.

243
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:39,700
North probably spoils Ter.

244
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:41,217
Me?

245
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:42,417
Ugh.

246
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,060
I don’t want to fight with North.

247
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,401
Then sushi is fine.

248
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:51,208
– Which place?
– The one in front of the campus?

249
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:53,994
It just opened. The reviews say it’s really good.

250
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:55,537
Sounds good. Let’s go.

251
00:15:56,244 --> 00:15:58,448
You guys go ahead. I’ll wait for North.

252
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:02,177
Phoon, come with us.

253
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:04,789
You can go with me.

254
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:12,475
Then I’ll go with P’Fah.

255
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:15,007
Sure. See you at the restaurant.

256
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:17,211
Hurry up.

257
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:19,669
Let’s go. See you.

258
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:21,074
– I’ll carry it for you.
– See you at the restaurant.

259
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,672
Oh, thank you.

260
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:25,469
Just go.

261
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:27,484
– Want some?
– No.

262
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:43,284
Thank you.

263
00:16:56,897 --> 00:16:59,342
Phoon, could you grab the blue paper bag for me?

264
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:12,690
Uh…

265
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:16,598
Could you take the stuff inside out?

266
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:23,348
What’s inside?

267
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:31,120
Photos.

268
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:34,368
A letter and some snacks.

269
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:37,429
What kind of photos?

270
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,285
Flowers.

271
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:44,315
Could you read the letter to me?

272
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,485
Uh… is that okay?

273
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:48,539
Yes.

274
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:52,635
I want to know what it says, but I’m driving.

275
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,862
Could you read it for me?

276
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:10,893
The flowers I’ve been taking care of for months have finally bloomed.

277
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:12,688
They’re really beautiful.

278
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:16,220
I couldn’t help but take photos to share with you.

279
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:20,005
If you’re interested in growing some,

280
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,291
I’d be happy to recommend how.

281
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:29,367
Final exams are coming up, so you must be studying hard.

282
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:31,573
I am too.

283
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:35,454
Hang in there.

284
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,734
Let’s get through finals together.

285
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:44,364
Is that all?

286
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,257
Uh, P’Fah.

287
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,337
Weren’t we supposed to eat sushi with the others?

288
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:20,811
This place is good.

289
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:22,562
I wanted you to try it.

290
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:25,780
Oh.

291
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:31,782
Okay.

292
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:48,992
Here.

293
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,632
P’Fah.

294
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:04,191
Yes?

295
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:08,207
If I start over as a first-year student,

296
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:09,832
would it be a waste of time?

297
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:15,934
No.

298
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:18,425
If it means getting to know yourself better,

299
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,120
and knowing what you truly want to study.

300
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:21,637
What do you like.

301
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:24,235
No matter what it is, I think it’s worth it.

302
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:29,234
So then—

303
00:20:29,524 --> 00:20:30,915
what faculty are you planning to transfer to?

304
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:32,090
Have you decided yet?

305
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:34,703
I want to study photography.

306
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,282
That’s good.

307
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:38,632
You like it, after all.

308
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:42,300
By the way—

309
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,185
that faculty—

310
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,942
doesn’t it require Arts–Language Program scores?

311
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,567
Have you been preparing for a long time?

312
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:51,045
Well—

313
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:52,552
I just started studying.

314
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:53,825
But—

315
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,998
I’m afraid I won’t remember everything in time.

316
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:06,746
Phoon…

317
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:10,385
Do you want me to tutor you?

318
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:14,290
Would that really be okay?

319
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:17,807
Of course.

320
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:21,611
But this time—

321
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:24,223
I’m not letting you run away anywhere.

322
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:30,841
In that case—

323
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:32,324
I’ll be in your care, then.

324
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,477
Sure.

325
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:41,734
Thank you.

326
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,349
About—

327
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,431
the letters—

328
00:21:58,961 --> 00:21:59,700
yes?

329
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,362
You can ask. Why?

330
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,232
Whose are they?

331
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:17,850
I don’t know.

332
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,862
You’ve been talking, but you don’t even know who he is?

333
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:26,968
That’s right.

334
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:29,740
I barely know anything about him.

335
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,922
He didn’t tell you anything about himself?

336
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:35,437
No.

337
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,481
I asked, but he wouldn’t say.

338
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:39,377
That’s too bad.

339
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,186
But it’s okay, really.

340
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:43,902
If he’s comfortable—

341
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:46,228
I'm okay with everything.

342
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:50,724
And—

343
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:53,118
how long have you been talking?

344
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:55,743
About—

345
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:57,355
two months now.

346
00:22:58,992 --> 00:22:59,746
Well—

347
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,167
that’s quite a while.

348
00:23:05,623 --> 00:23:06,896
Actually,

349
00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:08,973
I want to keep talking longer.

350
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:21,251
That’s nice.

351
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:22,208
Hmm?

352
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:23,819
What’s nice?

353
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:26,084
Oh—

354
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:27,586
I mean—

355
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:29,782
the person who—

356
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,545
writes the letters.

357
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,072
He’s kind of cute.

358
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:34,397
But—

359
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,368
these days, not many people—

360
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:38,995
write letters to talk anymore.

361
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:40,053
Mm.

362
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:44,404
But it does have its downsides.

363
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,459
When you want to meet—

364
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:48,579
you can’t.

365
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:50,982
When you want to hear his voice—

366
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:52,429
you can’t.

367
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:55,352
And another thing—

368
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:57,915
if one day he disappears—

369
00:23:58,317 --> 00:23:59,182
I—

370
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:01,210
wouldn’t know what to do.

371
00:24:06,365 --> 00:24:07,696
If he really disappeared—

372
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:10,208
he’d be pretty heartless, wouldn’t he?

373
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:15,697
Heartless?

374
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:19,160
Of course.

375
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:21,420
After making someone like him this much—

376
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:22,942
and then just disappearing.

377
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:24,890
If that’s not heartless—

378
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:26,254
what would you call it?

379
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:29,939
People should learn to take responsibility for other feelings.

380
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:33,198
Right?

381
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:32,765
Fun.

382
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:35,208
I'm really happy to have today.

383
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:39,967
I once thought my life would have no meaning anymore—

384
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,494
when Fun wasn’t by my side.

385
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:44,088
But in the end—

386
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,727
I got to meet everyone.

387
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:47,733
I learned so many things.

388
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:50,380
And that’s how I realized that being alive—

389
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,019
is already the best thing.

390
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:55,530
I once thought the rain would never stop.

391
00:25:56,506 --> 00:25:58,194
But when it finally did—

392
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,857
the sky was truly beautiful.

393
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:03,330
It was worth the wait.

394
00:26:05,362 --> 00:26:07,075
Waiting for a brighter sky.

395
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,168
The point is—you know P'Fah likes him,

396
00:26:34,502 --> 00:26:36,091
but the guy from the letters doesn’t know yet.

397
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:39,100
So what are you gonna do?

398
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:41,370
Keep sending letters like this?

399
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:42,988
I think that’s the only way, yeah.

400
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,185
We’ve come this far already.

401
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:48,586
And P'Fah even told you he likes him already.

402
00:26:52,214 --> 00:26:55,597
I’m so happy the letter plan worked out for Maew.

403
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:56,832
Worked out?

404
00:26:58,885 --> 00:26:59,712
Me, really?

405
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:03,708
Maew, we’re already this far—have some confidence in yourself.

406
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:10,068
- You’re basically about to ask him to be your boyfriend already. Hey, why’d you hit me?
- He's shy.

407
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:12,188
Wow, you’re really blushing hard.

408
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:14,500
Caught you.

409
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:17,173
But seriously, P'Fah is no joke.

410
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:18,841
He’s pretty clear about it too.

411
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:22,213
Hey, guys.

412
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:23,822
I’ve got something to tell you.

413
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:24,711
Hmm?

414
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:35,577
- I’m going to drop out.
- What? You’ve got kidney stones?

415
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:36,685
Drop out.

416
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,400
Seriously, you’re never serious at the right time.

417
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,183
I thought you said kidney stones.

418
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,545
You’re really dropping out?

419
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:43,933
Yeah.

420
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:46,642
I already applied for the photography exam.

421
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:51,438
So it’ll just be me and Foam left together.

422
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:54,065
If it’s just you two, don’t fight, okay?

423
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:58,345
- Yeah.
- But I’m kinda sad.

424
00:27:59,072 --> 00:28:00,881
I won’t be with you guys anymore.

425
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:06,737
Come on, you’re being dramatic.

426
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:08,478
We’ll still see each other anyway, right?

427
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:10,198
- Yeah.
- True.

428
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:13,782
We’re really happy for you, Maew.

429
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:16,082
That you finally chose your own path.

430
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:23,112
Won’t your dad say anything about it?

431
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,696
Especially now that you’re talking to p"Fah again.

432
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:29,518
Whatever happens, happens.

433
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:32,296
Well…

434
00:28:32,817 --> 00:28:34,730
If my dad won’t pay for me to study photography,

435
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:39,379
I’ll just do freelance photography or something.

436
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:43,665
I never wanted to rely on him forever anyway.

437
00:28:46,457 --> 00:28:47,973
It’s okay. You’ve got us.

438
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:49,657
Don’t pressure yourself too much.

439
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:53,005
You’re already amazing for deciding this much.

440
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:57,040
Yeah, I think I’m pretty amazing too.

441
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:59,214
Both for being born

442
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:00,740
and for everything about Fun.

443
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:06,958
For every time my dad blamed me, even when I did nothing wrong.

444
00:29:09,128 --> 00:29:12,604
I used to think that if one day I lost my mom and Fun,

445
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,551
I wouldn’t want to lose my dad too.

446
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:18,131
Until I started losing myself.

447
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,635
Damn, that’s handsome.

448
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,271
Hey.

449
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,481
Daotok, wanna go eat?

450
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:45,602
Nah, I’m going back to my room to work.

451
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,020
Look at him.

452
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:47,936
Wow.

453
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,303
Always ditching his friends.

454
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:52,902
Do you know how lonely we are?

455
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,349
- For real.
- I see you two eating with your boyfriends every day.

456
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,869
When do you even have time to be lonely?

457
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,657
Wow, you really can talk.

458
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:06,579
I know it—you secretly went to eat together, just the two of you and P'Fah, right?

459
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:07,921
Yeah.

460
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,703
That day I ordered tons of sushi. So what, you made me to eat everything.

461
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:13,259
True. He must paid for that.

462
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,136
So now that Typhoon and P'Fah are good again,

463
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:23,371
how’s the situation with the letter person?

464
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:26,552
- Answer me.
- It’s going okay.

465
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,536
Caught you.

466
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:30,337
What does “going okay” mean?

467
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:38,085
Are you really not going to tell P'Fah?

468
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:44,051
I’m scared that if I tell him, P'Fah will be disappointed.

469
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:44,893
Hey.

470
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:46,219
No way.

471
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:47,807
You never know though, right?

472
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:50,598
I don’t think P'Fah would be disappointed.

473
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:53,822
P'Fah really seems to like the person in the letters, Phoon.

474
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:55,208
Yeah.

475
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:56,517
I think so too.

476
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:59,699
Thanks. I feel better now. I trust Dao.

477
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,245
Hey, I said the same thing.

478
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:03,925
- Why don’t you trust me?
- Huh?

479
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:06,605
What the hell, let’s go.

480
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:08,641
You never believe anything I say.

481
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:10,063
What are you even saying?

482
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:04,395
Would it be possible if I wanted to see you just once?

483
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:22,853
Do you think Phoon will come see you?

484
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:25,122
He will.

485
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:26,768
Why are you so confident about that?

486
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:31,736
What kind of plan do you have?

487
00:33:39,188 --> 00:33:40,477
About the letters…

488
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,629
Actually, I have something I'm not sure about too.

489
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:46,625
What is it?

490
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:52,508
I'm not sure if that person really likes me or not.

491
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:56,324
If they didn’t like you, why would they write you letters?

492
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:57,875
I don’t know.

493
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,075
- Maybe they’re writing to several people.
- No way.

494
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:02,685
How do you know, Phoon?

495
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,056
Just a guess.

496
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:14,242
Then that means they like me, right?

497
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:15,171
Yeah.

498
00:34:20,948 --> 00:34:22,096
Only me, right?

499
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:26,983
Yeah.

500
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:31,902
So that means he’ll love only me, right?

501
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:39,614
What do you say?

502
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,260
Yes. I'm sure he’ll love P'Fah and only P'Fah.

503
00:34:45,546 --> 00:34:46,186
Oh.

504
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:57,502
Was it fun teasing him?

505
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:00,213
He was kind of cute getting teased.

506
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:02,608
Look at your friend.

507
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:05,771
But when you really think about it,

508
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:07,749
North and Ter aren’t bad at all.

509
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:09,297
They’ve totally got their friend’s back.

510
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:10,847
Even if it’s not very smooth.

511
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:14,842
So what do you think we should do?

512
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:19,213
I think Ter will already go along with Phoon anyway.

513
00:35:20,337 --> 00:35:21,651
He’ll probably talk him into it.

514
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:24,480
But as for North,

515
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:26,180
he’ll likely be the one pushing him to come.

516
00:35:31,002 --> 00:35:33,810
I think that’s exactly why I’m confident Phoon will come—because of North.

517
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:36,518
Hey, you should thank me.

518
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:38,442
My wife’s doing this much for you, you know.

519
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:42,471
- Ok.
- Your boyfriend does something nice and you take all the credit.

520
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:43,520
Of course I do.

521
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:57,096
What are you guys talking about?

522
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:00,253
You’re loud as hell.

523
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:11,082
And what’s wrong with you? Why do you look like Jo?

524
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,952
How does he looks like me?

525
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:17,908
You always smirk when you’ve got some evil plan, like—

526
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:21,543
like “damn, I’m handsome” or something.

527
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,437
Which—

528
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:29,414
you actually are handsome, Jo.

529
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:32,580
I mean,

530
00:36:33,386 --> 00:36:36,645
in this whole world, you’re the only one I’ll admit I’m second to.

531
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:39,222
Everyone else, I think I’m better-looking.

532
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:41,121
Nice save.

533
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,865
Isn’t it sticking out a bit?

534
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:48,235
You look like a teenage mom.

535
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:49,512
Tuck your stomach in a little.

536
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,053
This right here is the ultimate level.

537
00:36:54,554 --> 00:36:56,930
Seriously, what are you guys doing?

538
00:36:57,404 --> 00:36:58,152
Disguised him

539
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:01,303
I know it’s a disguise, but what are you doing it for?

540
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:02,948
Just talk to him directly.

541
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,949
Maew doesn’t dare face him directly, North.

542
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,991
So you’re really going to disguise yourselves like this?

543
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:11,168
- Yeah.
- You think P'Fah won’t notice?

544
00:37:12,957 --> 00:37:14,620
Hey, look at this.

545
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:15,891
This.

546
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:17,382
What do you think?

547
00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:20,602
If you ran into him on the street, you wouldn’t recognize him.

548
00:37:20,752 --> 00:37:22,602
You wouldn’t recognize him? idiot. Just look at him.

549
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:25,422
Damn it, North. If you can’t recognize him, don’t act like you’re so smart.

550
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:28,171
You’re not helping, and now you’re getting in the way. Seriously.

551
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:31,882
Alright, alright. Don’t fight. Stop it.

552
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:33,976
So, does this outfit pass?

553
00:37:35,328 --> 00:37:36,477
Mm, it passes.

554
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:37,989
I think it passes too.

555
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:40,136
But I think you should take it off. It’s hot.

556
00:37:40,211 --> 00:37:40,840
Yeah.

557
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,685
Okay?

558
00:37:41,912 --> 00:37:43,100
You’ll pass out on the actual day.

559
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:45,702
Ow, ow.

560
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:47,933
I think I can handle it.

561
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,302
You’re already panting just standing in the room.

562
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:56,677
But P'Fah recognizes Maew’s voice.
So does that mean you guys can’t talk at all?

563
00:37:58,888 --> 00:37:59,853
Then what if—

564
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:01,317
I write it in a notebook?

565
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:03,334
Sure.

566
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,442
I don’t think he’d mind that much.

567
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:12,746
So have you written back yet, about agreeing to meet?

568
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:16,431
Not yet.

569
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:18,290
I don’t know what to say.

570
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:23,850
Just say you’ll meet him, but with conditions.

571
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:25,311
But right now,

572
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,011
I think P'Fah is already head over heels for you.

573
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,204
Whatever you ask, he’ll probably agree to it all.

574
00:38:33,026 --> 00:38:34,835
Caught you.

575
00:38:36,823 --> 00:38:37,708
North.

576
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,622
Me again.

577
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:47,299
Thank you for wanting to meet me.

578
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,642
I want to meet you too.

579
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:51,899
It might seem a bit complicated,

580
00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:54,145
but I have a few conditions.

581
00:39:08,731 --> 00:39:09,965
Is it this place?

582
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,091
Hey, why are you so tense?

583
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:18,245
Let’s go.

584
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:23,851
One.

585
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:26,860
I’ll be wearing something rather unusual when I meet you.

586
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,946
Please don’t mind it.

587
00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:56,628
Two.

588
00:39:57,459 --> 00:40:00,059
I don’t want you to try to find out who I am.

589
00:40:07,434 --> 00:40:08,794
Thank you for coming to meet me.

590
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,845
Three. If you happen to find out

591
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:16,078
who I am,

592
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:18,844
please pretend you don’t know.

593
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:25,425
I have so many things I want to tell you.

594
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:32,925
I really feel at ease.

595
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,717
You’re my safe zone.

596
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:41,182
Is that okay?

597
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:43,820
Can you be my safe zone?

598
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:58,757
I can be anything.

599
00:40:59,454 --> 00:41:00,490
That’s so sweet.

600
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:02,946
Why are you being this kind to me?

601
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:14,085
Because you’re important to me.

602
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:18,179
I really wanted to hear you say that.

603
00:41:27,383 --> 00:41:29,601
You’re important to me.

604
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,275
You’re not ready yet, are you?

605
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:44,137
I’m sorry.

606
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:45,688
It’s okay.

607
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:47,976
For now,

608
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:49,574
this is enough.

609
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,000
Has anyone ever told you

610
00:41:56,468 --> 00:41:57,637
that you’re really cute?

611
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,333
Where have you been all this time?

612
00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:20,001
There’s something I want to ask you.

613
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:27,731
Yes?

614
00:42:28,915 --> 00:42:30,617
I once wrote in my letter that

615
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:32,200
the name Tonfah comes from

616
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:34,117
my father wanting me to be the sky,

617
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,299
and my mother wanting me to be a tree.

618
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:37,605
What about you?

619
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,228
What do you want me to be?

620
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:49,330
Love.

621
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:07,029
Why did you want to meet me?

622
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:13,822
I just wanted to know how I’d feel if I met you.

623
00:43:14,377 --> 00:43:15,682
And then I realized

624
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:17,475
it feels really good.

625
00:43:19,773 --> 00:43:21,185
I want to see you often.

626
00:43:22,737 --> 00:43:23,718
What about you?

627
00:43:24,721 --> 00:43:26,600
Why did you decide to come meet me?

628
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:34,420
Because you said you wanted to see me.

629
00:43:38,044 --> 00:43:38,930
Why?

630
00:43:39,595 --> 00:43:42,088
Even though you chose to hide your identity this much.

631
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:52,983
I don’t really know. You just said you wanted to meet me,

632
00:43:53,271 --> 00:43:54,760
so I wanted to come see you.

633
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,675
May I hold your hand?

634
00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:14,762
You’re love to me too.

635
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,552
What’s wrong?

636
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,995
You don’t like it? I’m sorry.

637
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,223
Do you want to wipe your tears first? I’ll close my eyes, okay?

638
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:00,296
Have you stopped crying?

639
00:45:18,545 --> 00:45:19,506
It’s okay.

640
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:06,869
Wait.

641
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,514
I really like your soft lips

642
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,232
when I kiss you.

643
00:47:05,462 --> 00:47:07,631
Anyway, your first time meeting—

644
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,571
Don’t say it.

645
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:12,278
It’s been so long since we last met, P'Fah.

646
00:47:12,714 --> 00:47:14,813
Didn’t we just see each other yesterday?

647
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:18,096
Are you free tonight?

648
00:47:18,471 --> 00:47:20,045
I’ll tutor you.

649
00:47:20,746 --> 00:47:22,515
The chance is here. Go for it.

650
00:47:22,992 --> 00:47:24,225
P'Fah is kind to everyone.

651
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:27,894
He might really like the person from the letters.

652
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:31,048
You might be wondering why I kissed you.

653
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:35,023
The answer is—
