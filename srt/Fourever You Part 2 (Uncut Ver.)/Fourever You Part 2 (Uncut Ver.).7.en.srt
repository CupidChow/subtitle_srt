1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,423
P'Fah’s pretty good at this too, huh.

2
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,571
Today, I actually met him.

3
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:19,880
Who was it?

4
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:21,531
The person from the letter.

5
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:25,985
Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:27,896
The one from the letter.

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,768
Nice to love you.

8
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:33,060
Dad, Mom.

9
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:34,411
We are dating.

10
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:36,198
It feels impossible.

11
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:38,028
But today, I got my answer.

12
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,250
I’m here to submit my resignation documents.

13
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:19,810
So how did it go? Was everything settled?

14
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,568
I thought you would burst into tears.

15
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:27,915
I'm grown up now.

16
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:29,808
Maybe it’s because

17
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:31,807
there’s something I like waiting ahead.

18
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,727
And if I submit my scores and get accepted here again,

19
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:35,308
I’ll get to see my friends,

20
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:36,906
and also

21
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:38,894
stay with you.

22
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:40,882
That already makes me happy enough.

23
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:44,232
You really have grown up.

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,351
Then should we head back now?

25
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:53,320
Oh right, I should tell those two first.

26
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:59,570
I submitted my resignation today.

27
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,760
I won’t let you leave.

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,753
Don’t be clingy. You don’t have to miss me too much,
because I’m submitting my portfolio here anyway.

29
00:02:08,286 --> 00:02:10,313
Then you should call me your senior.

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,460
I order you, junior Phoon—ten push-ups! Execute!

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,126
Yeah, when the semester starts, you’ll definitely see me.

32
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:20,816
Phoon, do you want to stop anywhere?

33
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:24,565
Can we stop by the dorm first? I want to get my clothes.

34
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:30,035
Phoon, would you like to move in with me?

35
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,005
You mean your condo?

36
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,188
Yes.

37
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:42,810
Please. Even staying with you for a short while makes me really happy.

38
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:44,834
If we could stay together all the time, it would be amazing.

39
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:46,666
Please.

40
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,366
You won’t get bored of me, right?

41
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:54,802
No way. That way, you won’t have to go back and forth between our rooms anymore.

42
00:02:58,798 --> 00:03:00,005
Then P'Fah has to help me move.

43
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:04,684
I helped you move in—why wouldn’t I help you move out?

44
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:20,105
Looks like there are way more cameras than when you moved in.

45
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,318
P'Fah.

46
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,057
Yes?

47
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,240
About Fun…

48
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:33,589
I didn’t tell Uncle and Auntie directly,

49
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:36,362
so I don’t really feel at ease.

50
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:42,370
Don’t overthink it.

51
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,934
I believe my parents will understand.

52
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:54,728
Let’s go back and tell Dad and Mom together later.

53
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:09,577
So this is the gift you think your mom sent you?

54
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:11,860
What does it say inside?

55
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,450
“To: Ren.”

56
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:18,318
Let me guess—Ren is your old name?

57
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,499
Who sent it?

58
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,631
Your mom?

59
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:24,882
I wish it were.

60
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,857
If you think your mom sent it, do you want to see her?

61
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:31,112
I do.

62
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:36,293
Why, can it transform or something?

63
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,376
A limited-edition robot.

64
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,902
Produced in early 2008 in Japan.

65
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:45,722
Whoa, how do you know that?

66
00:04:46,157 --> 00:04:47,139
I used to collect them.

67
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,400
I think that’s it.

68
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,717
The name’s Ren.

69
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,814
Sounds Japanese. Or is your mom Japanese?

70
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,361
P'Fah.

71
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,085
You said you’d take me anywhere I want to go.

72
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,520
Now I know where I want to go.

73
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:02,330
P'Fah, can we head back now?

74
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:06,053
Why? You just got here.

75
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:10,023
I didn’t think it would be this cold.

76
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,666
How is it?

77
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:26,444
Is it warmer?

78
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:35,645
Come on.

79
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:37,297
Let’s go.

80
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:55,543
P'Fah.

81
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:28,509
Careful, little one.

82
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:30,678
Slow down, little one.

83
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:33,274
P'Fah, look over here. It’s so beautiful.

84
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,770
It really is.

85
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:37,191
Thank you.

86
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:44,570
You look like one of those wobble dolls.

87
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,651
P'Fah, want a photo? I’ll take it for you.

88
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:05,786
Right here.

89
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,401
Thank you.

90
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:54,028
Let's eat...right?

91
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:55,573
Yes.

92
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,845
Phoon.

93
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:16,152
Then let P'Fah take one of you this time.

94
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:25,491
But I think

95
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,327
it still feels like something’s missing.

96
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:30,367
What is it?

97
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,801
Like, for example…

98
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:37,696
Something like this.

99
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,305
Mom’s calling.

100
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:45,897
Hi, Mom.

101
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,992
- How was it, kids? Did you have fun on the trip?
- I did.

102
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:51,619
What about you, Fah?

103
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:55,014
If Phoon had fun, then I did too.

104
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:58,499
That’s good then. Mom and Dad won’t bother you anymore.

105
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:00,488
Yes, Mom. See you later.

106
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:01,610
Goodbye.

107
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:08,543
Phoon.

108
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,075
About your mom—

109
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:14,521
Honestly, I’m not really sure either.

110
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:17,780
Whether the things that were sent were really from her.

111
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,823
But still—

112
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,926
Deep down, I hope they were from her.

113
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,650
Coming to Japan, I already knew.

114
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:30,699
That I wouldn’t get to see her.

115
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:37,510
At least, just being able to breathe a little closer to her is enough for me.

116
00:12:37,908 --> 00:12:39,874
That’s true.

117
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:00,374
How is it?

118
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,100
Do you usually like taking photos?

119
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:07,586
I hardly ever even touch a camera.

120
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,562
You don’t like it?

121
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:14,035
Just kidding.

122
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,873
- Really?
- Let’s go take photos over there instead.

123
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,736
Hey, Phoon. Phoon!

124
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:28,675
Help me with something.

125
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,800
What is it?

126
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,241
Help me look for Phoon’s mom.

127
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:35,804
His real mom.

128
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,553
Do you think I’m a private detective or something?

129
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:42,262
Are you going to write this term’s lab report yourself?

130
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,486
Fine, I’m a private detective. I’ll find her for you.

131
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,366
But you have to help me write the report.

132
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:50,522
Yeah, I’ll help.

133
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,422
Deal.

134
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,433
- I’ll hang up now.
- Hey, wait.

135
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,520
It’s—

136
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:09,764
Isn’t it strange?

137
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:12,597
It’s not strange.

138
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:14,705
It’s very cute.

139
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,102
Really?

140
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:24,585
Really.

141
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:29,011
Very cute.

142
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:42,146
Good boy.

143
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:52,687
At first, I thought I’d wait a little longer.

144
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:59,065
But now, I can’t wait anymore.

145
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:26,281
You’re mine, okay?

146
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:47,204
But I have already been yours for a long time, haven’t I?

147
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:51,037
I’ll take that as your answer.

148
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,880
Is that okay?

149
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:09,457
If it’s P'Fah, then I’m okay with anything.

150
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,816
I love you, Phoon.

151
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,486
I love you too.

152
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:51,582
You’re up early, P'Fah.

153
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,154
You’re the one who woke up late.

154
00:17:58,857 --> 00:17:59,764
Really?

155
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,312
Are you okay?

156
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:06,992
Okay about what?

157
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,288
Well—

158
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,247
Last night—

159
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:14,607
I don’t know.

160
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,349
I’m sorry.

161
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,269
Forget it. I won’t say anything.

162
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:25,508
Hey, how can you not say it?

163
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:27,524
I were the one who did it.

164
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:30,697
Next time—

165
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,038
I’ll be gentler, I promise.

166
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,891
Promise.

167
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,108
Are you okay?

168
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,517
Why wouldn’t I be?

169
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:47,242
I was afraid you wouldn’t like it.

170
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:50,259
Oh.

171
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:53,650
Should I prove it to you one more time?

172
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,410
That I do like it?

173
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:14,933
Is it not good?

174
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,088
I don’t want to go back.

175
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,591
But earlier you said you wanted to go home.

176
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:28,205
At first, I wasn’t used to the cold weather,
but now I’m getting used to it.

177
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:33,000
Then if you don’t want to go back yet, should we stay another week?

178
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,345
You need to hurry back to classes.

179
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:40,349
And I need to go back and prepare for exams.

180
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,888
Let’s come back together next time.

181
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:44,608
Really?

182
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:46,903
Everywhere we want to go?

183
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,066
Of course.

184
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:02,657
Phoon.

185
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:05,911
Can I post this photo on Instagram?

186
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,179
There are so many nice photos. Why did you choose this one?

187
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:11,127
Because you look cute in this one.

188
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,743
Okay?

189
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,091
Do you want it?

190
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:41,671
I want to give it to my friends.

191
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:33,992
- Souvenirs from Japan.
- Hey, which one’s mine?

192
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,259
- This one.
- Pink's mine.

193
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:38,678
Pink's yours?
Hey, that’s cute.

194
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:41,400
- Thanks.
- Hey, there’s a cat too.

195
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,811
Thanks, Maew.

196
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:44,823
It’s pretty cute.

197
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:48,922
So how was going to Japan with P'Fah?

198
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:52,268
Super sweet, right?

199
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:54,985
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You’re going to hurt me again, look.

200
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:57,373
- See? You’re blushing.
- I was just curious.

201
00:21:57,414 --> 00:22:00,428
It was fun, honestly. Even if it was only for a short time.

202
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,866
Come on, you can go more often.

203
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:07,725
Yeah, it really does sound fun. I’ve never been to Japan before—I wanna go too.

204
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,977
Then why are you telling us?

205
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:13,192
All you need is one call, and P'Jo will book the ticket for you.

206
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,143
That’s nice.

207
00:22:16,851 --> 00:22:19,487
I just like it when everyone talks about partners.

208
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:23,265
I can really feel how warm the atmosphere is.

209
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:27,085
What about you? Don’t you have anyone?

210
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:30,565
Nope.

211
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:33,176
But it’d be nice if someone were there to take care of you.

212
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:36,214
- I already have someone important to take care of.
- Hey!

213
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:37,370
Who is it?

214
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,268
Should I tell you?

215
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,493
Of course, Dao. I wanna know.

216
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,432
Show us. What do they look like? Got a picture?

217
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:56,345
Uh…

218
00:22:57,014 --> 00:22:58,377
Why are you showing me a cat?

219
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:01,965
This is my important one.

220
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,620
Oh.

221
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:07,478
- Cute.
- Pretty cute.

222
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:11,840
Hurry up and eat, then get to campus. You guys will be late.

223
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:15,385
I’m going back to study too.
I’m almost at the score submission exams.

224
00:23:15,705 --> 00:23:17,588
Don’t forget about me once you leave.

225
00:23:17,714 --> 00:23:21,823
- Don’t ditch us. Come back too.
- What nonsense are you talking about?

226
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:30,127
Fah.

227
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:33,300
- Can you check this for me? Is it right?
- Sure.

228
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:39,262
Mm, yeah, that’s correct.

229
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:41,571
Okay, thanks.

230
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:45,654
Hey, that picture you posted on IG—your real boyfriend?

231
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,591
Yeah. Why?

232
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:50,583
- What faculty is he in?
- He’s about to enter Photo.

233
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,552
Oh.

234
00:23:53,254 --> 00:23:54,600
- I’ll secretly stalk him.
- Huh?

235
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:57,354
Just kidding. You’re pretty possessive, huh.

236
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:07,939
Hey Hill, did anyone ever have a crush on Phoon back when he was studying veterinary medicine?

237
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:09,682
Yeah, definitely.

238
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:11,189
Ter said there were a lot, too.

239
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:12,914
Upperclassmen and classmates alike.

240
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,176
That many?

241
00:24:14,598 --> 00:24:16,309
Once he enters Photo, there’ll probably be even more.

242
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:17,466
Watch out.

243
00:24:19,777 --> 00:24:22,380
Fah, people are crushing on your boyfriend.

244
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:24,262
Don’t you feel anything at all?

245
00:24:25,574 --> 00:24:28,531
So what if they like him? Phoon only likes me, right?

246
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:35,832
I think Hill and Jo are getting annoying now.

247
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:38,368
But you’re really the most one.

248
00:24:41,503 --> 00:24:42,417
You better go back to sleep.

249
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,060
What are you doing, my little one?

250
00:24:58,106 --> 00:25:00,100
I’m studying.

251
00:25:02,786 --> 00:25:05,810
Don’t forget to eat. I already sent food over.

252
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,953
So cute. Noted.

253
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:25,936
I’m finishing late today. Sorry about that.

254
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,193
Why apologize? You’re focusing on your studies. Don’t worry about me.

255
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,650
Alright. Good luck with your studying too.
I’ll be back soon.

256
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,757
You’re back already?

257
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:03,650
Phoon.

258
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:05,614
If you’re sleepy, go sleep properly on the bed.

259
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,520
Sleeping here will give you a headache.

260
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:11,234
I can’t get up.

261
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:35,983
Are you going to keep studying, P'Fah?

262
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:37,213
Yeah.

263
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,158
You’ve been pushing yourself a lot lately.

264
00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:42,619
My grades weren’t great last term.

265
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:44,580
I want to make up for it this term.

266
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:46,281
You can do it.

267
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,010
Thanks.

268
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:50,970
Can I get some encouragement in another way?

269
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:02,802
Again.

270
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:06,826
Again.

271
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:08,139
That’s enough.

272
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:16,225
You’ve got this.

273
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:17,857
Okay.

274
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:19,429
I won’t bother you anymore.

275
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:20,475
Good night.

276
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:46,860
You little bastard—how dare you not answer my call?

277
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:49,693
Don’t think I don’t know that Phrae went to see you.

278
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:52,400
- What nonsense are you spouting?
- Uncle.

279
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,746
Tonfah? Why are you…

280
00:27:55,856 --> 00:27:58,528
Phoon’s asleep. Is there something you’re calling about?

281
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:00,917
- Uh…
- If not, I’ll hang up.

282
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,811
Wait—don’t hang up yet.

283
00:28:13,102 --> 00:28:13,834
What is it, Kong?

284
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:17,945
I heard there’s an investor in Chiang Mai interested in partnering with us.

285
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:19,453
They want to talk details first.

286
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,093
An investor?

287
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:22,081
Yeah.

288
00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:23,364
A big one.

289
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:25,325
That’s good.

290
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,869
Then I’ll book the tickets and we’ll go right away.

291
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:28,607
Kong.

292
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:32,059
What about Phrae—the thing I told you to handle? How’s that going?

293
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,586
Enough already, Rit.

294
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:35,548
Just let Phrae go.

295
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:38,865
Shut up. Even if you’re my friend,

296
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,097
I can still kick you out of this company.

297
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:44,647
You’re the one who kept backing that kid until he get spoiled.

298
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:52,149
Did you head out early today?

299
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:54,481
I had a small errand.

300
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,281
Once I’m done,

301
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:58,041
I’ll hurry back to you, my little one.

302
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,053
I hope you have a great day today.

303
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,700
You too.

304
00:29:17,197 --> 00:29:19,063
Please have a seat and wait for a moment.

305
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,700
Hello, Uncle. It’s been a long time.

306
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,549
Tonfah, right? I almost didn’t recognize you.

307
00:30:14,757 --> 00:30:15,727
How did you end up here?

308
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:18,188
The person who contacted you about the investment—

309
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:19,865
that was me.

310
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:21,583
Don’t tell me…

311
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:23,106
the one who’s going to invest with me

312
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:24,293
is you, Tonfah?

313
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:28,333
But there’s something else I want to talk about more.

314
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:29,922
What is it?

315
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:31,585
Let me get straight to the point.

316
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:34,894
Could you stop interfering with Phoon?

317
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:41,137
What did that kid say to you?

318
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:44,625
Phoon has never once spoken badly about you.

319
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,986
Phoon has endured enough already.

320
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,290
Could you please let him go?

321
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:51,885
I never forced that kid to stay with me.

322
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:53,921
He just can’t live on his own.

323
00:30:54,108 --> 00:30:55,345
That’s why he needs me.

324
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,423
But now Phoon can manage on his own.

325
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,453
He doesn’t need you anymore.

326
00:31:03,797 --> 00:31:05,125
So this means

327
00:31:05,645 --> 00:31:07,890
that kid has successfully fooled you, hasn’t he?

328
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:12,459
How disappointing.

329
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:13,684
In the end,

330
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:15,611
you’re not that smart after all.

331
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:22,238
If you think Typhoon owes you money,

332
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:24,674
just tell me the amount.

333
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,700
Money is one thing,

334
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,588
but that kid—

335
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:30,207
he ruined my life.

336
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:32,278
He made Phrae file for divorce from me.

337
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:45,463
Hello, Jo.

338
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:46,551
I need your help with something.

339
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:56,468
Are you trying to use this to threaten me?

340
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:57,980
Consider this a warning.

341
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:01,659
I hope you know what you should do.

342
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:10,202
I’ll make you realize how wrong you are.

343
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:12,536
You brat.

344
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,357
Oh, P’Fah, what are you doing here so early?

345
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:23,642
Where’s Jo?

346
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,155
P’Jo isn’t awake yet.

347
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,662
Are you heading to class now?

348
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,868
Yes, I have to go to class now, P’Fah. I’m off.

349
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:39,360
Jo.

350
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,333
- Jo.
- North?

351
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:47,388
- It’s me.
- Why are you calling yourself “me” with me?

352
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:48,874
It’s me.

353
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,340
Hey, how did you get here?

354
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,863
Where did North go?

355
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:58,075
North already went to class. He just opened the door for me.

356
00:32:58,982 --> 00:33:02,228
Why didn’t you wake me up properly? If I accidentally carry you to the bed?

357
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:04,014
It’d be too awkward to even look at each other.

358
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:06,149
Good thing it’s me and not Arthit.

359
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:09,354
Yeah, he’d totally want to be my wife even more.

360
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:10,442
Come on, get up.

361
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:15,760
What’s up with you?

362
00:33:18,983 --> 00:33:20,708
So how did it go? Did you talk to him?

363
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:22,317
I just warned him.

364
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:25,768
Did it work?

365
00:33:26,303 --> 00:33:27,007
I don’t know.

366
00:33:28,188 --> 00:33:29,400
Have you talked to him yet?

367
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,373
If Phoon doesn’t want us involved,

368
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:33,617
then we’re really meddling.

369
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,610
And

370
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:36,429
if in the end Phoon chooses his father,

371
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:38,829
and breaks up with you, what will you do?

372
00:33:41,411 --> 00:33:43,625
Hey, I’m just saying hypothetically.

373
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,167
What you did might actually work.

374
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,468
Oh, by the way—

375
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:52,986
how’s the thing you asked me to look into?

376
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:56,109
Relax. I already sent someone to check it out.

377
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:58,466
No progress at all?

378
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:01,100
They’re still gathering information.

379
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:02,234
But—

380
00:34:03,232 --> 00:34:04,776
what you said was

381
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,964
Phoon’s mother is probably Japanese, right?

382
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:08,080
Yeah.

383
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:10,629
Phoon is probably right.

384
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,671
You’re back already?

385
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:31,680
I’m back.

386
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:33,377
What are you doing?

387
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:36,797
I’m trying to write some Japanese.

388
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:38,711
Japanese?

389
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,533
Just in case I get to talk to my mom.

390
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:46,214
Oh, you’re amazing. P’Fah has a reward for a good kid.

391
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,031
Hm?

392
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,253
Phoon, do you remember telling me to ask Jo to look into your mom?

393
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:57,254
Right now, it seems your mom really is in Japan.

394
00:34:57,872 --> 00:35:01,068
But we still haven’t found her yet. They’re continuing the search.

395
00:35:02,122 --> 00:35:03,801
- Really?
- Really.

396
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,884
Thank you, P’Fah.

397
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:32,854
Phoon.

398
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:35,979
Actually…

399
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,601
today I met your father.

400
00:35:39,602 --> 00:35:41,097
Your dad called last night.

401
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,675
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you beforehand, Phoon.

402
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:51,568
I just thought that

403
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,173
you didn’t really want to talk about your dad.

404
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,500
So I didn’t dare to ask you properly.

405
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:58,838
I’m worried about you, Phoon.

406
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:01,871
It’s not like that.

407
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:03,906
I just…

408
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:07,703
don’t know how to start telling you about it.

409
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:10,917
I haven’t contacted my dad for a long time.

410
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,472
I think…

411
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,160
it’s probably better to cut ties like this.

412
00:36:17,414 --> 00:36:19,494
The time you distanced yourself from me…

413
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:22,557
was it because of your dad?

414
00:36:31,374 --> 00:36:32,448
If…

415
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:34,773
your dad asked you to stop seeing me again,

416
00:36:35,724 --> 00:36:37,053
would you agree to it?

417
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:39,149
Did my dad say that?

418
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:40,731
No.

419
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:42,640
I was just asking, just in case.

420
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,040
Actually…

421
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:47,659
my dad didn’t want me involved with you from the start.

422
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,068
But if he asks me to stop now…

423
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:54,866
I won’t do it.

424
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:02,237
That’s more than enough

425
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:03,171
for me, Phoon.

426
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:05,822
You don’t have to worry about anything anymore.

427
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:08,097
Everything will be sorted out.

428
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,880
Trust me, little one.

429
00:37:27,566 --> 00:37:30,493
In the end, Phoon chose me.

430
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,066
Chose what?

431
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,000
He said he wouldn’t break up with me.

432
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,900
What?

433
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:52,139
I’m sorry. I haven’t really had much time for you lately.

434
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:53,737
You’re overthinking again, P'Fah.

435
00:37:54,296 --> 00:37:55,048
It’s okay.

436
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:57,360
I’ll let Ter and North to come.

437
00:37:57,845 --> 00:37:59,115
You should focus on studying too.

438
00:37:59,514 --> 00:38:00,654
I’ll read and wait for you.

439
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:01,758
Okay.

440
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,527
Call me if anything comes up.

441
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:21,260
I’m at the café in front of the campus. Hurry over after class. I’m lonely.

442
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,746
I’m lonely too. You ditched me.

443
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:27,646
You’re still sulking?

444
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:33,246
Go study properly. Read your books, you dropout kid.

445
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,506
I’ve still got a long way to go.

446
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:39,753
Study hard, Dao.

447
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,720
Miss you, Maew.

448
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,966
I’m almost done. You have to treat me a green tea frappe.

449
00:38:46,486 --> 00:38:47,706
Alright.

450
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,139
Yes, Aunt Phrae.

451
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:09,526
He even threatened me, saying he’d take Fai to live with him.

452
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,873
I’m sorry for dumping all this on you.
I don’t have anyone else to listen to me.

453
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:19,050
Other than listening, there’s not much I can do.

454
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:22,666
Don’t say that. You’ve helped me so much already.

455
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,177
I’ll try talking to my partner.

456
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,000
Maybe he can help somehow.

457
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:34,166
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Just having you listen already means a lot.

458
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:38,011
I want to help. Fai is my younger sibling.

459
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:54,017
What did you tell Tonfah for him to treat me like this?

460
00:39:54,265 --> 00:39:55,100
Treat you how?

461
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:58,514
How? You ungrateful bastard.

462
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,474
This whole thing with Phrae is because of you, isn’t it?

463
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:04,724
You already took Thorfun. Still not satisfied?

464
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:08,091
What you’re doing is making me lose my wife and kids.

465
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:11,546
You bastard. How far are you going to ruin my life?

466
00:40:12,183 --> 00:40:14,466
I never should’ve let that woman give birth to you.

467
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,373
Then why did you let me be born?

468
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,350
If you never loved me or cared at all.

469
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:21,070
Did I ask to be born?

470
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:25,503
If I could choose…

471
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:28,059
do you think I’d choose you as my father?

472
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,619
I can’t choose that.

473
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,668
You’re the one who had the choice.

474
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:36,228
I’m the result of your actions.

475
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,937
Take some responsibility.

476
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:40,477
I told that woman to get rid of you.

477
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:42,434
I never chose you.

478
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:45,037
I never wanted you to be born.

479
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:46,835
That woman…

480
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,807
she was stupid and stubborn.

481
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:50,656
She chose to keep you.

482
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,737
And in the end, she abandoned you anyway.

483
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:55,241
No one even knows where she is now.

484
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:58,241
And you think Aunt Phrae left you because of me?

485
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:00,463
She wanted to raise Fai on her own.

486
00:41:01,294 --> 00:41:03,554
Because you’re too messed up to be a father.

487
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:06,762
So messed up she didn’t even want you touching her daughter.

488
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,071
Big mouth.

489
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:10,106
You’re asking for it.

490
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:11,678
Hey, North!

491
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:15,422
- North, that’s enough.
- This bastard deserves it!

492
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,025
That’s enough!

493
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:20,020
You little shit just punched me!

494
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,648
I’ll remember this.

495
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,345
Keep an eye on your friend.

496
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:28,506
- Serves you right, asshole! Who the hell are you?
- Calm down, North.

497
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,037
Huh? Your dad?

498
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:33,327
That guy earlier was your dad?

499
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:34,314
Yeah.

500
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:37,220
I saw him about to hit you, so I hit him first.

501
00:41:38,303 --> 00:41:41,770
Damn it, I’ve never punched a friend’s dad in my life.

502
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:45,330
It’s fine. You were just trying to help me.

503
00:41:45,924 --> 00:41:48,925
What kind of father beats his kid like he’s trying to kill him?

504
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:53,734
- Does it hurt?
- Hell yes, it does.

505
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:54,668
Sorry.

506
00:41:56,518 --> 00:41:58,202
What am I gonna tell P'Jo?

507
00:41:59,845 --> 00:42:01,482
Say I’m allergic to chili?

508
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,574
Think he’ll believe it?

509
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,920
Or maybe I drank some wine,

510
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,103
and got a little dizzy.

511
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:08,850
Ow.

512
00:42:10,026 --> 00:42:11,471
Will P'Jo believe me?

513
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:14,930
Hey.

514
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:17,882
North.

515
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,592
They said you got beaten up?

516
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:20,755
Are you okay?

517
00:42:35,226 --> 00:42:35,998
Does it hurt?

518
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:40,392
Fah.

519
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,684
Come talk to me for a second.

520
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:43,637
Okay.

521
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,675
Hill, stay with them for now.

522
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,121
I really thought talking nicely would get through to him.

523
00:43:01,638 --> 00:43:03,442
If you don’t do anything, I’ll handle it myself.

524
00:43:03,773 --> 00:43:04,405
Calm down first.

525
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:06,154
How the hell am I supposed to calm down?

526
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:08,198
Then calm down for me, at least.

527
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:12,564
I’ve got to do something about this.

528
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:16,752
What do you mean, the account’s been frozen?

529
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,665
Are you crazy? How is that even possible? Did you check properly?

530
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,034
Turn yourself in, Rit.

531
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,240
What did you say? How dare you talk to me like that?

532
00:43:26,995 --> 00:43:27,848
Tonfah.

533
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:30,091
But how could he do this?

534
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,371
I already cleaned everything up.

535
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:36,388
Captain, Sergeant.

536
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:38,554
What are you arresting me for, officer?

537
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:42,508
Officer, wait—let go first. Let’s sit down and talk.

538
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:43,737
You can’t just arrest me like this.

539
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:50,680
It has sent shockwaves through the business world.
A prominent businessman and former senior executive of a leading real estate company

540
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:54,093
was arrested by police in his hotel room while preparing to flee.

541
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,760
He is now a suspect in embezzlement and money laundering cases.

542
00:43:57,909 --> 00:43:59,960
Was that you and P'Jo doing?

543
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,622
At first, I thought he wouldn’t bother you anymore.

544
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:14,659
But then he did this.

545
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:19,324
Honestly,

546
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,613
I’ve been worried about your dad for a while now.

547
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,487
So I asked Jo to look into it a bit.

548
00:44:25,182 --> 00:44:27,831
That’s how we found evidence of embezzlement and money laundering.

549
00:44:28,724 --> 00:44:29,496
At first,

550
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,525
I only meant to use it to scare him into leaving you alone.

551
00:44:33,385 --> 00:44:35,128
But since he chose to do this,

552
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,121
I had to do the right thing.

553
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:42,897
Are you mad at me, Phoon?

554
00:44:45,878 --> 00:44:47,411
Why would I be mad at you?

555
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:52,151
That’s exactly what he deserved.

556
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,760
Mr. Ritchai admitted to authorities

557
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,840
that he was involved in illegal money transfers,

558
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:04,100
including businesses under his management that may be linked to gray-area operations in neighboring countries.

559
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:08,426
Authorities are currently reviewing financial records spanning several years.

560
00:45:08,646 --> 00:45:09,780
Back then,

561
00:45:10,484 --> 00:45:12,808
he was so proud of his image.

562
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:16,675
Now he has to hide even his face.

563
00:45:18,136 --> 00:45:19,601
I cared about him so much,

564
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:22,717
did everything he wanted me to be,

565
00:45:24,017 --> 00:45:25,736
hoping he’d love me back.

566
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:28,626
But he never did.

567
00:45:30,909 --> 00:45:31,964
In the end,

568
00:45:32,765 --> 00:45:33,979
I was left all alone.

569
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:39,703
Why would you say that?

570
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:41,494
You’ve got me.

571
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:43,826
You still have me.

572
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:46,900
Don’t think you have to be alone anymore.

573
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:49,155
Or I’ll get sad, you know.

574
00:45:51,906 --> 00:45:52,859
I’m sorry.

575
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:55,733
You will always have me.

576
00:46:25,902 --> 00:46:26,645
Where did you go?

577
00:46:27,228 --> 00:46:28,554
I went to grab something downstairs.

578
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,388
Jo sent it over.

579
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,680
Good news.

580
00:46:36,682 --> 00:46:37,360
What is it?

581
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:56,565
Mom.

582
00:47:13,035 --> 00:47:13,948
P'Fah.

583
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:15,645
Yeah?

584
00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:17,842
Mom must’ve had me when she wasn’t ready at all.

585
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:19,733
Are you going to see her?

586
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:23,120
I think you should. She must miss you a lot.

587
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,040
Maybe she doesn’t want to see me.

588
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,457
That’s why she never replied to my letters.

589
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:31,496
Why do you think that?

590
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:34,884
Maybe I’m just not used to being happy.

591
00:47:36,397 --> 00:47:39,450
I’m really sorry.

592
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,884
Mom loves you.
