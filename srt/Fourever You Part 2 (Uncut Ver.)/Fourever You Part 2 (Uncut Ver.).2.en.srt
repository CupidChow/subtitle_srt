1
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:11,029
To Thorfun.

2
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:12,751
Phoon has arrived in Chiang Mai.

3
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:14,965
Today, Phoon happened to run into P'Fah as well.

4
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:16,684
And Phoon lied,

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,577
saying that Fun is doing fine.

6
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:23,103
Do you want to stay in P'Fah’s room tonight?

7
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:26,197
You’ll stay with me until I fall asleep, right?

8
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:27,665
Yes.

9
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:29,441
Uh, Phoon.

10
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,392
Can I have Fun’s LINE ID?

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,164
Are you dating anyone right now?

12
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:37,505
I’m not dating anyone.

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,659
I can’t be the sky for anyone.

14
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,790
Can you be the sky for me?

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,190
Is that not allowed?

16
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,930
Phoon.

17
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,050
Phoon. Phoon.

18
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,030
Yes?

19
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,430
Are you okay? You suddenly went quiet.

20
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,990
Oh.

21
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,810
I’m fine.

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,650
I thought you were bored with what Fah was talking about.

23
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,380
Looks like it’s about to rain. Should we head back?

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,180
Let’s go.

25
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,910
Hey, Jo. Where have you been?

26
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,760
Just running some errands. What about you?

27
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,910
Out.

28
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,190
You didn’t even wear a raincoat. You’ll catch a cold.

29
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,650
I’ll be fine.

30
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,920
Where are you heading next?

31
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Back to my condo.

32
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,950
And damn it, it’s raining again.

33
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,320
What about you?

34
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,280
I’m heading back too.

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,620
- Drive safe.
- You too.

36
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,320
- See you.
- Bye.

37
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,380
Was that your friend?

38
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,270
Yes.

39
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,470
What’s his name?

40
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,390
His name is Johan.

41
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,040
Oh, P’Johan.

42
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,690
Why?

43
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,780
Interested?

44
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,100
No.

45
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,890
If I were to recommend someone,

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,560
Jo would be the last person I’d recommend.

47
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,360
No—second to last.

48
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,670
The last one would be Arthit.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,080
Hmm. Why is that?

50
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,450
He’s not a very good person.

51
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,100
If I were to recommend someone from the group,

52
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,200
I’d want you to meet Hill the most.

53
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,260
Why do you think you need to introduce someone to me?

54
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,810
I just think it’d be good if you had someone to look after.

55
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:26,620
And if there’s going to be someone, I want them to be a good, trustworthy person.

56
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,620
So if you date anyone, they have to pass Thorfun first, right?

57
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,900
Yes.

58
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,560
Then they’ll have to pass me too.

59
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,890
I am your brother, after all.

60
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,100
Looks like the power’s about to go out again.

61
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,660
Will you be okay?

62
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,930
Uh…

63
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,750
Honestly…

64
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,170
Do you want to stay in P'Fah’s room tonight?

65
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,110
Yes.

66
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,210
Sorry for bothering you again.

67
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,780
It’s okay.

68
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,070
I just ordered this.

69
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,550
May I sit here?

70
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,780
Sure.

71
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,600
Here’s some water.

72
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,740
I think it’d be better if you moved dorms.

73
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,210
I’ll find a new place for you.

74
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,110
My dad might scold me.

75
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,140
He'd already paid the deposit.

76
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,960
Then I’ll talk to your dad myself.

77
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,430
May I have your dad’s number?

78
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,640
I’ve sent you my dad’s number.

79
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,290
Wait a moment. I’ll talk to your dad for you.

80
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,540
Aren’t you going to bed yet?

81
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,990
Then I’ll go to bed first.

82
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,800
Mm.

83
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,280
Who is it?

84
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,540
Hello?

85
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,840
Hello, Uncle. This is Tonfah.

86
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,520
Oh, Tonfah?

87
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,700
You startled me. I was wondering who it was.

88
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,610
Why are you calling? Is something wrong?

89
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,980
It’s about Phoon.

90
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,180
About Phoon?

91
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,120
What is it?

92
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,750
About the dorm you chose for Phoon.

93
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,980
It’s not very good.

94
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,990
So I thought it’d be better for him to move.

95
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,350
But I wanted to ask for your permission first.

96
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,980
I had no idea the dorm wasn’t good.

97
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,750
I’ve recently changed jobs and have been very busy.

98
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,770
So I asked my secretary to handle the booking.

99
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,070
I see.

100
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,390
Alright then.

101
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,800
Tonfah studies here too?

102
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,050
I had no idea.

103
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,480
Yes, I study here, and I happened to run into Typhoon.

104
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,250
What? You ran into Typhoon too?

105
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,910
How was he?

106
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,290
Did he say anything or tell you something?

107
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,610
He didn’t say anything.

108
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,390
Did he mention Thorfun at all?

109
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,140
I heard she’s studying medicine near home, right?

110
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,520
Then I’ll take care of Typhoon myself.

111
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,240
Including finding a new dorm.

112
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,490
Then I’ll leave Typhoon in your care.

113
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,090
Yes, uncle. Don’t worry.

114
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
How are you?

115
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,560
We’ll go look for a new dorm together.

116
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,930
Did Dad allow it?

117
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,330
Yes.

118
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,440
P’Fah.

119
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,060
Is something wrong?

120
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,660
No.

121
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,860
You should go take a shower.

122
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,330
You’ve been tired all day. Get some rest.

123
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,390
Did Typhoon mention Thorfun at all?

124
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,320
Where are you, Fun?

125
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,470
Tomorrow morning, I’ll pick you up. Rith wants to talk to you.

126
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,590
Are you sure you don’t want P’Fah to take you?

127
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,610
I’m sure.

128
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,950
Uncle said he’d come pick me up.

129
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,660
They suddenly flew to Chiang Mai like this.

130
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,160
Is something wrong?

131
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,000
Is it about what P’Fah called about last night?

132
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,110
I don’t know.

133
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,880
I’ll get going now.

134
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,440
Okay.

135
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,540
Why did you suddenly come to Chiang Mai?

136
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,980
Rith already had business with a client here.

137
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,290
It suddenly got moved to today last night.

138
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,020
It’s about P’Fah, right?

139
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,490
Probably.

140
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,900
Is Dad angry?

141
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,780
I warned you not to get involved with Tonfah.

142
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,550
If Tonfah’s family finds out about his divorce,

143
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,820
because Thorfun’s mother caught him with another woman,

144
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,260
and knew about you who is his child—

145
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,550
An illegitimate child.

146
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,690
That’s right.

147
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,500
That’s why he doesn’t dare face them.

148
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,570
He hasn’t contacted that family for years.

149
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,320
But—

150
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,010
P’Fah’s parents aren’t like that.

151
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,910
I know.

152
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,310
But Typhoon should know his father well.

153
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,780
Rith really respects Tonfah’s parents.

154
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,990
He’s afraid of being seen badly.

155
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,430
And that it might affect his career.

156
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,540
You have to understand him.

157
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,770
I understand.

158
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,730
You really are a good kid.

159
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,060
Even after everything he’s done to you,

160
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,880
you still love him and respect him as your father.

161
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,370
He’s the only family I have left.

162
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,370
Typhoon.

163
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,170
You already knew Tonfah studies here, didn’t you?

164
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,820
Yes.

165
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,640
But I didn’t think I’d run into him this soon.

166
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,970
What did you tell him?

167
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,830
I didn’t tell him anything.

168
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,370
What exactly do you want?

169
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,990
Wasn’t killing my daughter enough for you?

170
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,020
You even made Wit and Pha see me badly.

171
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,700
I already told you, didn’t I?

172
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,750
You can study wherever you want,

173
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,570
but stay away from Tonfah.

174
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,720
Do you understand?

175
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,380
Or are you planning to tell Tonfah about Thorfun?

176
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,210
That you killed your own sister?

177
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,100
He must be so proud of you.

178
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,450
I didn’t kill Fun.

179
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,380
I didn’t mean to.

180
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,100
So you’re saying you’re not at fault?

181
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,340
Look at what’s happened to me.

182
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,890
Everything has fallen apart.

183
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,790
My family was torn apart.
And you’re saying you did nothing wrong?

184
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,490
Remember this—no one wants you.

185
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,120
I never even wanted you to be born.

186
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,330
Do you know your mother abandoned you when you were little?

187
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,860
And now no one even knows where she is.

188
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,030
If it weren’t for Thorfun’s mother,

189
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,710
you wouldn’t even be standing here.
Look at how you repaid us.

190
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,870
You killed our child.

191
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,750
And remember this well—

192
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,530
no one sees you as family except Thorfun and Tonfah.

193
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,890
Once Thorfun died,

194
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,720
you crawled back to Tonfah,

195
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,560
thinking he wouldn’t abandon you, right?

196
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,980
Dad, can I stay with P’Fah?

197
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,910
I won’t say anything. I promise.

198
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,720
Yes, you have to promise.

199
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,400
Because if you tell him,

200
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,850
he’ll abandon you anyway.

201
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,840
Because you’re afraid he’ll hate you, right?

202
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,440
Right?

203
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,580
You have to withdraw from university within this week.

204
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,410
Dad.

205
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,480
You already sold the house in Phuket.

206
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,140
If I withdraw too, where am I supposed to go?

207
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,820
Where you go is your problem. I don’t care.

208
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,320
But you must stay as far away from Tonfah’s family as possible.

209
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,030
The farther, the better.

210
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,400
As for money, I’ll have Kong handle it.

211
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,180
Remember this.

212
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,680
Don’t ever let me see your face again.

213
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,460
Do you understand?

214
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,260
Dad, please don’t.

215
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,690
Please don’t abandon me.

216
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,930
I’m sorry.

217
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,220
I was wrong.

218
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,710
No matter what it is, it’s my fault.

219
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,410
I’m the only one at fault.

220
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,640
I never wanted to be born just to ruin your life.

221
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,650
I’ll stay quiet, but please…
don’t abandon me.

222
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,700
If you still see me as your dad,

223
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
then you must stop getting involved with Tonfah.

224
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,010
P’Fah.

225
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,610
Yes, P’Fah?

226
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,590
You didn’t reply, so I called.

227
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,010
Are you still with your dad?

228
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,220
No.

229
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,460
I just got back to my room.

230
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,940
P’Fah.

231
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,940
Yes?

232
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,060
Are you free these days?

233
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,930
Yeah, I am.

234
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,110
Why?

235
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,460
Could you take me out somewhere?

236
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,740
Please?

237
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,700
I really want to go out with you.

238
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,380
Sure. Where do you want to go?

239
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,660
Anywhere.

240
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,270
As long as you’re with me.

241
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,090
I want to go everywhere with you.

242
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,820
Are you okay?

243
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,660
What does your dad say?

244
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,680
Dad just came up for work.

245
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,770
So he stopped by to see me.

246
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,300
I see.

247
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,430
Uh…

248
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,600
I’ll hang up now, P’Fah.

249
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,360
If Fun were still here,

250
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,340
everything would be better.

251
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,820
Why did it have to be you who left?

252
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,870
Why was I the one left behind?

253
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,250
Why couldn’t it have been me instead?

254
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,270
Typhoon.

255
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,360
Are you okay?

256
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,650
It’s okay.

257
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,090
I think Dad might be stressed about work.

258
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,150
So he may have lost his temper.

259
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,830
Failing this exam—

260
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,470
it’s okay.

261
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,960
You can retake it next time.

262
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,150
Can you stop saying that?

263
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,600
How can you say it’s okay?

264
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,800
You’d never understand me.

265
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,080
Everyone loves you.

266
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,250
I’m just bad luck.

267
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,950
No matter what I do, it’s never good enough.

268
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,020
This house doesn’t even need me.

269
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,470
Don’t say that.
What do you want me to do for you?

270
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,290
There’s nothing you can do for me.

271
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,130
Typhoon.

272
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,460
You’re leaving again?

273
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,790
Can’t you stay?

274
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,360
Don’t call to chase after me.

275
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,110
Go.

276
00:23:18,352 --> 00:23:19,500
I’ll be back.

277
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,310
Typhoon.

278
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,560
Where are you?

279
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,530
Why is it so loud?

280
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,330
I told you not to call.

281
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,520
Let’s go home, okay?

282
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,460
I’m not going back.

283
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,680
Can’t we talk properly?

284
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,970
There’s nothing to talk about, damn it.

285
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,930
Stop calling me already. You’re annoying.

286
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,100
Typhoon.

287
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,450
Hey!

288
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,530
You just bumped into me.

289
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,470
Hey!

290
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,640
What the hell?

291
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,930
Stop calling already!

292
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,560
Typhoon, what happened?

293
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,320
Are you okay?

294
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,410
Hello, Typhoon.

295
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,440
Stay right there. I’m coming to you.

296
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,120
Still so young.

297
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,260
Such a shame.

298
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,280
A good kid, top of the class.

299
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,710
So much potential. What a waste.

300
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,880
I heard she snuck out at night.

301
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,710
And then a drunk driver came the wrong way.

302
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,120
- Wow.
- She died on the spot.

303
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,700
That’s so pitiful.

304
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,910
Why did she take the car out so late at night anyway?

305
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,480
They said her younger brother got into a fight at a bar.

306
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,570
She was worried, so she rushed to find him.

307
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,120
Such bad karma, having a younger brother like that.

308
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,730
So young, yet already going into bars.

309
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,950
And he doesn’t even study.
The only sister he could rely on passed away first.

310
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,070
Mm.

311
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,800
I heard both the father and mother were arguing about it.

312
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:46,260
No one wanted to take the younger brother in.

313
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,450
- Really?
- Yeah, that’s what I heard.

314
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,810
You little bastard! You damn kid!

315
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,930
You got my child killed!

316
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,290
You killed my child!

317
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,850
I’m sorry.

318
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,100
You damn kid, remember this — you should never have been born as my child.

319
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,260
Where are you going? Wait!

320
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:29,270
After that, our family fell apart.

321
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,970
So broken that it could never be put back together again.

322
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,660
That’s enough. I won’t put up with you anymore.

323
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,800
Why? What did I do?

324
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,330
You’re just a womanizer, sleeping with anyone you please.

325
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,330
Even after marrying me, you got another woman pregnant.

326
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,090
Shut up. Stop talking.

327
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,830
Do you know how much I’ve endured raising that child for over ten years?

328
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,150
That’s already more than enough.

329
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:03,320
Every time I see his face, I see how badly our family failed,
how utterly broken it became. Do you even know that?

330
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,870
I told you, I didn’t mean to get that woman pregnant.

331
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,490
He’s an illegitimate child, and he caused my child’s death.

332
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,520
Why wasn’t it that kid who died?

333
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,710
Why did it have to be Fun?

334
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,880
Why did it have to be my child?

335
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,480
Still crying like always.

336
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:30,560
Faun.

337
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,690
I’ve missed you all this time.

338
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,490
I know.

339
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,420
You wrote to me every single day.

340
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,570
I missed you too.

341
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,080
You’ve been through so many terrible things, haven’t you?

342
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,190
I’m sorry.

343
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,470
I’m sorry I wasn’t there with you.

344
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,330
I’m sorry too. I’m sorry… I’m sorry, Fun.

345
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,340
None of this is your fault.

346
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,100
Don’t cling to me anymore.

347
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,140
You have to move forward.

348
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,890
Do you understand?

349
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,650
Please love yourself.

350
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,740
Just like I loved you, okay?

351
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,810
Would it be okay…

352
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,240
if I don’t want to endure anymore?

353
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,280
If I just let everything end…

354
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,210
and stop trying altogether?

355
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,320
Then I could finally go be with you.

356
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,910
Phoon.

357
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,040
Don’t hurt the person I love.

358
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,570
You have to take care of yourself.

359
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,870
Eat good food.

360
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,390
Take yourself to good places.

361
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,770
Tell yourself you love yourself often.

362
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,490
Can you promise me?

363
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,150
Live for me.

364
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,610
Live for me.

365
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,570
Thank you for coming to see me.

366
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,110
Thank you so much.

367
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,930
Feel free to take a look.

368
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,200
Do you like it?

369
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,060
I do.

370
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,650
Can we move in today?

371
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,050
Well, you’ve already paid the deposit.

372
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,660
You can move in right away if you want.

373
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,330
P'Fah.

374
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,200
Yes?

375
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,270
I’ll hurry and earn money to pay it back.

376
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,650
No need. Your father entrusted that money to me.

377
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:18,770
My dad?

378
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:20,950
Yes.

379
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,340
Then shall we start moving your things?

380
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,600
I’ll go with you.

381
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,250
Fun'd been busy lately? I texted her but she didn’t reply.

382
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,100
Well…

383
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,120
I guess so.

384
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,690
Oh.

385
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,030
At first, I thought…

386
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,650
you’d study photography.

387
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,220
P'Fah.

388
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,790
Yes?

389
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,270
I’m going to take the medical school exam.

390
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,220
Really?

391
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,400
Yes.

392
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,000
Then…

393
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,170
you’ll study here first and take the exam later, right?

394
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,990
Uh…

395
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:56,192
Yes.

396
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:00,980
P'Fah, could you…

397
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,460
help tutor me?

398
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,260
Well…

399
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,100
Of course I can.

400
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,690
But if we’re going to tutor,

401
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,340
you have to promise not to quit halfway.

402
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,210
You have to keep studying until the exam.

403
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,860
Can you promise me that?

404
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,270
Until the exam...

405
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,000
Yes.

406
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,710
Many students who start tutoring tend to change their minds halfway.

407
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,870
The tutor ends up feeling a bit hurt too.

408
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,370
But still—

409
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,690
The exam is still months away.

410
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,000
Can you promise me you'll stay until then?

411
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:46,990
Hmm?

412
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,100
Yes.

413
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,350
I promise.

414
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,460
Why did you make that face?

415
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,220
You finally call yourself “Phoon” again like before.

416
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,070
Is that strange?

417
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,790
Not at all. It’s much better.

418
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,250
You’re the same, P’Fah.

419
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,240
You always refer to yourself as P’Fah.

420
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
That’s true.

421
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,390
Do you usually refer to yourself like that?

422
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,320
I only do that with you, Phoon.

423
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,560
Do you remember why?

424
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,800
When we were kids—

425
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,970
There were a lot of kids in our neighborhood.

426
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,080
If I just called myself “P’,”

427
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,080
You’d get confused about which one.

428
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,090
So I used my name instead.

429
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,570
So you’d know.

430
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,040
Oh.

431
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,800
Thank you for helping me move dorms.

432
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,590
Honestly, thank you for everything.

433
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,260
It’s no big deal.

434
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,430
I have to go now. I’m tutoring a junior.

435
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,130
Okay.

436
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,610
See you. Call me if you need anything.

437
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:24,287
Do the homework on page 15.

438
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:28,336
And, um...

439
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:30,722
That should be enough for today.

440
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:32,991
See you.

441
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:06,090
P’Fah.

442
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:16,303
Hello, P’Fah?

443
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:17,971
Phoon.

444
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:19,752
Is the new dorm all set?

445
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,034
All set.

446
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:23,641
It suddenly started raining.

447
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,863
I was worried about a blackout, so I called.

448
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,762
Mm.

449
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,743
It’s just raining.

450
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:47,005
P’Fah.

451
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:48,651
Yes?

452
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:50,980
What if—

453
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:53,081
It’s a place where it rains all the time,

454
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:54,657
Then—

455
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:56,484
How do people

456
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:58,234
live there?

457
00:38:58,463 --> 00:38:59,512
There is a place like that.

458
00:38:59,776 --> 00:39:01,334
Meghalaya State, India.

459
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,751
It gets over 10,800 millimeters of rain a year.

460
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,435
That’s nine times more than Thailand.

461
00:39:06,921 --> 00:39:09,299
They adapt by building steep roofs,

462
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:10,533
So water doesn’t pool.

463
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:12,029
They raise their houses,

464
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,288
Grow rain-resistant crops,

465
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:16,339
And always carry flashlights and umbrellas.

466
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:18,557
You could say

467
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,394
Rain is just normal there.

468
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:22,281
Clear skies would be the strange thing.

469
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:23,927
But some people—

470
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:26,715
Learn to be happy in the rain.

471
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,240
Learning to be happy in the rain.

472
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,014
That’s true.

473
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:38,684
Phoon.

474
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:41,702
You’re serious about becoming a doctor, right?

475
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:45,004
Of course.

476
00:39:45,357 --> 00:39:47,813
Good. I’ll prepare the materials.

477
00:39:48,112 --> 00:39:49,542
Shall we start tutoring tomorrow?

478
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:51,432
Sure.

479
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:53,725
Isn’t that too soon?

480
00:39:53,997 --> 00:39:55,785
You still have plenty of time.

481
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:05,463
I don’t have much time.

482
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:38,699
P’Fah.

483
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:46,848
Have you been waiting long?

484
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:48,392
Not at all.

485
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:51,219
Do you want anything? I’ll order for you.

486
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,029
Hmm.

487
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:54,484
I’ll have an iced latte.

488
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,703
Got it.

489
00:41:00,637 --> 00:41:01,565
One iced latte, please.

490
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:11,456
Thank you.

491
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:13,619
Here you go.

492
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:21,453
P’Fah, look.

493
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:24,675
The sky is so beautiful today.

494
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:27,207
Even though it rained hard last night.

495
00:41:28,502 --> 00:41:29,536
That’s really nice.

496
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:31,951
That the sky can make you smile like this.

497
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:36,882
Phoon.

498
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:38,337
Yes?

499
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,247
You’re smiling, you know?

500
00:41:44,057 --> 00:41:44,900
Yes.

501
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,988
And do you realize it?

502
00:41:52,324 --> 00:41:54,659
That you suit a smile more than anything.

503
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:56,223
Smile a lot, okay?

504
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:01,025
Oh.

505
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:04,192
About today’s tutoring—

506
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:09,934
Let me see.

507
00:42:33,924 --> 00:42:34,924
How do I do this?

508
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,155
Okay, come on.

509
00:42:43,134 --> 00:42:45,574
Ah, this one. Read the question first, Phoon.

510
00:42:46,285 --> 00:42:50,642
They’re asking for a unit vector in the same direction as U, which equals U.

511
00:42:50,877 --> 00:42:54,894
and the absolute value of U, first we think about—

512
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,472
What is a vector?

513
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:58,444
A vector is—

514
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:01,130
Vector comes from—

515
00:43:04,278 --> 00:43:05,315
What are you looking at?

516
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:08,691
If you don’t finish this problem,

517
00:43:09,977 --> 00:43:11,440
I won’t let you go home.

518
00:43:51,515 --> 00:43:52,376
Phoon.

519
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,174
Let’s sit for a bit.

520
00:44:43,345 --> 00:44:47,543
Up ahead is the clock tower. When you come to class, you’ll see this clock tower.

521
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,785
And this is the dormitory.

522
00:44:52,263 --> 00:44:53,737
The cafeteria is on the left.

523
00:44:56,628 --> 00:44:57,404
On the left.

524
00:45:02,391 --> 00:45:03,992
That’s the right, Phoon.

525
00:45:34,709 --> 00:45:36,440
I thought you didn’t like taking photos of people.

526
00:45:36,678 --> 00:45:38,592
Why have you been taking so many of me lately?

527
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:43,168
I want to keep these moments as much as possible.

528
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:46,604
And photographs

529
00:45:47,451 --> 00:45:49,097
Are the clearest proof.

530
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:54,438
Like how you like taking pictures of Fun, right?

531
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:41,106
Your time is up.

532
00:46:44,616 --> 00:46:45,546
I know.

533
00:46:52,031 --> 00:46:53,770
Let me stay with P'Fah a little longer.

534
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:55,392
Until the semester starts.

535
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:01,287
After that, I won’t interfere with P'Fah ever again.

536
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:06,592
And if you guys run into each other at the university?

537
00:47:07,914 --> 00:47:09,161
I’ll pretend I didn’t see him.

538
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,644
Like we’re strangers.

539
00:47:15,088 --> 00:47:16,842
And if Tonfah doesn’t agree?

540
00:47:19,084 --> 00:47:20,937
I’ll make him hate me.

541
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:24,626
So much he won’t even want to look at me.

542
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:28,831
Just make sure you do what you said.

543
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,041
P’Fah.

544
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:17,980
I’m not free today. Let’s cancel the tutoring session.

545
00:50:18,674 --> 00:50:21,149
It’s okay. Are you free tomorrow?

546
00:50:27,703 --> 00:50:28,672
I’m not.

547
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:32,200
Then when are you free?

548
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,094
I’m not free anymore.

549
00:51:40,075 --> 00:51:41,020
Aren’t you eating?

550
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,515
I told you, I’m not hungry.

551
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:51,306
Please eat a little.

552
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,293
I said I’m not eating.

553
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,770
I’m sorry.

554
00:52:06,837 --> 00:52:08,392
Did I do something wrong?

555
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:18,428
I’ll head back first.

556
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:22,099
How will you get home?

557
00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:25,514
I’ll call a taxi.

558
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:40,223
Happy birthday, Johan!

559
00:52:40,414 --> 00:52:42,463
Bottoms up! Hey, Fah!

560
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,908
Everyone!

561
00:52:49,226 --> 00:52:51,462
Today’s my friend Johan’s birthday.

562
00:52:52,841 --> 00:52:54,102
One big sip!

563
00:52:54,722 --> 00:52:56,444
Alright, together!

564
00:52:57,617 --> 00:53:00,106
Hey!

565
00:53:01,703 --> 00:53:04,768
Whoever finishes their glass gets cash!

566
00:53:06,068 --> 00:53:07,125
You’re ridiculous.

567
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:11,480
Come on, enjoy it. Have some fun!

568
00:53:13,114 --> 00:53:14,795
It’d be way more fun without you.

569
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:18,355
Hey!

570
00:53:18,485 --> 00:53:22,336
Alright, bottoms up! Cheers!

571
00:53:22,475 --> 00:53:24,237
- Come on, Fah!
- Where’d you come from, so hungry?

572
00:53:24,528 --> 00:53:25,389
Fah!

573
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:27,656
Fah!

574
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,722
Hey, Fah!

575
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:34,391
What?

576
00:53:34,518 --> 00:53:35,625
What’s wrong with you?

577
00:53:38,023 --> 00:53:39,848
Nothing. I’m fine.

578
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:43,914
I’m gonna step outside for some air.

579
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:49,487
What’s with him?

580
00:53:50,075 --> 00:53:52,506
- What’s his problem?
- How would I know?

581
00:54:03,016 --> 00:54:04,278
Hey, go talk to him.

582
00:54:07,149 --> 00:54:08,013
This killed the mood.

583
00:54:11,808 --> 00:54:12,634
What’s wrong?

584
00:54:19,746 --> 00:54:20,906
Got something you wanna talk about?

585
00:54:26,788 --> 00:54:27,949
Do you think I’m okay?

586
00:54:29,037 --> 00:54:30,285
What do you mean?

587
00:54:33,198 --> 00:54:34,194
Everything.

588
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:35,991
Who I am.

589
00:54:36,814 --> 00:54:37,724
My personality.

590
00:54:38,614 --> 00:54:40,047
The things I do.

591
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:41,520
The things I say.

592
00:54:42,555 --> 00:54:43,776
Is there anything wrong with me?

593
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:47,620
What made you lose your confidence like this?

594
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,574
My brother.

595
00:54:56,358 --> 00:54:57,628
Your brother?

596
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:00,042
Yeah.

597
00:55:01,613 --> 00:55:03,588
The kid next door when I lived in Phuket.

598
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:07,077
He happened to study here.

599
00:55:07,629 --> 00:55:09,478
So we ran into each other again.

600
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:12,337
Back then,

601
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,031
We were really close.

602
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,991
He is someone I can’t help but worry about.

603
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,185
So much that it makes me want to take good care of him.

604
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,188
But ever since I moved out of the house,

605
00:55:27,148 --> 00:55:28,878
and stopped contacting him,

606
00:55:30,155 --> 00:55:31,533
I’ve felt guilty ever since.

607
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:35,416
And now,

608
00:55:36,284 --> 00:55:37,743
that we finally get to see each other again,

609
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:40,568
I just want to make up for the time we lost.

610
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:42,724
But…

611
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:46,709
He is not okay with you anymore?

612
00:55:50,905 --> 00:55:52,770
At first, it seemed fine.

613
00:55:53,628 --> 00:55:54,635
But then suddenly,

614
00:55:54,805 --> 00:55:56,336
he started pulling away.

615
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:58,739
He doesn't answer my calls.

616
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,817
And barely reply to my messages.

617
00:56:01,988 --> 00:56:03,407
It’s like he doesn't want to see me anymore.

618
00:56:05,777 --> 00:56:07,170
So I started thinking that

619
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,207
maybe it’s better if no need to have me around.

620
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:16,949
While you were gone, did anything happen to him?

621
00:56:26,106 --> 00:56:27,308
It seems like

622
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,065
his parents got divorced.

623
00:56:29,998 --> 00:56:32,801
But his dad and older sister

624
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,207
are still living with him like before.

625
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,745
Do you think he's hiding something from you?

626
00:56:44,971 --> 00:56:45,961
Hiding something?

627
00:56:48,284 --> 00:56:49,078
Maybe.

628
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:50,878
I don’t really know.

629
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:54,967
All I know is that this already makes he feel really bad about me.

630
00:56:56,044 --> 00:56:57,811
I don’t dare do anything at all, Hill.

631
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,271
It feels like

632
00:56:59,557 --> 00:57:01,262
if I make even the slightest wrong move,

633
00:57:01,487 --> 00:57:03,040
I’ll lose him forever.

634
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:05,890
Are you sure

635
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:07,339
he’s just your younger brother?

636
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:11,973
Why are you asking that?

637
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:17,902
He seem really important to you.

638
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:23,936
He's just my younger brother.

639
00:57:24,878 --> 00:57:26,368
I’ve taken care of him since we were little.

640
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:29,160
So you think it’s your responsibility?

641
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:30,669
Yeah.

642
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:39,594
Fah.

643
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,525
About what you asked me,

644
00:57:41,903 --> 00:57:43,333
whether there’s something wrong with you,

645
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:45,602
for me,

646
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:47,155
no.

647
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,520
I believe you’ve done your best.

648
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:55,294
You’re always taking care of others.

649
00:57:56,497 --> 00:57:57,794
Try caring about yourself too.

650
00:58:02,266 --> 00:58:03,170
Thanks, Hill.

651
00:58:06,995 --> 00:58:08,310
Right now, even I

652
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,804
am starting to feel exhausted too.

653
00:59:10,568 --> 00:59:11,423
Dad.

654
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,468
I don't want to do this anymore.

655
00:59:16,964 --> 00:59:18,377
I don't want to hurt P'Fah.

656
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:24,128
If you don’t want to do it, then don’t show your face to me again.

657
00:59:31,891 --> 00:59:33,736
But P'Fah must hate me already.

658
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:36,194
That’s even better then.

659
00:59:36,955 --> 00:59:39,885
So who are you going to choose—Tonfah or your father?

660
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:48,696
Dad.

661
00:59:55,402 --> 00:59:57,128
Can Phoon ask for a chance?

662
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:00,897
Just to see him one more time.

663
01:00:01,903 --> 01:00:03,945
Are you sure that will be the last time?

664
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,192
Yes, I’m sure.

665
01:00:18,465 --> 01:00:19,465
And after that,

666
01:00:31,133 --> 01:00:33,247
I will never get involved with P' Fah again.

667
01:01:13,197 --> 01:01:13,973
Phoon.

668
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,198
Have you been waiting long?

669
01:01:20,293 --> 01:01:21,202
Not long at all.

670
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:26,146
Are you feeling unwell?

671
01:01:28,321 --> 01:01:29,405
I’m fine.

672
01:01:34,601 --> 01:01:35,722
You feel warm.

673
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:37,869
Why didn’t you tell P'Fah if you weren’t feeling well?

674
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:41,577
It’s okay.

675
01:01:46,466 --> 01:01:49,183
I don’t know when I might have hurt you unintentionally.

676
01:01:49,684 --> 01:01:53,884
If there’s anything you don’t like, can you tell me?

677
01:01:54,488 --> 01:01:56,020
I’ll try to improve myself.

678
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:01,971
It’s really okay.

679
01:02:03,213 --> 01:02:04,742
You’re fine just the way you are.

680
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:12,370
Then eat well, okay? After that, you can take your medicine.

681
01:02:25,395 --> 01:02:27,017
Stay over in P'Fah’s room tonight.

682
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:33,842
With you being sick like this, I can’t leave you alone.

683
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,761
Or should P'Fah stay in your room instead?

684
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,377
Your room is fine.

685
01:02:45,037 --> 01:02:45,968
Okay.

686
01:03:16,262 --> 01:03:17,063
Here’s your medicine.

687
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:32,955
Phoon.

688
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:34,828
You seem to really like this chair.

689
01:03:39,722 --> 01:03:41,502
It can see the sky outside the window.

690
01:03:42,962 --> 01:03:44,471
It feels really relaxing.

691
01:03:59,888 --> 01:04:01,364
You’re still warm.

692
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:02,988
Want to lie down and rest?

693
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:14,905
I’ll sit here and read beside you.

694
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,074
If you’re not okay, call me.

695
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:18,909
Okay.

696
01:04:33,075 --> 01:04:34,891
This might be the last time

697
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:37,585
that I get to be with P'Fah like this.

698
01:05:12,232 --> 01:05:13,632
The last time.

699
01:05:14,226 --> 01:05:15,856
The last time I wish would never come.

700
01:05:39,697 --> 01:05:41,198
Goodbye.

701
01:06:33,638 --> 01:06:34,580
P'Fah.

702
01:06:40,722 --> 01:06:41,684
Phoon.

703
01:06:42,688 --> 01:06:43,635
Phoon.

704
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:45,161
You’re inside, right?

705
01:06:45,493 --> 01:06:47,114
Come out and see me for a bit.

706
01:06:48,248 --> 01:06:49,121
Phoon.

707
01:06:50,503 --> 01:06:51,782
Are you okay?

708
01:06:51,986 --> 01:06:53,365
Come out and talk to me, please.

709
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:55,562
Phoon.

710
01:06:59,837 --> 01:07:00,681
Phoon.

711
01:07:01,462 --> 01:07:03,386
I know you’re inside.

712
01:07:03,511 --> 01:07:05,019
Aren’t you going to answer me?

713
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,188
Do you hate me now?

714
01:07:16,216 --> 01:07:19,045
I really don’t know what I did wrong.

715
01:07:20,441 --> 01:07:22,032
But can you tell me,

716
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:23,768
what I did wrong?

717
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:33,413
You’re my important little brother.

718
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:36,915
Can we go back to how things were?

719
01:07:50,931 --> 01:07:52,035
Get out.

720
01:07:54,685 --> 01:07:56,282
What nonsense are you rambling on about?

721
01:07:57,488 --> 01:07:58,743
It’s annoying.

722
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:01,358
Do you realize,

723
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:04,109
how damn annoying you are?

724
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:06,302
And get away from my door.

725
01:08:06,997 --> 01:08:08,020
Go wherever you want.

726
01:08:17,435 --> 01:08:18,601
I’m sorry.

727
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,622
I’ll go now.

728
01:08:48,856 --> 01:08:50,217
I’m sorry.

729
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,783
I’m really sorry.

730
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:13,755
I never wanted this to happen.

731
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,234
It’s been sent ever since you were little.

732
01:09:27,391 --> 01:09:30,562
Since you were one year old, every March.

733
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:32,002
Your birthday month.

734
01:09:32,152 --> 01:09:33,296
Mom?

735
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,688
There's something?

736
01:09:34,948 --> 01:09:36,420
If you want to know, transfer the money first.

737
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:37,644
Go get it at home.

738
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:41,465
I’ve got an idea—how to get Maew to talk to P'Fah.

739
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:43,625
- Why chocolate milk?
- Because I like it.

740
