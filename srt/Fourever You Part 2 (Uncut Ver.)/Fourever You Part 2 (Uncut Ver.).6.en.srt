1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,980
Aren’t you mad at him for not talking to you directly?

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,360
I’m actually glad it was Phoon.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,620
Why is P'Fah so kind?

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,680
He even remembered that I’m afraid of the dark.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,500
Here you go, cocoa for someone special.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,680
Someone special?

7
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:30,272
Seriously, what are you guys doing?

8
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:31,226
Disguising.

9
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,938
I just wanted to know how I’d feel if I got to meet you.

10
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:37,936
And I found out that it feels really good.

11
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:45,744
Wait.

12
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:49,957
I really like how soft your lips are when I kiss you.

13
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,240
Yes, P'Fah.

14
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,440
Are you free to talk, Phoon?

15
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:24,922
Yes, I am.

16
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:26,890
Is there something you need, P'Fah?

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,880
I wanted to ask if you’re going home this break.

18
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:36,592
I probably won’t.

19
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:40,357
So you’ll be alone, Phoon?

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,912
I think so.

21
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:44,933
I was alone last break too.

22
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:52,266
Then how about spending the break with me?
My parents said they want to see you. It’s been a while.

23
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:54,640
At your place, P'Fah?

24
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:58,160
Yes. Or do you want to go somewhere else?

25
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:06,005
Can I let you know again later?

26
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:08,768
Sure.

27
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:11,792
Phoon.

28
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:12,965
Yes?

29
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:15,573
Was today a good day for you?

30
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:26,736
It was.

31
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:28,741
A very good day.

32
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:32,666
What about you, P'Fah?

33
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,605
Very good as well.

34
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,460
Hurry up, damn it.

35
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:48,661
Of all days to be late, you had to be late on exam day.

36
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,026
You complain so much.

37
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,192
Why are you so late?

38
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:13,600
I overslept.

39
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:39,781
Who’s gonna pass?

40
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:47,776
It’s like everything I studied got returned to the professor already.

41
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,509
I couldn’t do any of it.

42
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:52,373
Do you think anyone will pass?

43
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:56,197
Even with P'Hill tutoring me, I still couldn’t do it.

44
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,280
Are you complaining about the exam or showing off your boyfriend?

45
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:05,594
So how are you getting home? Want me to take you?

46
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,997
You go on ahead. I think I’ll stop by P'Gib’s cafe.

47
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:12,965
Wow, great. Just leave me behind.

48
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:16,533
I’ll be all alone and lonely like this.

49
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,460
You? Lonely?

50
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:21,568
I see you changing girls you talk to all the time.

51
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:25,381
That reminds me, I should go see my sweetheart too.

52
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:28,053
- See you!
- There he is.

53
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:29,781
Friends never even get to see your face.

54
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:31,050
See you.

55
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:36,517
So, how was it?

56
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:37,989
You went to see him?

57
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,522
How was it? Tell us, Maew.

58
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,938
Well, uh—

59
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,704
- I’ll tell you all at once later.
- Oh?

60
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:49,930
You sure?

61
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:52,314
Come on, this needs details.

62
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:59,434
So? Come on, Maew. Tell us.

63
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:02,544
Damn it, North. You’re quick about stuff like this.

64
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:04,570
If you told me like that. It means you tell to Daotok too.

65
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:06,517
I know it. You went and pushed him, didn’t you?

66
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:09,584
- North was the one who dragged me out.
- See?.

67
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:11,013
I knew it.

68
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,002
You never help me.

69
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,424
You’re such a nosy.

70
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:16,650
Whatever.

71
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:17,941
Let’s talk about this instead.

72
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:20,512
So, how was it? Your first time meeting—

73
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,160
Stop. Don’t say it.

74
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:29,952
P'Fah isn’t bad at all, you know.

75
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:31,749
Aha.

76
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:37,610
Ugh, stop making that face already.

77
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,397
What face?

78
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,218
The face like that.

79
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:45,296
- Your face is way less bad than mine?
- Of course.

80
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:46,762
Here. A mirror.

81
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:53,189
Damn it, Dao. When are you ever free?

82
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,848
- Hey, when are you going to have time to work? You never submit club work.
- What are you nagging about, Ter?

83
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:01,189
P'Fah.

84
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,296
Hi, P'Fah.

85
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,778
What a coincidence.

86
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:05,845
Yeah.

87
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,370
Such a coincidence.

88
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:13,264
We haven’t seen each other in a long time, P'Fah.

89
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:15,893
Didn’t we just see each other yesterday?

90
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,936
You’re here to get drinks at P'Gib’s cafe again?

91
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:33,642
Oh, uh… the peach tea at P'Gib’s cafe is really good.

92
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:39,029
Are you heading home already? Want me to take you?

93
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,837
That’d be great.

94
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:46,512
North’s going to see P'Jo anyway, and I was planning to see P'Hill.

95
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,602
Daotok, don’t you have work this evening?

96
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,460
- Yeah.
- Busy again.

97
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:51,424
Everyone’s busy.

98
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:54,602
Man, Phoon has to go home alone. I’m worried about him.

99
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:58,352
True, but if P'Fah takes him home, that’s a relief.

100
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:00,762
- Right?
- Yeah.

101
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:01,493
Exactly.

102
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,192
Then please, go ahead.

103
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,357
Yeah, if you go home with P'Fah, that’s reassuring.

104
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,189
Bye, P'Fah.

105
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,557
Bye. Please take care of him for us, P'Fah.

106
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:26,816
Of course.

107
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,880
So, have you decided whether you’ll come with me during the break?

108
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:52,880
Uh…

109
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:54,837
Is your place far, P'Fah?

110
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:56,906
Not far from the university.

111
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,805
Just a short drive.

112
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,840
But if you don’t want to go, that’s okay.

113
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,952
Don’t overthink it.

114
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:12,842
My parents would understand.

115
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:14,309
Uh…

116
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,904
That’s not it, really.

117
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:23,050
I’ll go.

118
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:25,834
I was just thinking about uncle and aunt anyway.

119
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:30,416
That’s great. My parents will be really happy.

120
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:39,109
Oh, by the way, how were the exams?

121
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,250
They were good.

122
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,053
Mm.

123
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:46,725
And how about transferring?

124
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,672
About I tutoring you like I said.

125
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:50,192
I really meant it.

126
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:52,720
That wouldn’t be a burden for you, right?

127
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:55,914
Of course not. Are you free tonight?

128
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:57,776
I’ll tutor you.

129
00:10:58,298 --> 00:10:59,290
Huh?

130
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:03,834
Would that really be okay?

131
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,152
Of course.

132
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,460
I’ll call you later.

133
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:10,565
Oh, a call?

134
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:13,605
Why?

135
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:16,460
Or do you want me to tutor you in your room?

136
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:19,098
Ah— a call would be better.

137
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,136
Okay.

138
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,738
I’ve got a light exam tomorrow.

139
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:28,746
So I should be free tonight.

140
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:31,637
Alright.

141
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:09,802
Thanks for taking me home.

142
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:16,026
I’ll call you tonight.

143
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:18,368
Okay.

144
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,656
Hello.

145
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:34,810
Hello.

146
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:36,965
Ready?

147
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:38,602
I’m ready.

148
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:42,266
Then let’s get started.

149
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,237
You still have your high school textbooks, right?

150
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:48,026
I do.

151
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:49,013
Okay.

152
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,301
Phoon.

153
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:04,741
Yes?

154
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,789
Today…

155
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:08,656
I went to see him.

156
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,370
Uh…

157
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,077
Who?

158
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,168
The person from the letters.

159
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:20,640
Oh.

160
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,757
Are you okay?

161
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,149
I’m fine.

162
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:31,909
And…

163
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:34,170
How was it?

164
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,760
I was really happy he agreed to meet me.

165
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:41,984
But…

166
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,818
He cried.

167
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,157
I really didn’t want him to cry.

168
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:52,858
If I asked him not to cry anymore… would that be okay?

169
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,605
I was really scared.

170
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:09,552
What were you scared of?

171
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:12,693
That he’d overthink things.

172
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,826
Because of everything that happened.

173
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,928
It was all intentional.

174
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:19,541
I don’t want him to think I wasn’t serious.

175
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:29,045
Oh.

176
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:32,000
Sorry, I got off topic.

177
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:33,440
Shall we continue studying?

178
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,165
Uh, sure.

179
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,133
Mm.

180
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:53,584
Done.

181
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,797
You did great.

182
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,000
Shall we stop here for today?

183
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,565
I’ll tutor you again later.

184
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,460
Okay. Sure.

185
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,181
Alright. Go get some rest.

186
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,520
Good night.

187
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:13,258
Good night.

188
00:16:42,954 --> 00:16:46,384
Holy shit, dude. P'Fah posted a photo of you.

189
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,460
Damn, look at his face.

190
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:09,418
Huh?

191
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:11,434
Didn’t expect that.

192
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,610
- Why is he like that?
- Yeah.

193
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:17,157
Seriously, I thought you’d be grinning ear to ear after seeing P'Fah’s IG story.

194
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:19,072
What’s with that sour face? Like a cat’s butt.

195
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:21,738
Cheer up, now!

196
00:18:22,224 --> 00:18:23,584
Is something wrong?

197
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:26,277
Do you think…

198
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,584
If P'Fah finds out I’m the person from the letters,

199
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:31,600
Would he be disappointed?

200
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,648
Ugh.

201
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:39,040
Doesn’t P'Fah seem to like you though?

202
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,834
Mm.

203
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,434
P'Fah is kind to everyone.

204
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,008
Maybe he really likes the person in the letter.

205
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:50,229
But with me, he probably just sees me as a little brother.

206
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:53,434
Come on, what kind of little brother gets posted on IG Story like that?

207
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:58,460
"Study hard, alright, my good boy."

208
00:18:58,565 --> 00:19:00,768
Wow, what kind of “little brother” is that?

209
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:02,709
Definitely not just bros.

210
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:05,381
I think so too—it’s not like bros.

211
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:06,650
I mean…

212
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:09,482
What if I’m just his option or something?

213
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:15,621
It’s hard to say, you know.
Maybe because we know Maew is the person in the letter.

214
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:19,114
So it doesn’t really feel that strange to us.

215
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:29,824
Why are you kids looking so stressed?

216
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,349
- Eat some snacks first.
- Oh, that’s too kind of you, P'Gib.

217
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,650
Wow, and that’s you being considerate?

218
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:38,698
You jerk.

219
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:40,245
Hey, what?

220
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:43,850
What if it’s poisoned?

221
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,677
Oh come on, this is to celebrate finishing exams.

222
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:51,952
Once it’s break, we won’t see each other for days.

223
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,288
Yeah.

224
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,709
So during the break,

225
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:58,460
how are you going to talk to Fah?

226
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:02,373
I honestly don’t know.

227
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:03,877
Huh.

228
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:06,880
Hmm.

229
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:10,688
Have you tried reading Fah’s letter yet?

230
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:19,461
Ugh, you’re so damn nosy.

231
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:21,722
Just like you.

232
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,858
You're worse than me.

233
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:26,144
If it’s not too much trouble,

234
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,970
may I see you again?

235
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:31,290
There’s something important I want to talk to you about.

236
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:33,898
After the last exam day.

237
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:36,416
I’ll be waiting at the park.

238
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:42,112
What should I do, guys?

239
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:44,304
Do about what?

240
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:48,026
- He said he’ll wait at the park, just go see him.
- Yeah.

241
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:52,954
What’s wrong, Phoon?

242
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:55,477
This is your chance—go for it.

243
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,874
If it’s break, how are you two supposed to keep talking through letters anyway?

244
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:01,098
Just go.

245
00:22:06,981 --> 00:22:07,930
Thank you very much.

246
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,176
Thank you for coming.

247
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:22,272
You forgot this the other day.

248
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,778
You said you had something important to talk to me about.

249
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:49,696
Yes.

250
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:51,706
I haven’t felt at ease at all.

251
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:52,997
So I wanted to apologize

252
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:54,512
for overstepping my bounds.

253
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,413
It’s really okay.

254
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,200
Thank you.

255
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:43,061
Shall we take a walk?

256
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:13,984
It’s really beautiful here.

257
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:20,460
It’s even nicer in the evening.

258
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:26,021
Next time,

259
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:27,866
would you like to come here with me again?

260
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:37,941
You…

261
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:39,856
don’t want to come with me?

262
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:53,712
Will you come?

263
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,085
About what I said I wanted to talk to you about—
you might be wondering why I kissed you.

264
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:21,962
The answer is,

265
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:23,600
simply because I wanted to kiss you.

266
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,954
Not just yesterday.

267
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:29,152
Right now as well.

268
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:33,834
I want to cherish you,

269
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:36,522
not only in letters.

270
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:42,826
I want to hear you call my name,

271
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,784
and tell me you love me.

272
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:50,460
Not just cheering me on from afar.

273
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,344
I want to hold you,

274
00:25:58,362 --> 00:25:59,813
and take the best care of you

275
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,460
as much as a man possibly can.

276
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:08,880
I love you.

277
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:25,546
For the rest of my life from now on.

278
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,080
Please be my boyfriend.

279
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:30,224
If you find out who I really am, you won’t be disappointed, right?

280
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:31,765
There’s no way.

281
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:33,285
Just being you is enough.

282
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:34,864
No one could be better than this.

283
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:41,493
I’m sorry.

284
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:43,978
I’m sorry for trying to pull you out of your safe zone.

285
00:27:45,242 --> 00:27:48,762
But from now on, may I be your safe zone too?

286
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:56,266
This might be too fast.

287
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:59,898
So how about this?

288
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,634
I’ll count from one to ten.

289
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,386
The question I asked just now—

290
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:07,776
if you’re not ready,

291
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,861
you can just walk away.

292
00:28:10,613 --> 00:28:12,261
And we’ll go back to where we were before,

293
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:14,650
the place where you feel comfortable.

294
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,661
No matter how long it takes, I’ll wait.

295
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:20,725
But if you say yes,

296
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,872
could you please turn back around?

297
00:28:29,552 --> 00:28:30,460
Ten.

298
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:33,248
Nine.

299
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:35,530
Eight.

300
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:37,722
Seven.

301
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:39,696
Six.

302
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,042
Five.

303
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,341
Four.

304
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:57,754
Three.

305
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:04,128
Two.

306
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,237
One.

307
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:36,624
Yes.

308
00:30:06,954 --> 00:30:08,256
Nice to finally meet you.

309
00:30:09,072 --> 00:30:10,410
The person from the letters.

310
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:12,074
Likewise.

311
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,960
As the person from the letters.

312
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,968
It’s my first time hearing your voice.

313
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:22,357
Would you like to introduce yourself?

314
00:30:29,877 --> 00:30:30,901
Typhoon.

315
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,333
And you?

316
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:35,578
Tonfah.

317
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,253
Nice to love you.

318
00:30:43,824 --> 00:30:46,405
Nice to love you too.

319
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:03,760
Phoon.

320
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:08,037
P'Fah is cheating. I didn’t even have time to prepare.

321
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:11,024
Can I post it on Instagram and tag you?

322
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,706
Would that be okay?

323
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:16,901
Hey, we’re dating now. Can’t we post a couple photo?

324
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:20,725
Alright.

325
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:24,400
Oh.

326
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,128
You have my Instagram too, P'Fah?

327
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:31,893
Yeah. I check it pretty often.

328
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:33,856
Phoon.

329
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:36,677
Wait a sec. You’ll get lost.

330
00:31:38,506 --> 00:31:39,653
I won’t get lost.

331
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:41,056
Really?

332
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,632
Then I’m not necessary anymore?

333
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:48,362
Uh—no. That’s not what I meant.

334
00:31:51,658 --> 00:31:52,460
And this—

335
00:31:53,002 --> 00:31:53,850
how did you get here?

336
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,357
Well—

337
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:57,957
I called a ride.

338
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:01,296
Then—

339
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:03,610
want to go back with me?

340
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:07,946
You mean you will take me back to my dorm?

341
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:12,602
Right?

342
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:15,690
Can’t you stay over at my place?

343
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:17,413
We’re dating now.

344
00:32:19,296 --> 00:32:22,256
So what if we are?

345
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:26,460
Then we should spend time together.

346
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,090
What are you thinking, Phoon?

347
00:32:28,986 --> 00:32:29,626
Hmm?

348
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:31,152
Hmm?

349
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:35,168
I’m not thinking about anything.

350
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,594
- Let’s go.
- Hey.

351
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:39,386
You’re really not coming?

352
00:32:39,664 --> 00:32:42,048
- No.
- My bed’s really comfy.

353
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,165
Phoon, wait for me.

354
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:14,218
I thought I’d never come back here again.

355
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:16,352
You had to come back.

356
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:18,149
No matter where you go,

357
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:19,962
you have to come back to P'Fah.

358
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,546
By the way—

359
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:28,460
why did you turn back?

360
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,349
I thought—

361
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:33,712
you were going to walk away.

362
00:33:35,365 --> 00:33:36,346
No.

363
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:38,954
I’ve always been right here.

364
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:42,010
I made a promise to myself

365
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:44,277
from the day I left this place.

366
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:47,002
that I wouldn’t go anywhere.

367
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:49,344
If you turned around,

368
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,648
I’d always be right here.

369
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,944
Come on, good boy.

370
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,754
Why did you say back then that I annoyed you?

371
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:07,722
Where are you going?

372
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,112
P'Fah, let go.

373
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:13,541
I won’t.

374
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:17,536
So I can know whether you lied to me or not.

375
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:21,909
I didn’t lie.

376
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:24,160
Really?

377
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,069
Bad kid need to be punished.

378
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,034
Uh—

379
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:31,301
I can’t tell you yet.

380
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,460
About—

381
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:34,357
why I had to do that.

382
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,730
So you have a reason but can’t say it?

383
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,605
I’m sorry.

384
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,109
Then it’s okay.

385
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:49,552
I think—

386
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:52,976
we should change your apology

387
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:55,557
into something else.

388
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,104
P'Fah is going to—

389
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:02,922
let—

390
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:06,192
change the apology into what?

391
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:50,005
What are you doing, P'Fah?

392
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:51,978
Let’s save it for later.

393
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,245
I know you’re not ready yet.

394
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,418
Don’t go yet.

395
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,181
If you’re a good boy, you should stay like this for now.

396
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:08,314
Okay.

397
00:36:12,106 --> 00:36:12,960
You smell nice.

398
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,288
That tickles.

399
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:21,898
Phoon.

400
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,685
Don’t you have anything you want to ask me?

401
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,144
Aren’t you surprised, P'Fah, that the person from the letters was Phoon?

402
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,477
Honestly—

403
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:46,176
I already knew it was you, Phoon.

404
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:47,098
Huh?

405
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:49,754
How did you know? When?

406
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:51,173
On my birthday.

407
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:53,738
When you wrote that birthday message.

408
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:56,618
The handwriting on the card and in the letters—

409
00:36:57,562 --> 00:36:58,460
it’s the same.

410
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:02,384
Oh.

411
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:05,488
So I messed up, huh?

412
00:37:07,797 --> 00:37:11,034
Then when you let me read the letters, that means—

413
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:13,669
You wrote them yourself and read them yourself.

414
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:15,962
I even thought—

415
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:17,504
how cute it was.

416
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:20,336
P'Fah, why did you have to tease me like that?

417
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,208
Well, why are you so good at being cute?

418
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:24,544
I don’t know.

419
00:37:25,274 --> 00:37:26,074
I.

420
00:37:27,072 --> 00:37:28,336
I should go take a shower.

421
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:31,525
Do you always run away when you’re shy?

422
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,394
What are you doing?

423
00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:52,656
I’m looking at these photos.

424
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,256
So many people sent you things.

425
00:37:56,698 --> 00:38:00,394
But why did you choose to reply to this letter?

426
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:03,760
Because this letter—

427
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,069
it was thoughtful,

428
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,349
sincere, and caring.

429
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:13,674
And it didn’t expect anything in return.

430
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:17,216
It felt like you just wanted me to know you liked me.

431
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:19,909
Also—

432
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:22,928
there was someone in it who’s my type.

433
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,261
Someone who’s your type?

434
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,805
You really are my type, Phoon.

435
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,357
I really like you too, P'Fah.

436
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,514
I always have.

437
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,621
Where are you running off to?

438
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,842
I’m sleepy.

439
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:07,354
Stay and talk to me first.

440
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,314
I can’t believe this is real.

441
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,957
Tomorrow—

442
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:24,272
you won’t disappear, right?

443
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:27,328
No way.

444
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,669
You too.

445
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,722
You won’t disappear again, right?

446
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,698
I won’t go anywhere.

447
00:39:37,568 --> 00:39:40,741
Then tonight we’ll have to hold each other tight.

448
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:43,733
So no kid sneaks away from me in my sleep again.

449
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:46,992
I told you—I’m not going anywhere.

450
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:50,293
Okay.

451
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:51,733
I believe you.

452
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:54,746
So, shall we sleep?

453
00:40:06,528 --> 00:40:07,445
Phoon.

454
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:11,738
Can we turn off the lights?

455
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:17,781
Sure.

456
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:20,890
You’re not scared anymore?

457
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,757
With you here, I’m not scared.

458
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:27,338
Good job.

459
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:51,882
Good night.

460
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:56,460
Good night.

461
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:46,773
Good morning, P'Fah.
I saw there was food in the kitchen, so I thought I’d—

462
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:12,330
I told you I wouldn’t disappear on you.

463
00:42:13,205 --> 00:42:15,104
I’m sorry.

464
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,074
I woke up and couldn’t find you, so I panicked.

465
00:42:19,797 --> 00:42:22,026
I just wanted to make breakfast for you.

466
00:42:24,522 --> 00:42:25,594
This is—

467
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:28,405
the sandwich and milk you used to send all the time.

468
00:42:30,218 --> 00:42:31,820
But it seems—

469
00:42:32,405 --> 00:42:34,698
P'Arthit gets to eat them more often.

470
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:36,378
That’s true.

471
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,642
My hands are full.

472
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:41,514
Can you feed me?

473
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,381
Mmm, it’s really good.

474
00:43:04,912 --> 00:43:05,546
Oh—

475
00:43:06,768 --> 00:43:10,341
I already told my parents I’d bring you to visit.

476
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,821
Won’t Uncle and Aunt be suspicious?

477
00:43:15,088 --> 00:43:15,600
About—

478
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:17,621
why I suddenly came to see them?

479
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:19,136
No.

480
00:43:19,386 --> 00:43:21,850
Ever since I told them you study here,

481
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:24,528
they’ve wanted you to visit many times.

482
00:43:26,768 --> 00:43:27,877
Actually,

483
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,032
I should’ve made time to visit more often.

484
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:33,173
Back then, Uncle and Aunt were kind to me—and Fun too…

485
00:43:41,392 --> 00:43:44,229
I’ll go get more milk.

486
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:49,925
- Do you want anything else, P'Fah?
- No, I’m good.

487
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,826
You’re here already, dear?

488
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,296
Phoon, it’s been so long since I last saw you.

489
00:44:58,352 --> 00:44:59,712
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hello.

490
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:01,514
How have you been? Are you doing well?

491
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:04,768
- I’m doing well. And you?
- I’m well too.

492
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,280
I heard you’re studying at the same place as Fah, right?

493
00:45:07,514 --> 00:45:08,352
Yes.

494
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,976
Why don’t you come visit us more? We miss you so much.

495
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,384
I haven’t talked to Rit in ages either.

496
00:45:17,008 --> 00:45:21,738
Uh—sorry.

497
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:23,365
I’m just teasing you.

498
00:45:23,685 --> 00:45:25,664
I know you’ve been busy with your studies.

499
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,642
And you’re living far from home now, right?

500
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:32,122
Let’s go inside first, dear. Come on.

501
00:45:49,509 --> 00:45:51,498
Uh, and how is uncle?

502
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:55,829
He’s in the hospital, dear. But he said he’d hurry back so we can have dinner together.

503
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,978
He’s still working just as hard as ever, isn’t he?

504
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:00,304
It can’t really be helped.

505
00:46:05,493 --> 00:46:09,674
Ma’am, a client is calling. They’re waiting on the line now.

506
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,872
See? I didn’t even finish speaking.

507
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,229
Alright then, I’ll step out to take the call for a moment.

508
00:46:16,736 --> 00:46:18,224
Fah, help watch him for me, okay?

509
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:19,530
Yes, Mom.

510
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:26,282
Your mom hasn’t changed at all, has she?

511
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,037
That’s true.

512
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,173
This is P'Fah’s room.

513
00:47:04,794 --> 00:47:06,288
It’s even bigger than the old house.

514
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:09,893
Mm.

515
00:47:11,013 --> 00:47:13,306
But without the neighborhood kids coming over to play…

516
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:14,762
it feels a bit lonely.

517
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,493
You still haven’t made up for letting go of P'Fah’s hand, you know.

518
00:47:29,098 --> 00:47:30,682
This is your house.

519
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:33,632
- We can’t hold hands.
- Why not?

520
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:35,466
Well—

521
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,576
What if someone sees us?

522
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:41,514
Phoon, you don’t want others to know?

523
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:42,154
Hmm?

524
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:46,704
I’m worried uncle and aunt might see us and not be okay with it.

525
00:47:56,736 --> 00:47:57,616
I’m sorry.

526
00:48:03,584 --> 00:48:05,285
Phoon won’t let go of my hand.

527
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:07,909
I’ll tell Mom and Dad that we’re dating.

528
00:48:10,602 --> 00:48:13,530
- But—
- We really are dating.

529
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:16,810
Okay?

530
00:48:19,722 --> 00:48:20,378
Okay.

531
00:48:31,706 --> 00:48:32,917
That’s a relief.

532
00:48:39,077 --> 00:48:41,344
Typhoon, it’s been so long. How have you been?

533
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:43,328
I’m doing well.

534
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,845
And what about Rit? Is he doing well?

535
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,746
Dad is…

536
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:54,981
doing well.

537
00:48:56,549 --> 00:48:59,178
Last time he said he’d come visit, but he never did.

538
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:09,669
- Phoon, dear.
- Yes?

539
00:49:11,504 --> 00:49:15,130
Eat a lot, okay? We haven’t seen each other in ages.

540
00:49:15,397 --> 00:49:18,080
How are you still this small? I really can’t accept that.

541
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:18,986
Yes.

542
00:49:19,797 --> 00:49:20,778
Fah.

543
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:21,770
Yes?

544
00:49:21,861 --> 00:49:24,848
I heard that Hill and Johan already have lovers. Is that true?

545
00:49:26,037 --> 00:49:26,992
Yes, Mom.

546
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:28,330
And what about you, Fah?

547
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:31,114
Aren’t you going to find me a daughter-in-law?

548
00:49:35,226 --> 00:49:36,949
Our son has been too busy studying.

549
00:49:37,104 --> 00:49:38,320
Oh, Dad.

550
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:40,460
Shouldn’t he at least have someone to talk to?

551
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,664
Or should you finish your studies first?

552
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:44,858
What do you think, son?

553
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:09,760
Dad. Mom.

554
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,261
Phoon and I are dating.

555
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,360
Really?

556
00:50:49,706 --> 00:50:53,808
Oh my, when I said I wanted a daughter-in-law,

557
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:57,717
I didn’t expect it to happen this fast.

558
00:50:59,317 --> 00:51:00,460
Dad, are you okay with it?

559
00:51:03,509 --> 00:51:04,304
Of course.

560
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:07,306
I’m not that old-fashioned.

561
00:51:09,104 --> 00:51:11,397
It’s even better that it’s someone we already know.

562
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:13,776
That way, we don’t have to worry.

563
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:15,365
about Fah meeting the wrong person.

564
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:20,661
Thank you.

565
00:51:21,877 --> 00:51:23,557
How long have you two been together?

566
00:51:26,613 --> 00:51:29,504
Not very long.

567
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:33,888
This is such good news. We should celebrate.

568
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,098
We definitely should celebrate.

569
00:51:35,264 --> 00:51:35,893
Yes.

570
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:36,602
Phoon.

571
00:51:37,285 --> 00:51:39,733
- Do you want anything else to eat?
- I’m fine, thank you.

572
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,306
Here, eat up.

573
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:43,333
Should we order from this restaurant again?

574
00:51:43,536 --> 00:51:44,460
Sure, Dad.

575
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,989
Eat plenty, okay?

576
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,098
What are you watching?

577
00:52:06,394 --> 00:52:07,578
Easter and North.

578
00:52:07,936 --> 00:52:09,205
They sent photos showing off their trip abroad.

579
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:10,906
Mm.

580
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,650
Phoon, do you want to go too?

581
00:52:18,048 --> 00:52:18,460
Hmm?

582
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:26,112
If I want to go, can I just go like that?

583
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,336
If you want to go, P'Fah will take you.

584
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:36,965
Don’t spoil me too much.

585
00:52:37,552 --> 00:52:38,997
Or I’ll become a spoiled kid.

586
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:40,709
Mm.

587
00:52:41,856 --> 00:52:43,856
I always spoils my boyfriend anyway.

588
00:52:45,637 --> 00:52:46,778
Mm.

589
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,090
Let me think about it first.

590
00:52:50,554 --> 00:52:53,450
But right now, I don’t really want to go anywhere.

591
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,680
What about P'Fah’s room?

592
00:52:56,325 --> 00:52:57,072
Do you want to go?

593
00:53:00,192 --> 00:53:01,168
Just kidding.

594
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:03,546
By the way—

595
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:06,608
Do you feel better now?

596
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,424
My parents didn’t seem upset at all.

597
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:11,258
They even looked happy.

598
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:13,578
They’re still just as kind as ever.

599
00:53:21,205 --> 00:53:22,757
Was today a good day for Phoon?

600
00:53:26,197 --> 00:53:26,677
Yes.

601
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,866
So, was today a good day for P'Fah?

602
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,874
With Phoon here and all.

603
00:53:33,562 --> 00:53:35,200
Then of course it has to be a good day.

604
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:45,141
P'Fah.

605
00:54:55,728 --> 00:54:57,600
I'm starting to lose my patience now.

606
00:55:01,728 --> 00:55:03,829
But I will wait until Phoon is ready.

607
00:55:11,077 --> 00:55:12,080
Is that okay?

608
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,056
Phoon.

609
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:37,856
Yes.

610
00:55:38,917 --> 00:55:40,405
You’re not alone anymore, you know.

611
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:45,669
Those heavy things you’ve been carrying—

612
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:48,730
you can share them with me.

613
00:55:57,568 --> 00:55:58,613
Do you understand?

614
00:55:59,317 --> 00:55:59,872
Hmm?

615
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,333
Do you understand?

616
00:56:01,701 --> 00:56:02,266
Yes.

617
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:07,098
About what you asked me to look into, Khun Tonfah,

618
00:56:07,285 --> 00:56:08,928
I have some updates to report.

619
00:56:09,898 --> 00:56:10,597
Go on.

620
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,930
Thorfun passed away three to four years ago.

621
00:56:27,962 --> 00:56:29,573
Oh, you’re up early, Phoon.

622
00:56:30,922 --> 00:56:31,882
Come, sit here.

623
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,733
Is Fah still asleep?

624
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,914
Oh, he’s awake already. He’s taking a shower.

625
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,216
Yes.

626
00:56:48,512 --> 00:56:50,032
- Go ahead, dear.
- Thank you.

627
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,896
And what about Fun? Is she doing well?

628
00:56:57,573 --> 00:57:00,325
That’s right, it’s been a long time since we last saw her.

629
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:10,901
- Good morning.
- Good morning, dear.

630
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,029
- How are you?
- We’re doing fine.

631
00:57:17,973 --> 00:57:20,896
We’ll probably head to Phuket.

632
00:57:44,149 --> 00:57:46,789
Goodbye.

633
00:57:50,864 --> 00:57:51,962
Come visit often, okay?

634
00:57:52,272 --> 00:57:53,130
I will.

635
00:57:53,989 --> 00:57:54,928
Drive safely.

636
00:57:55,045 --> 00:57:55,749
Yes, Dad.

637
00:57:57,354 --> 00:57:58,309
We’re heading off now.

638
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,520
- Goodbye, Mom and Dad.
- Take good care of each other.

639
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,098
That’s sweet.

640
00:58:29,253 --> 00:58:30,368
Is there anywhere you want to stop by, Phoon?

641
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,717
The temple in the village.

642
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:09,408
Um…

643
00:59:11,445 --> 00:59:15,253
Aren’t you going to ask why we came back to Phuket?

644
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,322
Is it strange that I didn’t ask?

645
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:19,850
It is.

646
00:59:20,885 --> 00:59:23,765
At least you should ask.

647
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:31,114
P'Fah must be angry with me for sure.

648
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,882
Why would I be?

649
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:39,386
It’s okay if you’re angry at me.

650
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,338
I’ll apologize.

651
00:59:41,749 --> 00:59:42,640
But…

652
00:59:44,784 --> 00:59:47,482
Can we not break up?

653
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:49,498
Phoon.

654
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:53,056
We just started dating. Why are you talking about breaking up?

655
00:59:54,165 --> 00:59:55,232
That’s not good at all.

656
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:56,880
Should I punish you for that?

657
00:59:58,282 --> 00:59:59,514
I’m serious.

658
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,509
We’re not breaking up.

659
01:00:03,002 --> 01:00:05,205
Yes. No way.

660
01:00:09,066 --> 01:00:10,597
It took so long just to meet you.

661
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:12,240
P'Fah won’t let go that easily.

662
01:00:18,389 --> 01:00:18,944
Let’s go.

663
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:01,765
P'Fah.

664
01:01:02,213 --> 01:01:03,648
I’m sorry.

665
01:01:05,173 --> 01:01:06,933
About everything—

666
01:01:08,213 --> 01:01:09,370
I lied to you.

667
01:01:18,197 --> 01:01:18,949
Phoon.

668
01:01:20,256 --> 01:01:21,189
It’s okay.

669
01:01:21,733 --> 01:01:23,157
I already knew.

670
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,032
I’ve known for a long time.

671
01:01:29,013 --> 01:01:32,352
I was just waiting for you to be ready to tell me yourself.

672
01:01:36,896 --> 01:01:38,234
You’re not angry with me?

673
01:01:39,626 --> 01:01:40,842
I understand you.

674
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:01,690
Fun.

675
01:02:02,357 --> 01:02:04,965
I’m sorry I never came to see you.

676
01:02:07,146 --> 01:02:08,880
You don’t have to worry about Phoon anymore.

677
01:02:10,213 --> 01:02:11,269
From now on,

678
01:02:11,717 --> 01:02:13,088
I’ll take care of him myself.

679
01:02:23,088 --> 01:02:24,133
Don’t cry.

680
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,840
Fun.

681
01:03:06,512 --> 01:03:09,477
I probably don’t have anything to worry about anymore.

682
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:12,400
It’s really time for me to go now.

683
01:03:18,304 --> 01:03:19,840
Can’t you stay?

684
01:03:27,994 --> 01:03:30,240
Thank you for everything.

685
01:03:33,466 --> 01:03:34,000
Mm.

686
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:36,460
I love you, Fun.

687
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:41,424
I love you too, Phoon.

688
01:04:06,357 --> 01:04:07,429
Are you okay?

689
01:04:20,794 --> 01:04:22,138
I can feel Fun.

690
01:04:28,277 --> 01:04:29,605
Even though it hurts,

691
01:04:29,861 --> 01:04:30,602
and I miss her,

692
01:04:33,024 --> 01:04:34,704
every time I feel her,

693
01:04:36,544 --> 01:04:38,336
it’s such a good feeling.

694
01:04:41,269 --> 01:04:42,368
But this time,

695
01:04:49,322 --> 01:04:50,357
she came to say goodbye.

696
01:04:53,818 --> 01:04:55,466
Because she has nothing to worry about anymore, right?

697
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,189
I understand.

698
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:04,570
I want Fun to rest peacefully.

699
01:05:05,877 --> 01:05:07,018
She doesn’t have to worry about me anymore.

700
01:05:09,253 --> 01:05:10,677
But when I think about it again…

701
01:05:11,376 --> 01:05:12,460
I thought we might never see each other again.

702
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:17,013
It’s just…

703
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:20,080
a bit heartbreaking.

704
01:05:27,141 --> 01:05:28,576
Phoon, listen to me.

705
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:31,274
Fun hasn’t gone anywhere.

706
01:05:32,544 --> 01:05:33,376
Because Fun

707
01:05:34,837 --> 01:05:36,896
will always live on in the memories of both of us.

708
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:42,298
That’s true.

709
01:06:14,624 --> 01:06:17,642
I never thought I’d get to watch the sunset with you like this.

710
01:06:19,733 --> 01:06:20,565
Why not?

711
01:06:25,568 --> 01:06:26,976
It just felt impossible.

712
01:06:27,498 --> 01:06:29,077
Huh? Why’s that?

713
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:32,981
Back then,

714
01:06:33,312 --> 01:06:35,066
whenever I looked at the sky,

715
01:06:36,778 --> 01:06:38,400
I’d always ask myself

716
01:06:39,861 --> 01:06:41,765
whether P'Fah was looking at the same sky.

717
01:06:44,869 --> 01:06:46,256
But today, I got my answer.

718
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:49,178
That we’re looking at the same sky.

719
01:06:54,149 --> 01:06:56,016
Then that means we’re looking at the sky together.

720
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:12,026
Phoon, would you like to move in with me?

721
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:15,173
- Please?
- Don’t overthink it.

722
01:08:15,456 --> 01:08:17,584
P'Fah believes your parents will understand.

723
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:19,845
I heard there’s an investor in Chiang Mai

724
01:08:20,037 --> 01:08:21,872
who’s interested in partnering with us.

725
01:08:22,288 --> 01:08:23,669
They want to discuss the details first.

726
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:27,520
You ungrateful brat, a complete waste of everything I’ve given you.

727
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:30,106
I should never have let that woman give birth to you.

728
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,800
This is the result of your own actions—take some responsibility for it.

729
01:08:32,906 --> 01:08:35,274
Don’t think you have to face everything alone anymore.

730
01:08:35,616 --> 01:08:37,136
Phoon, you’ll always have me.
