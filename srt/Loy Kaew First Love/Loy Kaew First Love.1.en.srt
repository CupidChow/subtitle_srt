1
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:33,901
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

2
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,724
I want to keep you close to me.

3
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:46,312
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

4
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,150
When you're not here,

5
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,227
know that I'm vulnerable.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,702
But our love might be wrong.

7
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:09,966
Fate might be too cruel to me.

8
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:16,484
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,534
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

10
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:27,702
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

11
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:34,672
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

12
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:41,422
If love is as strange as people say it is.

13
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:46,421
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

14
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:53,329
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

15
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:59,989
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

16
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:28,185
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

17
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:34,492
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

18
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,576
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

19
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:48,579
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

20
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:56,384
If love is as strange as people say it is.

21
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:01,396
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

22
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:08,334
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

23
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:14,706
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

24
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:55,936
- Boo!
- Hey!?

25
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,187
Loy! Damn, you freaked me out!

26
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,361
I thought a crocodile was about to come
grab me and make me its lunch!

27
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,986
Damn, you're scared like a kid, Kaew!

28
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:08,191
Damn, look at your face!

29
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,577
Come here! Let croc Loy take a bite!

30
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:17,009
What are you doing?
Don't do such nasty things, Loy!

31
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:18,439
Oh? You wanna get bit, huh?

32
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,059
Who told you?

33
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:24,860
Go away! Don't do such nasty things, you!

34
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,995
- I didn't say I wanted to play with you.
- But I'm going to play with you.

35
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,129
- I'm not going to play with you.
- I'm going to play with you.

36
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,389
- Are you trying to fight me?
- Yes, I am!

37
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,063
- Huh? Are you trying to fight me?
- Yes, I am!

38
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,583
Ouch! What are you doing?

39
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:55,263
Kaew! Give it back!

40
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:59,016
So? You like doing such nasty things, huh?

41
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:02,376
You should be running back home
without your clothes on like this!

42
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:03,379
Give it back!

43
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,231
If you dare, come and get it!

44
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:07,005
Damn it!

45
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:10,882
Damn it! What the hell are you doing?!

46
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:21,410
- Wow!
- Hey!

47
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,838
It's so dark. Do you think it might rain?

48
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:25,206
Oh my God… seriously?

49
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:28,390
- We better get home fast.
- Hmm... Hey, Wan and P'Nuan.

50
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,095
My mom told me
I'm getting married next year, you know?

51
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:38,849
Oh, Duang! It’s just having a husband.
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?

52
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:42,914
So, which guy from what village
is your mom going to have you marry?

53
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,299
I'm not sure, either. What village is the guy
my mom will set me up with from?

54
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:51,152
I don't know who’s gonna be my husband either.

55
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:56,730
But the thing is, right now I'm so nervous,
I have butterflies in my stomach.

56
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:01,321
Ugh, Duang. What's so hard about it?

57
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:04,350
Come here, I'll guide you.

58
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:07,876
- Guide me?
- Well... it's... um...

59
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,642
- Hold on a second, Wan!
- Well... it's like... uh...

60
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:12,968
You mean like this?

61
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:15,788
Oh dear! These kids talk dirty these days!

62
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:20,469
Oh my God! Spirits of the fields and rivers,
I hope they could see it for once!

63
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,485
- Kaew!
- If you're so fast, then come and get me, Loy!

64
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:26,231
- Aah!... Aaaargh!...
- Kaew!

65
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,211
This is so indecent! What nonsense is this?!

66
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,411
- Mmm.
- Wow!

67
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,921
Wow, that looks so good, Mom!

68
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:16,960
It smells really good!

69
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:30,695
- Mmm...
- How does it taste?

70
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:33,603
It's super yummy, Mom!

71
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,762
Let me tell you, in this village,
My Mom's chili paste is the bomb!

72
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:45,035
Oh, You're such a charmer.

73
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:55,165
Heard the Bangkok girls cook like
they're serving gods or something!

74
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,451
Listen to me, Loy.
It would be good for you to go to Bangkok.

75
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:12,135
Your dad's cousin, Uncle In,
He has a shop there, you know.

76
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,300
He’s probably got some work for you to do.

77
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:23,416
Mom!

78
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:30,291
If I leave to work in Bangkok, Then who's
gonna look after you and our land, Mom?

79
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:42,700
I've been looking after myself
since your dad passed away.

80
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:49,399
I've managed to take care of myself
and you for so many years, Loy.

81
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:55,191
The land’s been in debt for ages. They’re gonna
take it soon, just haven’t shown up yet.

82
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:05,180
Kamnan Boonlue could come to take it
any time now.

83
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:11,418
If you keep living here,
there's no future for you.

84
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:19,656
Then let me try asking Phuyai Prik for a loan.
Maybe I can get the land back.

85
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:31,381
Loy, we've talked about this so many times.

86
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:36,164
Sure, you're friends with Kaew,

87
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:44,927
but you know what Mae Lamphoei's like.

88
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:51,296
Don't make me explain myself again.

89
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:55,936
Well, Mom, what I mean is...

90
00:10:58,545 --> 00:11:02,255
Ugh. Stop talking, just eat.

91
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:10,782
And don't forget to flip the fish I'm drying.

92
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:16,113
Because tomorrow,
I want you to take them to sell at the market

93
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:22,588
So we can get some money
to pay Kamnan Boonlue the interest.

94
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:24,972
Eat up quickly.

95
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:54,900
Be ready to synchronize with
the same rhythmic pattern. Pay attention.

96
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:07,045
Ouch!

97
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:09,529
Aow!

98
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:12,494
What's going on with you all?

99
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:16,745
You're dancing all contorted
and awkward, like worms in ashes!

100
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:19,304
- Oh, Master.
- Ugh!

101
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:22,220
I'm trying my best, you know.

102
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,710
Please let us rest, Master.
We've been practicing since morning, Master.

103
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:32,958
Listen, what are your preparations for
the upcoming Wai Kru ceremony?!

104
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:37,401
Hey, hey, hey! Turn and look at these kids!
See how hard they're trying to learn?

105
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:40,228
Look how dedicated they are to their dancing!

106
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:42,348
They're pointing their fingers down,
pointing their fingers up,

107
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:43,720
lifting their legs – so cute!

108
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,931
They're really trying hard, guys.
You gotta take them as an example. Alright, Aow!

109
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:50,321
Oh! They're gone already.

110
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:53,831
Hmph! Just you wait, Mae Malai.

111
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:58,005
They've all departed, every one of them!

112
00:12:58,756 --> 00:13:01,515
All departed, indeed! I can perform by myself!

113
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:07,606
If I were younger, you'd be outmatched, everyone!

114
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:28,942
Why the sudden sneeze? Who's badmouthing me?

115
00:13:29,562 --> 00:13:33,460
- I don't think we've done anything wrong.
- Yeah.

116
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,643
Hey, you.

117
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:38,058
- Huh?
- P'Loy, P'Kaew.

118
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,382
^Why aren't you two at practice?

119
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,380
Won't Master Jom be angry?

120
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:46,724
Hey Dech, you're being too mouthy.

121
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:51,382
If you're so eager to dance,
then you go dance for me and Loy.

122
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:56,144
Me and Kaew will do the drinking for ya.

123
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:58,166
- Yeah, right.
- I'm sick of it.

124
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,261
- All we do is rehearse, rehearse. I wanna drink.
- Right on!

125
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:07,686
Listen, if I were as talented as you two,
I'd be dancing.

126
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,340
But every time
I ask Master for a chance to dance...

127
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:15,757
Keep talking.

128
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,371
I get my ankle tapped every time.

129
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:23,492
He says I dance like some ugly bird.

130
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:25,019
What's that supposed to mean?

131
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:31,150
Yeah!

132
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:34,193
I get it now. That's why the teacher
won't let you dance. Okay, sit down.

133
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:36,908
Master Jom's kinda weird, huh?

134
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,784
- Those who wanna dance don’t get to,
- Right!

135
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:43,376
But we're not interested in dancing,
but he keeps pushing us to.

136
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,241
Me too.

137
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:50,884
Well, well…

138
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:54,847
Hey Saeng, look at this.

139
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,277
See who's sitting here drinking.

140
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:06,699
Look, it's Kaew, the Rojana dancer, and Loy,
the wild monkey from the woods.

141
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,689
And her husband-to-be, huh?

142
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,556
Still got that foul mouth, huh?

143
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:18,245
Don’t make me shut that mouth with your own blood.

144
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:21,489
Ignore him, Loy. He's just barking.

145
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:26,056
If we fight him,
his blood will just get on our feet.

146
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,930
Someone's feisty today.

147
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,582
What do you want?

148
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:39,134
We were just walking past,
minding our business...

149
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,475
And we heard a loud commotion.

150
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,927
So we came to check it out.

151
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,667
- That's how we found out.
- Know what?

152
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:56,555
That's how we know that this year's
Wai Kru ceremony at Master Jom's place...

153
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,286
The dancers skipped out to get drunk.

154
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,990
And it's gonna ruin the Wai Kru thing.

155
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,733
I think, this year...

156
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:17,092
Master Jom and his crew are gonna be
so embarrassed 'cause of these drunk students.

157
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:18,982
Drunks.

158
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:21,556
Well, looks like you're right this time, Lert.

159
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:24,766
- Oh, hey Mae Bua, where the hell have you been?
-  Butt out!

160
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:29,649
Honestly, I wasn't planning
on agreeing with you guys.

161
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:32,477
But I gotta admit, what you said’s true.

162
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:37,588
If anyone's at fault, it's me.

163
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,006
Because I'm poor.

164
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,220
That's how poor people are.

165
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,168
Do I look dead, Wan?
It's just a little cut on my head.

166
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:06,902
-  Let me have a look.
-  Ouch, that really hurts.
