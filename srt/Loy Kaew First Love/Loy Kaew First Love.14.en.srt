1
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,564
Hey Toss, Saeng, have you guys
told P'Loy yet that P'Kaew is sick?

2
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:29,944
Before coming here,
Saeng and I stopped by to tell him.

3
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,698
So what did P'Loy say?
Why didn’t he come with you?

4
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:36,939
Well... P'Loy said...

5
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:40,132
Oh! Stop being so secretive!

6
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,562
- Yeah!
- What did P'Loy say?

7
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,390
P'Loy said he's only coming on
the cremation day.

8
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:48,147
He’s really just showing up for the cremation?

9
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,556
At least he’s making it to the cremation.

10
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,984
Isn’t P’Loy kinda cute, Whan?

11
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:57,895
Ugh, your mouth! My brother is also
the P’Kaew that you love, isn't he?

12
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,998
Hey, who even wants your older brother?

13
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:03,582
It's only you who keeps pushing him on me!

14
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,944
So if you don’t want P'Kaew,
who the heck do you want?

15
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:11,453
You want my P'Loy instead?

16
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,883
P’Kaew must be asleep by now. He has a fever.

17
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:18,870
Let’s go visit P'Loy.

18
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:22,508
Or are you gonna stay with P'Kaew,
just the two of you?

19
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:24,360
You're crazy! I'm coming too!

20
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:29,765
Get well soon.

21
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:48,217
Hey... do you see it back here?

22
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,414
Bua, let's head back.

23
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,646
- Phaka! You!
- Bua!

24
00:01:56,384 --> 00:02:00,451
Phaka, you venomous snake!
Why are you getting fresh with P'Loy?

25
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,192
With P'Phaad, don’t think
I don’t know what you’ve been up to!

26
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,070
And now you're still sticking your nose
into P'Loy's business again!

27
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,963
It seems like you and I just can't get
along anymore. Let me try one more time!

28
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,035
Bua, calm down. Phaka and I... we...

29
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:15,172
You don’t need to cover for her!

30
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:18,760
You have no idea what
this venomous snake is up to!

31
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:20,975
- Let me have one more go!
- Bua!

32
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:22,561
That's enough!

33
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:25,408
- That's enough, Bua.
- Whan!

34
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:29,737
- Whan, it's good you came.
- We were just passing by!

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,489
We're leaving now.

36
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,448
Let's go!

37
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:37,289
I can only say one thing.

38
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,841
- Shit!
- Shit!

39
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:06,693
Wow! This is my absolute favorite!

40
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:10,328
Hey! Hey, hey, easy there, easy there.

41
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:11,692
Sigh...

42
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,310
Hey, Whan, what were you saying again?

43
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:21,871
Geez... I already told you, I saw it myself!

44
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:25,569
It was like she was totally possessed!

45
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,112
Possessed by a ghost, huh...

46
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:34,056
If a ghost really possessed Bua,
the story you told wouldn't be that scary.

47
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:35,882
Because...

48
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:40,669
A ghost probably wouldn't be as vengeful towards
Phaka as it would be towards Bua.

49
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:47,235
You talk strangely, ambiguously,
it's hard for me to understand.

50
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:52,223
Hey, hey, hey,
Phaad goes around having mistresses everywhere.

51
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:56,496
But I've never once seen
Bua criticize her brother.

52
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:02,259
Are you seriously that clueless,
or are you faking it, Whan?

53
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:06,109
Why Bua slapped Phaka.

54
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:12,019
She’s liked P’Loy for ages.

55
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,665
But she was just being considerate of you.

56
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:19,577
And when she saw Phaka with P'Loy like that,
she totally lost it.

57
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,245
- What?!
- Come on, everyone knows that.

58
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,081
That you’ve got a thing for P’Loy.

59
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:29,894
I know — and Bua sure does too.

60
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:34,705
But… P'Loy doesn’t like me back.

61
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,525
P'Loy doesn’t like Phaka
either—trust me on this.

62
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,463
Sigh!

63
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:46,267
Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy there!

64
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,908
Leave some for me!
My mom made this especially for me, you know.

65
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:56,716
Wait, wait, wait.

66
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,257
Mae Lamduan made you Toddy Palm Cake?

67
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:04,011
- Of course!
- I can't believe my ears.

68
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,886
Normally she just feeds you dog food,
doesn't she?

69
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:12,607
My mom loves me so much these days.

70
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,110
Oh, my dear Gimm, my dear Gimm!

71
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:19,852
Would you like something to eat?
Mom will make it for you.

72
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,732
Oh, Gimm, you little rascal!

73
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,166
Oh wow! Mom!

74
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:27,932
It's that mouth of yours. If you're not lovable,
it's because of your words.

75
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,116
- Oh, Mae Lamduan!
- Hmph!

76
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:32,218
Well...

77
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,028
- Wow!
- Come hug me!

78
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,840
You deserved that.

79
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,224
Alright, let me hug you too.

80
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:58,327
I don't think what Bua did was too much.

81
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:00,839
Phaka had it coming.

82
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,501
Shut up, Phun! I'm talking to my sister.

83
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:14,659
Bua, please, I'm asking you as your brother.

84
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:17,762
Could you please let Phaka go?

85
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,185
P'Phaad, for a hundred days, a thousand years,
no matter which girl you flirt with,

86
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:26,581
I've never seen you care this much.

87
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:31,683
Then why with Phaka,
do you have to go so far to defend her, huh?!

88
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,827
Phun told me that day you slapped Phaka
so hard her mouth was all busted, right?

89
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:42,423
Because I was just pissed off by her, bro.

90
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:46,965
Whatever you do with her on your own,
I never complain.

91
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,844
But what pissed me off was that
she got involved with P'Loy.

92
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:59,231
What?! What did Phaka do with Loy?

93
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:04,556
- Uh...
- Well, Toss and Saeng said that,

94
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:08,510
They went to P'Loy's house
with Whan and Bua,

95
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:14,529
They saw Phaka getting really close to P'Loy.
I don’t know about that.

96
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:17,206
Who told you to speak, Phun?

97
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:36,246
P'Phaad, is something wrong?

98
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:33,603
Hey, hey, Loy!

99
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:38,032
What the hell are you doing?

100
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:46,235
Why not? I've done more than this before.

101
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,715
You know this,
and you should know right from wrong too.

102
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,824
Don't interfere and do something as vile as this.

103
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:55,702
Yeah.

104
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:59,617
I just wanted to see it for myself. Toss
and Saeng said you were lying sick in bed.

105
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:01,926
I'm perfectly fine.

106
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,824
I knew it, you're not really sick.

107
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,761
I bet you're just pretending to make a certain
someone feel sorry for you.

108
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:17,698
Can you just get out of my sight? Or I won't be
able to hold back and will kick your face in.

109
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:27,364
They say when you're in love,
even boiled water tastes sweet.

110
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:31,005
But after some time,
you end up wanting to kick me in the face.

111
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,618
Can you just leave me alone already?

112
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:38,025
Then how about letting me marry Whan,
your sister?

113
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:39,136
No!

114
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:46,505
Then run away with me.

115
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:50,553
You bastard! What’s the point of provoking me?

116
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:54,345
If we truly loved each other,
I wouldn’t allow things to be this way.

117
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:59,097
But this is impossible.
You and I can never be together.

118
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:02,944
No one will let us be together.

119
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:13,840
Still don't get it?

120
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:26,550
I just walked by and heard something—sounded like
a bunch of people were about to kill each other.

121
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,572
But I was too scared to go in alone.

122
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,384
So I went to get help.

123
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,179
Huh? Hold on a second!

124
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,756
- Hey!
- Hey!

125
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:37,483
- What's that sound?
- What sound?

126
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:41,394
- Gotta go see now!
- Phuyai Prik, be careful!

127
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,135
Be careful, Phuyai.

128
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:49,405
Thanks so much for helping us
raise Namchok all this time.

129
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:52,815
But why don't you want to stay with Phaad?

130
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:57,463
I know how P'Phaad feels about me.

131
00:12:58,064 --> 00:13:02,587
If I stay here any longer,
I'll just end up being P'Phaad's kept woman.

132
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:06,548
Letting me leave
like this would probably be better.

133
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:12,172
- Why! Say it!
- But...

134
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:15,535
- Why!
- But I didn't see Phaka at all today, brother.

135
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:18,876
We only saw Loy and Kaew.

136
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:21,006
They ambushed us at Phaka's house.

137
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:24,594
But... I think...

138
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:26,844
Loy...
