1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,869
What's that, Mom?

2
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:28,849
It's your dad's old shirt.
I found it in a trunk.

3
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,530
See? It's still in good shape.

4
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,814
So I'm giving it to you to wear.

5
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:37,306
Later, if we sell the rice,

6
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:42,737
I'll save some money
to buy you a new shirt in town.

7
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:52,090
- Mom.
- Huh?

8
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:54,292
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,634
What are you apologizing for, Loy?

10
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:00,803
Huh?

11
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:03,192
Look.

12
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:09,474
I... can't be a good son.

13
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,629
I've never made you happy.

14
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,401
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,432
Hmm... Loy.

16
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:25,966
Uh?

17
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,853
Have you talked to Kaew yet?

18
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:32,526
He's probably mad at you about something.

19
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:37,255
How come, Mom?

20
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:44,835
He probably thinks
I have feelings for his sister.

21
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,188
What?

22
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:52,907
You guys have known each
other since you were kids.

23
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:58,645
He knows what kind of person you are, right?

24
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:04,055
That's why he hates me.

25
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:08,735
He probably thinks
Loy is trying to climb the social ladder.

26
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:12,226
That I want to marry his sister.

27
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:18,797
Why do you think that?

28
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:23,591
Why wouldn't I think that, Mom?

29
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:27,408
The reason Phaad messed with me,

30
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,955
isn't it because Loy is poor?

31
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,385
And the reason Kaew punched me,

32
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,703
is because he's protective of his sister.

33
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:40,444
Phaad's going to ask
for Whan's hand in marriage.

34
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:45,593
The dowry will probably be huge.

35
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,795
That's why he's so protective.

36
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,320
He doesn't want her getting involved
with someone poor like me.

37
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,268
I promise you, Mom.

38
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,191
From now on, I won’t let anyone
look down on my mother ever again.

39
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:17,457
I promise, Mom.

40
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,914
Aaaargh! It hurts!

41
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,190
Enough, Ughhh... Cut it out already!

42
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,532
What the heck are you screaming about?

43
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,292
It's just a little bump on your head.

44
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,791
I've seen you fall out of a tree
and almost break your leg,

45
00:03:58,222 --> 00:03:59,928
and you didn't make this much fuss.

46
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:01,611
- P'Parik!
- Ouch!

47
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:04,608
Come on! She's your daughter,
for heaven’s sake!

48
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:08,850
Loy bullied her like this,
and you're still yelling at her?

49
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:12,191
If it were you who got hurt,
I wouldn't say a word.

50
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,964
Oh, come on, Lamphoei.

51
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,174
They were just playing a little rough,
what's the big deal?

52
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,130
What do you mean "playing a little rough"?
Look, look!

53
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,859
Look at Kaew,
his lip is all busted up!

54
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:27,750
And you, Whan, oh, oh, oh,
does it hurt a lot, honey?

55
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,784
You're crying your eyes out!

56
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,408
I'm not crying because I'm in pain, Mom.

57
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:36,090
I'm crying because
I feel sorry for P'Loy.

58
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:37,823
Oh, P'Kaew.

59
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:41,790
What the heck possessed you to do that to P'Loy?

60
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:45,007
Oh, Whan, look at your own brother!

61
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,163
Your own brother's hurt,
and you're taking that guy's side?

62
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,757
- Bua, let's go see P'Loy.
- Absolutely not!

63
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,281
Sit down!

64
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:59,055
You're not running off to see any guys anymore.

65
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:03,069
From now on, you're not going to be
hanging around any of those boatmen.

66
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:04,464
Especially Loy.

67
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,433
Why can't I, Mom?!

68
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,131
No means no. That’s final!

69
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,196
This dry season, Kamnan Boonlue is coming to
ask for your hand in marriage for Phaad.

70
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:17,575
If you go around acting all loose,
it won't look good.

71
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:23,446
Oh, Mom! That filthy bastard Phaad?
I wouldn't waste myself on garbage like him!

72
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:26,008
Oh! This daughter of mine!

73
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:29,040
Whan! My brother, my brother!

74
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:32,274
Watch your mouth!
If you curse him again, I'll...

75
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:34,946
Ow! It hurts... it hurts!

76
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:39,638
P'Kaew.

77
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:43,698
Seriously, what happened between you and P'Loy?

78
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:46,050
Why did you guys fight like this?

79
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:49,970
- P'Kaew started it, Bua.
- Enough, You shut your mouth, Whan!

80
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:53,608
Kaew, what happened? Tell me the story.

81
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:00,499
- Whan!
- Whan! / - Whan!

82
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,104
- Whan!
- Whan!

83
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:05,783
Calm down, okay?
Let's just talk this out slowly.

84
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:09,572
If you keep this up,
Aunt Lamphoei will have my head for sure.

85
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,912
True! Calm down first.

86
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:18,102
I swear,
I'm gonna give Phaka a piece of my mind today!

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,310
Hey! Don’t do this.

88
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:21,958
This is my problem, not yours!
Get your hands off me!

89
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,052
- Let me go!
- You're turning a Small problem, into big chaos.

90
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,123
And I’m worried about you, Whan.

91
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,597
- Whan!
- Whan! / - Whan!

92
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:31,961
- Stop!
- Hey Phaka! Get your ass out here now!

93
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:34,064
- Come out, you!
- Whan!

94
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,773
- Come out now!
- Whan!

95
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:40,224
- I swear, I'm gonna smash your head in today!
- Whan!

96
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:42,257
- Let go of me! Ow! Let me go!
- Whan!

97
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:43,640
- You better get out here right now!
- Whan!

98
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,113
Whan!

99
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:46,929
P'Loy!

100
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:55,370
Phaka!

101
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:01,640
I can’t believe P'Loy would mess
around with that bitch Phaka...

102
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:06,813
Toss!

103
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,573
Saeng!

104
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:15,044
Ging!

105
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:19,916
Duang!

106
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:23,044
Wow... what a long-ass list!

107
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,795
Why are you yelling like a crazy person?

108
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,792
Whoa! Whan.

109
00:07:33,214 --> 00:07:35,334
- Ow!
- Ugh... Whan...

110
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:36,542
What the hell is wrong with you?

111
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm sorry, okay?

112
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:46,615
That’s just how I saw it, no offense.

113
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:50,769
Ugh, there's so many leaves.
Does she ever sweep?

114
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,602
- Why don't you go help her sweep?
- Are you kidding?

115
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:55,093
- Well, you were complaining.
- But there really are a lot.

116
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:58,295
I know about this because...

117
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,907
I overheard my uncle from Phetchaburi
talking to my parents about it.

118
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:08,124
My uncle said he wants to make money
and set up a rice mill here.

119
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:11,640
But he doesn't know any buyers in Bangkok.

120
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:19,798
This Phaka is weird, you know. We ask her to
go to the market, and she never does.

121
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:22,066
So, it means that...

122
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,973
If I can contact my relatives in Bangkok...

123
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:29,480
And you can contact your uncle in Phetchaburi...

124
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,041
We might get money from your uncle
to buy rice from the villagers.

125
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:37,222
Then I’ll ask my relatives in Bangkok

126
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:40,494
to find buyers who export rice.

127
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:44,223
...so they can buy rice from the villagers
at a better price than Kamnan Boonlue offers.

128
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:47,089
That way, the villagers will make more profit.

129
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:52,626
If we can do that, it would be good,
wouldn't it, brother P'Loy?

130
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:56,805
But if Kamnan Boonlue finds out,
it will definitely be a big problem.

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,285
Yeah, because we'd be undercutting the headman.

132
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,308
But today,
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

133
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:07,416
- Let's go.
- Let's go then.

134
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,287
Hey Phaka, let me ask you something.

135
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:19,764
Your uncle is so well-off,
why don't you go live with him?

136
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:21,653
Well...

137
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:25,801
Well, well, Whan,
the beautiful girl of Thung Bang Maklua,

138
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:28,323
that all the young men desire

139
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:31,839
But probably no one will get their wish.

140
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:36,159
Because she has given her whole heart to Loy.

141
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,091
May the sacred beings be my witness.

142
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:25,310
This Loy swears to love
and remain loyal to Kaew forever..

143
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:32,219
This Kaew also swears to love
and remain unwaveringly loyal to Loy.

144
00:10:56,863 --> 00:11:08,150
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

145
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:12,973
I want to keep you close to me.

146
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:20,561
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

147
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:26,399
When you're not here,

148
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:32,476
know that I'm vulnerable.

149
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,951
But our love might be wrong.

150
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:44,215
Fate might be too cruel to me.

151
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:50,733
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

152
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:56,783
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

153
00:11:56,846 --> 00:12:01,951
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

154
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:08,921
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

155
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:15,671
If love is as strange as people say it is.

156
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:20,670
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

157
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:27,578
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

158
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:34,238
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

159
00:12:56,913 --> 00:13:02,434
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

160
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:08,741
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

161
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,825
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

162
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:22,828
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

163
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:30,633
If love is as strange as people say it is.

164
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:35,645
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

165
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:42,583
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

166
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:48,955
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.
