1
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,334
Well, well, Phaka.

2
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:53,260
Well, well, seems like Phaad's
got a thing for you, doesn’t he?

3
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,359
What are you talking about, Phun?

4
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,762
Just a few bunches of veggies.

5
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:03,742
My Phaad even left ten baht with me for you,
can you believe that?

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:11,723
Not sure if this is for the veggies…
or for your body.

7
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:15,636
You’re just a damn servant. Now get lost!

8
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,494
You're just wasting time here,
messing up my house.

9
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:46,660
Young Phaka.

10
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:54,117
Don't eat that.

11
00:01:57,503 --> 00:01:59,698
No, I didn't steal it.

12
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,665
I didn't say anything,
I just saw it was dirty.

13
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:07,935
Why are you bothering me?
It's my business if I want to eat it.

14
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:09,837
Here, I'll give you this instead.

15
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:14,867
Thanks a bunch.

16
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:18,615
- Here, I'll give you one too.
- Don't bother.

17
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:32,487
Ugh, there's so many leaves.
Does she ever sweep?

18
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:34,264
- Why don't you go help her sweep?
- Are you kidding?

19
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:36,504
- Well, you were complaining.
- But there really are a lot.

20
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:37,780
Oh, wait, wait.

21
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:42,354
This Phaka is weird, you know. We ask her to
go to the market, and she never does.

22
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:46,377
But today,
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

23
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,510
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

24
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:05,549
Oh my! Whose cow is that?

25
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:08,875
It's P'Loy's cow.

26
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:11,122
- Ugh! Not that.
- Oh?

27
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,201
Is it true, Phaka?
I heard the rumors all over the market.

28
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:20,287
Ugh! That Phaad is so evil! He's evil,
and his gang is evil too.

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,816
There's no way he'd suddenly
become a good person.

30
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:27,073
Yeah, Phaad really cares about his guys.

31
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:31,552
Last time, he and his gang beat up P'Loy
until he was covered in blood.

32
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:34,865
So how could he beat up his own guys this time?

33
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:42,817
I think that's probably because
P'Phaad's always had a grudge against P'Loy.

34
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:47,738
Everyone knows P'Phaad really likes P'Whan.

35
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,566
But P'Whan never says anything nice to him.

36
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,707
She only talks nicely to P'Loy.

37
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:57,660
So they had a fight, like guys do.

38
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,111
But as for those guys,

39
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:03,926
P'Phaad probably couldn't stand them
trying to mess with me.

40
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,610
So P'Phaad beat them up real bad.

41
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:11,265
Okay girl,
sounds like someone’s got a thing for P'Phaad.

42
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:14,080
What's going on with you, Phaka?

43
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:18,322
Uh... well...
I'm just saying what happened. It's nothing.

44
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:23,844
Hey, what's wrong with you?
You're acting all nervous and weird.

45
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:27,692
Uh... well...
I'm not feeling so good.

46
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:32,585
Oh, you're probably still freaked out
from what happened yesterday.

47
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,602
Go, go rest upstairs.
You live alone.

48
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,811
We'll go get you some medicine.

49
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:42,088
- Let's go.
- Oh! No, don't!

50
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:46,349
It's okay, I can take care of myself.

51
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,915
Okay, okay, we'll head out then.

52
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,494
- Whoa, it's obvious.
- Totally.

53
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,276
- Let's go.
- go.

54
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,915
- Hey, P'Loy.
- Yeah?

55
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:34,723
So... are you free tomorrow?

56
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,287
Nah, I'm busy.
I'm going to sell fish at the market.

57
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,654
- Can I come with you?
- No.

58
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,514
Eek!

59
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,757
You bastard!
Stop messing with my sister right now!

60
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,391
P'Kaew! stop it!
What the hell are you doing?!

61
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,774
I’m dead serious, Whan.

62
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:59,289
You’re done seeing her.
From now on, stay the hell away.

63
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,310
Kaew, what the hell is wrong with you?

64
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:03,981
I was just talking, man.
That’s all. What’s your problem?!

65
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:06,660
Ow!

66
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:09,232
Someone like you doesn't deserve
to even talk to my sister!

67
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:10,236
P'Kaew!

68
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,877
- Whan!
- Whan!

69
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,036
- Here, take this.
- What?

70
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:34,183
- My clothes.
- Why’re you giving me that?

71
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:38,412
So Phaad will shut up about you
looking like a walking garbage bag.

72
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,312
You think I'm poor, right?
That's why you're giving me your clothes.

73
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:50,241
You don't have to worry about me.
I know I'm poor.

74
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,606
Aren't we friends?

75
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:34,135
Ouch! What was that for?
I'm telling mom!

76
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,824
Ptooey! Snitch!

77
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:37,921
You go wear your mom's sarong!

78
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:40,511
No, you go wear it!

79
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,887
- You don't even have any clothes!
- You gave them to me, Kaew!

80
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:48,499
It's because Loy's poor,
he's poor, Loy's poor!

81
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,530
P'Kaew's mean!

82
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,227
Hey! What's wrong?

83
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:02,266
Mom.

84
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:05,689
I promise you, Mom.

85
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:12,690
From now on, I won’t let anyone
look down on my mother ever again.

86
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:15,850
I promise, Mom.

87
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:22,905
And you, Whan, oh, oh, oh,
does it hurt a lot, honey?

88
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:24,898
You're crying your eyes out!

89
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,355
I'm not crying because I'm in pain, Mom.

90
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:31,358
I'm crying because I feel sorry for P'Loy.

91
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,061
Oh, P'Kaew.

92
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:36,876
What the heck possessed you to do that to P'Loy?

93
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,148
Oh, Whan, look at your own brother!

94
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,026
Your own brother's hurt,
and you're taking that guy's side?

95
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:45,303
- Let me go!
- You're turning a Small problem, into big chaos.

96
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,418
And I’m worried about you, Whan.

97
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:48,951
- Whan!
- Whan! / - Whan!

98
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,047
Whan!

99
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:54,381
- Stop!
- Hey Phaka! Get your ass out here now!

100
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:57,303
Well, well, Whan,
the beautiful girl of Thung Bang Maklua,

101
00:09:57,704 --> 00:10:00,698
But probably no one will get their wish.

102
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:05,124
Because she has given her whole heart to Loy.

103
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:37,981
What's that, Mom?

104
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,961
It's your dad's old shirt.
I found it in a trunk.

105
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:48,642
See? It's still in good shape.

106
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,926
So I'm giving it to you to wear.

107
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:54,418
Later, if we sell the rice,

108
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:59,849
I'll save some money
to buy you a new shirt in town.

109
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,202
- Mom.
- Huh?

110
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:11,404
I'm sorry.

111
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,746
What are you apologizing for, Loy?

112
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,915
Huh?

113
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:20,304
Look.

114
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:26,586
I... can't be a good son.

115
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,741
I've never made you happy.

116
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:34,513
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,544
Hmm... Loy.

118
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,078
Uh?

119
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,965
Have you talked to Kaew yet?

120
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:49,638
He's probably mad at you about something.

121
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,367
How come, Mom?

122
00:11:55,797 --> 00:12:01,947
He probably thinks
I have feelings for his sister.

123
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:04,300
What?

124
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:10,019
You guys have known each
other since you were kids.

125
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:15,757
He knows what kind of person you are, right?

126
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:21,167
That's why he hates me.

127
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,847
He probably thinks
Loy is trying to climb the social ladder.

128
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:29,338
That I want to marry his sister.

129
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,909
Why do you think that?

130
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:40,703
Why wouldn't I think that, Mom?

131
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:44,520
The reason Phaad messed with me,

132
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,067
isn't it because Loy is poor?

133
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:52,497
And the reason Kaew punched me,

134
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:54,815
is because he's protective of his sister.

135
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:57,556
Phaad's going to ask
for Whan's hand in marriage.

136
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:02,705
The dowry will probably be huge.

137
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:04,907
That's why he's so protective.

138
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,432
He doesn't want her getting involved
with someone poor like me.

139
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:24,380
I promise you, Mom.

140
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:31,303
From now on, I won’t let anyone
look down on my mother ever again.

141
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:34,569
I promise, Mom.

142
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:02,026
Aaaargh! It hurts!

143
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,302
Enough, Ughhh... Cut it out already!

144
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,644
What the heck are you screaming about?

145
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,404
It's just a little bump on your head.

146
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,903
I've seen you fall out of a tree
and almost break your leg,

147
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,040
and you didn't make this much fuss.

148
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:18,723
- P'Parik!
- Ouch!

149
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,720
Come on! She's your daughter,
for heaven’s sake!

150
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,962
Loy bullied her like this,
and you're still yelling at her?

151
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:29,303
If it were you who got hurt,
I wouldn't say a word.

152
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,076
Oh, come on, Lamphoei.

153
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:34,286
They were just playing a little rough,
what's the big deal?

154
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,242
What do you mean "playing a little rough"?
Look, look!

155
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:40,971
Look at Kaew,
his lip is all busted up!

156
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:44,862
And you, Whan, oh, oh, oh,
does it hurt a lot, honey?

157
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:46,896
You're crying your eyes out!

158
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:50,520
I'm not crying because I'm in pain, Mom.

159
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:53,202
I'm crying because
I feel sorry for P'Loy.

160
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,935
Oh, P'Kaew.

161
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:58,902
What the heck possessed you to do that to P'Loy?

162
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:02,119
Oh, Whan, look at your own brother!

163
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:05,275
Your own brother's hurt,
and you're taking that guy's side?

164
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:10,869
- Bua, let's go see P'Loy.
- Absolutely not!

165
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,393
Sit down!

166
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:16,167
You're not running off to see any guys anymore.

167
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,181
From now on, you're not going to be
hanging around any of those boatmen.

168
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:21,576
Especially Loy.

169
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,545
Why can't I, Mom?!

170
00:15:24,877 --> 00:15:26,243
No means no. That’s final!

171
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:31,308
This dry season, Kamnan Boonlue is coming to
ask for your hand in marriage for Phaad.

172
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:34,687
If you go around acting all loose,
it won't look good.

173
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:40,558
Oh, Mom! That filthy bastard Phaad?
I wouldn't waste myself on garbage like him!

174
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,120
Oh! This daughter of mine!

175
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:46,152
Whan! My brother, my brother!

176
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:49,386
Watch your mouth!
If you curse him again, I'll...

177
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:52,058
Ow! It hurts... it hurts!

178
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:56,750
P'Kaew.

179
00:15:56,995 --> 00:16:00,810
Seriously, what happened between you and P'Loy?

180
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:03,162
Why did you guys fight like this?

181
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,082
- P'Kaew started it, Bua.
- Enough, You shut your mouth, Whan!

182
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:10,720
Kaew, what happened? Tell me the story.

183
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:17,611
- Whan!
- Whan! / - Whan!

184
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,216
- Whan!
- Whan!

185
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:22,895
Calm down, okay?
Let's just talk this out slowly.

186
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:26,684
If you keep this up,
Aunt Lamphoei will have my head for sure.

187
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,024
True! Calm down first.

188
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,214
I swear,
I'm gonna give Phaka a piece of my mind today!

189
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:37,422
Hey! Don’t do this.

190
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:39,070
This is my problem, not yours!
Get your hands off me!

191
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:41,164
- Let me go!
- You're turning a Small problem, into big chaos.

192
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:43,235
And I’m worried about you, Whan.

193
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,709
- Whan!
- Whan! / - Whan!

194
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,073
- Stop!
- Hey Phaka! Get your ass out here now!

195
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,176
- Come out, you!
- Whan!

196
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,885
- Come out now!
- Whan!

197
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,336
- I swear, I'm gonna smash your head in today!
- Whan!

198
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:59,369
- Let go of me! Ow! Let me go!
- Whan!

199
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,752
- You better get out here right now!
- Whan!

200
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:02,225
Whan!

201
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,041
P'Loy!

202
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,482
Phaka!

203
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,752
I can’t believe P'Loy would mess
around with that bitch Phaka...

204
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:23,925
Toss!

205
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,685
Saeng!

206
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:32,156
Ging!

207
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,028
Duang!

208
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,156
Wow... what a long-ass list!

209
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:44,907
Why are you yelling like a crazy person?

210
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:47,904
Whoa! Whan.

211
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:52,446
- Ow!
- Ugh... Whan...

212
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,654
What the hell is wrong with you?

213
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,392
I'm sorry, okay?

214
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,727
That’s just how I saw it, no offense.

215
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,881
Ugh, there's so many leaves.
Does she ever sweep?

216
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:09,714
- Why don't you go help her sweep?
- Are you kidding?

217
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,205
- Well, you were complaining.
- But there really are a lot.

218
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:15,407
I know about this because...

219
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:21,019
I overheard my uncle from Phetchaburi
talking to my parents about it.

220
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:25,236
My uncle said he wants to make money
and set up a rice mill here.

221
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:28,752
But he doesn't know any buyers in Bangkok.

222
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:36,910
This Phaka is weird, you know. We ask her to
go to the market, and she never does.

223
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:39,178
So, it means that...

224
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:43,085
If I can contact my relatives in Bangkok...

225
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:46,592
And you can contact your uncle in Phetchaburi...

226
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:51,153
We might get money from your uncle
to buy rice from the villagers.

227
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:54,334
Then I’ll ask my relatives in Bangkok

228
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:57,606
to find buyers who export rice.

229
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:01,335
...so they can buy rice from the villagers
at a better price than Kamnan Boonlue offers.

230
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:04,201
That way, the villagers will make more profit.

231
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:09,738
If we can do that, it would be good,
wouldn't it, brother P'Loy?

232
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:13,917
But if Kamnan Boonlue finds out,
it will definitely be a big problem.

233
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,397
Yeah, because we'd be undercutting the headman.

234
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:22,420
But today,
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

235
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:24,528
- Let's go.
- Let's go then.

236
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:32,399
Hey Phaka, let me ask you something.

237
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:36,876
Your uncle is so well-off,
why don't you go live with him?

238
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:38,765
Well...

239
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,913
Well, well, Whan,
the beautiful girl of Thung Bang Maklua,

240
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,435
that all the young men desire

241
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:48,951
But probably no one will get their wish.

242
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:53,271
Because she has given her whole heart to Loy.

243
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:33,203
May the sacred beings be my witness.

244
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:42,422
This Loy swears to love
and remain loyal to Kaew forever..

245
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:49,331
This Kaew also swears to love
and remain unwaveringly loyal to Loy.

246
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:25,262
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

247
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:30,085
I want to keep you close to me.

248
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:37,673
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

249
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:43,511
When you're not here,

250
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,588
know that I'm vulnerable.

251
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:54,063
But our love might be wrong.

252
00:21:54,064 --> 00:22:01,327
Fate might be too cruel to me.

253
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:07,845
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

254
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:13,895
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

255
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:19,063
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

256
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:26,033
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

257
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:32,783
If love is as strange as people say it is.

258
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:37,782
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

259
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:44,690
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

260
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:51,350
Because she has given her whole heart to Loy.
