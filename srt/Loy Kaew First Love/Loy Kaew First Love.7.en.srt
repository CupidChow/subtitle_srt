1
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:33,901
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

2
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,724
I want to keep you close to me.

3
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:46,312
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

4
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,150
When you're not here,

5
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,227
know that I'm vulnerable.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,702
But our love might be wrong.

7
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:09,966
Fate might be too cruel to me.

8
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:16,484
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,534
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

10
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:27,702
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

11
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:34,672
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

12
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:41,422
If love is as strange as people say it is.

13
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:46,421
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

14
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:53,329
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

15
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:59,989
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

16
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:28,185
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

17
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:34,492
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

18
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,576
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

19
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:48,579
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

20
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:56,384
If love is as strange as people say it is.

21
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:01,396
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

22
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:08,334
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

23
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:14,706
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

24
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:32,851
Mom.

25
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:36,205
I promise you, Mom.

26
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:43,290
From now on, I won’t let anyone
look down on my mother ever again.

27
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,425
I promise, Mom.

28
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,382
And you, Whan, oh, oh, oh,
does it hurt a lot, honey?

29
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:55,434
You're crying your eyes out!

30
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:01,750
I'm not crying because I'm in pain, Mom.

31
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:07,478
Oh, Kaew.
What the heck possessed you to do that to Loy?

32
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:10,672
Oh, Whan, look at your own brother!

33
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,713
Your own brother's hurt,
and you're taking that guy's side?

34
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:15,833
- Let me go!
- You're turning a Small problem, into big chaos.

35
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,948
And I’m worried about you, Whan.

36
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:20,426
- Whan!
- Whan! / - Whan!

37
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,965
- Stop!
- Hey Phaka! Get your ass out here now!

38
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,840
Whan, the beautiful girl of Thung Bang Maklua,

39
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,275
But probably no one will get their wish.

40
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:35,710
Because she has given her whole heart to Loy.

41
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:40,353
Hey Phaka, let me ask you something.

42
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:45,001
Your uncle is so well-off,
why don't you go live with him?

43
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:48,514
Well...

44
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:52,384
They had such a big fight
that they cut all family ties.

45
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:55,306
So I didn't dare to go see him.

46
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,015
But you really need to go see your uncle, Phaka.

47
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,495
If you don’t go,
the villagers will keep suffering like this.

48
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:06,345
But Loy, I'm scared there’ll be trouble
with Kamnan Boonlue.

49
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,782
Then… give me your uncle’s address.

50
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:13,609
I'll go look for him myself.

51
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:16,725
I...

52
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:22,741
I’m not really sure where he lives.

53
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:24,874
It’s been so many years already.

54
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:27,990
Can you try to think back slowly?

55
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:33,128
But listen,
don’t let anyone know about this, alright?

56
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:39,207
Phaka, can you try to think it over again?

57
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:44,405
Wait, someone's coming.

58
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:45,284
Let's hurry inside.

59
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:47,118
- Hey!
- Go hide inside the house first.

60
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:50,734
Hurry!

61
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:55,739
- Close the door!
- Close the door!

62
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:09,377
Oh my! Whose cow is that?

63
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:12,652
It's Loy's cow.

64
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:14,942
- Ugh! Not that.
- Oh?

65
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:19,034
Is it true, Phaka?
I heard the rumors all over the market.

66
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:24,052
Ugh! That Phaad is so evil! He's evil,
and his gang is evil too.

67
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:27,493
There's no way he'd suddenly
become a good person.

68
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,909
Yeah, Phaad really cares about his guys.

69
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:35,357
Last time, he and his gang beat up Loy
until he was covered in blood.

70
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:38,648
So how could he beat up his own guys this time?

71
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:46,588
I think that's probably because
Phaad's always had a grudge against Loy.

72
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:51,574
Everyone knows Phaad really likes Whan.

73
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:55,315
But Whan never says anything nice to him.

74
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,487
She only talks nicely to Loy.

75
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,466
So they had a fight, like guys do.

76
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:03,927
But as for those guys,

77
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:07,728
Phaad probably couldn't stand them
trying to mess with me.

78
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:10,403
So Phaad beat them up real bad.

79
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:15,055
Okay girl,
sounds like someone’s got a thing for Phaad.

80
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,845
What's going on with you, Phaka?

81
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:22,125
Uh... well...
I'm just saying what happened. It's nothing.

82
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:27,658
Hey, what's wrong with you?
You're acting all nervous and weird.

83
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,481
Uh... well...
I'm not feeling so good.

84
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:36,280
Oh, you're probably still freaked out
from what happened yesterday.

85
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:40,474
Go, go rest upstairs.
You live alone.

86
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:43,612
We'll go get you some medicine.

87
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,846
- Let's go.
- Oh! No, don't!

88
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:50,188
It's okay, I can take care of myself.

89
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,679
Okay, okay, we'll head out then.

90
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:23,366
- Whoa, it's obvious.
- Totally.

91
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:25,982
- Let's go.
- go.

92
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:34,678
That’s exactly what they mean by
"mishearing something and making wild assumptions.

93
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:39,618
You two nearly made Kaew
and Loy kill each other.

94
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,366
It looked like that! How were we supposed to know
if they were up to something crazy?

95
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,093
You’re the one thinking weird stuff.

96
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,432
We were just discussing something.

97
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:52,637
About having Loy take everyone's harvested rice
this year to sell in Bangkok.

98
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:55,997
So they can buy it straight from us,
not through Kamnan Boonlue’s rice mill.

99
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:59,651
Then why all the secrecy? It’s so shady.

100
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:03,818
Hey! How could we go around
announcing something like this?

101
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:07,541
If Kamnan Boonlue finds out
and it becomes a big deal,

102
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:10,031
you guys will be in trouble.

103
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:14,841
Loy isn’t the kind
to let anyone walk all over him.

104
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:17,564
Otherwise, our kids and grandkids
would never get out of this mess.

105
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:23,057
And Loy's uncle trades in Bangkok.
He must know the merchants there.

106
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:28,450
But Loy himself had never thought of this.

107
00:10:28,888 --> 00:10:30,646
Until that Phaka just thought of it.

108
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,167
Phun, that sneaky Phun.

109
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:37,240
She told us that Loy was secretly
trying to get close to Phaka.

110
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:40,143
So... we just wanted to see what was going on.

111
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:44,101
Alright, enough chit-chat.
Let’s go. Let’s head back.

112
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:51,865
Oh!

113
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:54,602
What are you carrying so much stuff for?

114
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,504
And what are you all doing?

115
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,531
You haven't come to help me at all.

116
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:01,990
Here, sweep the floor too.

117
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:03,474
Wow!

118
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:07,697
- Bua, you treat me like your maid!
- Mmm.

119
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:09,305
Here, this spot too, this spot too.

120
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:10,857
What else is it?

121
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,542
It's here, it's here.
I went to get it for you.

122
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:17,645
Give it here, I'll help.

123
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:20,260
Don't pretend, let Whan do it.

124
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,982
When she's at home, she doesn't do anything.
She's practically crippled.

125
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:24,489
Give it here, give it here.

126
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:30,195
Hey! Whan,
you really thought this through, huh?

127
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:34,295
That’s what happens
when you try to uncover the truth,

128
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:36,633
but end up making a mess instead.

129
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:44,231
Well, this is what they say,
when someone is in love, or love blinds them.

130
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:47,347
From a pig to a dog, then from a dog to a bear!

131
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:49,619
- Hey! It's a chicken.
- Oh, really?

132
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:54,624
Oh! Enough! Stop talking about me!

133
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:56,741
It's that... hmph...

134
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:01,293
It's that Phim and Chomm told Kaew...

135
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:04,928
So I...

136
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:08,470
So you got jealous and saw red!

137
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:12,349
Wait! What jealousy?

138
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,793
Well, well, Whan,
the beautiful girl of Thung Bang Maklua,

139
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:20,147
that all the young men desire

140
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,680
But probably no one will get their wish.

141
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:27,950
Because she has given her whole heart to Loy.

142
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,486
May the sacred beings be my witness.

143
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:47,765
This Loy swears to love
and remain loyal to Kaew forever..

144
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:54,578
This Kaew also swears to love
and remain unwaveringly loyal to Loy.
