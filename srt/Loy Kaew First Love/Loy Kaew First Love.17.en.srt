1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,958
Loy, will everything be okay?

2
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:19,568
The money we have on us isn't much.

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,087
We lost a lot of money just to get this job.

4
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:31,083
Oh well... consider it gaining new experiences.

5
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:33,569
Having come all the way to Bangkok,

6
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,792
it's as different from our home
as heaven and earth!

7
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:42,129
- But still...
- Still what?

8
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:47,910
Being here just doesn’t feel like home.

9
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,109
I've been fishing all day,
when will I catch anything?

10
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,091
Oh! Loy, you were here all along?
I've been looking for you for ages!

11
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,000
Hey Kaew, tone it down, will ya?

12
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:11,122
Can’t you see I’m fishing?
You’re scaring them off!

13
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:14,960
Dude, you’ve been fishing all day
and still got nothing!

14
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:17,834
That’s because
I’m not crazy about fishing like you are!

15
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,340
That’s why I can hardly catch anything.

16
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,689
Why don’t you just do what you actually enjoy?

17
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:27,056
I’m into trading, man! When I grow up,
I’m gonna be a rice seller!

18
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:30,511
It’s not really my thing,
but if you’re doing it, I’ll give you a hand.

19
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:34,565
Just give it here — I’ll handle the fishing.

20
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,630
Whoa, Loy, where’d you get all
these snacks from? There’s a ton!

21
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,425
I got them from the market.

22
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:14,303
Where'd you get that money?

23
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:18,185
I got the fish from Uncle Dam,
sold them to the merchant,

24
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:19,587
and that’s how I got the money.

25
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:23,907
Whoa, Loy, if you keep this up,
you could totally be a merchant when you grow up!

26
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,654
- Don’t forget to help me, okay?
- I won’t forget, don’t worry.

27
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:51,974
You think we did the right thing,
just taking off like that?

28
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,817
If we were still back home,
no one would let us be together.

29
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,922
But here,
people couldn’t care less that we’re together.

30
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:09,512
Hmm.

31
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,951
I miss Phaka.

32
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:14,220
She went off all alone.

33
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:17,207
You think she’ll really find her relatives
in Phetchaburi like she planned?

34
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:19,328
We asked her to come too, but she said no.

35
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,124
Phaka’s super tough.
She’s always handled things on her own.

36
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:27,099
I wouldn’t be surprised
if she’s actually better than us.

37
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:35,805
Now that you mention it, I kinda miss my mom too.

38
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,058
Hey, the boat's docking!

39
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:46,710
Let’s go grab our shift sticks.

40
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,762
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

41
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:15,876
- Top me off.
- Yeah, pour some more.

42
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:19,711
I'll pour for you, I'll pour for you.

43
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,761
Bottoms up, pal!

44
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,857
Here—take it! Cheers!

45
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:33,285
- Do it, man!
- Hold up, dude!

46
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:34,742
Fine, take it then!

47
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,292
Hey, Saeng.

48
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:48,788
Man, why do we always end up eating together?

49
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,263
I'm completely fed up with seeing your face.

50
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,374
Then what do you want me to do?

51
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:56,011
Well, I love you, Toss.

52
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,783
You damn wretch!

53
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,686
When will you stop being such a nutcase?

54
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,422
Only when I die and leave you.

55
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,958
Then when will you finally die?

56
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,902
- So annoying!
- I don't know...

57
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,152
...when death will come
and separate me from you.

58
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:22,098
All I know is...

59
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,617
Right now, I love you, Toss.

60
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,049
What are you blabbering about?

61
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:30,544
Ouch!

62
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:32,779
Ouch!

63
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:35,527
You damn wretch, what are you blabbering about?

64
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:38,430
Hey! You guys! Hey! You guys!

65
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,123
- Hey! You guys!
- Ouch! What's wrong with you, Phaen?

66
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,899
- It's all spilled now!
- Hey! Saeng!

67
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:46,412
Get up first, get up.

68
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,232
A letter!

69
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,596
- What letter?
- A letter!

70
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:50,741
What letter?

71
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:53,250
- Look! Look at the letter!
- What's wrong with you?

72
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:56,582
- Whoa!
- Oi!

73
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,893
Mama... I'm back.

74
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,176
Loy!

75
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:18,702
Mama!

76
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,308
How have you been, Loy?

77
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:26,686
Come here, let me look at your face.

78
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,303
How have you been?

79
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,886
Oh,

80
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:38,022
Oh, my boy.

81
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,199
Mama!

82
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:43,220
I'm really sorry, Mama…

83
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,561
for all the hardship you had to go through
because of me.

84
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:49,631
How have you been holding up, Mama?

85
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,260
I'm fine.

86
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:59,010
Me too, I'm really sorry, Mom.

87
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:08,119
You're saying sorry
for taking Loy and running off?

88
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,422
Or could it be...

89
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:14,050
...Should I go apologize to his father?

90
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,573
...for my son taking you away?

91
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,321
Huh?

92
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:24,518
- What is it, my boy?
- Mama.

93
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:25,773
Mom.

94
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,331
Just look at them.

95
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:35,019
You missed me, didn’t you?
Bet you missed my cooking too.

96
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:40,697
Loy’s always telling me how good your cooking is.
I’ve been dying to try it!

97
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,082
Come on… Loy, go grab the plates.

98
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,442
- Go on, you.
- We’ll eat in a bit.

99
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:48,840
- Go give my mom a hand.
- Sure thing!

100
00:07:49,347 --> 00:07:50,607
I just wanna hug Mom again.

101
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:59,160
- Hey, Whan.
- Huh?

102
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:01,545
I seriously can't decide what to eat today.

103
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:04,592
What's cooking at your place?
I'm thinking of inviting myself over.

104
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,422
I haven't cooked taro stalk curry
since P’Loy left.

105
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:12,437
- Hmm?
- Lately, I’ve been having lotus stem soup .

106
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:17,987
Ohhh... lotus stem soup , huh.

107
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,305
Hey, are you being dirty-minded?

108
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:26,274
Noooo... well... lately Gimm keeps
bringing me lotus stems all the time.

109
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,318
So... I’ve been eating
lotus stem soup with fish... yep...

110
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,598
Having lotus stem soup with fish...

111
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,380
Oh... so now you're making lotus stem soup.

112
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,229
So you’re not depending on P’Loy anymore, huh?

113
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:40,811
I don’t think P’Loy’s coming back.

114
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,373
Hey, Whan! Bua!

115
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:45,228
- What?!
- Huh?!

116
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:47,552
Ugh, what’s his deal?

117
00:08:47,915 --> 00:08:49,739
- Ugh, fine!
- Phaen...

118
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:51,728
- Phaen...
- Ugh, what?

119
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,890
Phaen! Phaen!!

120
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:56,708
Phaen! Hey, Phaen!!

121
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,980
- Ugh! What now?!
- Ugh!

122
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,414
- Phaen, Phaen said...
- Yeah, / - yeah!

123
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,152
P'Loy and P'Kaew are coming back.

124
00:09:03,153 --> 00:09:04,629
- Huh!
- What! / - Phaen...

125
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:07,009
Phaen is running over to tell us.

126
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,510
- Well, what are we waiting for?!
- Go! Go! Go!

127
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,743
- Do we really have to rush that much?
- Yeah, come on!

128
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,086
Hey!

129
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,416
Spill it. Everything.

130
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:54,641
What's wrong? Why are you panting like that?

131
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:57,613
Look who's talking.

132
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:02,875
Because I love you.

133
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:06,429
I love you too.

134
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,047
You’re acting like it’s our first time.

135
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,930
Every time with you feels like the first time.

136
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:34,940
If I could choose...

137
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:38,381
Would you still choose me?

138
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:48,269
It's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

139
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,005
...is getting to be yours.

140
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,783
And you getting to be mine.

141
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,661
Then why wouldn't I choose it?

142
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,185
I love you, Kaew.

143
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,845
I love you too, Loy.

144
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,216
Hey! What the hell is going on between you two?

145
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:35,249
Phaad!

146
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:40,035
Great! Great!

147
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:43,148
I’ll let everyone in on your secret.

148
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:45,995
I’m dying to know.

149
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:49,930
...what if Phaka finds out
she’s into freaks like you?

150
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:53,245
- ...what her reaction will be.
- Don’t even think about it, Phad!

151
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:54,957
Please, I’m begging you.

152
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,219
Fine! I won’t tell a soul.

153
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:01,066
Alright, make Whan marry me then!

154
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,387
But Whan doesn't love you, Phaad.

155
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:07,204
Whether she loves me or not,
what does it even matter?

156
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:10,857
That's enough, Phaad.
What do you want from me? Spit it out.

157
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:14,098
Well, then I’ll take your sister’s virginity.

158
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,738
Just once, that's all I’m asking!

159
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,912
And I promise that
I'll keep this matter to laugh about by myself.

160
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:24,903
I won’t tell a soul.
