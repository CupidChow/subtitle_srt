1
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:33,901
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

2
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,724
I want to keep you close to me.

3
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:46,312
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

4
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,150
When you're not here,

5
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,227
know that I'm vulnerable.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,702
But our love might be wrong.

7
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:09,966
Fate might be too cruel to me.

8
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:16,484
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,534
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

10
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:27,702
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

11
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:34,672
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

12
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:41,422
If love is as strange as people say it is.

13
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:46,421
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

14
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:53,329
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

15
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:59,989
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

16
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:28,185
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

17
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:34,492
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

18
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,576
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

19
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:48,579
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

20
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:56,384
If love is as strange as people say it is.

21
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:01,396
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

22
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:08,334
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

23
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:14,706
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

24
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:36,819
- I'm getting married, you know?
- Oh, Duang! It’s just having a husband.

25
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:41,721
Oh my God! Spirits of the fields and rivers,
I hope they could see it for once!

26
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,762
- Kaew!
- If you're so fast, then come and get me, Loy!

27
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:47,298
- Aah!... Aaaargh!...
- Kaew!

28
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,184
This is so indecent!

29
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:54,355
- Hold up!
- Where the hell are you goin'?

30
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:56,501
Go on, do it again!

31
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:04,797
I'm really gettin' a kick outta this.

32
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:08,154
Remember this, you guys. If you’re born broke,

33
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:10,415
this is all you’ll ever be.

34
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,573
You!

35
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:15,833
You don't have to keep peeling fish for him.
Phaad's got hands.

36
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:18,123
Let him eat it himself,
or are you gonna feed him?

37
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,557
- Really? Then let me!
- Phun!

38
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,765
You're going too far, you Phun!

39
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:32,488
I got hands,
don’t I? I can eat on my own!

40
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,440
You don't have to butt in, you bitch!

41
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:37,240
- Okay, okay, hand it over!
- Whoa! / - Hey!

42
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,620
- That’s enough already!
- Phaad!

43
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:41,153
- Mae Samorn!
- Come on, just one last sip for me and Dad?

44
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:44,961
- I said no!
- Mae Samorn! / -Mom!

45
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,537
- Come on!
- Ow!

46
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,758
- You just don’t get what it’s like to be a man!
- So what’re we supposed to eat now, Phaad?

47
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:52,803
- How about a little salt, Pa?
- Maybe you’d like some fish, huh?

48
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:53,985
Want some fish, P'Phaad?

49
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:56,251
- Eat some salt first, son.
- Should I feed you?

50
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:20,514
Ugh!

51
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:23,045
What's wrong, Loy?

52
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:26,054
Nothing, Mom. I saw a mouse run past.

53
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:28,557
Mouse? What mouse?

54
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:51,687
Many days passed.

55
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,720
This nice gun is from Bangkok!

56
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:06,204
You know, when I bought this gun,

57
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:08,651
I had to wear a hat all the time
when I went anywhere.

58
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:12,730
Because it was the Mala leads Thailand era.
Believe the leader, the nation survives.

59
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,813
Having this one gun is better than
having a lot of wives.

60
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,836
Oh Mom, I'm so tired.

61
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,342
Mae Lamphoei, look at Kaew.

62
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,103
He's sitting there spacing out
like someone heartbroken.

63
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:45,925
Tch, this one, coming to talk about my child.

64
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:53,186
Uh, it's been almost half a month
since Loy got his head whacked by Phaad.

65
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:56,752
I hope Loy isn't thinking
about getting revenge on Phaad.

66
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,767
I already talked to Kamnan Boonlue
to help warn Phaad a bit.

67
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:04,708
Uh, so how's Loy doing?

68
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:07,549
Kaew!

69
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:09,872
- Yes, Dad.
- How's Loy doing?

70
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,153
I don't know, Dad.

71
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:16,273
Hey! How can you not know?
You guys are best friends!

72
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:20,655
Well, ever since that day,
I haven't gone to see him, Dad.

73
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:22,870
Oh, why?

74
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:30,128
Well, P'Kaew's just been
being a couch potato at home, Dad.

75
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:34,019
Being such good friends,
you should go see each other.

76
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,081
You really have no heart at all, do you?

77
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:40,213
I'm not heartless like you think I am, Whan!

78
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:46,194
If you're not heartless,
maybe you've just lost interest in your friend.

79
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:49,363
What do you mean by that, Whan?

80
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:56,339
Dad, it's probably because P'Kaew
secretly has feelings for only Bua.

81
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:04,088
Hey Dad, the other day I saw P'Kaew
and P'Loy hanging out in the fields.

82
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:08,336
P'Loy just got hurt,
instead of letting him rest.

83
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:14,033
Well... I did let him rest,
that's why I didn't go bother him.

84
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:20,162
Hey P'Kaew, should we go see P'Loy?

85
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,017
But wait a minute.

86
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:27,961
Let me go make some taro stalk curry,
P'Loy's favorite, first.

87
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,465
Hey, hey, hey, no need,
Whan. Sit down.

88
00:11:32,703 --> 00:11:35,446
Just do what's appropriate.
You're not a kid anymore.

89
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,919
If you keep running back and forth to see a guy,
people are going to get the wrong idea.

90
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:42,929
- But I miss P'Loy, Dad.
- Tch! This girl!

91
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,621
- Phuyai Prik, Phuyai Prik.
- Huh?

92
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:50,769
It's me, Loy.
My mom told me to bring fish as a gift.

93
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:52,232
P'Loy!

94
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:55,086
- Hey! This girl!
- Hey! This girl!

95
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:13,383
A spoon, A spoon.

96
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:14,872
- Ugh, this kid...
- Here's a spoon for you...

97
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:17,500
Thanks.

98
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:21,540
Dad!

99
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,207
Use a spoon! No hands!

100
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:27,160
Geez, what’s with you, Whan?

101
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:29,557
I’ve been eating with my hands my whole life.

102
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,660
Oh, so suddenly hands
are too low-class for you now?

103
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:36,238
You know,
civilized people don’t eat with their hands.

104
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:38,359
The big boss kept shouting.

105
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:41,491
That our people gotta be
as good as them civilized foreign countries.

106
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:43,324
And you're supposed to be the village head, huh?

107
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:48,285
Damn it, girl! Are you my kid or my mom?

108
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:49,865
Man, whoever ends up being your,

109
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:52,565
kid or your husband…
poor soul, they'll just drop dead from stress!

110
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,546
Hey! You guys,
why aren't you eating? Huh? Loy, Kaew!

111
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:07,787
Or trying to be all classy like Whan now, huh?

112
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:08,893
Dad!

113
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,409
Nah, that's not it.

114
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:16,083
It's just that I still got a bit of a headache,
so I don't really feel like eating much.

115
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:19,255
Alright, what about you, Kaew?

116
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:22,862
Well, I'm full, Dad.
I'm gonna go crash. I'm sleepy.

117
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:25,340
Hey! What's up with him?

118
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:48,678
Thought you were going to bed.
What’re you doing out here?

119
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:54,453
Wait, weren't you the one with the headache?
Why’re you still here?

120
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:01,960
Wait! Loy!

121
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,402
I know you're mad at me.

122
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:12,503
- I'm sorry.
- What are you apologizing for?

123
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:16,297
- It's about...
- About you kissing me?

124
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:22,240
What did you do? Do you even realize?

125
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,250
You don't need to apologize to me.

126
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:29,592
Someone like me has nothing to forgive you for.

127
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:54,305
Whoa!

128
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:45,190
Whoa! You guys scared the crap outta me!

129
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:48,875
What are you guys doing blocking my way?
Back off!

130
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,054
- Hold on!
- Hold on!

131
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,350
Well, well, look who it is... sweet Phaka.

132
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:00,960
Look at you, why are you shaking like that?

133
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:06,478
And all these veggies,
why bother carrying all that heavy stuff?

134
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:10,038
You don't even get much money selling them.

135
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:19,453
I think you should spend your time
having fun with us instead, Phaka.

136
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:22,169
You filthy-mouthed dogs!

137
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,216
If you got so much free time,

138
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,692
why don't you go back
and suck on your mama's tit!

139
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,701
This girl!

140
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:29,727
I went out of my way to talk to you nicely,
but you had the nerve to disrespect my mother!

141
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:32,248
You're really asking for it! Oh!

142
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,624
What are you looking at me for? Go grab her!

143
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:41,270
- Go!
- Eek!

144
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,718
- Eek! Help me, somebody!
- Now it's my turn!

145
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:46,618
I told you—let her go!

146
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,067
Hey! Let her go!

147
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,183
Let her go!

148
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:07,294
Why don’t we have our way with Phaka first,
then dump her body?

149
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:10,378
I'll let you go first.

150
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:12,803
- Ouch!
- Bro, bro, bro!

151
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:20,561
You three,
better get this through your thick skulls!

152
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,808
From now on,
Lay a finger on her again, and you’ll regret it!

153
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:25,973
Next time, there won’t be a warning.

154
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,043
And you three,
hurry up and apologize to Phaka!

155
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:33,847
Hurry up! What are you waiting for?

156
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,015
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

157
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,895
And you guys better remember this!

158
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:43,317
Go! Get outta this village!

159
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,577
- Go on!
- You’ll pay for this, just you wait!

160
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,216
Uh, P'Phaad.

161
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:54,814
I think... it doesn't have to go that far.

162
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,727
I don't want anyone
to get into trouble because of me.

163
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,548
You're so kind, Phaka.

164
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,756
But no matter what,

165
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:10,173
those three deserve to be punished
for what they did.

166
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:26,769
As for the damaged stuff,
I'll have someone bring you money for it later.

167
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:32,950
From now on,
you’re under my protection.

168
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:41,903
You should head home now.

169
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:27,558
I think that's probably because
P'Phaad's always had a grudge against P'Loy.

170
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:32,544
Everyone knows P'Phaad really likes Whan.

171
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:36,304
But P'Whan never says anything nice to him.

172
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:39,452
She only talks nicely to P'Loy.

173
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,423
So they had a fight, like guys do.

174
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:47,691
Okay girl,
sounds like someone’s got a thing for P'Phaad.

175
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:50,519
What's going on with you, Phaka?

176
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:15,559
Ow!

177
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:18,132
Someone like you doesn't deserve
to even talk to my sister!

178
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,137
P'Kaew!

179
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:22,070
P'Loy!

180
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:24,805
Whan!
