1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,120
P'Phaad!… P'Phaad!…

2
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:20,538
- Brother... We're in deep trouble.
- What the hell is going on with you guys?

3
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,995
- What?
- Do you know,

4
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:27,025
what we just saw out there?

5
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:32,080
What's wrong with you guys?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,381
Oh, P'Phaad,

7
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:36,504
if you knew what we saw, you'd freak out way
more than if you'd seen a ghost.

8
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:38,994
Just tell me!

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,577
Calm down.

10
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:42,706
- You saw it, Just spit it out, Mun!
- Come on, you say it.

11
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:44,762
You saw it first,
so you should be the one to tell him!

12
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,617
Keep messing around and I’ll kick your ass!

13
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:48,820
- Calm down, brother, calm down.
- Hmph!

14
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:49,861
If you're gonna talk, talk.

15
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:52,342
- If not, then get lost.
- Alright, alright! We'll tell you!

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,537
Sorry, brother.

17
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,034
We... we saw Loy.

18
00:00:57,773 --> 00:01:01,595
We saw Loy, Duang, Gimm,

19
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:05,731
- Who else?
- Whan! Oh!

20
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:08,969
- Who?!
- Whan, your beloved woman, P'Phad!

21
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:12,272
And... Toss... and Saeng.

22
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,249
They’re all over at Phaka’s place.

23
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,639
It’s not just Phaka and Loy like you said.

24
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,665
- So what?
- Aow!

25
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:23,506
Brother, it’s the plan we talked about!

26
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:29,781
The one where you were supposed to trick Whan
into catching Loy and Phaka alone.

27
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:33,682
But now, everyone’s there.

28
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:36,069
- So what?
- Come on!

29
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,327
So we’re gonna get beaten up by you for nothing?

30
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:41,030
- You told us to trick Phaka, remember?
- Exactly.

31
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:44,415
So, what now, brother?

32
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:00,911
- Jeez! Where are you rushing off to?
- Hurry up, Nual! Sis.

33
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,865
- I can't run anymore!
- Come on, move it!

34
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:08,272
- Over here! Over here! Hurry!
- What’s going on?

35
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:13,240
- They say this place is haunted… Aaaahh!!
- Boo!

36
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:17,171
Geez, Gimm! You're such a kid!

37
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:18,635
You really scared me!

38
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:20,325
Don’t be scared, it’s okay!

39
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:21,908
Ooooh…

40
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:26,469
There’s three of us here,
but you’re only teasing one, huh, Gimm?

41
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:29,591
Always up to something, aren’t you, Gimm?

42
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,900
So you’re not mad anymore, huh?

43
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,196
You disappeared for a while there.

44
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:37,280
So you could tell I was mad?

45
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,451
But... hmm...

46
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,949
I wonder if someone around here noticed...

47
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:45,633
Come on, we all saw that.

48
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,366
That’s just how I am, Nual, Sis.

49
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:52,712
I sulk by myself,
and get over it by myself too.

50
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:57,085
Can’t stay mad too long...
I’d miss seeing her face.

51
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:04,211
Doesn’t matter if I live or die,
Whan wouldn’t give a damn.

52
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:09,016
So here I am, coming to see her myself.

53
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,052
Here, I brought you a bunch of lotus stems.

54
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:18,501
I brought them so you can make curry.
Yours is the best,

55
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:19,893
- You know that, right?
- Ooh la la!

56
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:28,186
So, where are you heading off to?

57
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:30,419
We were thinking of picking some taro.

58
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,354
We’re making taro curry for P'Loy,
so we’re going to pick some.

59
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:39,819
Hey, Whan, let me ask you something.

60
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:44,918
Are you saying my lotus stem curry
doesn’t even compare to P'Loy’s taro curry?

61
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,905
You do know taro curry
makes your mouth itchy, right?

62
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,819
Hey! Don’t cross the line!

63
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:56,249
So what? If it itches, it’s my mouth, not yours.

64
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:59,733
Whan! Gimm brought you those lotus stems,
you know—out of the kindness of her heart.

65
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,559
Yeah, yeah, I know—it’s your mouth, not mine.

66
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:08,446
C’mon... won’t you just give mine a little taste?

67
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:11,949
Bet you’ll end up addicted to it.

68
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:16,348
Hey! Gimm, don’t you go running
your mouth like that at me again!

69
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:19,748
I know exactly what you're hinting at,
don't act innocent.

70
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,883
Why don’t you take your flirting somewhere else?

71
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,149
Just go!

72
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:28,357
Who else would I tease?
You’re the only one I’ve got eyes for.

73
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,507
I love you—more than you’ll ever know, Whan.

74
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,802
Wow, thank you so much for loving me.

75
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,711
Burn this into that thick skull of yours—
I. Don’t. Love. You.

76
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:43,009
And I will never love you.
Because my heart belongs to P'Loy—and only him.

77
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:46,150
Now go cry your heart out. At home. Alone.

78
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:49,447
Hold on a sec! I gotta ask you something.

79
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:54,481
How the hell did lotus stems
and taro get dragged into this? Tell me.

80
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:58,238
Well… you see…
the thing about the lotus stems is…

81
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:01,597
Geez, Duang! You’re so clueless!

82
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,197
- Ugh!
- You should’ve known, seriously!

83
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,055
Let’s get outta here.

84
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:14,924
Hey, aren’t you gonna wait up for me?

85
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:19,285
Whan, I do love you, you know that?

86
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:23,449
I’ll go pick some taro—uh,
I mean lotus stems! Again!

87
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,358
I’ll bring it right to your house, alright?

88
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,151
Hey! Use your spoon!

89
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,827
Oh, the ‘civilized’ spoon again...

90
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,805
Well then, who taught you to eat with your hands?

91
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,003
What a daughter...

92
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:38,352
Here’s your spoon, Mom.

93
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:46,226
Hey! Where the hell is Kaew?
Why isn’t he here for dinner?

94
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:48,939
He’s off somewhere with Loy again.

95
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:56,647
Those two are a strange pair.
Sometimes they fight like it's life or death.

96
00:05:57,005 --> 00:06:00,145
Other times, they act like they're inseparable.

97
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,072
Come on, eat up.

98
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:13,353
Mmm...

99
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:17,403
This lotus stem curry’s real tasty.
Did you make it, Nual?

100
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:22,515
Whan cooked it.

101
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:24,774
Well damn, Whan!

102
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,274
When’d you go pick these lotus stems, huh?

103
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:31,284
Normally, I always see you making taro curry.

104
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:34,790
Every time I eat it,
my mouth starts itching like crazy.

105
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,115
It was Gimm who picked
the lotus stems for Whan.

106
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:52,978
You know, Gimm’s not bad at all.
She’s always hanging around, looking after Whan.

107
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:59,541
I swear, if she were a boy,
Phaad wouldn’t be the only one after Whan.

108
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,517
Kinda feel sorry for her, to be honest.

109
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,321
Her mother wanted a son.

110
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:09,874
So she raised Gimm as if she were a boy.

111
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:18,614
So, dinner ready yet, my dear wife?

112
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,424
- It’s ready, dear.
- So, what are we having, sweetie?

113
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,117
I made lotus stem curry, honey.

114
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,704
Ahh! It’s all over the place!

115
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:31,168
Mom's gonna spank me for sure!
What do I do, Gimm?

116
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:32,188
Gimm.

117
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:41,289
Here, take this one. It’s from my place.
That way, you won’t get in trouble, Whan.

118
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:44,955
What about you?

119
00:07:45,594 --> 00:07:47,639
If someone has to get punished, I’ll do it.

120
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:27,606
Whan,

121
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,244
What's wrong?

122
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,666
I noticed you've been spacing out since dinner.

123
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,180
Are you sick?

124
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,093
Nual, sis...

125
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:48,543
Have you ever been in love?

126
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,120
Yes, I have.

127
00:08:57,854 --> 00:09:02,502
But I've never had any luck in love.

128
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:11,389
And... what are people like
when love doesn’t go their way?

129
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,887
What are they like?

130
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:20,509
Well...

131
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:26,750
They're really quite unfortunate.

132
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:37,458
If we already know that love won't work out,

133
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:40,098
then why do we still choose to love?

134
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:46,843
Just to experience love.

135
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,762
True love...

136
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:54,657
isn't about who you love,

137
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:58,583
or what you get in return.

138
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:04,640
Because love is beyond all reason.

139
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:07,830
Even if it hurts,

140
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:14,544
it's... still better
than never having loved at all.

141
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:52,820
If you knew that our love…

142
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,817
would never be fulfilled,

143
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:58,620
would you still love me, Loy?

144
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,620
Even if I knew I had to die a thousand times,

145
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,497
I would still love you, Kaew.

146
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:12,105
Even if I only got to love you
for a single breath,

147
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:17,032
And how long could you love me for?

148
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:23,595
For as long as I still draw breath.

149
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:29,013
Every breath I have... it’s all yours, Loy.

150
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:46,270
Thanks, Mom.

151
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:51,518
Why is that?

152
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:54,886
Does the food not suit your taste?

153
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,416
Are you just not hungry?

154
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:02,766
But... um...

155
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,918
Came back tired from dance rehearsal...

156
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,520
Eat up lots.

157
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,713
So you can quickly go take a bath.

158
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:20,261
So you can quickly go rest.

159
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:24,149
The Wai Kru ceremony is approaching.

160
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,583
You might end up getting sick.

161
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:32,656
Oh, Mom dear...

162
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,678
Mom, please stop nagging me.

163
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:38,430
This is enough to break my heart.

164
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:40,611
Then what’s going on?

165
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:43,308
Is that why you ran away...?

166
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:48,464
And you skipped out on that Lakorn Nok rehearsal.

167
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:51,234
Did Bua tattle to you, Mom?

168
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,968
It doesn’t matter who told me.

169
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,323
Why don’t you just tell me?

170
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,572
Why did you do that, huh?!

171
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:09,596
Oh Mae Ieat, please don’t scold Loy.

172
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,556
Loy’s just scared he won’t be good at it.

173
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,957
When he dances, it’s not the most graceful.

174
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:20,430
If he messes up the dance,
he gets embarrassed in front of others.

175
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,188
Let them talk, Mom. It's no big deal.

176
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,300
They keep calling Loy a loser, huh?

177
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,557
He can’t even do a simple dance, huh?

178
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:34,640
Phad, head over to Mae Ieat’s place with Loy.

179
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,942
And make sure to tell him.

180
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:42,160
I’m giving him just three months.
If he doesn’t pay up by then...

181
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:46,452
…I’ll seize his land. No more talk.

182
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:49,534
He’ll have to get himself off my land.
Immediately.

183
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:51,620
- Go now, Phad!
- On it, Mom!

184
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:53,128
This is right up Phad’s alley.

185
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:56,044
- Loy, stop!
- Phad!

186
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:00,789
- Oh no! Loy!
- Loy, stop!

187
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:02,729
- Phad! Loy!
- Grab him!

188
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,100
- Stop!
- Stay put! / - Don't move!

189
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:08,221
- Please! Don't do anything to Loy!
- Be quiet, Mae Ieat.

190
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,686
This is none of your business.

191
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:11,256
Please! I'm begging you!

192
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,303
- Phad!
- Loy!

193
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,187
- Get on your knees, damn it!
- I told you to sit your ass down.

194
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:19,208
- Still? Still?!
- Phad!

195
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:58,971
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

196
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:03,794
I want to keep you close to me.

197
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:11,382
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

198
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,220
When you're not here,

199
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:23,297
know that I'm vulnerable.

200
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,772
But our love might be wrong.

201
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:35,036
Fate might be too cruel to me.

202
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:41,554
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

203
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:47,604
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

204
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:52,772
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

205
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:59,742
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

206
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:06,492
If love is as strange as people say it is.

207
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:11,491
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

208
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:18,399
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

209
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:25,059
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

210
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:53,255
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

211
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:59,562
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

212
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,646
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

213
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:13,649
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

214
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:21,454
If love is as strange as people say it is.

215
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:26,466
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

216
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:33,404
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

217
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:39,776
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.
