1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,217
Phuyai Prik!

2
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,817
- Is Phuyai Prik around?
- Phuyai!

3
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:17,080
Oh, Phuyai!

4
00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:20,091
- Phuyai Prik!
- Where did Phuyai go?

5
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:21,987
- Phuyai!
- Phuyai Prik!

6
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:23,427
Oh, Phuyai!

7
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:26,474
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
What's going on with you all?

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,469
Screaming like someone just died.

9
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:34,072
Die, die! Definitely die. If we don't hurry now,
someone will definitely die.

10
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:36,655
And where is Phuyai, P'Nual?

11
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,220
He went to the temple, he'll be back soon.

12
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:41,166
What's wrong with all of you?

13
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:43,558
Who, who died, who did what?

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,557
Don't ask anything yet, P'Nual.

15
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:48,401
Hurry and go get Phuyai to go to Phaka's house.

16
00:00:48,602 --> 00:00:50,888
If we delay, Phaka will be in trouble.

17
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:53,141
Yes, I'll go get the others myself.

18
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:54,924
- Let's go!
- Go!

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,797
Must hurry and find Phuyai.

20
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:13,982
Phaka!

21
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,165
- Phaka!
- Phaka!

22
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,542
- Phaka!
- Phaka!

23
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:24,312
Where do you want me to look,
Phim, Duang, Chomm?

24
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:25,694
I don't see anything at all.

25
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:31,247
I'm not someone you can mess around with!

26
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:34,988
You came running, all panicked,
and told me and Chomm...

27
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:37,916
You said Phaka was about to be killed!
And now what?

28
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:42,721
We even rushed off to report it to Phuyai,
and now that we're here—there's nothing at all!

29
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:48,127
I was just walking by earlier
and heard what sounded like a fight going on.

30
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:51,165
But I didn’t dare go in there alone.

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,549
- So I went to get...
- Huh?

32
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:57,340
- Wait a second!
- Whoa!

33
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:59,142
- What was that? What sound was that?
- Whoa!

34
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:03,002
- I have to go in and check.
- Be careful, Phuyai!

35
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:07,506
Be careful, Phuyai.

36
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,090
- Oh!
- Eek!

37
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:10,948
- Completely startled!
- Hey!

38
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:24,809
- Hmph! - Yah!
- Eek!

39
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,181
- Phuyai!
- Oh! So scary.

40
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:29,564
I've got goosebumps all over.

41
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,602
Hey!

42
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:44,075
Hey! Hey!

43
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:46,834
What's wrong with you guys?

44
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,324
You're here?

45
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:08,070
Sorry about that, I was in a bit of a rush,
so this is all I could manage.

46
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:12,212
Don’t worry about it, Mae Phaka.

47
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:20,255
I really feel sorry for those three.

48
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:23,698
Screaming like water buffaloes being slaughtered.
Do they really think we’re going to kill them?

49
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,730
I really feel sorry for Namchok.

50
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,353
From now on, there’s no me, no you guys.

51
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:38,943
How’s it going to make it?

52
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:58,651
Namchok.

53
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:02,787
From now on,
you have to learn to stand on your own.

54
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:05,430
From now on, you won’t have me around anymore.

55
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:08,505
I’m sorry I have to go.

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,632
Even if I stay,
I probably won't be of any use to anyone anyway.

57
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:21,729
You have to be able to handle things on your own.

58
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,413
I'm sorry that I have to leave.

59
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:28,596
I don't want to leave you at all.

60
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:36,520
When I leave, I'll really miss you, Namchok.

61
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,716
You have to be able to stand on your own.

62
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,691
Don’t be stubborn, alright? Got it?

63
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:58,128
P’Loy, P’Kaew, I think we should get moving.

64
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:02,321
I think we should split up quickly
before anyone spots us.

65
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:06,186
Take this money.

66
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,553
If I go get it myself,
my mom will definitely be suspicious.

67
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:19,758
Have you thought carefully, Phaka,
about not running away with us?

68
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,313
You two go ahead without me.
Don't drag me along as dead weight.

69
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,679
As for me, I already have a place to go.

70
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,271
Thanks so much for helping us
raise Namchok all this time.

71
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:35,731
But why don’t you want to stay with Phaad?

72
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,361
I know how P'Phaad feels about me.

73
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,491
If I stay any longer,
I’ll just end up being Phaad’s mistress.

74
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:49,479
It’s probably better if I just leave like this.

75
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,830
By the way, what about you two?

76
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,131
Going just the two of you like this,
aren’t you thinking of taking any girls along?

77
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:15,521
You’re one of them! And you’re the other one!

78
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:20,612
You three,
are you finally going to tell the truth?

79
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,303
Why did the three of you

80
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:26,986
get beaten almost to death by Loy
and Kaew in Phaka's house like that?

81
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:30,245
- I’ve already told you everything, bro.
- Huh? Why!

82
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:34,613
That Phun hired us to trick Loy,

83
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,987
Telling him you were going to sell Phaka
to a brothel.

84
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:45,142
Then you and Loy would get into a fight.

85
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,365
And then Whan would end up hating you.

86
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,356
So nobody else could steal you from Phun.

87
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:57,315
Hmph!

88
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:03,400
And you... What do you have to say?

89
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:07,442
- And... last night... Phun...
- What about her?!

90
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:10,660
She wanted to pay us to kill Phaka.

91
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:13,644
And take her and bury her behind the village.

92
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:17,949
So that Loy would believe
you trafficked Phaka as well.

93
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:21,878
Hmph!

94
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:26,164
Why… You… Say it!

95
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,733
But...

96
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,806
- Why!
- But I didn't see Phaka at all today, brother.

97
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,166
As for us, we only saw Loy and Kaew.

98
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,249
They set an ambush for us at Phaka's house.

99
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,925
But... I think

100
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:44,000
Loy probably took Phaka and ran away, brother.

101
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:45,008
Enough!

102
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,087
You three, get the hell out of this house, now!

103
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:51,777
And don't ever show your face here again!

104
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,505
Go! You can go now.

105
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:02,860
Argh.... Why!

106
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:07,296
Why the hell is this happening to me? Damn!

107
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:14,997
But still,

108
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,527
I must be truly wicked, just like everyone says.

109
00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:21,541
I won't do anything to you.

110
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:28,567
I just want Phun to realize
she’s no match for you.

111
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:37,839
I, Phaad, swear to the spirits and tree goddesses,

112
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,231
that I, Phaad, love Mae Phaka sincerely.

113
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:45,866
If only you’d love me back… even just a little.

114
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,235
If we were back home,
nobody would let us be together.

115
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:57,350
But here, no one even cares if we’re in love.

116
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,476
I really miss Phaka.

117
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:09,717
Going alone like that, will she be able to meet
her relatives in Phetchaburi like she intended?

118
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:43,939
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

119
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,762
I want to keep you close to me.

120
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:56,350
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

121
00:09:56,728 --> 00:10:02,188
When you're not here,

122
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:08,265
know that I'm vulnerable.

123
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:12,740
But our love might be wrong.

124
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:20,004
Fate might be too cruel to me.

125
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:26,522
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

126
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:32,572
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

127
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:37,740
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

128
00:10:38,673 --> 00:10:44,710
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

129
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:51,460
If love is as strange as people say it is.

130
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:56,459
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

131
00:10:56,704 --> 00:11:03,367
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

132
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:10,027
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

133
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:38,223
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

134
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:44,530
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

135
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:49,614
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

136
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:58,617
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

137
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:06,422
If love is as strange as people say it is.

138
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:11,434
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

139
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:18,372
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

140
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:24,744
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.
