1
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,073
Yeah, we both love each other,
and it’s been a long time now.

2
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,530
So, what about Whan and Phaka?

3
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:24,138
Phaka didn’t run off with me.

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,274
She ran away 'cause
she didn’t wanna be your second wife!

5
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:31,661
You still haven’t figured out that
Loy doesn’t like Phaka?

6
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,816
...or even Whan,
as you’ve got it in your head, Phaad?

7
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:38,345
I didn’t think you two were this messed up.

8
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:43,506
Great! Great!

9
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:46,704
I’ll let everyone in on your secret.

10
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:49,613
I’m dying to know.

11
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:53,539
...what if Phaka finds out
she’s into freaks like you?

12
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:56,805
- ...what her reaction will be.
- Don’t even think about it, Phad!

13
00:00:57,388 --> 00:00:58,545
Please, I’m begging you.

14
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:01,642
Fine! I won’t tell a soul.

15
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:04,642
Alright, make Whan marry me then!

16
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:06,981
But Whan doesn't love you, Phaad.

17
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,804
Whether she loves me or not,
what does it even matter?

18
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,392
That's enough, Phaad.
What do you want from me? Spit it out.

19
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,623
Well, then I’ll take your sister’s virginity.

20
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,331
Just once, that's all I’m asking!

21
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:24,531
And I promise that
I'll keep this matter to laugh about by myself.

22
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:28,429
I won’t tell a soul.

23
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:30,350
You son of a bitch!

24
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,962
Ouch...

25
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,939
Drop dead!

26
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:02,800
Hey... I didn’t mean to!

27
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,561
I... I didn't do it.

28
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:13,486
- Hey! No... I didn't do it!
- Oh my God!

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,388
Loy! Oh no!

30
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:19,949
Loy! Don’t die on me!
I’ll get you to a doctor right now!

31
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:31,718
- I can’t hold on anymore...
- Don’t you dare give up, Loy!

32
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:33,689
Please, stay with me.

33
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:36,754
Kaew... it really hurts.

34
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:42,251
No! No! Don’t you dare die on me!

35
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,430
Didn’t you say you loved me?

36
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:48,895
You promised you'd be with me forever…
didn't you?

37
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:51,272
You promised, damn it—don’t you dare break it!

38
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,675
Don’t you dare die on me!

39
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:03,463
I love you, Kaew…
I swear it before heaven and earth.

40
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:07,668
I love you, Kaew...

41
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,590
Even if our love is wrong...

42
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,597
But I'm incredibly happy,
Kaew, that I love you.

43
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:29,475
Since we both love each other...

44
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:32,410
...this is between the two of us.

45
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,189
Even if anyone sees it as wrong, who cares?

46
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,713
But I'm so glad I had the chance to love you.

47
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,551
I’ll always love you, Loy.

48
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:00,405
Loy... Loy!

49
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,312
Kaew... I'm so cold.

50
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:04,235
You're feeling cold...? Oh no...

51
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:07,639
Is that better...? Are you warmer now?

52
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,024
Thanks, Kaew... really.

53
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:18,051
I love you, Kaew...

54
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:54,516
Loy.

55
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,579
You will be in my heart forever.

56
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,583
No... Loy...

57
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,981
Loy! No!

58
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,805
If we truly loved each other,
I wouldn’t allow things to be this way.

59
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:57,660
But this is impossible.
You and I can never be together.

60
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,473
No one will let us be together.

61
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:12,351
Still don't get it?

62
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:31,019
May the sacred beings be my witness.

63
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:40,404
This Loy swears to love
and remain loyal to Kaew forever..

64
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:47,153
This Kaew also swears to love
and remain unwaveringly loyal to Loy.

65
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,633
- When love exists,
- Let it be true.

66
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,284
Nothing but love.

67
00:08:56,682 --> 00:09:00,198
That’s why
I believe in this love—it will never change.

68
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:04,167
No matter what rules anyone sets,

69
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,163
They can’t define our love.

70
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,365
If Loy and Kaew are forbidden to love,

71
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:15,460
Then only death could ever tear us apart.

72
00:10:10,758 --> 00:10:22,045
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

73
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:26,868
I want to keep you close to me.

74
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:34,456
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

75
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:40,294
When you're not here,

76
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:46,371
know that I'm vulnerable.

77
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:50,846
But our love might be wrong.

78
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:58,110
Fate might be too cruel to me.

79
00:10:58,707 --> 00:11:04,628
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

80
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:10,678
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

81
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:15,846
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

82
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:22,816
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

83
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:29,566
If love is as strange as people say it is.

84
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:34,565
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

85
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:41,473
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

86
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:48,133
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

87
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:16,329
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

88
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:22,636
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

89
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:27,720
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

90
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:36,723
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

91
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:44,528
If love is as strange as people say it is.

92
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:49,540
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

93
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:56,478
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

94
00:12:56,503 --> 00:13:02,850
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.
