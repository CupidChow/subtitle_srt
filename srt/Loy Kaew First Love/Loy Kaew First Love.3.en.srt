1
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:19,551
I just realized
I never even said sorry to you that day.

2
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,743
The day you got sick—like,
really sick. Almost died.

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,410
Don’t worry about it.

4
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:31,439
- Hey Loy.
- Huh?

5
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:35,712
Can I ask you something?
If we could turn back time...

6
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:39,898
Would you still have gone down
there for me that day?

7
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:48,222
Even if it happened a thousand more times,
I'd still do the same thing.

8
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:10,191
- Pass your cup here, Pa. I'll refill it.
- Here.

9
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,427
That Phad is really good at pleasing people.

10
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:25,144
That Bua girl is really important to you,
isn't she, Phad?

11
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:33,369
Come on, Pa! Are you still taking that
wicked girl's side?

12
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:42,300
Do you know how much she embarrasses me,
Pa? I'm ashamed in front of everyone.

13
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:47,594
Hey Phad, you got strong hands and feet.

14
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:50,396
Why don't you kick her a couple of times?

15
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:54,854
You just let her stand there
and curse you every day.

16
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:59,535
Hey! Pa knows all about it.

17
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:05,848
That Bua, she's my sister.
She's my only sister.

18
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:07,705
I...

19
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:11,438
I love her.
I just can't bring myself to hurt her, Pa.

20
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:19,574
Phad, then why are you complaining to me?

21
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,834
But don't even talk about you.

22
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,450
Even I'm still scared of her.

23
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:28,352
Because she's so fierce.

24
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:35,399
Hold on...

25
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,229
Don't butt in.
I'll take it to the servants myself.

26
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:50,902
- Here.
- Just a little more, Pa.

27
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,534
And aren't you gonna eat at all?

28
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:54,887
Come on, Phad, come here.

29
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:58,653
- P'Phad...
- Phun.

30
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:01,412
It’s dried grilled sour fish.
I know you like it, P'Phad.

31
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,016
Phun!

32
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:10,775
See? This is how you spoil her.

33
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:13,369
She's not even acting like a daughter anymore.

34
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,007
And soon, who's gonna dare
to ask for her hand in marriage?

35
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,203
Heh! See that, Pa?

36
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:23,179
Even Mom is on my side.
She agrees with me.

37
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,644
Hey, hey, hey, Phad!

38
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:28,666
Don't you think for a second
that I'm on your side.

39
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:33,887
Don't you think I don't know that you went
and beat up that Loy so badly he was bleeding.

40
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,815
When you two were kids,

41
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:37,912
I saw how much you loved each other,
like you could eat each other up.

42
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:42,743
But why do you hate each other
so much now that you're grown up?

43
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:45,355
- Why, Phad?
- Really?

44
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:47,905
- But P'Phad...
- Stop!

45
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:50,776
- Don't you butt in!
- You Phun!

46
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:55,043
You don't have to keep peeling fish for him.
Phad's got hands.

47
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,333
Let him eat it himself,
or are you gonna feed him?

48
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,662
- Really? Then let me!
- Phun!

49
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:07,112
You're going too far, you Phun!

50
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,736
I got hands,
don’t I? I can eat on my own!

51
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,593
You don't have to butt in, you bitch!

52
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:20,601
Hey! Phad, you're talking so harshly!

53
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:24,099
As a man, you need to be responsible.

54
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:27,161
You shouldn't talk to a woman so harshly, Phad.

55
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,334
Oh, Mae Samorn!

56
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:37,134
Well, that Phun,
her family doesn't have money to pay us interest.

57
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:41,026
So her parents gave her
to us as payment for the interest.

58
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:45,846
So we have to keep her,
but don't let her get too out of line.

59
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:50,073
- You know, Phad?
- Yes.

60
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:53,195
- Hey, Phad!
- Huh?

61
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,098
Consider this your mother's order.

62
00:07:55,236 --> 00:07:59,928
That from now on, if you want
to go play rough with that Loy again...

63
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:03,182
Don't let it end up with bloodshed again.
And don't think I don't know.

64
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:05,575
- Really?
- Consider it my direct order!

65
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:10,946
- That's enough drinking for you two tonight.
- Hey!

66
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:14,419
I’m not as cold-hearted
as you’re saying, Whan.

67
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:20,481
If you're not heartless, then you must have
given your whole heart to your friend, I reckon.

68
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:23,491
What the heck do you mean, you Whan?

69
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:26,400
Pa, it's just that P'Kaew

70
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:30,642
probably secretly gave his heart
to only that Bua girl, I guess.

71
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:35,553
I went out of my way to talk to you nicely,
but you had the nerve to disrespect my mother!

72
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:38,059
You're really asking for it! Oh!

73
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,416
What are you looking at me for? Go grab her!

74
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:47,087
- Go!
- Eek!

75
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,499
- Eek! Help me, somebody!
- Now it's my turn!

76
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
I told you let her go!
