1
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:14,909
Listen, P'Kaew and P'Loy,

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,735
you're aware that the master
has been regulating the Piphat orchestra.

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,183
Any troupe without recognized achievements will
not be permitted by the master to sing or dance.

4
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,496
What about Master Jom's orchestra?

5
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:30,939
Are you truly going to allow the performance
that Master cherishes

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,457
to cease because of your actions?

7
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:36,385
Why the hell is this our burden?

8
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,548
Since the master does not wish
for traditional Thai performing arts

9
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,251
to impede the nation's advancement.

10
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:46,648
Then why should we continue this tradition?

11
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:49,534
How are we to progress as a nation?

12
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:53,357
If we do not preserve our cultural heritage.

13
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,668
So what would you have us do, Bua?

14
00:00:57,398 --> 00:00:59,041
Then prove it.

15
00:01:00,257 --> 00:01:04,829
Demonstrate that the master's work has value.

16
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:11,155
Prove to everyone that you both are worthy.

17
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:14,623
To preserve it.

18
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:33,046
- Phad!
- Loy!

19
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:39,755
What are you doing?

20
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,775
Hey! Ming, Mun, Loet!

21
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:55,410
Man, our village’s got so much stuff.
Don’t you think?

22
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:57,861
Why, bro?

23
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:00,027
Check this out.

24
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,497
Even though we're on land,
there are fish flopping around.

25
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,596
Wriggle, wriggle.

26
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:06,834
Everywhere.

27
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:10,994
What are you gettin' at, Phad?

28
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:14,824
Mom told me to sell these fish
so we can pay off your dad’s interest.

29
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:18,978
That's your own damn business, Loy.

30
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,531
Your mom's owed my dad interest for a long time.

31
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,225
You guys are really shameless.

32
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:29,829
You and your mama are both so damn bold.

33
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:33,728
Me and my mom don't have it yet.
Can I have more time?

34
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:36,816
I'll hurry up and get the money
to pay back your dad.

35
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:41,202
I'm gonna laugh so loud, all the way to Bangkok.

36
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,567
Someone like me

37
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:46,107
- Hurry up! Pick it up!
- doesn't give a damn about anyone.

38
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:47,734
Or your mama ain't gonna eat.

39
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,287
- Hold up!
- Where the hell are you goin'?

40
00:02:51,357 --> 00:02:53,377
Go on, do it again!

41
00:02:58,289 --> 00:02:59,298
Ouch!

42
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:01,645
I'm really gettin' a kick outta this.

43
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,027
Remember this, you guys. If you’re born broke,

44
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,292
this is all you’ll ever be.

45
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,676
C'mon! What the fuck are you waitin' for?

46
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:12,659
Y'all, beat his ass again!

47
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,122
Alright! Take this!

48
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,210
- Who's there?
- It's me, Bua.

49
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:27,829
You okay, P'Loy?

50
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:29,874
Oh, blood.

51
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:34,611
- What the hell are you doin', P'Phaad?!
- Huh?

52
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:37,539
Well, uh, you see...

53
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,788
I was just takin' a stroll,
and I saw these three dudes, they...

54
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:47,530
- They were beatin' up Loy, so I stepped in.
- Oh! / - Phad!

55
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,221
- I came to stop it.
- Oh yeah? Do you think I'm that stupid?

56
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:55,237
Can't you see? He's bleedin' all over!

57
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:59,022
- What the hell are you doin'?!
- Ouch!

58
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:00,818
This is gettin' outta hand, Bua.

59
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:03,314
You're my little sister.

60
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,432
Don't you have any respect for a big shot like me?

61
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:10,791
If people find out, I'll be so embarrassed.

62
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,535
I'm the one who's ashamed.
I'm ashamed to have a brother like you.

63
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:17,889
The same goes for you assholes.

64
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,572
Ming, Mun, Loet!

65
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:23,241
You're so good at being his lackeys.

66
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:24,796
- I'll get you!
- Hold up!

67
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,944
- That's enough, Bua.
- Go home, or I'll send you all home!

68
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:30,940
- So what?!
- What right do you have?

69
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:34,759
- Are you talkin' back?! Are you talkin' back?!
- Ouch! Ouch!

70
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,404
- Just let go, hey!
- Are you talkin' back?! Get outta here!

71
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:37,563
All of you get outta here!

72
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:40,466
- Let go of me!
- So what?! So what?!

73
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,337
I'll get you for this, Loy.

74
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:47,292
Guys like you only hide behind women's skirts.

75
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:49,021
- Oh yeah? Go on!
- Just tryin' to get by.

76
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:51,257
Go now. If you ain't home when I get there...

77
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,750
- You'll be sorry.
- I'm goin'.

78
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:55,598
Ugh!

79
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:58,420
You okay, P'Loy?

80
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:01,648
You alright?

81
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:03,953
You okay?

82
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:09,018
That P'Phaad, you good?

83
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:21,179
- How's it goin'?
- Duh, it hurts.

84
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:24,284
It hurts right here.

85
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,717
Sorry.

86
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,876
All done.

87
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:38,484
Mae Iad, I'm really sorry about this.

88
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:42,491
Hold on.

89
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:47,390
You're the one who looked after and helped Loy.

90
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:52,426
Why the hell are you sayin’ sorry to me, Bua?
You did nothin’ wrong.

91
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,656
No, Mae Iad.

92
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,678
Because the one who hurt P'Loy...

93
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:04,060
It was my own brother, Phad.

94
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,464
I'm really sorry.

95
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,660
Oh, honey.

96
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:13,201
It's not your fault, child.

97
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:18,194
If someone's gotta take the blame, it's me.

98
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,470
Because I'm poor.

99
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:30,685
Poor people gotta live like this.

100
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,171
Oh, honey.

101
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:35,674
Oh, Mae Iad.

102
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:38,584
I'm really sorry.

103
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:42,851
I'm so sorry, y'all.

104
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,563
I really appreciate you.

105
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:53,562
For taking care of Loy.

106
00:06:56,296 --> 00:07:00,613
Hey P'Loy! Oh my gosh,
what happened? Does it hurt bad?

107
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,478
- Hello.
- Do I look dead, Whan?

108
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,093
It's just a little cut on my head.

109
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,852
-  Let me have a look.
-  Ouch, that really hurts.

110
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:08,958
Loy.

111
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,557
Come on, it's just a little scratch,
like something a cat would do.

112
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:14,865
What kinda cat lives at your place, tiger?

113
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,769
Why don't you try having it happen to you?
Let's see if you'd feel any pain.

114
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:20,681
Oh, come on...

115
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:24,654
I've seen you fall off a buffalo countless times
and you never seemed to be hurt.

116
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,347
Just this little thing
and you're acting all dramatic.

117
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:32,884
Hey man, good thing you're alright.

118
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:38,183
But my sister, Whan, was yelling her head off,
so startled she was practically dying.

119
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:42,169
When someone brought me the news
that you got hit on the head by that Phad.

120
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:43,896
God, it was getting on my nerves.

121
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:47,825
Oh! And don't you even think
about worrying about your friend?

122
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:51,643
Well, if you hadn't butted
in wanting to go to the market...

123
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,414
Father probably wouldn't have ordered me
to follow and take care of you.

124
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:57,674
Oh, Bua dear.

125
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:01,433
Here's the sweets you like.
I'll give them to you.

126
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:02,704
Thank you, P'Kaew.

127
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:07,925
Hmmph. Oh please, in P'Kaew's head,
there's probably only that Bua.

128
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:11,804
P'Loy is almost dying here,
and your younger sibling is sitting right here.

129
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,108
What is this?
Giving sweets to the one who started it all!

130
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:22,271
Hey Whan, watch your mouth!
Who's the one who started it? Say it again.

131
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:29,616
Why didn’t you tie him up in the basement
or slap a muzzle on him?

132
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,403
What is this?
You let him loose to bite people everywhere.

133
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:35,156
Hold on, Whan, this ain't my fault, alright?

134
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:39,730
I didn't chain him up.
His feet are his feet, his hands are his hands.

135
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,377
And how would anyone know that he would go
and do such nasty things to someone?

136
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:46,537
- Oh, well Phad is your brother, isn't he?
- Hey Whan!

137
00:08:47,313 --> 00:08:50,622
Tch! If he's your brother,
then you're definitely wrong.

138
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,729
Then I’m taking the sweets; deal with it!

139
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,625
Wait, P'Kaew bought this for me.
I'm not giving it to you.

140
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:02,066
Ooh, possessive!
Aren't you happy, P'Kaew?

141
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:05,832
Hey, if you're so possessive,
then come and take it yourself!

142
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:09,060
- You brat, Bua!
- Give it back, Whan!

143
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,282
Give it here! It's mine!

144
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,139
- Get over here, Kaew!
- You think I'm scared of you?

145
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,842
What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

146
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:42,968
- What the...!
- Hey, you're playing rough!

147
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,141
- Come on!
- Come on in!

148
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:58,506
What are you gonna do?

149
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:01,250
What's your deal?

150
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:05,310
- Think you're so tough, huh?
- Let go of me! Ouch!

151
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,559
Think you're so tough? Give in! Give in!

152
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:16,803
- Ouch!
- Hey! Loy!

153
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:18,448
What's wrong?

154
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,817
Hey! I'm sorry! Does it hurt bad?

155
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:23,854
- It really hurts my wound!
- Loy!

156
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,894
- I'm sorry.
- Ouch!

157
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,837
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

158
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:40,481
- I'm hurt.
- Huh?

159
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:42,993
Loy, you and your antics!

160
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:50,813
Kaew, I think we should go home first today.
I'm not feeling too good.

161
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,632
Don't go home yet! Let's play some more!

162
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:58,068
- I don't think so. The water's really cold today.
- You scaredy-cat!

163
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:04,130
Ouch, ouch! Loy, help me! I've got a cramp!

164
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:08,213
- I don't believe you.
- I'm serious! Ouch, help me!

165
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:10,728
Hey, Kaew! Kaew!

166
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:22,033
Hey! Don't you die on me, buddy! Hang in there!

167
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:26,575
Loy, I'm cold! I'm cold!

168
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,004
Warmer now, right?

169
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:54,029
Loy, you're like this because of me.
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,143
Hey Phad, you got strong hands and feet.

171
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:24,983
Why don't you kick her a couple of times?

172
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,121
I love her... I just can't do that to her, Pa.

173
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:36,585
- P'Phad...
- Phun.

174
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:39,345
It’s dried grilled sour fish.
I know you like it, P'Phad.

175
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:42,473
Let him eat it himself,
or are you gonna feed him?

176
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:45,699
- Really? Then let me!
- Phun!

177
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,098
You're going too far, you Phun!

178
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,815
I got hands, don’t I? I can eat on my own!
