1
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:33,901
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

2
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,724
I want to keep you close to me.

3
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:46,312
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

4
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,150
When you're not here,

5
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,227
know that I'm vulnerable.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,702
But our love might be wrong.

7
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:09,966
Fate might be too cruel to me.

8
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:16,484
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,534
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

10
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:27,702
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

11
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:34,672
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

12
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:41,422
If love is as strange as people say it is.

13
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:46,421
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

14
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:53,329
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

15
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:59,989
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

16
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:28,185
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

17
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:34,492
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

18
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,576
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

19
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:48,579
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

20
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:56,384
If love is as strange as people say it is.

21
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:01,396
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

22
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:08,334
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

23
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:14,706
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

24
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:36,884
Doesn’t matter if I live or die,
Whan wouldn’t give a damn.

25
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,716
So here I am, coming to see her myself.

26
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:45,931
Here, I brought you a bunch of lotus stems.

27
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:51,381
I brought them so you can make curry.
Yours is the best,

28
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,544
- You know that, right?
- Ooh la la!

29
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:56,214
Well... What, Mae Samorn?

30
00:03:57,297 --> 00:03:58,638
It’s because you speak without thinking—

31
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,145
that’s why our son Phaad…

32
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:05,674
and Mae Ieat’s son, Loy. ended up like this!

33
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,076
Don’t you ever forget this.

34
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:26,620
You're just a woman I use when I want.

35
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:34,211
P'Phaad!?

36
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,554
P'Lert?

37
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:46,469
P'Lert is also a tough guy.

38
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:50,855
Why the hell are you still living like this,
P’Lert?

39
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:52,526
Oh, come on...

40
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:55,560
You think this is where I want to end up?

41
00:04:56,705 --> 00:05:00,415
Tch! Damn it! It’s all because of money.

42
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,797
It all came down to money.

43
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,614
Why?

44
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:38,473
P'Loy, are you healing well?

45
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:39,956
Yeah, it’s getting better.

46
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,484
Mind if I take a peek?

47
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:50,955
It’s looking good now.

48
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:53,195
Do you still feel dizzy or anything?

49
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:56,936
P'Loy!

50
00:05:58,307 --> 00:05:59,739
Oh! Bua.

51
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,261
What are you doing here at P'Loy’s place?

52
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:03,942
Uh...

53
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,540
- Uh, well...
- Wait—don’t tell me you...

54
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,669
So, waiting around for my P'Kaew, are you?

55
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,235
Right? Right, right, right?

56
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,113
- Well...
- Right?

57
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:18,611
I just came to invite you to
P'Phaad's ordination ceremony.

58
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:23,131
I'm finished here, so I'll be going now.
P'Loy, P'Kaew, goodbye.

59
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,735
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Sit down!

60
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,759
- What are you doing, Whan?
- See? P'Kaew?

61
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:33,211
I told you if we didn't come to see P'Loy...

62
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:37,084
you and Bua wouldn't have met by chance.

63
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:38,730
I didn’t come here for anyone, alright?

64
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:41,226
Whatever you came here for, just spit it out.

65
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,416
Then we can leave quickly.

66
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,616
Uh, uh, P'Kaew..

67
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:52,866
Haven’t you ever thought that… um…

68
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:56,708
your little sister knows you best?

69
00:06:57,472 --> 00:07:02,558
It won’t be long before P'Loy and I get married.

70
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:07,137
As for you and Bua, where will you go?

71
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:10,497
You sure don’t sugarcoat anything, do you?

72
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:18,371
You really believe Loy loves you
like you imagine he does?

73
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:24,695
Weren’t you the one who insisted
Whan and I prove our love?

74
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:31,221
Alright, then! Bua?

75
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:35,819
I'll take Bua to the far end of the field
to gather some vegetables.

76
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,706
So we’ll have some alone time, just you and me.

77
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,106
And here, let Loy and Whan
have some time alone.

78
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:48,019
That way they can do whatever they want
without feeling embarrassed in front of us.

79
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:49,251
- Come on, let’s go!
- Uhm...

80
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:52,736
- Hold on! Hold on!
- Hey—wait! Hold on!

81
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:58,265
- how about we just head home, okay Bua?
- Yeah, yeah, totally, yes.

82
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:59,691
What’s the rush, Whan?

83
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:04,993
Don’t think I don’t know you want to see Loy.

84
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:09,758
- As for me? I’ve been dying to see Bua.
- Uhm...

85
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:14,297
Why don’t we just stay here together?
We can do whatever we feel like.

86
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:17,638
- Right here, let’s do it!
- Eek!

87
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,984
- Eek! P'Kaew! Hold on! Ahhh! P'Kaew!
- You bastard, Kaew!

88
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,224
I don’t get how you could do something like this.

89
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:30,758
But you shouldn’t stomp on my heart like that.

90
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:40,805
- Are you hurt?
- P'Kaew!

91
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,571
Alright, let’s kick things off with the
first move – Cobra’s Strike into the Nest!

92
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:58,286
- Woooo!
- Yesss!

93
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:02,132
Alrighty, time for move number two!

94
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:03,413
Clash of the Elephants!

95
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,186
- Eeeek!
- Oh my gosh!

96
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:11,960
Cobra's Deadly Embrace!

97
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:14,632
- Kyaaa!
- Oh my god~!

98
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:21,683
Alright! Time for the final move.
This one’s deadly if it hits!

99
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:25,751
- Behold! The Cobra Wheel!
- Ahhh!

100
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:28,333
- Wow! So handsome!
- Ahhh!

101
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,872
So, what do you think, girls?
You know, I'm just too irresistible.

102
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:32,855
I don’t want you girls fighting over me,
you know.

103
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:37,343
Oh my! I can't handle this anymore! Ahhh!

104
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,796
Wow!

105
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:48,808
Saw you throwing punches from way over there,
thought you were losing your mind or something!

106
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,228
Ugh...

107
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:55,164
Hey, but seriously,
why do you look so good lately?

108
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,911
- Let me guess… you won big at the gambling den?
- Oh, shut up!

109
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:02,729
Come on! Can’t I even say something nice?

110
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:06,322
But seriously, you look way prettier than before.
What did you do?

111
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,769
Looking good comes with being a woman.

112
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:11,413
Hey... check that out.

113
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,017
- Mom! Mom... please, Mom!
- You're finished today, Gimm!

114
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:49,389
Please, Mom! Please, don't! I'm begging you, Mom!

115
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,344
What the hell are you wearing?!

116
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:54,662
- Mom! Please don't hit me! Don't hit me...
- That's enough! Enough! Stop!

117
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:56,836
Mom!

118
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,482
What’s going on, Auntie Lamduan?
Are you trying to kill him?

119
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:03,006
She's your kid, not a pig or a dog.

120
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,605
Yeah! He's not my kid!

121
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:09,107
Someone like him could never be my kid.

122
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,146
I don’t have a damn kid like him!

123
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,267
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Today, it’s either you or me who’s going to die!

124
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:22,856
I’m really sorry, Mom. Please, I’m begging you.

125
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,346
Auntie Lamduan,
just take it easy and speak calmly.

126
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:33,844
Why are you punishing him so much?
What did he do to deserve this?

127
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:36,931
Mom!

128
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:41,030
Someone like him?
He's been a mistake from the moment he was born!

129
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:43,283
Don't ask me, Bua!

130
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,417
He's wrong simply because he was born as my kid!

131
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,655
I should have shoved ash into his mouth
to kill him since he was born!

132
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:54,133
What kind of mess did you get yourself into?

133
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,757
What could you have possibly done
to make your mother want to kill you?

134
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,599
If you're really at fault
like your mother claims...

135
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:03,738
I'll crack your skull and wash
your mother's feet with your blood myself!

136
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:09,969
Mom, please...

137
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,775
I'm really sorry, Mom.

138
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:20,483
I just can't be the person you want me to be.

139
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,700
I really tried.

140
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:28,791
But no matter how hard I try, it’s just not me.

141
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:33,246
I'm not a man, Mom.

142
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:41,905
Auntie Lamduan, that’s enough!

143
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,482
You're not my child. Not someone like you.

144
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:53,287
Go! Go die a terrible death anywhere you want,
Gimm!

145
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:56,945
- Just go! Go wherever you want, Gimm!
- That's enough already, Aunt Lamduan!

146
00:12:57,905 --> 00:13:00,044
This Nual has been putting up
with this for a long time!

147
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:02,644
Today, it's all or nothing!

148
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,534
If anyone dares lay a hand on Gimm again...

149
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:07,660
They'll have to deal with me!

150
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,340
Come on! Bring it on!

151
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:14,419
Is this it, Mae Lamduan?
Is this really what Gimm did wrong?

152
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,249
Why? Is it wrong
whether they are a woman or a man?

153
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:24,380
I see that she's a good person,
and she loves Mae Lamduan so much.

154
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,348
Well, I wanted a son!

155
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:40,198
But the reason her dad ran away to China was
because I couldn't give him a son!

156
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:43,512
That’s why I ended up here,
all alone—a dumped widow!

157
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:46,112
Auntie Lamduan!

158
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:48,418
Didn't Gimm try her best?

159
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,061
Didn't she do everything
to become the son you wanted, Mae Lamduan?

160
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:56,160
I tried my best, Mom.

161
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:59,101
I really tried.

162
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:04,662
No matter how hard I tried,
no one ever saw me as a man.

163
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,077
No one has ever loved someone like me.

164
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,990
Not even her own mother could love her!

165
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:14,164
No one loves me!

166
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:17,220
Oh, Gimm!

167
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:21,397
Someone with a face like yours?
Who would love you?

168
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,518
Whether anyone loves her or not, who cares?

169
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,663
But if Mae Lamduan doesn't love her,

170
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:29,513
then Whan will love her myself!

171
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,717
What do you guys even want?

172
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:13,407
Hey, Loy!

173
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:15,944
We came to say sorry.

174
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:20,639
For the way we treated you before.

175
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,375
We're sorry.

176
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,164
Phaad ordered you guys to come, right?

177
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:34,709
No, he didn’t send us.

178
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:39,500
He doesn't even know we came to see you.

179
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:46,025
If P'Phaad finds out,
we’re gonna get it real bad.

180
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:50,017
What do you guys mean by this?

181
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,599
- Uh... I...
- Wait, wait.

182
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:01,532
P'Lert, I think...
you'd better not say anything yet.

183
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:06,878
I think... we'd better hurry back.

184
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,888
That we secretly came to see Loy...

185
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,454
If P'Phaad finds out, we're in big trouble.

186
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:15,775
Yeah, that's right.

187
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,584
The walls have ears.

188
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,206
We'd better hurry back.

189
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:26,965
Hold on!

190
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,080
The fact that you guys came to see me...

191
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,801
I think it must be something important.

192
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:36,484
Just say it. There's no one here.

193
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,415
Whatever it is, say it.

194
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:43,351
Uh...

195
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:48,124
- Uh...
- Uh... what?

196
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:53,424
Loy, I mean, Phaka...

197
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:57,816
Phaka, what's wrong?

198
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:05,149
P'Phaad is planning to sell Phaka to a brothel!

199
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:22,754
If you don't want P'Kaew,
then who are you after?

200
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,257
How about my P'Loy?

201
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:30,609
P’Kaew must be sleeping already.
He has a fever.

202
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:32,702
Let's go, let's go see P'Loy.

203
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:35,258
My mother loves me so much.

204
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:38,705
Oh, my dear Gimm, my dear Gimm!

205
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:42,246
Would you like something to eat?
I'll whip it up for you.

206
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:44,346
Oh, Gimm, you little rascal!

207
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:46,804
Oh my! Mom!

208
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:50,568
It's that mouth of yours! If you're not lovable,
it's because of your words!

209
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:52,726
- Oh, Mae Lamduan!
- Hmph!

210
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:54,816
Well...

211
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:58,704
- Wow!
- Come hug me!

212
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:03,496
You deserve it.

213
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:13,929
You damn wretch!
What the hell do you get out of pissing me off?

214
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,738
If we really could love each other,
I’d never let it come to this.

215
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:22,505
But it’s just not possible.
You and I… we can’t love each other.
