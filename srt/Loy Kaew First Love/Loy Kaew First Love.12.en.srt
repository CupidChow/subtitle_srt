1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,518
Hey! Where are you off to?
There's a boxing match today?

2
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,073
- What?!<<<
- Seriously? At the market?

3
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:21,131
People say he's a boxer from Bangkok too!

4
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:23,409
- Super buff and ripped!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,443
Maybe we should split up and go home?

6
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:29,858
I've gotta help my mom treat P'Phaad's wound.

7
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,877
In that case, Whan dear.

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,173
Can I walk you home, please?

9
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:43,673
Ugh! It's my house, and I have legs, thank you.

10
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,914
I'm staying right here.
Because I want to be the one to take you home.

11
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:48,647
Ugh! You're so stubborn!

12
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,553
I'll kick your butt till you fall over!

13
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,996
Alright, before you go kicking my butt...

14
00:00:57,528 --> 00:01:00,450
- Then let me spank yours first.
- Eek!

15
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:02,915
Gimm, you naughty brat! Come here,
I'm kicking your butt right now!

16
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:05,395
- She's gone that way.
- Ahhh!

17
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,330
Ugh, this is so damn boring!

18
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,057
- Whoa! You jerk!
- Ow!

19
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,315
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:44,950
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What's wrong, P'Kaew?

21
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,646
What the hell was that?

22
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:49,260
Just an ant bite. Sorry, okay?

23
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,037
Wow! What kind of ant bite
makes you kick someone?!

24
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:53,246
- So getting bitten means you get to kick me now?
- What kinda mutant ant was that, huh?!

25
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:54,954
Okay, okay, listen.

26
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,603
You know what? I still can't believe this thing.

27
00:02:58,117 --> 00:03:01,023
That Phaad and Loy are friends again.
I mean, what?!

28
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:02,368
Yeah, true that.

29
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:04,711
- They almost tore each other apart.
- Right.

30
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,085
I can't believe it either, man.

31
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,786
That P'Kaew won't let Whan
and Loy be together anymore.

32
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,407
What do you reckon, huh?

33
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:16,661
Kaew and Loy are close buddies, man.

34
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:19,930
They always got along so well. Why now?

35
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:21,754
Listen up, Toss, Saeng.

36
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,313
You're just wet behind the ears.

37
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,002
You wouldn't get it anyway.

38
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:30,271
What do you mean, kids?
We're old enough to sit here and drink with you.

39
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:32,818
- We're not little kids anymore.
- Exactly, we're grown-ups now.

40
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:33,848
Yeah.

41
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,493
Come on! Let's drink up!

42
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:42,969
Careful, you'll spill it.

43
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:45,916
- What the hell are you doing?
- Eh... whatever.

44
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,763
- Hey, it actually worked.
- Still, I think...

45
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:59,862
If P'Kaew keeps doing this, people might
get the wrong idea about him and P'Loy.

46
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:01,608
What do you mean, misunderstand?

47
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,875
They might think the reason you
won't let Whan be with P'Loy is because...

48
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:09,950
it's because P'Kaew and P'Loy,
you know, they...

49
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:13,148
- they...
- they...

50
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:15,096
- like...
- they hate each other or something?

51
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:17,036
Oh, I thought it was something else.

52
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:23,470
Pfft! I thought you were gonna say
Kaew's secretly in love with Loy.

53
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,930
Just like I secretly have a thing for you.

54
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:29,984
Oh, you damn jerk, you gave me goosebumps.

55
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,921
Kaew's gonna think we're a bunch of queers.

56
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:35,987
Oh, cheers, cheers, cheers!

57
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:41,239
I love you, man.

58
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,479
- Oh, love your daddy instead!
- Ouch!

59
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:48,622
Can you two quit the nonsense already?

60
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:52,047
You two, better burn this into your brain.

61
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:56,002
Even if you love each other like crazy,
no one's ever gonna accept it.

62
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:01,708
He's mad at us now.

63
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:11,889
Much better now, Mother.

64
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,497
He’ll be back to normal soon, I’m sure.

65
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,959
Well, Phaad!

66
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:22,603
Good thing we have Phun around.

67
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:25,546
She’s been such a help to me.

68
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:28,437
Say, Phun, what if someday

69
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:30,719
your folks come to redeem you?

70
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:35,453
I’d be so lonely without you.

71
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,604
I won’t leave, Mae Samorn.

72
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:43,274
If you’re kind to me, I will stay and serve you.

73
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:45,383
And stay by P'Phaad’s side forever too.

74
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,674
Shut it, Phun. You’ve said enough.

75
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:50,913
Hey, Phaad!

76
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,096
Could you at least show her some damn respect?

77
00:05:55,374 --> 00:05:57,286
- Huh?!
- What for, Ma?

78
00:05:57,517 --> 00:06:00,449
Why should I talk politely to her, huh?

79
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,719
Listen, you call yourself a man?

80
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:08,206
If you’re man enough to do it,
be man enough to own up to it.

81
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,202
Ugh... listen...

82
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:15,211
Alright then,
since you’ve already paid your dues...

83
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:19,504
Prepare yourself.
We're going to see the abbot together.

84
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:24,498
We're going to talk about
your ordination during the dry season.

85
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:26,504
And after you disrobe,

86
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,482
Then we can talk about getting you married.

87
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,336
Who else are you planning
to have P'Phaad marry, Mae Samorn?

88
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,807
Since Whan doesn't love P'Phaad,

89
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:38,991
and she went and got together with P'Loy,
just like she wanted.

90
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:40,149
Hey!

91
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:42,696
This is my responsibility.

92
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,975
I'll take care of it.

93
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,027
I already told you.

94
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:49,925
If you're a real man,
you’ve got to own up to what you’ve done.

95
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,072
Alright! Go get ready.

96
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,831
I'll go get ready first.

97
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:58,772
- Come on now, sort yourself out!
- Wait, Mom—where are you going?

98
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:01,650
- Mom, Mom?
- P'Phaad?

99
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:06,132
P'Phaad, Do you think Mother knows
what’s going on between us?

100
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:08,105
You, Phun!

101
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:14,685
Don’t think
I don’t see through your sneaky tricks.

102
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:16,812
I know exactly what you're plotting.

103
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,836
Things could’ve turned out better.

104
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:25,543
If you had any sense of your place.

105
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:30,561
Don’t you ever forget this.

106
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,130
You're just a woman I use when I want.

107
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:41,686
P'Phaad!?

108
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,687
Just a mistress?

109
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:57,009
You’ll see what happens next.

110
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:06,664
P'Phaad? P'Phaad? Are you here?

111
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:16,449
Phun, is P’Phad not home?

112
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:18,723
Why the hell do you care!

113
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:21,319
I can take care of the food myself!

114
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,092
Stay out of it! Take your food and leave!

115
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,107
It is my business, isn’t it?

116
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:31,552
You are really shameless.

117
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:38,072
Phun! Don't you have anything to do? Go!

118
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:20,402
- Mom! Mom... please, Mom!
- You're finished today, Gimm!

119
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:24,208
Please, Mom! Please, don't! I'm begging you, Mom!

120
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:26,415
What the hell are you wearing?!

121
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,875
What kind of mess did you get yourself into?

122
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:31,505
What could you have possibly done
to make your mother want to kill you?

123
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,363
If you're really at fault
like your mother claims...

124
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,538
I'll crack your skull and wash
your mother's feet with your blood myself!

125
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:41,493
What's going on with Phaka?

126
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,318
P'Phaad is planning
to sell Phaka into prostitution.

127
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:22,856
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

128
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:27,679
I want to keep you close to me.

129
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,267
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

130
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:41,105
When you're not here,

131
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:47,182
know that I'm vulnerable.

132
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:51,657
But our love might be wrong.

133
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:58,921
Fate might be too cruel to me.

134
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:05,439
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

135
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:11,489
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

136
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:16,657
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

137
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:23,627
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

138
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:30,377
If love is as strange as people say it is.

139
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:35,376
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

140
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:42,284
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

141
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:48,944
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

142
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:17,140
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

143
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,447
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

144
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:28,531
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

145
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:37,534
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

146
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:45,339
If love is as strange as people say it is.

147
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,351
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

148
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:57,289
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

149
00:12:57,314 --> 00:13:03,661
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.
