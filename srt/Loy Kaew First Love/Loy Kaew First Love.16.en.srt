1
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:33,901
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

2
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,724
I want to keep you close to me.

3
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:46,312
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

4
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,150
When you're not here,

5
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,227
know that I'm vulnerable.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,702
But our love might be wrong.

7
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:09,966
Fate might be too cruel to me.

8
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:16,484
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,534
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

10
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:27,702
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

11
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:34,672
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

12
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:41,422
If love is as strange as people say it is.

13
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:46,421
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

14
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:53,329
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

15
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:59,989
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

16
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:28,185
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

17
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:34,492
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

18
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,576
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

19
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:48,579
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

20
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:56,384
If love is as strange as people say it is.

21
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:01,396
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

22
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:08,334
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

23
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:14,706
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

24
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:36,108
If you don't want P'Kaew,
then who are you after?

25
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:38,611
How about my P'Loy?

26
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:43,963
P’Kaew must be sleeping already.
He has a fever.

27
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:46,056
Let's go, let's go see P'Loy.

28
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:48,612
My mother loves me so much.

29
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:52,059
Oh, my dear Gimm, my dear Gimm!

30
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,600
Would you like something to eat?
I'll whip it up for you.

31
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:57,700
Oh, Gimm, you little rascal!

32
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,158
Oh my! Mom!

33
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,922
It's that mouth of yours! If you're not lovable,
it's because of your words!

34
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:05,934
- Wait a second!
- Whoa!

35
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,736
- What was that? What sound was that?
- Whoa!

36
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,596
- I have to go in and check.
- Be careful, Phuyai!

37
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,100
Be careful, Phuyai.

38
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:19,465
Thanks so much for helping us
raise Namchok all this time.

39
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,925
But why don’t you want to stay with Phaad?

40
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:27,555
I know how P'Phaad feels about me.

41
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:32,685
If I stay any longer,
I’ll just end up being Phaad’s mistress.

42
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:36,673
It’s probably better if I just leave like this.

43
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,154
Oh!

44
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:52,300
Oh! Ming, Mun, Lert! You startled me!

45
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:56,386
You sneaked up on me!
You scared the hell out of me!

46
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:57,997
Oh, Mae Phun.

47
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:02,011
Out here in the middle of the forest—
where are you off to in such a hurry?

48
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:04,917
How can I even stay,
with everything out in the open like this?

49
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:10,788
You guys just waiting for P’Phaad
to come kick my ass, like he did to you?

50
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:15,181
You call yourselves men?
You spilled everything, and now I’m screwed!

51
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:17,724
- Mae Phun...
- Ugh!

52
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,678
If we did it together, we’re in this together.

53
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:25,110
How can you let us take the fall alone?

54
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:27,093
I don't have time to waste on you guys.

55
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:31,548
Here, take this.

56
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,755
Don’t tell anyone you ran into me here.

57
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:41,161
This is nowhere near enough.
How could this little bit of gold be enough?

58
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,778
Well... the last time,
I gave you a lot more than this...

59
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,696
You were so incompetent...
couldn’t finish the task...

60
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,486
What am I supposed to do?

61
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,905
If you’d pulled it off,
you’d have gotten a fat reward.

62
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,304
This won’t cut it.

63
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:01,172
I’ve got nothing left to give you.

64
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:03,988
Haven’t I given you everything already?
What else do you want?!

65
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:10,000
Really now, Mae Phun?
You expect us to believe you’ve got nothing?

66
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,228
You know what I mean... that thing...

67
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:17,114
That thing's been with you since the day
you were born, Mae Phun.

68
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:25,607
And right now... it's so beautiful... sweet and
fragrant... really ripe for the taking, isn't it?

69
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:28,260
You disgusting, foul-mouthed brutes!

70
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:31,998
Good or bad, at least I'm P'Phaad's wife,
and you can't take that from me!

71
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:34,613
You dare talk to me like that?! How could you?!

72
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:40,566
P'Phaad doesn’t want you?
Fine, we’ll take you then!

73
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:42,745
- Let's go!
- Ogh...

74
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,867
Hey, P'Lert... here? Really?

75
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,011
I think... we should head over there instead.

76
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,467
Then you guys drag her over there.

77
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:00,938
- Come on! Get over here!
- Ahh!

78
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,509
- Quit struggling!
- Ahh!

79
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:04,882
- Stop struggling!
- Ahh!

80
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,108
- Nobody's going to save you.
- Let me go!

81
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:09,234
Stop struggling!

82
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:15,785
- Stay still!
- Ahh!

83
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:19,307
- Hold still!
- Let me go! Ahh! Ahh!

84
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,697
Hey, what's up with you, Phaka?
You’re shaking badly.

85
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,995
- Well...
- Well, well what?

86
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:11,511
Well... I... I’m really scared of you, P'Phaad.

87
00:08:18,358 --> 00:08:22,099
Sit down... Sit down...

88
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,879
Sit down!

89
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,850
What’s wrong with you?
Why are you shaking so badly?

90
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,428
Well...

91
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:49,179
I’m... I’m genuinely afraid of you, P'Phaad.

92
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:02,574
If you're scared of me,
why did you even come after me?

93
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,821
You followed me all the way to the house,
and all the way into the room.

94
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:06,998
Well...

95
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:10,577
Well... I... I know, you know?

96
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,386
That you're going to do something to me.

97
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:16,605
But... I wasn’t really sure...

98
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:19,201
That's why I was afraid.

99
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,246
Do you see me as that kind of person?
Am I a bad person in your eyes?

100
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:36,225
Well, maybe
I really am as bad as people say I am.

101
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,458
I won't do anything to you, I promise.

102
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:50,503
I just want Phun to realize that
she can't hold a candle to you.

103
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:59,621
I swear...
to the spirits of the forest and trees...

104
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:04,082
I swear that
I love Mother Phaka with true sincerity.

105
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,833
Even if, Mother,
you could love me just a little in return.

106
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:26,389
Mae Ieat.

107
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,570
What brings you here, Phuyai Prik?

108
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,021
Sigh!

109
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:18,700
Mae Ieat... it’s been nearly a year...
since they vanished from the village.

110
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:23,417
If you know something,
just be honest with me, Mae Ieat.

111
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,822
Mae Lamphoei and I
are really worried sick about Kaew, my son.

112
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:35,373
Honestly,
I don’t know any more than you do, Phuyai Prik.

113
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:40,094
Mmm... take it easy, Phuyai Prik.

114
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,626
I'm sure of it.

115
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:48,649
That they will come back on their own.

116
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,324
Mae Ieat is telling me to calm down?

117
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,931
Kaew, Loy, Phaka, and Phun...

118
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:58,957
the four of them
have gone missing from the village.

119
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:01,400
And Mae Ieat is still telling me
to stay calm after all this?

120
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:03,156
Hey!

121
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,753
Hey! Mae Ieat.

122
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:09,946
P'Prik and I, as we're on good terms,
came to talk things over calmly.

123
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:15,223
But if you don't tell the truth, Mae Ieat,
about where Loy led everyone to disappear...

124
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,194
I won't spare your feelings anymore, Mae Ieat.

125
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:20,325
Alright, alright, calm down first.

126
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:22,728
Since there's no evidence yet...

127
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:26,681
We’re still unable to make a conclusion.
Let’s see how things unfold.

128
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:30,282
But I regret losing the money.

129
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:34,327
How could the money just vanish?
I worked hard for it.

130
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:02,326
P'Loy, do you want me to help you out?

131
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,399
Aww, look at the little puppy!
This job's too big for you!

132
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,733
Geez, you guys are a real pain, you know that?

133
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,200
Aiya!

134
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:25,278
Loy, Kaew, you guys hungry?

135
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,230
A little, yeah.

136
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:31,175
Gotta say, you two are super hardworking.

137
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:34,988
One day, you guys will definitely strike it big!

138
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:41,367
If I hit it big,
I'll take Kaew to Penang for sure!

139
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:45,274
You two are really sweet together.

140
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:49,234
Alright, I'm off. Tons of work waiting for me.

141
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,436
Do you think anyone here will catch on?

142
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:03,296
- ...that you and I are husband and wife?
- Are you out of your mind?

143
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,536
Who’s gonna know?

144
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,618
Come on, we’ve never even been alone overnight!

145
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,393
Hmm.

146
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:16,931
There's a week-long celebration
going on at Phu Khao Thong.

147
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:19,286
Wanna grab something to eat tonight?

148
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:21,189
How have you been, Loy?

149
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:23,710
Come here, let me look at your face.

150
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:29,635
Look at you! Oh my!

151
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:32,607
Oh, my boy.

152
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:36,085
- Oh... my son.
- Mama...

153
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,228
I'm really sorry, Mama…

154
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,417
for all the hardship you had to go through
because of me.

155
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:46,618
How have you been holding up, Mama?

156
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,253
I'm fine.

157
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,940
Me too, I'm really sorry, Mom.

158
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:04,962
You're saying sorry
for taking Loy and running off?

159
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,607
Or could it be...

160
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:10,970
...Should I go apologize to his father?

161
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,452
...for my son taking you away?
