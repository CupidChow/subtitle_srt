1
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:33,901
It's said that fate brought us together
To meet each other like this.

2
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,724
I want to keep you close to me.

3
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:46,312
For us to stand side by side,
our hearts filled with joy.

4
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,150
When you're not here,

5
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,227
know that I'm vulnerable.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,702
But our love might be wrong.

7
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:09,966
Fate might be too cruel to me.

8
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:16,484
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,534
Even if others condemn us in their hearts.

10
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:27,702
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

11
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:34,672
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

12
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:41,422
If love is as strange as people say it is.

13
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:46,421
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

14
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:53,329
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

15
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:59,989
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

16
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:28,185
If we have to face the gaze
of a thousand judging eyes.

17
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:34,492
Even if others condemn us in their hearts

18
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,576
I'll remain steadfast, unchanged.

19
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:48,579
Even if the world crumbles
or fate takes you away.

20
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:56,384
If love is as strange as people say it is.

21
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:01,396
If, in the end, we can’t be together.

22
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:08,334
I'll defy fate,
even if it means our love will fall apart.

23
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:14,706
I hope one day
my dream of love will come true.

24
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,165
May the sacred beings be my witness.

25
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:45,625
This Loy swears to love
and remain Loyal to Kaew forever..

26
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:52,346
This Kaew also swears to love
and remain unwaveringly Loyal to Loy.

27
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:57,873
Doesn’t matter if I live or die,
Whan wouldn’t give a damn.

28
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:02,705
So here I am, coming to see her myself.

29
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:06,920
Here, I brought you a bunch of lotus stems.

30
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:12,370
I brought them so you can make soup.
Yours is the best,

31
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,533
- You know that, right?
- Ooh la la!

32
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:20,637
And... what are people like
when love doesn’t go their way?

33
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:23,978
What are they like?

34
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:29,755
Well...

35
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:35,903
They're really quite unfortunate.

36
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:41,818
They keep calling Loy a loser, huh?

37
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,284
- Hey! Kaew, you.
- Ouch!

38
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,293
If you're gonna say stuff like that,
why not just kick me?

39
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,480
Come on, this is just a little dance!

40
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,313
- Take that! Just this little bit of dancing?
- Ouch!

41
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:03,539
It's good that you two came today.

42
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,574
I have something important to share...

43
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:14,240
I must make sure
everything is done right for you.

44
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,956
If you are to carry on this art and culture...

45
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:10,907
And there's one more thing I have...

46
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,779
It's something important that I'll give you.

47
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:29,687
Do you realize... what this red cloth is?

48
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:35,012
His Majesty gave it to us.

49
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,590
For artists like us.

50
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,300
So that we may thrive in the future.

51
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:47,200
You must keep it safe until your life is no more.

52
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,431
You must safeguard it until the end of your days.

53
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:16,022
And there’s something else
you need to understand.

54
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,483
The dance you’ve been practicing...

55
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,379
which I have taught you
to practice with great care...

56
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:32,110
The traditional Nok dance,
'Rojana Siang Puang Malai'...

57
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:37,008
Do you know where it originates from?

58
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,292
I don't know, Master.

59
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,045
This traditional Thai play...

60
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,239
This is a royal manuscript written
by His Majesty.

61
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:53,322
So you must dance with full dedication.

62
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:57,257
And put your heart into it.

63
00:07:58,427 --> 00:07:59,910
I hope you won't disappoint me.

64
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:02,531
Understood, Master.

65
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,184
We will do our very best, Master.

66
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,128
Right here. That’s the spot.

67
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,308
Humph!

68
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:43,396
Raised them, and they still bite like a cobra.

69
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:47,625
Look at their land.

70
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:51,085
They haven’t paid for a year,but I still
didn’t take the land. I let them stay.

71
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,825
And they repay my kindness like this.

72
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:56,791
Take it easy, Mae Samorn.

73
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:00,194
Let's think it over and get the facts straight.

74
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:02,634
I'm done being calm.

75
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,032
Look at Loy.

76
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:10,311
He brought in a broker from Bangkok
to buy rice—right under my nose.

77
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:11,828
How could he do this?

78
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,283
Someone like him needs to be taught a lesson.

79
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,028
So ungrateful.

80
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:24,723
That’s true, Mom. I heard everything myself.

81
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,289
I should go teach him a lesson, right?

82
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:31,245
Phaad! You stop right there!

83
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:37,818
Mae Samorn,
you and Mae Ieat were childhood friends.

84
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:42,517
Let's talk it out.
Why do you have to make a big deal out of it?

85
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:50,372
Phaad, I want you to go to Mae Ieat
and Loy’s house.

86
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:54,764
And you tell them
that I'm giving them three months.

87
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:57,842
If they don't give me the money in three months,

88
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,984
Tell them I’ll seize their land.

89
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:05,131
And they can move out of my land.

90
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:07,446
- Yes, Mom.
- Go! Phaad

91
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:09,126
- This is Phaad's specialty.
- Go on!

92
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:13,468
Hey! Ming, Mun, Lert, get my sword. Now!

93
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:16,327
- I'm going to deal with him right now!
- Phaad!

94
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:19,205
- Phaad! Phaad!
- Go on, son!

95
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:20,638
Mae Samorn!

96
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,809
Don't you dare stop me!

97
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,117
Go on, son! That's right!

98
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,052
Come on, Loy, eat your food.

99
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,294
It's very late. You must be starving by now.

100
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:39,410
I'm not hungry yet, Mom.

101
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:44,014
I’ve told you many times, Mom.
You don’t need to go through all this for me.

102
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,428
Ahem!

103
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:51,541
What a cozy picture—mother and son, all together.

104
00:11:54,451 --> 00:11:56,402
What do you want, Phaad?

105
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:03,034
Have you had anything to eat?
I’ll go get you something.

106
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:09,146
Sorry, Mae Ieat.

107
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:14,252
Someone like me wouldn't stoop to eating
with someone who's ungrateful.

108
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,113
Ungrateful?

109
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,329
What are you talking about, Phaad?

110
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,509
Why don't you ask your son, Loy?

111
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:31,739
Maybe he'll know who's ungrateful to whom.

112
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:44,517
Shut the hell up, Phaad!

113
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:48,847
I just want to trade with them.
What's wrong with that?

114
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,540
Then why are you being so secretive?

115
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:57,699
Are you afraid my father will find out
you're secretly undercutting him?

116
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,031
My father has done so much for you
and your mother.

117
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,097
So why are you acting like an ungrateful dog?

118
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:16,020
Hey, wait a minute!

119
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:23,887
What's going on, Loy?

120
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,590
Is it true?

121
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:31,019
Kamnan Boonlue has been nothing but kind to us.

122
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,057
How could you do that?

123
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:40,661
Let it go, Mae Ieat. Loy is ambitious.

124
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:43,967
He even dared to try
and take Whan away from me.

125
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:46,320
There's just one problem, Mae Ieat.

126
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:49,723
He was born poor.

127
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:53,959
So he has to find a way to get rich,
no matter who he betrays.

128
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,665
Stop talking nonsense, Phaad!

129
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,293
I just want to get ahead in life.

130
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:08,524
If Kamnan Boonlue thinks I'm ungrateful,

131
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:13,373
I’ll go and beg his forgiveness myself.

132
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:18,162
Then why don’t you grovel at my feet first, Loy.

133
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:21,484
I'll tell my mother

134
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:24,694
That she should postpone
the day she kicks you out.

135
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,529
Oh! My mother told me to tell you,

136
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,658
she's giving you and your mother three months.

137
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,698
She's kicking you out of here!

138
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:38,374
Mom! Oh, Mom!

139
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:40,288
What is this, Phaad?

140
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,886
What about the land my mother
and I worked so hard on?

141
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,945
You're only giving us three months?

142
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,988
Where will my mother and I go?

143
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:57,587
Then take your mother to live at the temple.

144
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,097
Go fight the temple dogs for food!

145
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,621
Someone like me, I may be poor,

146
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,425
but I won’t let anyone trample on my dignity!

147
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:12,847
- Loy, stop!
- Phaad!

148
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:17,602
- Oh no! Loy!
- Loy, stop!

149
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:19,710
- Phaad! Loy!
- Grab him!

150
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:21,813
- Stop!
- Stay still!

151
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,984
- Please! Don't do anything to Loy!
- Be quiet, Mae Ieat.

152
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:26,380
This doesn't concern you.

153
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,963
Please!

154
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:31,044
Loy, sit down!

155
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:34,056
- Kneel down!
- I said, sit down!

156
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,934
- Again and again!
- Phaad!

157
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,330
Loy.

158
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,775
The day has finally come.

159
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:53,373
- Hiyah!
- Aaaah!!!

160
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:56,788
Dad!

161
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,494
Dad!

162
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:02,692
Oh! Dad, why are you being so slow?
Why are you stopping?

163
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,469
Loy's going to end up dead if we don’t hurry!

164
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:08,795
Phuyai! I think you might really be
getting too old for this.

165
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:10,491
- Kaew!
- I can't go on!

166
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:11,868
Go ahead! Don’t wait for us!

167
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,783
- Your father's too old, he might collapse!
- Go on ahead!

168
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:16,890
Okay, Mom.

169
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:18,503
Wait! Kaew!

170
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:20,577
- Will they be okay?
- Go! Go on ahead!

171
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,267
- Go! Go on ahead!
- Phuyai, please follow us, okay?

172
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:26,602
- Ugh, ugh.
- Go! Go! Phuyai! Ugh!

173
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,808
What happened, Kaew?

174
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:43,344
And Loy? What happened to him?

175
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,962
Loy! Are you okay? Where are you?

176
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,642
Loy! Ah!!!

177
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,509
- Whan!
- Whan!

178
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,003
- Whan!
- Whan! / - Whan!

179
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:03,561
What was that, Mae Samorn?

180
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:05,816
It's because you spoke without thinking.

181
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,040
That's what caused all this,
between Phaad, our son, and Mae Ieat...

182
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:12,967
...ended up this way.

183
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,636
In that case, Whan dear.

184
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,941
Can I walk you home, please?

185
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:45,378
Ugh! It's my house, and I have legs, thank you.

186
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:47,429
I can walk home just fine.
Fine, go wherever you want.

187
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,568
I’m staying right here.
Because I want to be the one to take you home.

188
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:52,108
Ugh! You’re so stubborn!

189
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,199
I’ll kick your butt till you fall over!

190
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:00,738
Alright, before you go kicking my butt...

191
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:03,153
- Then let me spank yours first.
- Eek!
