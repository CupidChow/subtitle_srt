1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,877
Loy! Ah!!!

2
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:17,766
- Whan!
- Whan!

3
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,117
Phun! What the hell happened here?

4
00:00:26,763 --> 00:00:27,989
And Loy... is he okay?

5
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:34,734
- What did you expect? I mean...
- Mother!

6
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,108
That damn Loy, he... he just...

7
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:39,967
- Uh...
- That’s enough...

8
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:41,732
That’s enough, Mae Samorn!

9
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:47,234
Enough with the chatter, Mae Samorn.

10
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:52,416
Well... Loy...

11
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:55,585
Well... What, Mae Samorn?

12
00:00:56,668 --> 00:00:58,009
It’s because you speak without thinking—

13
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:01,516
that’s why our son Phaad…

14
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,045
and Mae Ieat’s son, Loy. ended up like this!

15
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:29,720
- Ming!
- Hey!

16
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,650
- Hey!
- Hey!

17
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:34,065
You can’t just lie around here,
go sleep somewhere else!

18
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:35,726
Oh Kamnan…

19
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:38,666
I got dizzy when I saw the blood...

20
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:41,832
- Go lie down somewhere else, Ming.
- I just needed a quick rest, that’s all.

21
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,015
Go sleep somewhere else!

22
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,647
You fool!

23
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,988
Hey!

24
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,908
You two, come in already!

25
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:01,324
Take it slow, Phaad.

26
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:09,899
Thank you so much, Loy.
Without you, I’d be in real trouble.

27
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,509
- P'Loy!
- Hey! Whan!

28
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,458
Whan, come here this instant!

29
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:32,979
What kind of girl
goes around hugging men like that?

30
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:35,419
Let her go first, Mae Lamphoei.

31
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:40,290
If you ask me, things have already gone this far.

32
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:43,922
Besides, Whan was a big part
of what caused all this.

33
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:47,989
And I get it, Kamnan just wants

34
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:52,087
Kamnan just wants this
to be over before anyone dies.

35
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,586
Right, Kamnan?

36
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:55,647
That's right, as Phuyai said.

37
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:01,359
Alright, girl,
say what you need to say, Whan.

38
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,274
We will listen to your needs once.

39
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:11,129
- I love P'Loy.
- Huh?!

40
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,850
Dad, Mom, if you truly love me...

41
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:24,486
Please don't force me
to marry someone I don't love.

42
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,671
You, Phaad!

43
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,639
What do Kamnan and Mae Samorn say?

44
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,889
Phuyai.

45
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:45,840
If Whan doesn't love me...

46
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,249
If she doesn't have feelings for me...

47
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:51,508
Then I won't force her anymore.

48
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:08,942
Thank you very much, P'Phaad.

49
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,121
I will absolutely not let Loy marry Whan.

50
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:25,379
Why not, Kaew?

51
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:33,522
I'll only agree if Loy proves
he truly loves Whan.

52
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:05,508
Hey! You guys, come over here!

53
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:09,885
What do you think about when Phaad tried
to kick P'Loy right onto that sword?

54
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:12,864
When Lert had that knife
right at P'Loy's throat?

55
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:16,173
Oh wow… Thank god
P'Loy dodged just in time!

56
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:19,069
So the knife ended up stabbing Phaad’s own foot!

57
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,986
Oh my... Honestly,
I think he had it coming.

58
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:25,824
Phaad went and gave a full-force kick,
just like that!

59
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,084
Now his foot’s all messed up—
don’t even know if he can walk again.

60
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:31,036
Serves him right.

61
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:34,389
That’ll teach him not
to mess with others again. Totally deserved it.

62
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,685
Oi! Duang, Chomm	m, Phim—you little devils!

63
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:39,826
Dang, y’all are ripping
into my P'real good!

64
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:42,679
You’re really enjoying yourselves, huh?

65
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,298
- Yeah, you guys...
- Aww, don’t be mad!

66
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:50,365
All you did was hear it secondhand,
and now you're talking like you were there!

67
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,824
Don’t you think it’s kind of weird,
P'Gimm, that all of a sudden…

68
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,746
And now P'Kaew
won’t let Sister Whan marry P'Loy.

69
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:58,760
Right?

70
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,959
Huh? Or maybe...

71
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,206
Are those two... you know...?

72
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,618
- Are they seriously fighting again?
- Ughhh!!!

73
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,013
They bicker like this every single day.

74
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:13,303
You know what? That might be for the best.

75
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:17,476
That way,
my sweet Whan won’t have to marry anyone else!

76
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,778
I’ll have my mom go
ask for Whan's hand myself, just you wait!

77
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,948
- Oh my god, Gimm!
- Geez!

78
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,507
You crazy Gimm!

79
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:27,152
- Would you chill for a sec, Gimm?
- C’mon, let’s get out of here.

80
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,618
Ouch! Watch where you're going!

81
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:09,534
Wow, P'Phaad,
that’s so pretty! Can I have it, please?

82
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:10,692
Hands off!

83
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:14,020
Hey Whan, check this out. You like it?

84
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:15,969
I made it just for you. Here, take it.

85
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:17,513
Thanks, P'Phaad!

86
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:19,391
Here, Loy. I’m giving it to you.

87
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:23,695
Ew! That’s ugly. Mine’s way better!

88
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:26,444
Hey! Loy! What the heck was that for?

89
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:27,968
I worked so hard making that for Whan...

90
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:29,802
...and you just threw it away? Seriously?

91
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,403
I just didn’t like it, okay?

92
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:34,582
You wanna get kicked or what, Loy?

93
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:37,497
Hey, stop it! We’re all friends!

94
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:39,456
You saw what he did, right Kaew?

95
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:43,916
Yeah! Don’t let him get away with that,
P'Phaad—he disrespected you!

96
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:47,652
Know your place, Loy.
You can’t even hold a candle to Phaad!

97
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:49,841
Want me to deal with him, Phaad?

98
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,033
Don’t you dare!
Anyone who touches P'Loy will pay!

99
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:57,105
Let’s not fight, we’re friends, remember?

100
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,181
Okay, okay... I’m sorry.
It was my fault. I didn’t think it through.

101
00:11:01,738 --> 00:11:02,958
Hmm, it's fine.

102
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,526
Gaeng Bon — Loy’s favorite.
I’m the best at making it, obviously.

103
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,534
Oh, come on — mine’s way better.

104
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:20,956
But Phaka makes a tasty one too.

105
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:23,584
I said Whan’s is better, didn’t I?!

106
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:26,259
And I'm telling you Bua's is more delicious!

107
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,826
Quit arguing! Everyone makes it tasty.

108
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:32,541
But Whan’s is just a little better.

109
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,148
Shut your mouth!
Whan’s done playing with you, Gimm.

110
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:48,461
Whan’s being mean.
I’m telling P'Phaad so he’ll hate you!

111
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:54,530
Whan, why did you do that?
Gimm is our friend. We should love each other.

112
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:01,578
Whan is sorry, Gimm. When I grow up,
Whan will cook for Gimm myself.

113
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:08,529
Don’t you ever forget this.

114
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:12,073
You're just a woman I use when I want.

115
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:19,664
P'Phaad!?

116
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:34,995
Just a mistress?
You’ll see what happens next.

117
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,821
In that case, Whan dear.

118
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:46,126
Can I walk you home, please?

119
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:49,563
Ugh! It's my house, and I have legs, thank you.

120
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,614
I can walk home just fine.
Fine, go wherever you want.

121
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,883
I’m staying right here.
Because I want to be the one to take you home.

122
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,609
Ugh! You’re so stubborn!

123
00:12:58,305 --> 00:12:59,519
I’ll kick your butt till you fall over!

124
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,962
Alright, before you go kicking my butt...

125
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:08,422
- Then let me spank yours first.
- Eek!

126
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,887
Gimm, you naughty brat! Come here,
I’m kicking your butt right now!
