1
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,507
Hey!

2
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:31,849
Kaew, are you seriously
not going to apologize to me?

3
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,528
Did you even think to tell me
what you were doing?

4
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:37,067
Why should I tell you?

5
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,050
And why the hell should I apologize to you?

6
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:41,518
What was the punch for, huh?

7
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,285
Why, Kaew?

8
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:49,739
Last time, you thought
I hooked up with Phaka behind your back.

9
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:51,781
You even thought
I was after your family’s inheritance,

10
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:53,512
hitting on your sister just to get it.

11
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,245
But when you found out the truth,

12
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:59,550
that I, Loy, would end up
being richer than you.

13
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:01,458
Why?

14
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,743
So someone like me
doesn't get a shot at success, huh?

15
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:10,017
Because for you,
no matter what I do, I'm always wrong.

16
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,431
Because I'm just some poor guy, right?

17
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:15,147
Shut up already, Loy! Huh? Just shut up!

18
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:18,563
I already know everything you're thinking.

19
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:20,919
You know everything about how I feel too.

20
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:24,385
If you want to play tough,
I can play tough too. What do you want?

21
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,853
May the sacred beings be my witness.

22
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:34,203
This Loy swears to love
and remain loyal to Kaew forever..

23
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:40,942
This Kaew also swears to love
and remain unwaveringly loyal to Loy.

24
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:47,432
- When love exists,
- Let it be true.

25
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,077
Nothing but love.

26
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:53,920
That’s why
I believe in this love—it will never change.

27
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:57,979
No matter what rules anyone sets,

28
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:00,929
They can’t define our love.

29
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:04,133
If Loy and Kaew are forbidden to love,

30
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:09,176
Then only death could ever tear us apart.

31
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,033
I freaking love you, Kaew.

32
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,697
Same here, Loy. I love you like crazy.

33
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:44,180
- They say this place is haunted… Aaaahh!!
- Boo!

34
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,043
Geez, Gimm! You're such a kid!

35
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:50,786
Duang, Gimm,

36
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:55,055
- Who else?
- Whan! Oh!

37
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:58,150
- Who?!
- Whan, your beloved woman, P'Phad! Bua.

38
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,437
And... Toss... and Saeng.

39
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,477
They’re all over at Phaka’s place.

40
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:05,842
It’s not just Phaka and Loy like you said.

41
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,257
You know, Gimm’s not bad at all.

42
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:17,473
She’s always hanging around, looking after Whan.

43
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:24,027
I swear, if she were a boy,
Phaad wouldn’t be the only one after Whan.

44
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:27,452
Nual, sis...

45
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:33,952
Have you ever been in love?

46
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:36,693
Yes, I have.

47
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:44,032
But I've never had any luck in love.
