00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,570
Zhou Ruoxi!

178
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,880
This is your last chance.

179
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,050
Don't force my hand.

180
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,080
I've struggled so hard

181
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,260
to get where I am.

182
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,260
I am the Empress of Yunrui.

183
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,970
I will

184
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,900
not leave.

185
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,090
Prince Yan, if you

186
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,750
cannot bear to kill me...

187
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,560
Then go.

188
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,600
Xi, don't blame me.

189
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Only if the evil empress dies

190
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,970
can Zhou Ruoxi live.

191
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,530
How did we end up like this?

192
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,540
Have you truly forgotten

193
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,780
all those memories we shared?

194
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,420
Prince Yan, you accepted my sachet,

195
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,080
which means we're betrothed.

196
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,690
To avenge my mother,

197
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,650
I can only rely on
the Crown Prince's power.

198
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,370
Prince Yan,

199
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,850
you cannot give me these.

200
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,410
Don't move.

201
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,620
Why did you save me?

202
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,270
I told you I wouldn't leave.

203
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,440
I am the Empress of Yunrui.

204
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,490
I will wait here
for His Majesty to return.

205
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,320
The Empress of Yunrui

206
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,540
is there.

207
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,530
Li Yan.

208
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,900
What are you going to do?

209
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:43,970
Zhou Ruoxi.

210
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,800
You should thank me.

211
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,560
I arranged for a death row prisoner
to take your place.

212
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,860
Otherwise,

213
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,590
at today's execution by fire,

214
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,990
you would be the one dying.

215
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,870
No!

216
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,840
It's not like that.

217
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,480
It's not like that.

218
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,380
It's not like that.

219
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,100
Don't move.

220
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,330
You need to witness
your fate with your own eyes.

221
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,160
Execute the evil empress!

222
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,680
Safeguard peace!

223
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,930
Execute the evil empress!

224
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,290
Safeguard peace!

225
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,800
Execute the evil empress!

226
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,340
Safeguard peace!

227
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,750
Execute the evil empress!

228
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,110
Safeguard peace!

229
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,620
Execute the evil empress!

230
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,160
Safeguard peace!

231
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,330
Whoa!

232
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,180
Who goes there?

233
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,800
[Qingzhou]

234
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,980
Yan!

235
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,900
What a coincidence.

236
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,490
You've done great service
in defense of the throne.

237
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,950
Why not wait
for your reward before leaving?

238
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Brother, I heard that you've been

239
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,220
suffering from a long illness

240
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,340
and couldn't even leave your bed.

241
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,210
And then you vanished without a trace.

242
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,300
But now it seems

243
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,700
that was just a false rumor.

244
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,750
Your Majesty!

245
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,450
[Qingzhou]

246
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,260
Your Majesty!

247
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,590
Your Majesty!

248
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,190
You've finally come.

249
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,440
I...

250
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,910
The evil Empress Zhou

251
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,090
was burned at the stake
at the Meridian Gate last night.

252
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,810
Yan.

253
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,200
Why is she still alive?

254
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,120
Your Majesty.

255
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,250
Zhou Ruoxi's crimes are unforgivable.

256
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,730
But everything she did

257
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,790
was for the sake of Yunrui.

258
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,210
I beg you to spare her life.

259
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,630
I nurtured her ambition bit by bit,

260
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,960
all for this day.

261
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,610
Yet you ask me to spare her?

262
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,570
Your Majesty.

263
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,290
You want to kill me?

264
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,710
Zhou Ruoxi.

265
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,210
You caused
your elder sister Ruoyao's death.

266
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,880
You killed the woman I loved most.

267
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,800
Should I not kill you?

268
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,520
Yan.

269
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,360
Kill her now,

270
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,000
and your merit in serving the throne

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
shall remain.

272
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
I cannot

273
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,620
obey this order.

274
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,200
Fine.

275
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,970
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

276
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,550
Liang Feng!

277
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000
Prince Yan!

278
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,220
Yan!

279
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,870
Yan!

280
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,570
Xi.

281
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
It's been so long

282
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,570
since you called me that.

283
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,070
If you care for him so deeply,

284
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,510
why didn't you marry him back then?

285
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,340
What are you laughing at?

286
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,920
I laugh at how pitiful Your Majesty is.

287
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,810
You kept claiming
how much you loved my sister,

288
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,780
but when her face was disfigured,

289
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,470
you didn't dare
to propose to her immediately.

290
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,400
That's how I got the position.

291
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,440
Li Shu,

292
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,920
what you love

293
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,650
and what you care about

294
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,010
from beginning to end

295
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,790
has only been yourself.

296
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,460
What right do you have to accuse me?

297
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,760
Isn't everything happening now

298
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,120
your own doing?

299
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,960
Yes,

300
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,190
but wasn't everything that led me here

301
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,440
part of Your Majesty's plan?

302
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,560
Your Majesty used me
to eliminate the aristocratic clans,

303
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,820
made me the target of everyone's hatred,

304
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,370
then used
the aristocratic clans' vengeance

305
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,900
to kill me.

306
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,390
After my execution,

307
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,440
Your Majesty will take over a clean court.

308
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,640
Shut up!

309
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,830
Yan,

310
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,630
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,140
Xi.

312
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,380
I've kept it all this time.

313
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,100
I got you into this.

314
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,120
If there's a next life,

315
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,760
please don't

316
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,890
meet me again.

317
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,840
I willingly

318
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,630
accept

319
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,440
this fate.

320
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,240
In my entire life,

321
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,570
I've schemed and plotted,

322
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,770
only to end up like this.

323
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,600
It's unbearable to accept.

324
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,230
When clouds drift to the open wild,

325
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,050
dreams turn dark and deep.

326
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,920
A mournful wind stirs the pale mist,

327
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,150
entombing the fragrance of blossoms
throughout the city.

328
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,060
When clouds drift to the open wild,

329
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,860
dreams turn dark and deep.

330
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,780
A mournful wind stirs the pale mist,

331
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,320
entombing the fragrance of blossoms
throughout the city.

332
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,250
When clouds drift to the open wild,

333
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,760
dreams turn dark and deep.

334
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,600
A mournful wind stirs the pale mist,

335
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,860
entombing the fragrance of blossoms
throughout the city.

336
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,780
Miss Ruoxi.

337
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,490
Yan.

338
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,620
Miss Ruoxi.

339
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,570
Prince Yan.

340
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
She is Zhou Ruoxi?

341
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,440
Then who am I?
