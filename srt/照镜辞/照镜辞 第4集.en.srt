Mrs. Zhou,

3
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,680
this tea is what I've granted to you.

4
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,570
Mrs. Zhou,

5
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,810
you must drink it.

6
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,210
I really

7
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,280
cannot drink it.

8
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,180
Why are you so resistant, Mrs. Zhou?

9
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,710
Could there be something wrong
with this tea?

10
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,920
This does not make sense.

11

If there is something wrong with this tea,

12
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,190
how would you know about it, Mrs. Zhou?

13
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,300
No...

14
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,060
There's nothing wrong with it.

15
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,390
How could there be?

16
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,820
Is there really nothing wrong with it?

17
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,200
Would it cause something like

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,400
tuberculosis,

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,890
which might make a person bedridden?

20
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,950
The poisoning symptoms

21
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,440
are like those of tuberculosis.

In mild cases,

a person may become bedridden.

25

may even die.

from Daqing Wolf Camp.

Though my aunt and I aren't close,

Your Highness, you're finally awake.

You've been unconscious for so long.

209

Where is Madam Wang?

How is she?

Madam Wang...

212
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,400
Madam Wang has passed away.

How could this happen?

217
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,630
It was that bowl of medicine.

218
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Someone must have put poison
in that bowl of medicine.

219
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,120
Lord Zhou has already sent people
to investigate it.

220
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,220
They said
there was nothing wrong with the medicine.

221
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,420
The doctor said

222
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,000
Madam Wang had been ill
from years of overwork,

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,080
and after being flogged,

224
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,720
she failed to survive.

Your Highness!

228
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,550
This substitute
not only resembles Miss Zhou Ruoxi,

229
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,650
but she's also heartbroken
about Madam Wang's death.

230
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,930
Why is that?

231
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,760
Why?

232
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,630
Why was the ending still the same

233
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,080
after I came back to this life?

234
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,340
I couldn't save

235
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,510
those who I wanted to save.

236
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,050
I couldn't keep

237
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,910
those who I wanted to keep.

238
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,060
Why did Heaven let me come back?

239
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,960
This is just a joke.

240
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,210
A joke.

241
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,840
Princess,

242
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,910
you're drunk.

243
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,510
Since you're here,

244
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,820
why don't you have a drink with me?

245
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,320
Let me tell you a story.

246
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Once upon a time,

247
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,130
there was a person
who was alone and helpless.

248
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,520
Even her closest one was killed, too.

249
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,930
She wanted to take revenge,

250
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,610
but she didn't have such ability.

251
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,670
She could only take advantage of others.

252
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,000
She thought
after she gained a high status,

253
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,960
everything would be different.

254
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,740
But in the end,
she still caused her own death.

255
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,990
She also caused the death
of the only person who cared about her.

256
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,320
She was not willing to accept this ending.

257
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,170
Fortunately, Heaven pitied her

258
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,560
and gave her a chance to start over.

259
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,920
But she still messed things up.

260
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,860
She was so useless.

261
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,580
Nothing was changed in the end.

262
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,070
No.

263
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,000
It was worse than before.

264
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,740
It was more tragic than before.

265
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,920
It was...

266
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,570
It was more tragic than before.

267
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,920
Princess.

268
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,850
Gains, losses, glory and failure
are all determined by Heaven.

269
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,120
What we can do as humans

270
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,420
is to do our best
and strive for what we want.

271
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,040
I believe

272
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,270
you're not someone
who would give up easily.

273
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,750
Isn't that right?

274
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,910
Yes, that's right.

275
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,930
I shouldn't give up so easily.

You formed a connection‌
