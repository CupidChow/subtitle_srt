How could this happen?

172

My Lord,

173
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,260
we have no idea.

174
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,510
The fire suddenly broke out.

175
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,360
Put out the fire quickly!

176
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,760
Put out the fire quickly!

177
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,730
Hurry and put out the fire!

178
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,360
Hurry! Hurry up!

179
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,060
This place!

180
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,130
Xi!

181
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,960
How could...

182
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,840
Xi!

183
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,600
Let me do it.

184
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,200
This place!

185
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,230
Here!

186
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,040
Hurry!

187
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,480
Here is water!

188
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,320
Xi!

189
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,270
Miss Ruoxi,

190
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,030
it's too dangerous inside.

191
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,540
You can't go in!

192
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,250
Get out of my way!

193
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:46,770
Move!

194
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,500
It's too dangerous!

195
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,980
I am Princess Fu Wei!

196
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,800
Move aside!

197
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,200
Xi!

198
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,850
Xi!

199
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,630
Xi!

200
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,000
Xi,

201
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,040
are you alright?

202
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,700
How...

203
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,740
How can there be two Xi?

204
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,490
Madam Cui,

205
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,940
I will

206
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,130
let you pay the price.
