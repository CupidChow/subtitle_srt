But then, Shu

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,580
came and took the person
away without any explanation.

I wonder what his intentions were.

The person you took that day

176
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,280
Yan.

177
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,910
Then you'd better investigate quickly.

178
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,030
I'm alone at the mansion

179
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,630
and feeling rather lonely.

180
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,690
I might do something

181
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,910
harmful to your wife.

182
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,610
Thank you for the warning, Brother.

183
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,130
The next time we meet,

184
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,450
it will probably be

185
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,650
at the heir appointment banquet.

186
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,440
Li Yan!

187
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,890
Let me tell you!

188
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Father will not depose me.

189
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,090
Brother,

190
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,840
I take my leave.

191
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,510
Greetings, Your Highness.

192
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,420
Everyone, leave us.

193
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,410
Yes.

194
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,800
Father.

195
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,340
His Majesty wants to
depose the Crown Prince

196
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,020
and make Prince Yan the heir instead.

197
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,970
Is this true?

198
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,000
Who told you this?

199
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,900
Crown Prince Shu
is now under house arrest.

200
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Today, Prince Yan

201
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,720
even came to the mansion
to flaunt his power.

202
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,330
She longs to rule
as the empress, revered by the world.

203
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,270
This Li Yan

204
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,770
wants to seize the throne.

205
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,950
I certainly won't give in without a fight.

206
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,640
Father.

207
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,040
Now

208
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,660
we're in the same boat.

209
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,520
If the Crown Prince falls

210
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,460
and Prince Yan takes his place,

211
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,590
then our Zhou family

212
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,500
will have no place to stand.

213
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't worry, Xi.

214
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
As long as you do as I say,

215
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,720
all will be well.

216
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,220
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

217
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,500
The tide is turning.

218
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,550
We must ensure nothing goes wrong.

219
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,520
Crown Prince Shu.

220
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,030
I've prepared some sobering soup for you.

221
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,830
Please

222
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,380
drink it soon.

223
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,320
Get out.

224
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,300
I'm only thinking of your best interests.

225
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,250
Please drink this.

226
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,210
I am not drunk.

227
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,070
Why would I need sobering soup?

228
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,840
But I think

229
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,460
you are drunk.

230
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,600
Get out!

231
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,170
Crown Prince Shu,

232
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,670
you're under house arrest
in this mansion now.

233
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,640
Where else could you go?
