174
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,760
How would she die?

175
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,940
Your Highness,
you may choose not to believe me.

176
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,480
But you have to understand

177
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,970
life and death

178
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,700
might be decided by just one thought.

179
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,680
As for what to choose,

180
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,510
it's up to this young lady.

181
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,410
If she doesn't want to stay alive,

182
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,550
no one can save her.

183
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,380
That's absurd!

184
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,380
Prince Yan.

185
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,920
Prince Yan.

186
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,490
Please let the doctor leave first.

187
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,760
I have something to tell you.

188
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,080
Miss,

189
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,630
if you want to stay alive,

190
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,130
come find me within 3 days.

191
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,660
This is your last chance.

192
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,480
Prince Yan.

193
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,540
In everyone's lifetime,

194
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,510
fate is predetermined.

195
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,550
We shouldn't force it.

196
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,630
Nor should we

197
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,500
go against the trend.

198
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,470
What fate?

199
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,700
I never believe in fate.

200
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,280
In this world,

201
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,640
there's no fate I cannot conquer.

202
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,290
This is fate.

203
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,090
Why is your pulse...

204
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,280
It's the pulse of a dead person.

205
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,440
I am already

206
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,630
a dead person.

207
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,720
Since the moment I just returned,

208
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,530
I've been a dead person.

209
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,369
I have no pulse.

210
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,069
That was why in the suburbs,

211
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:57,730
Xi thought I was dead.

212
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm actually not the Princess of Daqing.

213
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,090
I don't even belong to this world.

214
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,310
I am Zhou Ruoxi
from 3 years in the future.

215
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,480
3 years in the future?

216
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm that lowly

217
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,310
concubine's daughter from the Zhou family.

218
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,000
I know my own ending.

219
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,570
I also know everyone else's ending here.

220
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,530
The day when I first met you in this life

221
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,000
was the day

222
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,190
when my mother died in my previous life.

223
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,990
Mother!

224
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:38,920
Go away!

225
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,840
In that life...

226
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,210
Mother!

227
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,430
I couldn't save her.

228
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,160
Later,

229
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,140
to take revenge,

230
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,180
I made my eldest sister

231
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,360
marry Li Shu...

232
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,010
and give up on you.

233
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,960
But in the end,

234
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,400
you still died because of me.
