found in Madam Wang's room.

175
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,809
How could these documents

176
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,130
be in my mom's room?

177
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,059
I never saw these in my previous life.

178
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,010
What's more,

179
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,309
I also have a witness.

180
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
A witness?

181
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,190
Ruoxi,

182
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
tell us the truth.

183
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,680
Xi,

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,930
think carefully before you speak.

185
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,760
Xi,

186
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,770
these loan sharking receipts

187
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,500
were given by the Wang family.

188
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
Why did I say this?

189
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,020
How could I possibly harm my mom?

190
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,840
The testimony of her own daughter

191
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,210
serves as solid evidence!

192
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,760
The Wang family engaged in loan sharking

193
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,900
for personal profit.

194
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,500
It is an unforgivable crime.

195
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,480
Father,

196
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,620
Mother has always been at odds with
the Wang family.

197
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,900
You know this.

198
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,040
These loan sharking receipts must be
their attempt to frame her.

199
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,080
Father, please

200
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,540
help clear Mother's name.

201
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,680
I should prevent them from framing my mom.

202
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,250
As a daughter of the Wang family,

203
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,480
how could she get away with it?

204
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,320
Mrs. Zhou has reversed cause and effect.

205
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,720
How eloquent you are!

206
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,300
In the Zhou family,

207
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,080
who is the real beneficiary of
this loan sharking case?

208
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280
Your Highness,

209
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,850
what do you mean?

210
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,590
Though Mrs. Zhou's attire

211
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,540
looks understated,

212
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,850
it is high-quality clothing made by
the Jiangnan Weaving Bureau.

213
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,220
It's worth a fortune.

214
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
I'm afraid that there are
a few such garments in the palace.

215
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,220
Your Highness,

216
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,300
what is Lord Zhou's
monthly salary

217
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,780
as the Minister of Rites?

218
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,900
Lord Zhou

219
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,660
is so rich that

220
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,940
his wife could afford such luxuries.

221
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,630
You...

222
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,000
Lord Zhou,

223
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,680
regarding Her Highness's words,

224
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,940
do you have any explanation?

225
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,800
Your Highness,

226
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,940
the attire my wife is wearing

227
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,600
was

228
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,230
a gift

229
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,850
from

230
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,370
the Marquis of Zhen'guo's Mansion.

231
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,290
Well,

232
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,900
the Princess has just arrived here.

233
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,220
She

234
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,510
didn't know the truth.

235
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,420
Your Highness,

236
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,040
please

237
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,190
do not wrongly accuse me.

238
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,090
Your Highness,

239
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,760
the loan sharking case
still needs investigation.

240
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,120
This incident arose from
the jealousy of my wife and concubine

241
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,960
who competed for favor.

242
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,490
Madam Cui,

243
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,120
hurry up and confess!

244
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,770
What?

245
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,200
Hurry up and confess!

246
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,380
It was all my fault.

247
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,620
I was possessed

248
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,120
and didn't thoroughly
investigate this matter

249
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,840
before punishing Madam Wang.

250
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,570
Please forgive me, My Lord.

251
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,940
You beat her
without a thorough investigation.

252
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,060
Then what about

253
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,940
the beating my aunt just received?

254
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,340
How do you make up for her?

255
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,060
Guards!

256
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,700
Take Madam Cui away!

257
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,160
Strike her with a cane twenty times!

258
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,500
Yes, sir.

259
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,030
Yes, sir.

260
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,130
My Lord?

261
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,960
Take her away.

262
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:29,970
My..

263
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,720
My...

264
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,590
My Lord!

265
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:33,920
My...

266
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,560
My Lord!

267
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,000
Mother!

268
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:37,900
Mother,

269
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
this time,

270
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,060
My Lord!

271
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,380
I won't let anyone bully us.

272
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,730
My Lord!

273
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,720
Lord Zhou.

274
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,150
I have just reunited with my aunt.

275
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,000
I want to stay at Zhou's Mansion.

276
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Do you

277
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,200
welcome me?

278
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,450
It would be my honor

279
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,760
if you stay here.

280
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,350
I will let servants
make preparations right away.

281
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,680
Your Highness,

282
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,190
I'll take my leave.

283
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,270
The Princess of Daqing

284
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,110
is quite interesting.

285
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,740
Your Highness.

286
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,870
Yan.

287
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,180
Your Highness.

288
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,900
Your Highness, you haven't left yet.

289
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,090
Do you have something to ask me?

290
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,800
Daqing's Peace-Making Marriage Delegation
was attacked by bandits at the posthouse.

291
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,560
Only you managed to survive.

292
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,110
And you came to Zhou's Mansion.

293
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,640
Isn't it too coincidental?

294
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,650
Bandits attacked the posthouse?

295
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,560
I didn't know
such a major incident had happened.

296
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,150
Your Highness, are you doubting

297
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,170
that I have something to do with

298
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,330
this matter?

299
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,170
Does it have nothing to do with you?

300
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,850
You people in Yunrui
are really ridiculous.

301
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,640
Bandits kill my men.

302
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,710
Instead of investigating who's behind this

303
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,060
and what his purpose is,

304
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,400
you're questioning me.

305
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,800
Why don't you ask me

306
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,600
if I know why I deserve to die?

307
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,590
Such a sharp tongue.

308
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,760
Please rest well, Your Highness.

309
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,310
Once I uncover the truth,

310
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,490
I will return

311
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,260
to explain everything to you.

312
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
That's fine.

313
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,310
Now Yan and I are like strangers.

314
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,050
Mother has been rescued.

315
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,900
I wonder if everything

316
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
can be changed.

317
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:25,920
Mother.

318
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,590
Kneel down!

319
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,410
Kneel down!

320
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,070
Do you know

321
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
what you did wrong today?

322
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,180
The Wang family mistreated you.

323
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Originally, I wanted to avenge you.

324
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,140
I didn't expect that I was utilized by
Big Mother.

325
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,260
It's my fault.

326
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,430
You wanted to avenge me.

327
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,920
I won't blame you for that.

328
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,840
I would rather risk my life
to protect you.

329
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,630
But judging from what you did today,

330
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,630
I think you are treating the Wang family
as your enemy.

331
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,090
If you persist in such thinking,

332
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,660
you will kill them one day.

333
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,620
Don't they deserve to die?

334
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,240
You treated them as your family

335
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,960
but what did they do to you?

336
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,830
When you were unmarried,

337
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,560
they forced you to be submissive.

338
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,370
For a mere trifle of gain, they forced you
to marry into the Zhou family.

339
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,570
When you were bullied at Zhou's Mansion

340
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
and returned to the Wang family
to ask for help,

341
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,610
they disregarded family ties
and kicked you out.

342
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,950
When you were seriously ill,

343
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,290
they refused to give you even a penny.

344
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,870
Xi.

345
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,930
Mother.

346
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,360
The loan sharking case arose

347
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,840
because the Wang family was greedy

348
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,240
and played with fire.

349
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,100
It was exposed,

350
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,630
and Big Mother wanted to frame us.

351
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,520
If I hadn't exposed the Wang family then,

352
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,320
you would have been implicated.

353
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,400
Mother.

354
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,740
Mother.

355
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,060
If the Wang family

356
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,730
really collapses,

357
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,850
do you think

358
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,860
I can survive?

359
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,150
This has nothing to do with you.

360
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,900
I'll beg Father

361
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,570
to protect you.

362
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,440
Xi.

363
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,800
You're too naive.

364
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,170
If your father

365
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,670
had any feelings for me,

366
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,690
today's incident

367
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,890
would never have happened.

368
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,280
Yan.

369
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,580
Yan.

370
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,940
Who is she?

371
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,530
Why did I dream of her?
