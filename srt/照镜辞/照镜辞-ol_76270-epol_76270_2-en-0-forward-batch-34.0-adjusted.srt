found in Madam Wang's room.

175
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,809
How could these documents

176
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:11,130
be in my mom's room?

177
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,059
I never saw these in my previous life.

178
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,010
What's more,

179
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,309
I also have a witness.

180
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,880
A witness?

181
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,190
Ruoxi,

182
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
tell us the truth.

183
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,680
Xi,

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,930
think carefully before you speak.

185
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,760
Xi,

186
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,770
these loan sharking receipts

187
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,500
were given by the Wang family.

188
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,120
Why did I say this?

189
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,020
How could I possibly harm my mom?

190
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,840
The testimony of her own daughter

191
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,210
serves as solid evidence!

192
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,760
The Wang family engaged in loan sharking

193
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,900
for personal profit.

194
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,500
It is an unforgivable crime.

195
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,480
Father,

196
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,620
Mother has always been at odds with
the Wang family.

197
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,900
You know this.

198
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,040
These loan sharking receipts must be
their attempt to frame her.

199
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,080
Father, please

200
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,540
help clear Mother's name.

201
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,680
I should prevent them from framing my mom.

202
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,250
As a daughter of the Wang family,

203
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,480
how could she get away with it?

204
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,320
Mrs. Zhou has reversed cause and effect.

205
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,720
How eloquent you are!

206
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,300
In the Zhou family,

207
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,080
who is the real beneficiary of
this loan sharking case?

208
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,280
Your Highness,

209
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,850
what do you mean?

210
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,590
Though Mrs. Zhou's attire

211
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,540
looks understated,

212
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,850
it is high-quality clothing made by
the Jiangnan Weaving Bureau.

213
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,220
It's worth a fortune.

214
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,360
I'm afraid that there are
a few such garments in the palace.

215
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,220
Your Highness,

216
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,300
what is Lord Zhou's
monthly salary

217
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,780
as the Minister of Rites?

218
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,900
Lord Zhou

219
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,660
is so rich that

220
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,940
his wife could afford such luxuries.

221
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,630
You...

222
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,000
Lord Zhou,

223
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,680
regarding Her Highness's words,

224
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,940
do you have any explanation?

225
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,800
Your Highness,

226
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,940
the attire my wife is wearing

227
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,600
was

228
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,230
a gift

229
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:03,850
from

230
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,370
the Marquis of Zhen'guo's Mansion.

231
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,290
Well,

232
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,900
the Princess has just arrived here.

233
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,220
She

234
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,510
didn't know the truth.

235
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,420
Your Highness,

236
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,040
please

237
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,190
do not wrongly accuse me.

238
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,090
Your Highness,

239
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,760
the loan sharking case
still needs investigation.

240
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,120
This incident arose from
the jealousy of my wife and concubine

241
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,960
who competed for favor.

242
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,490
Madam Cui,

243
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,120
hurry up and confess!

244
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,770
What?

245
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,200
Hurry up and confess!

246
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,380
It was all my fault.

247
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,620
I was possessed

248
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,120
and didn't thoroughly
investigate this matter

249
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,840
before punishing Madam Wang.

250
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,570
Please forgive me, My Lord.

251
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,940
You beat her
without a thorough investigation.

252
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,060
Then what about

253
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,940
the beating my aunt just received?

254
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,340
How do you make up for her?

255
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,060
Guards!

256
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,700
Take Madam Cui away!

257
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,160
Strike her with a cane twenty times!

258
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,500
Yes, sir.

259
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,030
Yes, sir.

260
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,130
My Lord?

261
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,960
Take her away.

262
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:03,970
My..

263
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,720
My...

264
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,590
My Lord!

265
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:07,920
My...

266
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,560
My Lord!

267
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,000
Mother!

268
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:11,900
Mother,

269
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
this time,

270
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,060
My Lord!

271
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,380
I won't let anyone bully us.

272
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,730
My Lord!

273
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,720
Lord Zhou.

274
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,150
I have just reunited with my aunt.

275
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,000
I want to stay at Zhou's Mansion.

276
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you

277
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,200
welcome me?

278
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,450
It would be my honor

279
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,760
if you stay here.

280
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,350
I will let servants
make preparations right away.

281
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,680
Your Highness,

282
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,190
I'll take my leave.

283
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,270
The Princess of Daqing

284
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,110
is quite interesting.

285
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,740
Your Highness.

286
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,870
Yan.

287
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,180
Your Highness.

288
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,900
Your Highness, you haven't left yet.

289
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,090
Do you have something to ask me?

290
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,800
Daqing's Peace-Making Marriage Delegation
was attacked by bandits at the posthouse.

291
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,560
Only you managed to survive.

292
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,110
And you came to Zhou's Mansion.

293
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,640
Isn't it too coincidental?

294
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,650
Bandits attacked the posthouse?

295
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,560
I didn't know
such a major incident had happened.

296
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,150
Your Highness, are you doubting

297
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,170
that I have something to do with

298
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,330
this matter?

299
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,170
Does it have nothing to do with you?

300
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,850
You people in Yunrui
are really ridiculous.

301
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,640
Bandits kill my men.

302
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,710
Instead of investigating who's behind this

303
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,060
and what his purpose is,

304
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,400
you're questioning me.

305
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,800
Why don't you ask me

306
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,600
if I know why I deserve to die?

307
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,590
Such a sharp tongue.

308
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,760
Please rest well, Your Highness.

309
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,310
Once I uncover the truth,

310
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,490
I will return

311
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,260
to explain everything to you.

312
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
That's fine.

313
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,310
Now Yan and I are like strangers.

314
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,050
Mother has been rescued.

315
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,900
I wonder if everything

316
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,120
can be changed.

317
00:14:59,460 --> 00:14:59,920
Mother.

318
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,590
Kneel down!

319
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,410
Kneel down!

320
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,070
Do you know

321
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,360
what you did wrong today?

322
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,180
The Wang family mistreated you.

323
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,250
Originally, I wanted to avenge you.

324
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,140
I didn't expect that I was utilized by
Big Mother.

325
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,260
It's my fault.

326
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,430
You wanted to avenge me.

327
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,920
I won't blame you for that.

328
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,840
I would rather risk my life
to protect you.

329
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,630
But judging from what you did today,

330
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,630
I think you are treating the Wang family
as your enemy.

331
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,090
If you persist in such thinking,

332
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,660
you will kill them one day.

333
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,620
Don't they deserve to die?

334
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,240
You treated them as your family

335
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,960
but what did they do to you?

336
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,830
When you were unmarried,

337
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,560
they forced you to be submissive.

338
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,370
For a mere trifle of gain, they forced you
to marry into the Zhou family.

339
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,570
When you were bullied at Zhou's Mansion

340
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,000
and returned to the Wang family
to ask for help,

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,610
they disregarded family ties
and kicked you out.

342
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,950
When you were seriously ill,

343
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,290
they refused to give you even a penny.

344
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,870
Xi.

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,930
Mother.

346
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
The loan sharking case arose

347
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,840
because the Wang family was greedy

348
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,240
and played with fire.

349
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,100
It was exposed,

350
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,630
and Big Mother wanted to frame us.

351
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,520
If I hadn't exposed the Wang family then,

352
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,320
you would have been implicated.

353
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,400
Mother.

354
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,740
Mother.

355
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,060
If the Wang family

356
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,730
really collapses,

357
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,850
do you think

358
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,860
I can survive?

359
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,150
This has nothing to do with you.

360
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,900
I'll beg Father

361
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,570
to protect you.

362
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,440
Xi.

363
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,800
You're too naive.

364
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,170
If your father

365
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,670
had any feelings for me,

366
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,690
today's incident

367
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,890
would never have happened.

368
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,280
Yan.

369
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,580
Yan.

370
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,940
Who is she?

371
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:52,530
Why did I dream of her?
