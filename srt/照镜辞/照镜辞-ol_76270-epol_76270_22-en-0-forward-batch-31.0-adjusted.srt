Zhou Kui.

3
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,060
What exactly are you trying to do?

4
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,410
He planted explosives
around the Imperial City.

5
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Fu Wei.

6
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,239
Should I address you
as the Minister of Rites

7
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,270
or the Fifth Prince of Daqing?

8
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,730
How unexpected.

9
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,620
I have

10
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,140
hidden my identity for so many years,

11
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,430
yet

12
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,350
I was exposed by a mere girl.

13
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,710
Is this the real reason
you killed Madam Wang?

14
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,470
Wang saw the tattoo on my hand.

15
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,980
She had to die.

16
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,440
But come to think of it,

17
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,650
if anyone's to blame,

18
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,330
it's you, Princess of Daqing,

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,500
for your sudden arrival.

20
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,360
She thought

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,920
she had found a protector

22
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,070
and dared to leave my mansion.

23
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,640
Your Highness,

24
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,430
you've been deceiving me for a long time.

25
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,680
This time,

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,840
you can hand over
the Red-armored Army's command token,

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,600
no,

28
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,280
the real command token,

29
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,490
to me now.

30
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,390
The Red-armored Army

31
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,889
is Yunrui's elite force.

32
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,140
I will never give it to you.

33
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,710
Look.

34
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,079
With just one command from me,

35
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,900
the entire Imperial City
will be reduced to ashes.

36
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,090
Think carefully.

37
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,520
This is your last chance.

38
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,870
Will you surrender it

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,310
or not?

40
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,780
Father.

41
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,640
The command token.

42
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,270

47

You killed my mother.

48

I will kill you

I can

53
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,880
still spare your lives.

54
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,420
We surrender

55

Father,

58
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,490
you must be startled.

59
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,530
This place is dangerous.

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,050

61

hidden my identity for so many years,

but never expected

everything you've done

69
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,160
is your own doing.

70
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,350
The one who took your throne

71
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,540
wasn't Yunrui.

72
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,920
Those who made you homeless

73
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,730
weren't the people of Qingzhou either.

74
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,990
None of this had anything to do with them.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,720
What does...

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,940
What does that have to do with you?

77
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,120
You were just a substitute.

78
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,640
You're not Princess Fu Wei at all.

79
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,920
Of course I'm not the Princess of Daqing.

80
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,720
I am Zhou Ruoxi.

81
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:20,740
What did you say?

82
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,840
I am Zhou Ruoxi
from 3 years in the future.

83
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,159
I am your daughter.

In this reincarnated life,

86
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,430
I thought saving my mother

87
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,930
would change everything.

88
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,990
But what I never expected was

89
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,600
that the one behind all this

90
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,600
was actually you.

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,960
Fine.

92
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
Fine.

93
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,360
Since it has come to this,

94
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
I will...

95
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,230
I will make everyone in the city

96
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,159
die with me.

97

Shoot!

98
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,510
How can this be?

99
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,240
Why hasn't the Imperial City exploded?

100
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,330
How is this possible?

101
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,000

104

Leave immediately.

105

Search carefully around the Imperial City.

106

If you find any gunpowder,

107

destroy it at once.

108
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,560
Yes.

109
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,860
You have no chance of winning.

110
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,830
Destroyed?

111
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,330
Destroyed?

112
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,830
My grand legacy.

113

and endured all my life.

115

All destroyed by you.

116
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,860
All ruined by you.

117
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,080

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,480
I knew you had other plans.

121
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,530
I trust you.

122
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,220
I always have.

The one you should trust

is yourself.

125
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,420
That day in the Crown Prince's Mansion,

126
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,900
I discovered Zhou Kui

127
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,660
had stockpiled
large amounts of sulfur and charcoal.

128
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,590
I knew things weren't that simple.

129
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
So

130
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,870
I had to pretend to go along with him

131
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,240
and use the situation to my advantage.

134
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,890
Take him away.

135
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,350
Yes.

Come with me.

144
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,240
While I'm here,

145
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,850
you won't die.

146

148

It's been so long

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,590
since you called me that.

150
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,910
I finally remember.

151
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,300
I remember our past.

152
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,740
I remember our two lifetimes.

We've always stood
by each other through life and death.

So our first meeting

155
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,800
was actually a reunion.

156
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,030
Yan.

157
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,210
It's snowing again.

158
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,410
I saw it

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,790
in my previous life.

160

This time upon my return,

161
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,850
I have fled,

who pulled me closer again and again.

166

Since you came for a marriage alliance,

167
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,910
why don't you marry me?

168

Xi.

169
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,680
Let me.

But Yan,

174
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,320
why can't we escape our fate,

175

nor this snow?

176
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,610
No need to escape.

177
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,620
And don't be afraid.

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,500
to play chess with you
under the moonlight,

180
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,700
to walk side by side with you,

181

and to be bound
with you in life and death...

182

All of this for me

183

Of all things in this world,

as long as we're together,

that alone

187
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,360

I'm sorry, Yan.

In this life,

190

I've dragged you down again.

191
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,310
It's alright.

192

all glory has faded.

Excuse me.

203
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,630
There's a Chinese cultural festival
up ahead.

204

Would you be interested
in checking it out?
