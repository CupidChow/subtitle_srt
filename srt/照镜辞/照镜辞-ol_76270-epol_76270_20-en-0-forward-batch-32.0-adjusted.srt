How has

4
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,750
Your Highness been these days?

5
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,620
He's been very obedient.

6
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,420
Good.

7
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,260
Your Highness,

8
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,370
it's time for your medicine.

9
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,300
Your Highness,

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,550
where is the military token

11
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,570
of the Red-armored Army now?

12
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,100
If you don't hand it over,

13
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,300
don't blame me

14
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,500
for showing no mercy.

15
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,120
Tell me where it is.

16
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,940
Where is it?

17
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,740
Father.

18
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,570
Leave it to me.

19
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,130
Your Highness.

20
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,570
Your Highness.

21
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,180
Why fight to the bitter end?

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,300
Being kind to others

23
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,390
is also being kind to yourself.

24
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,660
Isn't that right?

25
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,020
Take good care of His Highness

26
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,780
and make sure

27
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,340
nothing goes wrong.

28
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,220
Yes.

29
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,280
Xi is quite capable indeed.

30
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,040
You convinced the Crown Prince

31
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,450
with just a few words.

32
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,390
I'm not capable.

33
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,810
It's because you

34
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,610
intentionally gave the Crown Prince
a way out.

35
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,600
How do you know

36
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,730
I wouldn't kill him?

37
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,880
You have been planning for years.

38
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,820
You are determined to marry
Ruoyao to Crown Prince Shu.

39
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,900
I believe

40
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,140
your ambition

41
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,480
must be more than

42
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,630
rebelling.

43
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,990
The Li family

44
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,500
has held imperial power for many years.

45
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,190
It's not something that can be

46
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,940
overthrown overnight.

47
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,280
So, you

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,560
want an emperor whom you can control.

49
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,510
Then, you can replace him completely

50
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,980
without striking a blow.

51
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,280
Why didn't I notice before

52
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,860
that you are so smart?

53
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,370
I was so immature before

54
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,089
that I couldn't help you.

55
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,510
But in the Zhou family,

56
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,650
I'm the one who resembles you the most.

57
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,260
And I'm the only one who can help

58
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,380
you achieve your grand ambitions.

59
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,400
However,

60
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,130
although you can
control the Red-armored Army now,

61
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,730
with just a few thousand men,

62
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,780
how can we resist vast enemy forces?

63
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,040
Moreover,

64
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,350
the princes' troops are stationed

65
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,190
around the Imperial City.

66
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,610
If there's any disturbance
in the Imperial City,

67
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,430
I'm afraid...

68
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,290
Don't worry about that.

69
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,180
I have my own arrangements.

70
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,000
Besides the Red-armored Army,

71
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,220
I've also prepared arms and ordnance.

72
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,030
Arms and ordnance?

73
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,520
Why are you shouting?

74
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,420
When the time comes,

75
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,450
they will be delivered
to the Imperial City.

76
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,170
By then,

77
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,230
Qingzhou

78
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,700
will be impenetrable.

79
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,810
No matter how powerful their troops are,

80
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,810
they won't be able to break through.

81
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,360
But

82
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,690
His Majesty has already placed

83
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,430
heavy guards on Military Supply Route.

84
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,410
Father,

85
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,640
how will you manage this?

86
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,760
You don't need to worry about this.

87
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,200
I have it all figured out.

88
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,120
By the way,

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,520
for the next few days,

90
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,650
I'll be staying here

91
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,690
to prevent

92
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,600
any further incidents.

93
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,110
I

94
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,130
will make arrangements right away.

95
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,780
Your Highnesses,

96
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,780
new information.

97
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,920
In Liangzhou,

98
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,980
there are indeed two merchant caravans

99
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,409
that set off simultaneously for Qingzhou.

100
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,510
But one took the land route

101
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,830
while the other took the water route.

102
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,230
I truly don't know

103
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,480
which caravan is transporting

104
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,800
the arms and ordnance.

105
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,270
Should I

106
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,930
intercept both of them

107
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,610
and inspect their cargo?

108
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,710
That won't work.

109
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,800
Zhou Kui arranged for two caravans to
depart simultaneously

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
to prevent any incidents.

111
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
If we intercept both caravans,

112
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,290
I'm afraid

113
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,840
it will alert Zhou Kui.

114
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,340
Besides,

115
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
Shu is still in his hands.

116
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,590
The guards near the Imperial City

117
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,790
will take at least three days to arrive.

118
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,020
If we alert our enemies,

119
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,380
I'm afraid that Zhou Kui

120
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,720
might become desperate and reckless.

121
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,810
Our current plan

122
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
depends on news from the other side.

123

Why aren't you resting in your room?

Why did you come to the study?

126
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,940
The weather has turned cold.

127
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,060
I've brought you a coat.

Your Highness.

138
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,800
Since when have you become interested

139
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,950
in the Minister of Rites' documents?

140
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,960
These days, I've been helping my father
with official matters.

141
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,220
I realized

142
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,120
that being the Minister of Rites

143
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,480
isn't easy.

144
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:10,289
Not only must one
handle diplomatic affairs,

145
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:11,929
but also one has to oversee

146
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,020
merchant activities.

147
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,140
For instance, a few days ago,

148
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,670
the silks and porcelains sent from
Daliang to the Imperial City

149
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,510
could have all been transported by water.

150
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,870
But my father was worried that

151
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,540
due to the recent bad weather,

152
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,650
ships might encounter storms.

153
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,020
So he deliberately split the shipment
into two batches.

154
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,970
You should return to your room to rest.

155
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,480
Otherwise, when my father comes,

156
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,200
he'll criticize me for not taking
good care of you.

was just sent from

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,960
Horses are printed on it.

161

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,610

Using handkerchiefs to send messages

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,510
is an arrangement between you

165

I don't know if Shu

173
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,310
is safe.

174
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,480
Don't worry.

175
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,430
Since the Crown Prince
can send messages out,

176
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,990
he must be safe for now.

177
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,390
We should

178
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,040
quickly devise a strategy

179
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
and get prepared in advance,

180
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,560
so that we can rescue him.

181
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,290
Liang Feng.

182
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,710
Give the order

183
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,970
to intercept that shipment
coming by the land route.

184
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,730
Be quick

185
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,620
and thorough.

186
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,160
Yes.

187
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,130
Wait.

188
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,140
Your Highness.

189
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,250
Rather than alerting them,

190
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,740
we should switch the goods

191
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,710
to avoid Zhou Kui's suspicion.

192
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,400
I've endured humiliation
for so many years.

193
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,520
Finally, this day has come.

194
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,120
When I put on this imperial robe,

195
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,060
I will reclaim my dynasty

196
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,480
and receive the homage of all subjects.

197
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,880
Zhou Kui!

198
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
You...

199
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,400
You won't succeed.

200
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,040
Then, let's

201
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,800
just wait and see.

202
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,800
Master,

203
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,900
the goods have arrived at
the Imperial City gate.

204
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,000
Excellent.

205
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,970
Let the Red-armored Army

206
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,030
stand by at the Imperial City gate.

207
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,840
Yes.

208
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Your Highness,

209
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,370
I'll have to trouble you

210
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,080
to come with me.

211
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,450
Guards!

212
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,960
Yes!

213
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,300
You don't need to come with us today.

214
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,140
You have other matters to do.

215
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,120
Ruoyao

216
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,190
came back.

217
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,670
[The country prospers
and the people live in peace]

218
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,570
Your Highness.

219
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,860
Hold on a little longer.

220
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,720
Once the Red-armored Army arrives,

221
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,120
we'll storm the palace.

222
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,170
The emperor's throne

223
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,950
will soon be yours.

224
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,160
You are a traitor

225
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,540
who deserves death!

226
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,120
Traitor?

227
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,620
Where does

228
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,210
that accusation come from?

229
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,860
I

230
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,690
might as well tell you the truth.

231
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,320
I was never a subject of Yunrui
from the very beginning.

232
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,130
How can you say I am a traitor?

233
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,400
Lord.

234
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,330
Terrible news!

235
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,030
The weapons we transported into the city
have been replaced!

236
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,960
What did you say?

237
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,600
[The country prospers
and the people live in peace]

238
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,260
Protect His Highness!

239
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,590
Capture Zhou Kui alive!

240
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,710
Lord Zhou.

241
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,350
You have nowhere to run.

242
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,760
How did you know

243
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,830
the route of transporting
arms and ordnance

244
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,550
and act ahead of time?

245
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,210
Lord Zhou, you've planned for so long.

246
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,090
But sadly,

247
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,910
you've failed at the final step.

248
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,580
With just these dozen royal guards,

249
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,140
you think you can ruin my grand ambition?

250
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,880
Let me tell you.

251
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,400
The Red-armored Army

252
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,730
will be here any moment.

253
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,550
Why don't you beg me?

254
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,910
Beg me

255
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,330
to leave your body intact.

256
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,140
The Red-armored Army?

257
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,690
The Red-armored Army won't come either.

258
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,130
Lord Zhou.

259
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,170
The real military token

260
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,810
is in my possession.

261
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,240
You... You're...

262
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,920
Guards!

263
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,690
Arrest Zhou Kui, the traitor!

264
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,520
Who dares do so?

265
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,490
Stop!

266
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,050
Who dares touch my father?

267
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,690
Ruoyao?

268
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,000
Your Highness.

269
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,100
Miss Ruoyao.

270
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,400
Why did you come back?

271
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,180
Father's birthday is coming soon.

272
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,040
I came back to celebrate with him.

273
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,340
Where is Father?

274
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,490
You've come back

275
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,030
just in time.

276
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,540
Your Highness.

277
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,550
If you want her to live,

278
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,200
let us go.

279
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,380
Your Highness.

280
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,140
Please prepare a carriage for us,
Your Highness.

281
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,720
Shu.

282
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,760
Ruoyao.

283
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,490
Prepare a carriage.

284
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,530
Shu.

285
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,690
Prepare a carriage!

286
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,820
Liang Feng.

287
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,620
Yes.

288
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,790
Send out the order.

289
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,820
Arrest Zhou Kui,

290
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,650
the traitor!
