This peach kernel tea
is astringent and bitter.

00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,970
Only when you get used to it
will you feel its aftertaste is sweet.

It's what you like, Princess.

5
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,220
It's astringent.

6
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,650
I used to think
this tea was astringent and bitter too,

7
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,200
but after drinking it for a long time,

8

I finally felt its aftertaste was sweet.

Since you've long known that I'm not Xi,

playing along with me here?

You set up this stage.

And why are you wearing my clothes?

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,530
No wonder Linglan didn't let me go out.

31

It turns out that you went out
to meet with Prince Yan.

32
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,710
There are so many aristocrats
in the Imperial City.

33

Why must you choose the one I've selected?

34
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,030
You could choose anyone else,

35

but not Li Yan.

Why couldn't I choose Li Yan?

37

Do you have feelings for him?

38

Anyway, you must stay away from him.

39
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,750
What right do you have
to interfere in my affairs?

40
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,000
Because I know

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,930
you just want to use him
to climb up the social ladder.

42

Is it wrong to rely on powerful men?

45

You have a high status,
so no one can bully you.

46

Why should I let myself
be trampled on arbitrarily?

Why is Xi
still sticking to her wrong ideas?

51

How can I make her understand this?

Being unable to guess it

Nor can I afford to do that.

171
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,650
I have more important things to do.

172
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,090
Romantic love is not what I seek for.

173
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,880
I also hope that

174
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,830
you won't fall into it.

175
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,090
What if I say

176
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
I'll wait for you?

177
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,690
Take the umbrella.

178
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,170
Why are you waiting here, Crown Prince?

179
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,760
There's something

180
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,990
I'd like to ask you about.

181
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,790
You seem well aware of the affairs

182
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,490
in Qingzhou, namely the Imperial City,

183
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,120
and the affairs in the court of Yunrui.

184
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,180
Crown Prince, please speak frankly.

185
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,340
When you had just arrived
in the Imperial City,

186
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,410
some bandits tried to rob and kill you.

187
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,790
Coincidentally,
the bandits who tried to assassinate you

188
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,100
and the criminals
in the loan sharking case

189
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,430
were manipulated by the same mastermind.

190
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,050
There's one more thing.

191
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,790
In the loan sharking case
you personally solved,

192
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,720
with all the benefits that were gained,

193
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,980
a large amount of money flowed to Daqing.

194
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,550
In my previous life, the masterminds
behind the loan sharking case

195
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,890
were Madam Cui and those from
Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion.

196
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,640
I didn't expect even Daqing
would be implicated in this life.

197
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,040
All these coincidences are related to you.

198
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,970
It's inevitable to raise suspicions.

199
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,180
Are you trying to accuse me of a crime?

200
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,300
Crown Prince,

201
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,880
I was attacked by bandits

202
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,360
and fortunately escaped.

203
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,880
Thus, a conflict between Daqing and Yunrui
has been avoided.

204
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,840
Shouldn't you thank me?

205
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,100
The loan sharking case
was so rampant in Yunrui.

206
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,800
I cleared my aunt's name

207
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,000
and solved this case.

208
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,430
Shouldn't you reward me generously?

209
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,090
If you have evidence

210
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,940
for what you're suspicious of,

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,510
you can accuse me.

212
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,640
You need to build up your health.

213
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,200
Hurry.

214
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,620
Do you like the food today?

215
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,950
Mother, the food you made is so delicious.

216
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,030
Mother.

217
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,570
Are you feeling better now?

218
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,940
Much better.

219
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,590
It's Madam Cui's fault,

220
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,920
but Ruoyao is innocent.

221
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,340
However, at this point,

222
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,780
Ruoyao must hate me deeply.

223
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,880
Ruoyao.

224
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,020
I'll wait for you
at the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival.

225
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,220
[Invitation
to the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival]

226
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,930
No matter what,

227
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,079
you must come.

228
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,560
An invitation
to the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival.

229
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,170
In my previous life,
when I was assassinated that day,

230
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,220
I saved Yan,

231
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,569
which triggered the subsequent tragedy.

232
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,550
This is not okay.

233
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,079
I can't let history repeat itself.
