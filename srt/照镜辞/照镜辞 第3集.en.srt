1
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,770
[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,870
Princess Fu Wei,

3
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,060
why are you here?

4
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,910
Why did you lie?

5
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,810
Why betray your mother?

6
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,270
Why do things you'd regret?

7
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,700
In what capacity are you
speaking to me like this?

8
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,820
As the noble Princess of Daqing

9
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,190
or as my cousin whom I've never met?

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,370
I know Madam Cui has been
oppressing you all these years.

11
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,520
But however hard and dangerous it's been,

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,760
you shouldn't betray your own mother.

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,680
Don't you know

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,440
the risk of

15
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,289
bargaining with a tiger?

16
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,890
Everyone understands that.

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,480
But does knowing that

18
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,310
actually help people survive

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,910
or help them rise to power?

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,320
I can protect you.

21
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,479
But you're here
for a political marriage.

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,720
You may protect us today,

24
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,340
but once you leave the Zhou's Mansion,

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,289
how will my mother and I survive here?

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,200
My mother needs more rest.

27
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,890
Please leave, Your Highness.

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,960
Perhaps I shouldn't blame my past self
who's been lost in confusion

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,840
and unable to find a way out.

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,610
I need to figure everything out quickly

31
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,520
and find a way

32
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,390
to take Mother and Xi away.

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,360
Your Highness,

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,579
your ginseng soup is here.

35
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,240
Don't move.

36
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,670
What are you really after?

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,950
Why make me impersonate the Princess?

38
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,090
Your Highness,

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,460
what are you doing?

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,630
You are the Princess of Daqing.

41
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,500
Still won't tell the truth?

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,160
Then don't blame me for showing no mercy.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,960
I'll tell you.

44
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,640
That day when you collapsed
by the roadside,

45
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,320
Princess saved you.

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,850
When you woke up, you were confused

47
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,320
and had forgotten
everything that happened in your past.

48
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,790
Your appearance happens
to be similar to Princess's,

49
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,910
so Princess

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,210
had you take her place.

51
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,690
Your Princess want me
to die in her place?

52
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,770
Princess simply didn't want
this political marriage.

53
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,840
The encounter with bandits
at the posthouse that day

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,110
was truly an accident.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,110
Princess knew nothing about it.

56
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,630
Where is Princess now?

57
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,320
I don't know.

58
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,670
It's just that...

59
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,000
Princess told me to keep an eye on you.

60
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,370
Princess and I are not the same person.

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,680
How can I replace her?

62
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,920
The women of the Daqing royal family

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,320
all wear veils in public.

64
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,050
Except for their personal servants,

65
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,860
no one knows what they look like.

66
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,410
Besides,
Princess has the marriage documents.

67
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,010
As long as I stay with you,

68
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,010
you are the Princess.

69
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,360
Your name is Linglan, right?

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,730
From now on, you'll follow me.

71
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,520
However your princess treated you before,

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,840
that's how I'll treat you.

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,360
But if you dare tell anyone
about this impersonation,

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,829
I won't spare your life.

75
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,230
Yes.

76
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,710
Given how things stand,

77
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,070
I have to take advantage of
the identity of Princess of Daqing,

78
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,270
so that I won't repeat the same mistake.

79
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,290
Your Highness,

80
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,780
do you mean to take my life?

81
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,830
How do the guards in the royal escort team

82
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,110
compare to you

83
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,380
in martial arts?

84
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,440
I've heard

85
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,519
that Daqing's warriors
are all top-notch fighters.

86
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,579
Their martial arts

87
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,480
are certainly better than mine.

88
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,240
They were all top-notch fighters,

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,740
yet they were killed with a single strike,

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,670
without even signs of resistance.

91
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,150
This clearly shows

92
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,600
how formidable the killer is.

93
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,470
But

94
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,640
who would dare

95
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,210
to assassinate the princess
sent for marriage alliance?

96
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,740
This could seriously affect
relations between the two states.

97
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,580
Father,

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,460
I believe

99
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,270
we must not agree to
Daqing's marriage alliance.

100
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,400
Your Highness,

101
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,060
since Daqing has shown goodwill,

102
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,700
why resort to conflict?

103
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,530
Lord Liu,

104
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,140
a temporary war

105
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,880
is to secure lasting peace.

106
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,470
Don't you understand that?

107
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Regarding this marriage alliance,

108
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,660
I believe

109
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,900
the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

110
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,750
This matter needs no further discussion.

111
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,770
Your Majesty is wise.

112
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,470
This matter is indeed complicated.

113
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,910
I must find out who's behind this.

114
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,770
Your Highness,

115
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,500
we can't find any more clues
from those dead bodies.

116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,340
What should we

117
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,460
do next?

118
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,010
Since we can't find more clues

119
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,260
from the dead,

120
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,610
we must look among the living.

121
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,470
[Zhou's Mansion]

122
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,720
She seems somewhat similar

123
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,710
to the person in my dreams.

124
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,159
Yan.

125
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,180
Prince Yan.

126
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,660
Princess.

127
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,260
The old wound on your left arm
is acting up again.

128
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,600
How did she know?

129
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,770
And why does she care so much?

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,400
Have we met before?

131
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,590
No.

132
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,020
If we've never met,

133
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,270
then why

134
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,380
do you

135
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,760
know so much

136
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,430
about Yunrui's affairs?

137
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,970
You must have carefully arranged

138
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,500
for this marriage alliance

139
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,659
and have a chosen husband in mind.

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,159
Are you suggesting

141
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,300
that my carefully selected future husband

142
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,240
is you?

143
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,750
Could it be

144
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,100
she wants to marry me?

145
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,940
I not only know about
your left arm injury,

146
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,200
but I also know

147
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,470
that the Crown Prince's
childhood sweetheart

148
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,970
is the eldest daughter of the Zhou family,

149
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,620
and even what kind of women
His Majesty prefers.

150
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,750
Doesn't that make me more suspicious?

151
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,790
I came here for a marriage alliance.

152
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,460
What's so weird about
understanding the personalities

153
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,110
and preferences of the royal family?

154
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,930
Do I have to wait until the veil is lifted

155
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,200
in the bridal sedan

156
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,510
to find out who I'm marrying?

157
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,670
It seems

158
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,270
I overthought this.

159
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,060
Regarding the incident at the posthouse,

160
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,210
I have sent people
to investigate it thoroughly.

161
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,130
Except for you

162
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,590
and your maid Linglan,

163
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,350
everyone else

164
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,960
was killed by the bandits,

165
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,170
with no survivors.

166
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,000
But Princess,

167
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,020
why don't you show any grief?

168
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,050
How

169
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,340
should grief be shown?

170
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,320
They were all loyal servants

171
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,120
who accompanied me throughout the journey.

172
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,380
Now that they're dead,

173
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,920
what I can do

174
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,020
is not to wallow in self-pity,

175
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,960
but to seek justice for them.

176
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,580
Prince Yan,

177
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
isn't that right?

178
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,520
But the assassins
weren't some ordinary bandits,

179
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
but highly skilled martial artists.

180
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,580
It seems everything

181
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,390
was carefully premeditated.

182
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,540
Premeditated?

183
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,000
Could it be that Princess of Daqing's
death in the previous life

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,460
wasn't an accident at all?

185
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,720
Princess,

186
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,110
have you thought of something?

187
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,340
There was nothing

188
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,920
unusual along the way.

189
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,310
If you have the ability,

190
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,590
you can investigate yourself.

191
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,110
But...

192
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,580
Did you come today

193
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,130
to interrogate a prisoner?

194
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,170
I'm here to take you to the
Court of Imperial Sacrifices

195
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,310
for registration.

196
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,250
The carriage is ready.

197
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,580
Please, Princess.

198
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,760
Don't touch it.

199
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,170
It hurts.

200
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,470
Mother,

201
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,030
how did you get hurt so badly?

202
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
If you

203
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,800
hadn't come back,

204
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,480
I'd have been beaten to death.

205
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,610
Every day

206
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,840
you think about
being with the Crown Prince.

207
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,160
How could you care about my safety?

208
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,360
I went to the mountains to gather herbs.

209
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,490
His Highness was worried about my safety,

210
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,130
so he accompanied me.

211
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,520
His Highness truly cares for you.

212
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,400
You must not disappoint
his sincere feelings.

213
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
In my opinion,

214
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,460
you should

215
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,970
get married soon,

216
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,360
and put my mind at ease.

217
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,180
His Highness truly cares for me.

218
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,210
Does that mean I must marry him?

219
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,540
When His Highness becomes Emperor one day,

220
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,070
he will surely have
thousands of concubines.

221
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,080
I don't want to fight over a man
with a crowd of women.

222
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,870
Foolish!

223
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,880
Mother,

224
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,170
please rest well.

225
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,600
You're really confused!

226
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,380
So many women are eagerly pursuing

227
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,290
that position of Empress above thousands.

228
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,330
Only you

229
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,640
fail to see its value.

230
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,600
We already had those two,
mother and daughter, at home

231
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,660
who were eyesores.

232
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,300
Now suddenly a Daqing Princess shows up,

233
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,040
and your father takes her side.

234
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,960
He listened to her,

235
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,910
and even punished me.

236
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,450
Yao,

237
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,910
you must put more effort into this.

238
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,630
If you don't try harder,

239
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,060
His Highness will be taken
by someone else.

240
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,050
Someone who can be taken away

241
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,860
isn't truly devoted.

242
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,900
I don't care about that.

243
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,880
By the way, Mother.

244
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,790
Princess of Daqing has a noble status

245
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,290
and is also Madam Wang's distant relative.

246
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
If you keep opposing her,

247
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,310
aren't you just asking for trouble?

248
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
In my opinion,

249
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,900
you shouldn't take
everything so seriously.

250
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,090
Madam.

251
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,360
[Cicada Notebook]

252
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,850
Ruoxi, you're here.

253
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,570
Big Mother,

254
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,940
you wanted to see me?

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,530
Well, Ruoxi,

256
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,170
I have

257
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,720
truly underestimated you.

258
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,950
To save your mother,

259
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,040
you were even willing
to abandon your maternal family.

260
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,880
Did you summon me

261
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,210
just to talk about this?

262
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,040
Of course not.

263
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
I'm here to give you

264
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,440
and your mother

265
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,030
a way to survive.

266
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,390
I want that Princess of Daqing

267
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,570
gone from this world.

268
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,780
You want to hire someone to kill her?

269
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,320
What price are you offering?

270
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,850
Have you picked the wrong person?

271
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
What if

272
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,890
it's your mother's life at stake?

273
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,480
I wonder if you think

274
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,730
that's enough.

275
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,650
This poison mixed in tea

276
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,210
has a fragrant aroma

277
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,660
and a lingering taste.

278
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,590
The symptoms of poisoning

279
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,070
resemble tuberculosis.

280
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,920
At best,

281
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,320
she'll be bedridden.

282
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,930
At worst,

283
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,420
she won't survive.

284
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,770
You are cousins.

285
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,640
You'll have plenty of opportunities.

286
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,420
Of course,

287
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,550
if you're unwilling,

288
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,650
I certainly won't force you.

289
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,520
It's just

290
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,300
a pity.

291
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,060
Your mother

292
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,850
is already frail,

293
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,920
and now she's been beaten.

294
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,740
Who knows

295
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,060
how many days she has left?

296
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,080
Mother,

297
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,570
I'm well aware of

298
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,680
Madam Cui's wicked intentions.

299
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,440
She simply wants to use me

300
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,100
to poison Princess Fu Wei

301
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,560
to eliminate her threat

302
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,610
and then place all

303
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,970
the blame on me.

304
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,710
Killing two birds with one stone.

305
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,570
Mother.

306
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,060
If anything happens to me,

307
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,170
please don't worry,

308
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,520
and don't blame me.

309
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,100
The current Princess Fu Wei is fake?

310
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,080
Yes.

311
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,340
Master, do you want me to kill her?

312
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,140
No.

313
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,570
Hold your position

314
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,170
and wait for my instructions.

315
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:55,970
Master,

316
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:56,880
I...

317
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,720
It's time now.

318
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,770
Take it.

319
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,020
Thank you, Master.

320
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,280
Xi,

321
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,350
come with me.

322
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,290
What are you doing?

323
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,310
I should be asking you.

324
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,360
What are you going to do?

325
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,020
I'm bringing ginseng tea to Big Mother

326
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,870
to apologize for offending her earlier.

327
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,610
Your Highness, why are you so nervous?

328
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,320
Are you really apologizing to her

329
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,780
or setting a trap yourself

330
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,010
to frame her?

331
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,490
I don't understand what you mean.

332
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,720
You suspect I'm poisoning Big Mother?

333
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,020
You're planning to poison yourself.

334
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,240
You know
with Madam Cui's suspicion of you,

335
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,310
you can't easily poison her.

336
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,370
So you can only poison yourself

337
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,160
and then frame her for it.

338
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,840
Big Mother...

339
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,280
How cruel of you.

340
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,280
You've poisoned me.

341
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,370
You wretched girl!

342
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,180
How dare you frame Madam!

343
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,810
About this poisoning incident,

344
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,340
let's just forget about it.

345
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,920
Take care of yourself.

346
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,400
Father—

347
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,370
I said,

348
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,060
forget it.

349
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,020
Even if you're willing to risk your life

350
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,340
to drag her down with you,

351
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,030
you should understand that

352
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,860
in this Zhou's Mansion,

353
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,870
no one will protect you

354
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,940
or help you.

355
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,450
Your life

356
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,890
means absolutely nothing.

357
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,960
Even if I know this is
like a moth to a flame,

358
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,850
it's the only plan I could think of.

359
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,780
Your Highness, do you know

360
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,660
this poison

361
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,660
was originally meant for your tea,
on Madam Cui's order?

362
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,790
She wanted to kill you by my hand.

363
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,450
Do you have any

364
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,720
other option besides desperate measures?

365
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,080
Neither of us will die.

366
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,600
Your Highness, what brings you here today?

367
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,120
Mrs. Zhou,

368
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,910
today Xi brought me some new tea.

369
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,290
Since I've been disturbing you
here for so long,

370
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,560
I thought

371
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,270
I'd bring it to you as a small gift.

372
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,579
This tea was brought by Ruoxi?

373
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,740
Yes.

374
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,240
Mrs. Zhou,

375
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,160
please try it.

376
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,670
Alright.

377
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,099
Xi said

378
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,210
this tea

379
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,720
has a wonderful aroma

380
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,310
and a lingering aftertaste.

381
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,040
Please have a taste, Mrs. Zhou.

382
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,600
Recently,

383
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,140
I've been feeling unsettled

384
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,020
and can't sleep

385
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,170
at night.

386
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,520
The doctor said

387
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,650
I shouldn't drink strong tea.

388
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,880
Can't sleep at night?

389
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,560
Could it be

390
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,930
you've done something unconscionable
to harm someone's life?

391
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,790
I was just joking.

392
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,950
There's no need to be so nervous.

393
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,610
It's just that

394
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,520
this tea

395
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,340
is what I

396
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,460
have bestowed upon you.

397
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,120
So you

398
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,340
must drink it.
