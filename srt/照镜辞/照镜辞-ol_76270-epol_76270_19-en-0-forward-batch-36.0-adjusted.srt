But then, Shu

32

came and took the person
away without any explanation.

I wonder what his intentions were.

The person you took that day

176
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,280
Yan.

177
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,910
Then you'd better investigate quickly.

178
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,030
I'm alone at the mansion

179
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,630
and feeling rather lonely.

180
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,690
I might do something

181
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,910
harmful to your wife.

182
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,610
Thank you for the warning, Brother.

183
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,130
The next time we meet,

184
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,450
it will probably be

185
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,650
at the heir appointment banquet.

186
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,440
Li Yan!

187
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,890
Let me tell you!

188
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Father will not depose me.

189
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,090
Brother,

190
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,840
I take my leave.

191
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,510
Greetings, Your Highness.

192
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,420
Everyone, leave us.

193
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,410
Yes.

194
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,800
Father.

195
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,340
His Majesty wants to
depose the Crown Prince

196
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,020
and make Prince Yan the heir instead.

197
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,970
Is this true?

198
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,000
Who told you this?

199
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,900
Crown Prince Shu
is now under house arrest.

200
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Today, Prince Yan

201
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,720
even came to the mansion
to flaunt his power.

202
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,330
She longs to rule
as the empress, revered by the world.

203
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,270
This Li Yan

204
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,770
wants to seize the throne.

205
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,950
I certainly won't give in without a fight.

206
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,640
Father.

207
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,040
Now

208
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,660
we're in the same boat.

209
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,520
If the Crown Prince falls

210
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,460
and Prince Yan takes his place,

211
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,590
then our Zhou family

212
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,500
will have no place to stand.

213
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't worry, Xi.

214
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
As long as you do as I say,

215
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,720
all will be well.

216
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,220
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

217
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,500
The tide is turning.

218
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,550
We must ensure nothing goes wrong.

219
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,520
Crown Prince Shu.

220
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,030
I've prepared some sobering soup for you.

221
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,830
Please

222
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,380
drink it soon.

223
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,320
Get out.

224
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,300
I'm only thinking of your best interests.

225
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,250
Please drink this.

226
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,210
I am not drunk.

227
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,070
Why would I need sobering soup?

228
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,840
But I think

229
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,460
you are drunk.

230
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,600
Get out!

231
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,170
Crown Prince Shu,

232
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,670
you're under house arrest
in this mansion now.

233
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,640
Where else could you go?
