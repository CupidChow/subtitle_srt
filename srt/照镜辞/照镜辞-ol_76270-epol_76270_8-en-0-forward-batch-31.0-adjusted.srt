This peach kernel tea
is astringent and bitter.

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,970
Only when you get used to it
will you feel its aftertaste is sweet.

It's what you like, Princess.

5
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,220
It's astringent.

6
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,650
I used to think
this tea was astringent and bitter too,

7
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,200
but after drinking it for a long time,

8

I finally felt its aftertaste was sweet.

Since you've long known that I'm not Xi,

playing along with me here?

You set up this stage.

I simply didn't want to spoil the fun.

why did you go out so late at night?

And why are you wearing my clothes?

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,530
No wonder Linglan didn't let me go out.

31

It turns out that you went out
to meet with Prince Yan.

32
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,710
There are so many aristocrats
in the Imperial City.

33
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,210
Why must you choose the one I've selected?

34
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,030
You could choose anyone else,

35

but not Li Yan.

Why couldn't I choose Li Yan?

37
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,010
Do you have feelings for him?

38

Anyway, you must stay away from him.

39
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,750
What right do you have
to interfere in my affairs?

40
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,000
Because I know

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,930
you just want to use him
to climb up the social ladder.

42
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,520
Is it wrong to rely on powerful men?

Is it wrong to crave supremacy

45

You have a high status,
so no one can bully you.

46
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,650
Why should I let myself
be trampled on arbitrarily?

Why is Xi
still sticking to her wrong ideas?

51
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,970
How can I make her understand this?

Being unable to guess it

makes it more interesting.

Nor can I afford to do that.

171
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,650
I have more important things to do.

172
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,090
Romantic love is not what I seek for.

173
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,880
I also hope that

174
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,830
you won't fall into it.

175
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,090
What if I say

176
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
I'll wait for you?

177
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,690
Take the umbrella.

178
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,170
Why are you waiting here, Crown Prince?

179
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,760
There's something

180
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,990
I'd like to ask you about.

181
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,790
You seem well aware of the affairs

182
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,490
in Qingzhou, namely the Imperial City,

183
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,120
and the affairs in the court of Yunrui.

184
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,180
Crown Prince, please speak frankly.

185
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,340
When you had just arrived
in the Imperial City,

186
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,410
some bandits tried to rob and kill you.

187
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,790
Coincidentally,
the bandits who tried to assassinate you

188
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,100
and the criminals
in the loan sharking case

189
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,430
were manipulated by the same mastermind.

190
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,050
There's one more thing.

191
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,790
In the loan sharking case
you personally solved,

192
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,720
with all the benefits that were gained,

193
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,980
a large amount of money flowed to Daqing.

194
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,550
In my previous life, the masterminds
behind the loan sharking case

195
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,890
were Madam Cui and those from
Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion.

196
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,640
I didn't expect even Daqing
would be implicated in this life.

197
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,040
All these coincidences are related to you.

198
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,970
It's inevitable to raise suspicions.

199
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,180
Are you trying to accuse me of a crime?

200
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,300
Crown Prince,

201
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,880
I was attacked by bandits

202
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,360
and fortunately escaped.

203
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,880
Thus, a conflict between Daqing and Yunrui
has been avoided.

204
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,840
Shouldn't you thank me?

205
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,100
The loan sharking case
was so rampant in Yunrui.

206
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,800
I cleared my aunt's name

207
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,000
and solved this case.

208
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,430
Shouldn't you reward me generously?

209
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,090
If you have evidence

210
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,940
for what you're suspicious of,

211
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,510
you can accuse me.

212
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,640
You need to build up your health.

213
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,200
Hurry.

214
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,620
Do you like the food today?

215
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,950
Mother, the food you made is so delicious.

216
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,030
Mother.

217
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,570
Are you feeling better now?

218
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,940
Much better.

219
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,590
It's Madam Cui's fault,

220
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,920
but Ruoyao is innocent.

221
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,340
However, at this point,

222
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,780
Ruoyao must hate me deeply.

223
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:35,880
Ruoyao.

224
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,020
I'll wait for you
at the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival.

225
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:41,220
[Invitation
to the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival]

226
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,930
No matter what,

227
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,079
you must come.

228
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,560
An invitation
to the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival.

229
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:46,170
In my previous life,
when I was assassinated that day,

230
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,220
I saved Yan,

231
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,569
which triggered the subsequent tragedy.

232
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:50,550
This is not okay.

233
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,079
I can't let history repeat itself.
