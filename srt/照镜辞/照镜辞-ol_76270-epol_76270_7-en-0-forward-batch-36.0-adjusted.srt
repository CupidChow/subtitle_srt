00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,680
are identical.

175
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,390
There might be

176
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,150
more to this than meets the eye.

177
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,110
It might be connected to Daqing.

178
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,310
And the men you sent out earlier...

179
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,110
Yan,

180
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,240
I have something to ask you.

181
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,900
Why have you been

182
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,970
so close to the Daqing's princess?

183
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,580
Princess asked for my help before.

184
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,380
After the incident at the posthouse,

185
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,280
I was concerned for her safety.

186
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,730
That's why

187
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,830
we went together.

188
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,720
Is that really so?

189
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,530
Yes.

190
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,720
Don't you have feelings for her?

191
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,330
Let me warn you,

192
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,370
this princess
isn't as simple as she seems.

193
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,900
She's not just here
for a political marriage.

194
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,370
I'm well aware of that.

195
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,530
This is outrageous.

196
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,410
The Marquis of Zhenguo
has committed such a serious crime.

197
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,490
Crown Prince,

198
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,180
how do you think this matter
should be handled?

199
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,880
Father,

200
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,290
I believe

201
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,770
Madam Cui had already admitted everything.

202
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,820
As for the Marquis of Zhenguo,

203
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,490
perhaps his past merits
could be considered

204
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,090
and his punishment reduced.

205
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,490
How could a mere woman
from the inner chambers

206
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,490
have such power and influence?

207
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,800
Madam Cui relied on the Marquis's power.

208
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,660
Even before marriage,

209
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,220
she was known to be selfish and unruly.

210
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,560
It's not surprising

211
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,500
that she had committed such crimes.

212
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,810
Seize the Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion

213
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,460
at once.

214
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,970
All confiscated assets

215
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,060
will be allocated for military use.

216
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,200
Crown Prince,

217
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,760
you will

218
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,010
handle this matter.

219
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,440
Yes,

220
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,510
Father.

221
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,160
Father,

222
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,640
I believe...

223
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,440
I'm tired.

224
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Let's

225
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,310
call it a day.

226
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,870
You may leave.

227
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,480
Yes, Father.

228
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,870
[Zhou's Mansion]

229
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,750
Mother.

230
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,380
[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

231
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,590
Mother.

232
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,510
Mother, how could you leave me?

233
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,820
Mother.

234
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,370
Mother!

235
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,320
Mother, don't leave me.

236
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,240
Mother.

237
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,090
Mother!

238
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,390
My Lady.

239
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,410
[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

240
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,560
Ruoyao.

241
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
You may leave.

242
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:09,970
Ruoyao,

243
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,670
my condolences.

244
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,050
Get up first.

245
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,730
Ruoyao,

246
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,290
if something troubles you,

247
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,430
just tell me.

248
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,550
Mother was a convicted criminal.

249
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,970
At a time like this,

250
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,900
Your Highness shouldn't come here.

251
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,340
Ruoyao, you know me.

252
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,560
I've never cared for gossip.

253
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,260
Don't worry.

254
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,060
When this storm passes,

255
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,850
I will ask Father

256
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,930
to grant us a marriage.

257
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,020
Once you marry into the Eastern Palace,

258
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,420
everything will be fine.

259
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,470
Your Highness,

260
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,860
my mother just passed.

261
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,910
I want to leave

262
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,330
and travel for a while.

263
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,600
You're leaving?

264
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,640
Where to?

265
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,760
To visit mountains

266
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,580
and taste various herbs.

267
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,470
Your Highness,

268
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,350
I...

269
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,560
I...

270
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,480
I understand.

271
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,340
You never care about power and status,

272
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,020
nor do you want to be confined
within the palace walls.

273
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,980
Ruoyao,

274
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,550
I'll wait for you.

275
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,480
There, there.

276
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,380
Don't cry.

277
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,940
I once misunderstood,

278
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,610
but now I see—

279
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,850
Ruoyao and the Crown Prince's relationship

280
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,190
is far purer than I once thought.

281
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
Prince Yan?

282
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,400
Princess.

283
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,540
Why are you here?

284
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,760
Am I not allowed to come?

285
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,120
You must be joking.

286
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,280
Actually,

287
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,430
I have one question.

288
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,970
Who taught you

289
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,250
your crossbow skills?

290
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,410
An old friend.

291
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,490
Old friend?

292
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,980
This is for you.

293
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,110
While I'm away,

294
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,190
you can use this to protect yourself.

295
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,370
Remember,

296
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,230
hold it steady

297
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,040
and aim at one spot.

298
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,920
I hit it!

299
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,220
Careful,

300
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,100
don't get wet.

301
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,110
Let me try again.

302
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,640
It seems this old friend

303
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,480
means a lot to you.

304
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,640
Yes,

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
very much.

306
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,680
Good.

307
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,610
By the way.

308
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,450
after Madam Cui's case,

309
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,710
Zhou's Mansion may no longer
be a suitable place for you.

310
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,510
Princess,

311
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,970
why not change your residence?

312
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,570
You'll be more comfortable.

313
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,250
I won't leave.

314
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,390
I have more important things to do.

315
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,280
What things?

316
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,620
I'd be glad to help.

317
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:16,930
Prince Yan,

318
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,070
I'm about to be arranged in marriage.

319
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,140
We should

320
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,650
keep our distance.

321
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,420
The day of the marriage alliance
is approaching.

322
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,960
I need to make plans early.

323
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,710
Wait.

324
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,580
Your Highness.

325
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,490
What's that in your hand?

326
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,210
Your Highness,

327
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,870
Lady Ruoxi sent me to deliver this letter
to the Prince's mansion.

328
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,200
[Letter to the Prince]

329
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,780
Xi wants to meet Prince Yan?

330
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,490
Your Highness.

331
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,140
Miss Ruoxi.

332
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,040
Why did you ask me

333
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,950
here today?

334
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,520
Your Highness,

335
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,450
will you help me?

336
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,110
Could it be

337
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,680
[Letter to the Prince]

338
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,570
she's going to follow
the same path I once took?

339
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,570
Without entering reincarnation,

340
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,780
one must be reborn.

341
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,390
This dreamlike life will soon awaken,

342
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,240
and all things

343
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,350
must come to an end.

344
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,540
Same appearance,

345
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,010
but different fate.

346
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,070
Who exactly decides our fate?

347
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,830
I refuse to believe it.

348
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,610
Back in Yuzhou,

349
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,460
I could clearly feel
that she cared about me.

350
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,250
But why is she so distant now?

351
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,990
It's truly puzzling.

352
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,720
Your Highness,

353
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,790
the carriage is ready.

354
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,050
Didn't Miss Zhou Ruoxi invite you
to meet by the Moon River?

355
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,810
Yes.

356
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,380
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

357
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,800
Miss Ruoxi,

358
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:00,720
didn't you invite me

359
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,119
to meet by the Moon River?

360
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,780
Why did you suddenly

361
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,220
come to my residence
for a game of chess instead?

362
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,750
Boating on the lake is dull.

363
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,380
It's much more enjoyable

364
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,480
to stay here playing chess
and drinking tea

365
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,640
with Your Highness.

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,720
Having known you for so long,

367
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
I had no idea

368
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,570
you had such refined interests.

369
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,030
I just learned recently.

370
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,390
Perfect opportunity to

371
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,050
practice with Your Highness.

372
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,000
Your playing style

373
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,260
doesn't seem like

374
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,940
that of a beginner.

375
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,770
It rather has

376
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,660
the confidence of a chess master.

377
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,430
Are you giving up already, Your Highness?

378
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,300
Your Highness,

379
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,790
watch out for the encirclement below.

380
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,010
Miss Ruoxi, you understand me,

381
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,000
and likewise,

382
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,990
I understand you too.

383
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,180
Your Highness,
your reputation is well-deserved.

384
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,310
It's my honor to have

385
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,790
a worthy opponent like you.

386
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,450
Liang Feng,

387
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,650
serve the tea.

388
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,520
Please.

389
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,290
This peach kernel tea
is bitter and astringent.

390
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,570
Only after getting used to it
can one tastes its sweetness.

391
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,870
It's what Princess likes.
