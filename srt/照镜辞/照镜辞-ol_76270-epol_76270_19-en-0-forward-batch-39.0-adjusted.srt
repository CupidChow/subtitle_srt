But then, Shu

32

came and took the person
away without any explanation.

I wonder what his intentions were.

The person you took that day

176
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,280
Yan.

177
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,910
Then you'd better investigate quickly.

178
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,030
I'm alone at the mansion

179
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,630
and feeling rather lonely.

180
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,690
I might do something

181
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,910
harmful to your wife.

182
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,610
Thank you for the warning, Brother.

183
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,130
The next time we meet,

184
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,450
it will probably be

185
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,650
at the heir appointment banquet.

186
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,440
Li Yan!

187
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,890
Let me tell you!

188
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Father will not depose me.

189
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,090
Brother,

190
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,840
I take my leave.

191
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,510
Greetings, Your Highness.

192
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,420
Everyone, leave us.

193
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,410
Yes.

194
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,800
Father.

195
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,340
His Majesty wants to
depose the Crown Prince

196
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,020
and make Prince Yan the heir instead.

197
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,970
Is this true?

198
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,000
Who told you this?

199
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,900
Crown Prince Shu
is now under house arrest.

200
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Today, Prince Yan

201
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,720
even came to the mansion
to flaunt his power.

202
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,330
She longs to rule
as the empress, revered by the world.

203
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,270
This Li Yan

204
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,770
wants to seize the throne.

205
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,950
I certainly won't give in without a fight.

206
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,640
Father.

207
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,040
Now

208
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,660
we're in the same boat.

209
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,520
If the Crown Prince falls

210
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,460
and Prince Yan takes his place,

211
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,590
then our Zhou family

212
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,500
will have no place to stand.

213
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't worry, Xi.

214
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
As long as you do as I say,

215
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,720
all will be well.

216
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,220
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

217
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,500
The tide is turning.

218
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,550
We must ensure nothing goes wrong.

219
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,520
Crown Prince Shu.

220
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,030
I've prepared some sobering soup for you.

221
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,830
Please

222
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,380
drink it soon.

223
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,320
Get out.

224
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm only thinking of your best interests.

225
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,250
Please drink this.

226
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,210
I am not drunk.

227
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,070
Why would I need sobering soup?

228
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,840
But I think

229
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,460
you are drunk.

230
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,600
Get out!

231
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,170
Crown Prince Shu,

232
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,670
you're under house arrest
in this mansion now.

233
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,640
Where else could you go?
