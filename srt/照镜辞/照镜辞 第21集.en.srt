Xi,

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,460
don't you think

7
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,510
you should explain yourself to me?

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,430
Xi?

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,500
Father, what do you

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,460
mean by that?

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,210
What do I mean?

12
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,360
The Crown Prince's poisoning was fake.

13
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,030
The Red-armored Army's token
was also fake.

14
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,210
Could it be

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,960
you're working with them?

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,380
I failed to discover
the Crown Prince's scheme.

17
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,700
That was my fault.

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,640
But if I had ill intentions toward you,

19
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,210
I wouldn't have taken Ruoyao hostage

20

27

that I've lost the Red-armored Army

suddenly appeared

51

52

I thought Zhou Ruoxi replaced the poison

53
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,490
because she shared our goals.

54

Yan,

85
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,680
have you considered

86
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,320
that Zhou Kui might not leave at all,

87
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,100
but instead burn his bridges

88
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,360
and fight to win or die?

89
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,850
Do you know anything else?

90
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,750
Do you know

91
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,550
how His Majesty died

92
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,140
in the previous life?

93
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,840
In the 11th year of Xinshou reign,

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
His Majesty fell gravely ill

95
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,930
and when he was on his deathbed,

96
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,190
he passed the throne to the Crown Prince.

97
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,650
But His Majesty had always
been in good health.

98
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,650
How could he suddenly become so ill?

99
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,180
Are you saying

100
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,890
Father was also killed by Zhou Kui?

101
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,780
Although there's no concrete evidence,

102
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,750
thinking about it carefully now,

103
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,700
it could indeed
have been Zhou Kui's doing.

104
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,720
At that time,

105
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,120
I had already married Li Shu

106
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,850
and became the Crown Princess.

107
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,650
After His Majesty passed away,

108
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,780
he left the throne to the Crown Prince.

109
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,230
And I became the mistress
of the imperial harem.

110
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,360
Zhou Kui used my position as Empress

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,890
to throw his weight around.

112
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,140
Plus, I saw Linglan

113
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,960
secretly meeting with
someone from the palace.

114
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,230
Zhou Kui must have planted spies
around His Majesty,

115
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,360
otherwise he couldn't have done this.

116
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,530
Then I'll go to the palace

117
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,210
and warn Father to be more vigilant.

118
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:30,970
Also,

119
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,010
increase patrols inside the Imperial City.

120
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,340
Post guards at the city gates.

121
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,670
I feel Zhou Kui still
has some backup plan.

122
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,390
I'll be going then.

00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,230
Your Highness,

177
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,060
Your Grace,

178
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,600
I was patrolling the city as ordered

179
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,160
and discovered something suspicious.

180
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,960
What is it?

181
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,600
Near the Imperial City,

182
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,410
there seems to be the smell of gunpowder.

183
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,910
I just sent someone to investigate

184
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,170
and found traces of sulfur and charcoal.

185
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,660
It's not the Fireworks Festival.

186
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,720
Why would there be gunpowder and charcoal?

187
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,250
Gunpowder and charcoal...

188
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,760
Lieutenant Liang,

189
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,950
are you certain?

190
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,650
I smelled it clearly.

191
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,650
My hometown is known
for gunpowder production.

192
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,270
Since childhood,

193
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,000
I grew up surrounded
by black powder and fire caltrops.

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,730
Most people wouldn't notice this smell,

195
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,530
but I recognize it immediately.

196
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,490
Lieutenant Liang,

197
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,030
I need you to do something for me.

198
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,580
This dragon throne

199
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,240
is truly magnificent.

200
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,200
It's comfortable to sit on too.

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,120
No wonder so many people

202
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,320
fight desperately

203
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
to sit on this throne.

204
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,560
You've sat here long enough.

205
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,600
Make way

206
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,620
and let someone else have a turn.

207
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,220
Zhou Kui,

208
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,400
how dare you!

209
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,510
A mere Minister of Rites

210
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,750
with ambitions to usurp the throne.

211
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,370
Usurp?

212
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,080
The empire

213
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,540
belongs to the virtuous.

214
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,140
In both civil and military affairs,

215
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,700
I can say without doubt

216
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,100
that I'm second to none.

217
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,970
Why shouldn't this empire

218
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,390
be mine to rule?

219
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,210
Not to mention that since 30 years ago,

220
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,020
Yunrui should have been destroyed.

221
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,000
This should have been mine all along!

222
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,910
If you hadn't supported the Daqing rebels,

223
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,460
how would I have ended up like this?

224
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
You are...

225
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,820
the Crown Prince
of the former Daqing dynasty?

226
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,720
30 years.

227
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,420
It has been 30 years.

228
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,230
No one has addressed me that way.

229
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,960
But the good thing is

230
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,140
now I've returned to this court

231
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,040
and sit on this dragon throne!

232
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,560
Get off my throne now!

233
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,550
You'd better understand the situation.

234
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,640
Now

235
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,110
it's not up to you.

236
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,400
Zhou Kui,

237
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,460
Yunrui has never mistreated you.

238
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,150
I have treated you well.

239
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,120
Why would you do this?

240
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,440
Shut up!

241
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,470
For you,

242
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,940
titles and rewards

243
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,810
are the greatest gifts!

244
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,950
But for me...

245
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,280
For me,

246
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,480
I can't forget all these years

247
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,740
of humiliation,
begging at your feet like a dog.

248
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,090
I will avenge this shame

249
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,510
and reclaim the throne!

250
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,840
I want Yunrui's empire

251
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,540
to exact my revenge.

252
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:11,970
I

253
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,260
will not let you have your way.

254
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,660
Now,

255
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,160
you

256
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,980
and your son

257
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,570
are both in my hands.

258
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,680
You have no choice but to comply.

259
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,880
My Li family

260
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,760
only has martyrs who protect the state,

261
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,880
not hostages who fear death.

262
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,040
Well said!

263
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,840
Good!

264
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,870
Such eloquent words

265
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,240
and noble integrity.

266
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,390
But have you considered?

267
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,450
What if

268
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,340
I take the citizens of the Imperial City

269
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,860
as hostages?

270
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,490
What would you do then?

271
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,120
What did you say?

272
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,360
Are you saying

273
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,910
Zhou Kui planted explosives
in the Imperial City?

274
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,350
Yes.

275
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,390
Your Highness,

276
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,960
we should hurry to the palace.

277
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,740
I'm really worried about Prince Yan.

278
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,300
Alright.

279
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,160
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

280
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,450
By order of His Majesty,

281
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,300
the Crown Prince and his party

282
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,390
are to enter the palace immediately.

283
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,800
Your Majesty,

284
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,670
the life and death of

285
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,350
tens of thousands of citizens

286
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,250
in the Imperial City Qingzhou

287
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,360
depends solely

288
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,980
on Your Majesty's decision.

289
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,130
Zhou Kui,

290
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,740
what exactly are you trying to do?

291
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,790
He planted explosives
around the Imperial City!

292
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,350
Fu Wei.
