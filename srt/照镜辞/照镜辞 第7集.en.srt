00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,680
are identical.

175
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,390
There might be

176
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,150
more to this than meets the eye.

177
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,110
It might be connected to Daqing.

178
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,310
And the men you sent out earlier...

179
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,110
Yan,

180
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,240
I have something to ask you.

181
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,900
Why have you been

182
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,970
so close to the Daqing's princess?

183
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,580
Princess asked for my help before.

184
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,380
After the incident at the posthouse,

185
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,280
I was concerned for her safety.

186
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,730
That's why

187
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,830
we went together.

188
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,720
Is that really so?

189
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,530
Yes.

190
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,720
Don't you have feelings for her?

191
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,330
Let me warn you,

192
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,370
this princess
isn't as simple as she seems.

193
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,900
She's not just here
for a political marriage.

194
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,370
I'm well aware of that.

195
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,530
This is outrageous.

196
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,410
The Marquis of Zhenguo
has committed such a serious crime.

197
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,490
Crown Prince,

198
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,180
how do you think this matter
should be handled?

199
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,880
Father,

200
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,290
I believe

201
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,770
Madam Cui had already admitted everything.

202
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,820
As for the Marquis of Zhenguo,

203
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,490
perhaps his past merits
could be considered

204
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,090
and his punishment reduced.

205
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,490
How could a mere woman
from the inner chambers

206
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,490
have such power and influence?

207
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,800
Madam Cui relied on the Marquis's power.

208
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,660
Even before marriage,

209
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,220
she was known to be selfish and unruly.

210
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,560
It's not surprising

211
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,500
that she had committed such crimes.

212
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,810
Seize the Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion

213
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,460
at once.

214
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,970
All confiscated assets

215
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
will be allocated for military use.

216
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,200
Crown Prince,

217
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,760
you will

218
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,010
handle this matter.

219
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
Yes,

220
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,510
Father.

221
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,160
Father,

222
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,640
I believe...

223
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,440
I'm tired.

224
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Let's

225
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,310
call it a day.

226
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,870
You may leave.

227
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,480
Yes, Father.

228
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,870
[Zhou's Mansion]

229
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,750
Mother.

230
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,380
[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

231
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,590
Mother.

232
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,510
Mother, how could you leave me?

233
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,820
Mother.

234
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,370
Mother!

235
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
Mother, don't leave me.

236
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,240
Mother.

237
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,090
Mother!

238
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,390
My Lady.

239
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,410
[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

240
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,560
Ruoyao.

241
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,320
You may leave.

242
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,970
Ruoyao,

243
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,670
my condolences.

244
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,050
Get up first.

245
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,730
Ruoyao,

246
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,290
if something troubles you,

247
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,430
just tell me.

248
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,550
Mother was a convicted criminal.

249
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,970
At a time like this,

250
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,900
Your Highness shouldn't come here.

251
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,340
Ruoyao, you know me.

252
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
I've never cared for gossip.

253
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,260
Don't worry.

254
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,060
When this storm passes,

255
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,850
I will ask Father

256
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,930
to grant us a marriage.

257
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,020
Once you marry into the Eastern Palace,

258
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,420
everything will be fine.

259
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,470
Your Highness,

260
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,860
my mother just passed.

261
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,910
I want to leave

262
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,330
and travel for a while.

263
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,600
You're leaving?

264
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,640
Where to?

265
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,760
To visit mountains

266
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,580
and taste various herbs.

267
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,470
Your Highness,

268
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,350
I...

269
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,560
I...

270
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,480
I understand.

271
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,340
You never care about power and status,

272
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,020
nor do you want to be confined
within the palace walls.

273
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,980
Ruoyao,

274
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,550
I'll wait for you.

275
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,480
There, there.

276
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,380
Don't cry.

277
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,940
I once misunderstood,

278
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,610
but now I see—

279
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,850
Ruoyao and the Crown Prince's relationship

280
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,190
is far purer than I once thought.

281
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,320
Prince Yan?

282
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,400
Princess.

283
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,540
Why are you here?

284
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,760
Am I not allowed to come?

285
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,120
You must be joking.

286
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,280
Actually,

287
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,430
I have one question.

288
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,970
Who taught you

289
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,250
your crossbow skills?

290
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,410
An old friend.

291
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,490
Old friend?

292
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,980
This is for you.

293
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,110
While I'm away,

294
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,190
you can use this to protect yourself.

295
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,370
Remember,

296
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,230
hold it steady

297
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,040
and aim at one spot.

298
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,920
I hit it!

299
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,220
Careful,

300
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,100
don't get wet.

301
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,110
Let me try again.

302
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,640
It seems this old friend

303
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,480
means a lot to you.

304
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,640
Yes,

305
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
very much.

306
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,680
Good.

307
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,610
By the way.

308
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,450
after Madam Cui's case,

309
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,710
Zhou's Mansion may no longer
be a suitable place for you.

310
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,510
Princess,

311
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,970
why not change your residence?

312
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,570
You'll be more comfortable.

313
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,250
I won't leave.

314
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,390
I have more important things to do.

315
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,280
What things?

316
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,620
I'd be glad to help.

317
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,930
Prince Yan,

318
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,070
I'm about to be arranged in marriage.

319
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,140
We should

320
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,650
keep our distance.

321
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,420
The day of the marriage alliance
is approaching.

322
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,960
I need to make plans early.

323
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,710
Wait.

324
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,580
Your Highness.

325
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,490
What's that in your hand?

326
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,210
Your Highness,

327
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,870
Lady Ruoxi sent me to deliver this letter
to the Prince's mansion.

328
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,200
[Letter to the Prince]

329
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,780
Xi wants to meet Prince Yan?

330
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,490
Your Highness.

331
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,140
Miss Ruoxi.

332
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,040
Why did you ask me

333
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,950
here today?

334
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,520
Your Highness,

335
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,450
will you help me?

336
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,110
Could it be

337
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,680
[Letter to the Prince]

338
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,570
she's going to follow
the same path I once took?

339
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,570
Without entering reincarnation,

340
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,780
one must be reborn.

341
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,390
This dreamlike life will soon awaken,

342
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,240
and all things

343
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,350
must come to an end.

344
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,540
Same appearance,

345
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,010
but different fate.

346
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,070
Who exactly decides our fate?

347
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,830
I refuse to believe it.

348
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,610
Back in Yuzhou,

349
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,460
I could clearly feel
that she cared about me.

350
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,250
But why is she so distant now?

351
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,990
It's truly puzzling.

352
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,720
Your Highness,

353
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,790
the carriage is ready.

354
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,050
Didn't Miss Zhou Ruoxi invite you
to meet by the Moon River?

355
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,810
Yes.

356
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,380
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

357
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,800
Miss Ruoxi,

358
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,720
didn't you invite me

359
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,119
to meet by the Moon River?

360
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,780
Why did you suddenly

361
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,220
come to my residence
for a game of chess instead?

362
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,750
Boating on the lake is dull.

363
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,380
It's much more enjoyable

364
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,480
to stay here playing chess
and drinking tea

365
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,640
with Your Highness.

366
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,720
Having known you for so long,

367
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,740
I had no idea

368
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,570
you had such refined interests.

369
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,030
I just learned recently.

370
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,390
Perfect opportunity to

371
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,050
practice with Your Highness.

372
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,000
Your playing style

373
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,260
doesn't seem like

374
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,940
that of a beginner.

375
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,770
It rather has

376
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,660
the confidence of a chess master.

377
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,430
Are you giving up already, Your Highness?

378
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,300
Your Highness,

379
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,790
watch out for the encirclement below.

380
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,010
Miss Ruoxi, you understand me,

381
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,000
and likewise,

382
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,990
I understand you too.

383
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,180
Your Highness,
your reputation is well-deserved.

384
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,310
It's my honor to have

385
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,790
a worthy opponent like you.

386
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,450
Liang Feng,

387
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,650
serve the tea.

388
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,520
Please.

389
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,290
This peach kernel tea
is bitter and astringent.

390
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,570
Only after getting used to it
can one tastes its sweetness.

391
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,870
It's what Princess likes.
