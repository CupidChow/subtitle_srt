[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,360
Your mother

3
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,830
will never be honored
in the ancestral hall of Zhou's Mansion.

4
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,890
Who says my aunt wanted to be honored
in the ancestral hall of Zhou's Mansion?

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,660
[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

6
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,050
Move aside.

7
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,710
My aunt

8
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,750
is the Empress of Daqing's sister.

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,900
After her death,

10
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,410
her coffin should be returned to Daqing

11
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,569
for a grand funeral.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,920
But...

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,300
Madam Wang
was still a member of the Zhou family.

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,100
Even if she can't be honored
in the ancestral hall,

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,230
she should still be buried
in her husband's family tomb.

16
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,030
Sharing a bed in life and a grave in death

17
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,590
refers to loving couples.

18
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,770
But now,

19
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,650
does Uncle Kui have

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,190
even the slightest affection
left for my aunt?

21
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
Your Highness.

22
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,680
Madam Wang
was a concubine in our Zhou's Mansion.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,680
This should be our responsibility...

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,479
Uncle Kui, if you disagree,
then dissolve the nominal bond with her.

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,560
As long as Xi agrees,

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,539
my aunt

27
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,759
will no longer
be part of the Zhou's Mansion

28
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,690
and won't have to follow its rules.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,040
Your Highness,
since this is your kind intention,

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
the master certainly won't refuse.

31
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,600
After all,

32
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,250
being buried
as the Empress of Daqing's sister

33
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,840
would certainly be more prestigious
than the current arrangement.

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,760
In three days,

35
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,420
I will send people

36
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,030
to take my aunt's coffin

37
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,020
back to Daqing.

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,290
Mother is already dead.

39
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,420
In my previous life,

40
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,370
I went down a path of no return.

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,680
In this life,

42
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,750
I hope you, Xi,
can live a pure and good life.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,570
As for everything else,

44
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,380
leave it to me.

45
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,610
That medicine was given by His Highness.

46
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,110
Since it comes from

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,760
the palace,

48
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,420
Xi should recover faster.

49
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,070
I've also asked the servants
to prepare some medicinal soup.

50
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,470
After such a beating,

51
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
her body will need careful tending.

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,690
Miss Ruoyao.

53
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,920
You really care about your sister.

54
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,740
Your Highness must have heard some gossip,

55
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,740
thinking that the Zhou family's true-born
and concubine-born daughters

56
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,140
have always been at odds.

57
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,710
Is it just gossip?

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,160
She's my only sister.

59
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,070
How could I not treat her well?

60
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,700
It is only that birth sets us apart.

61
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,360
My mother runs the household.

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,680
If I were too close to Xi,

63
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,160
the suffering she would endure

64
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,680
would be ten or a hundred times worse.

65
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,340
So I've misunderstood Ruoyao all along.

66
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,390
And to marry the Crown Prince,

67
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,900
I brought about her disfigurement
and her tragic suicide.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,510
Ruoyao.

69
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,870
What Your Highness said
in the hall yesterday

70
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,070
was excellent.

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,760
Who says that after a woman dies,

72
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,420
she must be buried
in her husband's family tomb?

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,490
I think

74
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,280
that after a woman dies,

75
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,000
people tend to remember her

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,260
only as someone's wife

77
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,579
or mother,

78
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,279
rather than recall

79
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,959
her true name,

80
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,560
what she accomplished,

81
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,050
or the contributions she made.

82
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,660
I believe

83
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,500
that regardless of status

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
or gender,

85
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,670
what matters

86
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,860
is the path one has traveled.

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,500
Do you really think so?

88
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,840
Yes.

89
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
That's why I admire Your Highness so much.

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
You're bold and spirited,

91
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,250
never concerning yourself with status

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,159
or hierarchy.

93
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,100
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,659
I'm the one who should apologize.

95
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,440
What's wrong?

96
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,640
I just feel

97
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,200
that you and I are very compatible.

98
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,900
I also feel a connection
with Your Highness,

99
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,740
as if we've known each other
for a long time.

100
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,130
But actually,

101
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,510
Your Highness's way of doing things
is more similar to Xi's.

102
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,600
It's just that Xi is still young

103
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,390
and lacks
Your Highness's insight and courage.

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,180
If back then I had

105
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,440
been willing to remove my shackles

106
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,110
and paid more attention
to those around me,

107
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,090
perhaps

108
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,550
the outcome
would have been different long ago.

109

[Memorial Tablet of My Late Mother,
Madam Wang of the Zhou Family]

110
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,840
Didn't Your Highness say

111
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,090
you would protect us?

112
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,660
Why did my mother still die?

113
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,150
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,400
Indeed, others cannot be trusted.

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,280
I can only rely on myself.

116
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,660
Xi.

117
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,780
Xi!

118
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,440
What are you going to do?

119
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,920
Mother didn't die from illness.

120
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,460
She was murdered.

121
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,100
Why is this fragrance getting stronger?

122
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,780
Could it be

123
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,710
Mother died of poisoning?

124
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,460
It was Madam Cui.

125
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,670
Madam Cui killed her.

126
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,140
I'm going to kill her.

127
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,820
I will kill her!

128
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,320
I must have revenge!

129
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,150
Xi.

130
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,190
Xi.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,430
Acting so rashly

132
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,570
will only implicate yourself.

133
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,790
Then what does Your Highness think

134
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,800
I should do?

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,520
I have arranged everything.

136
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,960
Trust me.

137
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,080
I will

138
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,470
take this revenge with you.

139
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,000
Why should I trust you?

140
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,230
How could this be?

141
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,890
Lieutenant Liang,

142
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,870
show yourself.

143
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,580
How did Your Highness know I was nearby?

144
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,080
There are no such coincidences
in this world.

145
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,170
That day when I saw
your master at the tavern,

146
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,310
I realized

147
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,550
he had placed spies around me.

148
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,340
His Highness
is only concerned for your safety.

149
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,290
Go tell your master

150
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,920
to prepare a carriage.

151
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,850
At midnight tonight,

152
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,600
meet me at the back gate
of Zhou's Mansion.

153
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,230
Yes.

154
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,970
Your Highness.

155
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,429
The princess arranged to meet at midnight.

156
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,559
Do we really need to arrive this early?

157
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,870
It's so late.

158
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,650
Yet the princess still asked to meet me.

159
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,580
What urgent matter could she have?

160
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,710
Your Highness.

161
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,010
Miss Ruoxi.

162
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,870
I'm Fu Wei.

163
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,790
Miss Ruoxi.

164
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,030
Today,

165
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,840
the princess requested this meeting.

166
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,860
Please stop this nonsense...

167
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,220
I really am Fu Wei.

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
We've known each other for so long.

169
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,160
How could I not recognize you?

170
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,540
Gains, losses, glory and failure
are all determined by Heaven.

171
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,140
The only thing a person can do

172
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,090
is to strive for it on their own.

173
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,930
Your Highness, do you think

174
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm someone who gives up easily?

175
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,100
Do you believe me now?

176
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,860
Xi and I are cousins.

177
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,190
We look alike.

178
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,880
What's so strange about that?

179
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,890
Well,

180
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,280
Princess,

181
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,210
shall we get in the carriage first?

182
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,840
I can't believe there're two people
in the world who look so similar.

183
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,940
So where are we going now?

184
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,750
The Wang family in Yuzhou.

185
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,310
Hya!

186
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,700
Your face...

187
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,320
How is it identical to mine?

188
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,440
I can't explain

189
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,440
this matter clearly right now.

190
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,640
But please trust me.

191
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,080
I will go to Yuzhou
to investigate the loan sharking case

192
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,480
and clear my aunt's name.

193
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,850
During this time,

194
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,790
you'll stay at Zhou's Mansion
using my identity

195
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,030
to avoid suspicion.

196
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,380
Though I look identical
to Princess Fu Wei,

197
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,910
our fates couldn't be more different.

198
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,840
Madam.

199
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,790
I just saw Miss Ruoxi leaving the mansion

200
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,500
and don't know where she went.

201
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,100
Keep a close eye on her.

202
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,810
You must be careful.

203
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,360
If necessary,

204
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,270
eliminate her completely.

205
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,690
Yes.

206
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,870
By the way...

207
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,940
Watch the princess closely too.

208
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,340
Report to me immediately

209
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,890
if anything seems suspicious.

210
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,650
Yes.

211
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,080
Zhou Ruoxi.

212
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,540
You want to avenge your mother?

213
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,040
Soon you'll learn what it means

214
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,300
to be an ant
trying to shake a mighty tree.

215
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,530
[Wang's Mansion]

216
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,260
News of the loan sharking case
has reached the Imperial City.

217
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,440
The Wang family knows
they're under suspicion,

218
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,510
yet they're making no attempt
to hide anything.

219
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,510
Instead, their doors are wide open.

220
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,120
Don't you think

221
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
there's something suspicious about that?

222
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,780
Look.

223
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,620
That vendor
selling fried snacks by the door.

224
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,440
Though his movements seem practiced,

225
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,920
his apron

226
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,740
doesn't have a single oil stain.

227
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,260
And we've been sitting here

228
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,540
for 10 minutes.

229
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,860
He hasn't fried a single snack.

230
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,160
Also,

231
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,780
that vendor carrying vegetable baskets
and shouting

232
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,340
has passed by the Wang family gate
three times already.

233
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,220
So,

234
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,390
while they appear open and welcoming,

235
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,590
in reality, the surroundings

236
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,340
are full of ambushes.

237
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,420
In that case,

238
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,350
the Wang family is definitely suspicious.

239
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,080
Whether they're guilty or not,

240
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,010
we'll find out soon enough.

241
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,800
This tea is excellent.

242
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,090
Try some.

243
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,970
It's astringent.

244
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,370
I used to find this tea
bitter and astringent too.

245
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,900
But after drinking it for a while,

246
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,050
I began to taste its sweet aftertaste.

247
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Many things can't be rushed.

248
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,970
They need to be savored slowly.

249
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,350
Madam.

250
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,120
Your Highness.

251
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,590
Mrs. Zhou, please rise.

252
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,930
Yes.

253
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,230
Your Highness,

254
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,650
I have urgent matters,

255
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,330
so I must take my leave.

256
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,990
Since she thinks I'm Fu Wei,

257
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,800
I'll use my identity as princess

258
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,590
to teach her a lesson.

259
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,820
The main gate is wide open,

260
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,970
but the side door is tightly shut.

261
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,110
It seems the Wang family

262
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,200
truly has secrets they can't reveal.

263
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,180
Since the door is sealed tight,

264
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,890
how can we find out
what's really going on?

265
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,010
The Wang family
all enter through the side door,

266
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,780
and

267
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,780
this position is closer to the main hall.

268
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,490
Perhaps we can

269
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,440
learn something from here.

270
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,820
It seems you

271
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,100
not only resemble
Miss Ruoxi in appearance,

272
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,660
but also know everything

273
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,890
about her maternal family's affairs.

274
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,240
Hey!

275
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,170
You two!

276
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,800
What are you doing
sneaking around our gate?

277
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,510
It seems your method

278
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,650
won't work.

279
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,590
Right now,

280
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,050
what should we do?

281
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,190
Hold me.

282
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,230
I'm talking to you!

283
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,750
What are you doing here?

284
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,910
Oh, meeting your lover in secret.

285
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,050
I thought you were thieves.

286
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,940
Go away!

287
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
Get going!

288
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,440
Princess.

289
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,750
Using someone and then discarding them

290
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,880
is not a good habit.

291
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,200
Now

292
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,610
we're even.

293
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,640
Continue.

294
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,040
Madam,

295
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,410
the princess is here.

296
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,040
Your Highness, you've come unexpectedly.

297
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,440
What brings you here?

298
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,420
Kneel.

299
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,590
Did I tell you to rise?

300
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,540
My aunt's coffin
has now arrived in Daqing.

301
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
But I thought it over.

302
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,320
Lord Zhou and my aunt
were husband and wife.

303
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,850
My aunt's memorial tablet

304
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,720
should be placed
in the ancestral hall of Zhou's Mansion.

305
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,640
Mrs. Zhou,

306
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
what do you think?

307
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,100
Well...

308
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,880
This goes against proper etiquette.

309
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
I cannot make this decision.

310
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,310
I must

311
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,830
consult with the master first.

312
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,950
What if I insist
that you make this decision?

313
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,310
I...

314
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,880
I would still prefer
to wait for the master's return to decide.

315
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,720
Mrs. Zhou,

316
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,070
I want

317
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,350
my aunt's memorial tablet

318
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,280
placed in the Zhou's Mansion's
ancestral hall now.

319
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
Madam Wang

320
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,960
was only a concubine
in the Zhou's Mansion.

321
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,350
I dare not rashly...

322
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,800
-You...
-Madam.

323
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,840
What?

324
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,690
You dare to defy me?
