1
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,760
[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,250
Brother.

3
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,880
I've ordered people

4
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,070
to close the Military Supply Route.

5
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,870
Zhou Kui can't transport
his arms and ordnance in.

6
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,670
I'm afraid Zhou Kui

7
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,260
still has a backup plan.

8
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,450
How did I not notice

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,400
Zhou Kui's treacherous ambitions before?

10
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,720
Brother,

11
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,380
you used to

12
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,410
see him only as your father-in-law.

13
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,830
You were too busy trying to please him.

14
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,720
So how could you

15
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,020
be suspicious of him?

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,890
Why have you been with the Princess

17
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,560
for so long that

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
your tongue has become so sharp?

19
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,850
I think it's better this way.

20
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,080
Always holding back and pleasing others

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,940
is exhausting.

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,860
Yan,

23
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,970
you seem to know her well.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,370
I've known her for two lifetimes.

25
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,970
How could I not know her well?

26
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:49,880
Brother,

27
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,580
don't blame her.

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,180
She's just been through too much

29
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,060
and harbors hatred toward you.

30
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,620
Hatred?

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,280
I just can't understand

32
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,730
where this hatred

33
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,870
comes from.

34
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,310
Is it merely because

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,580
I previously suspected her

36
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,710
of orchestrating the assassination?

37
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,170
Brother,

38
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,790
right now

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,090
we're facing a great enemy.

40
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,290
The most important thing is

41
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,190
whether you and Fu Wei
can resolve your differences

42
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,250
and work together.

43
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,530
Hmm.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:27,880
Also,

45
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,430
Brother,

46
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,990
there are things

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,420
you need to tell her yourself.

48
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,170
We are both princes of Yunrui,

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,620
yet now we're worrying ourselves sick
over the women we love.

50
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,980
If Father found out,

51
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,690
he would surely scold us

52
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,820
for being pathetic.

53
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,620
I'm thinking,

54
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,320
after everything settles down,

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,280
we'll go find Ruoyao

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,800
and travel the world together,

57
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,890
living carefree lives.

58
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,030
I hope that day

59
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,010
comes soon.

60
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,720
Crown Prince Shu,

61
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,690
you wanted to see me?

62
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,170
Did you call me here
to listen to the rain?

63
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,310
I

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,350
asked you to come here today

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,960
to apologize for everything

66
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,440
that happened before

67
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,950
and ask for your forgiveness.

68
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,350
What you should apologize for

69
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,589
is more than just this.

70
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,290
I still don't understand

71
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,120
where all your hatred toward me

72
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,830
comes from.

73
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,370
Do you really want to know?

74
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,730
What do you mean?

75
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,040
Now

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,730
we're even.

77
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,690
Li Shu,

78
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,560
there will be no more hatred

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,520
between us

80
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,540
from now on.

81
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,900
Yan is right.

82
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,960
Since I've been given a second life,

83
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,820
I shouldn't be burdened
by the shackles of the past.

84
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,770
Crown Prince Shu,

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,870
you should return to your residence soon.

86
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,190
There's still a play

87
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,810
that you need to perform.

88
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,360
Also,

89
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,260
I would trouble you

90
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,190
to deliver a message for me.

91
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,680
It's been several days,

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,010
and there's still no sign of His Highness.

93
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,420
It seems I can't hide it anymore.

94
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,390
Xi.

95
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,800
Father.

96
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,420
It's so late.

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,740
Why are you here?

98
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,370
I've come to see His Highness

99
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,970
to report some matters.

100
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,670
Where is His Highness?

101
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,300
Are you hiding something

102
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,910
from me?

103
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,360
Has the Crown Prince gone missing?

104
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,430
No.

105
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,140
His Highness is here in the mansion.

106
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,320
He...

107
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,340
Let me tell you,

108
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,790
we're in the same boat now.

109
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,880
Don't you dare try

110
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,140
any tricks with me!

111
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,790
I wouldn't dare.

112
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,930
Then where is he?

113
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,430
Keep drinking!

114
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
Lord Zhou!

115
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,370
Let's continue!

116
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:39,950
Your Highness.

117
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,710
Don't leave.

118
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,659
Keep drinking.

119
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,980
Your Highness,

120
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,260
let me attend to you.

121
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,760
Don't you touch me!

122
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,710
Who are you really?

123
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,090
What's wrong, Your Highness?

124
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,010
I'm Fu Wei, your Crown Princess.

125
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,350
I know you're not her.

126
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,120
My Crown Princess...

127
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,220
My Crown Princess isn't that ugly!

128
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,250
Lord Zhou!

129
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,420
Don't go.

130
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Keep...

131
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,980
Keep drinking.

132
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
Keep drinking.

133
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,090
Drunk like this,

134
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,440
he hardly looks like
an heir to the throne.

135
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,520
Father,

136
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,970
His Highness

137
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,650
has been drinking every day

138
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,790
because of what happened to Ruoyao.

139
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,260
He hasn't attended
to state affairs for days.

140
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,220
That's fine.

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,960
If he's so lovesick,

142
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,780
then let's make him never wake up.

143
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,850
Come.

144
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,300
This is Xiaoyao Powder.

145
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,750
Mix it into

146
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,140
his meals every day.

147
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,210
Soon,

148
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,740
the state of Yunrui

149
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,130
will be in our hands.

150
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,430
His Majesty is still in power.

151
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,250
His Highness

152
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,300
hasn't inherited the throne yet.

153
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,820
How can we seize power?

154
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,160
Don't worry about that.

155
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,010
Just do as I say.

156
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,010
Just remember this.

157
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,720
I can raise you above thousands,

158
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,320
but I can also make you

159
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,730
fall into eternal damnation.

160
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,360
Take it.

161
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,320
Take it!

162
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,940
Don't you touch me!

163
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,550
You're here.

164
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,200
Why did you ask me to come here?

165
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,640
Today's Mother's birthday.

166
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,300
I was afraid you'd forget.

167
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,410
My mother's affairs

168
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,590
are none of your business.

169
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,380
Xi,

170
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,030
even now, don't you understand

171
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,980
why Mother died

172
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,690
and who killed her?

173
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,820
She discovered Zhou Kui
was from the Daqing royal family,

174
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,180
so Zhou Kui got rid of her
through Madam Cui's hands.

175
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,910
Mother was killed by Father?

176
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,990
Why would he do that?

177
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,320
Zhou Kui has been plotting for years,

178
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,910
all for that one day

179
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,910
he could seize power.

180
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,270
He won't let anyone
who knows his secret live.

181
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,360
He's hiding your identity now

182
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,670
just to make you a pawn in his game,

183
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,070
a stepping stone.

184
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,300
Even if what you say is true,

185
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,000
what difference does it make?

186
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,460
Mother is already dead.

187
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,270
In this world,

188
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,530
Father is my only support.

189
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,740
Since he's willing

190
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,790
to raise me above all others,

191
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,770
then I'm willing

192
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,170
to be his pawn

193
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,200
and stepping stone.

194
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,610
Xi,

195
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,760
why won't you turn back even now?

196
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,380
One turns back when there's a way out.

197
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,600
But now,

198
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,080
beneath my feet
are mountains of blades and seas of fire,

199
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
and behind me is a bottomless abyss.

200
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,450
What way out do I have?

201
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,110
How can I turn back?

202
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,380
Everywhere in this world

203
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,610
is like a prison.

204
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,700
Now that you have a second life,

205
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,220
you shouldn't be trapped here.

206
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,260
Mother's affairs,

207
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,420
the Zhou family's business,

208
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,450
even the politics of Yunrui court—

209
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,080
none of them concerns you.

210
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,970
You should leave this place

211
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,260
and find somewhere you can be free.

212
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,150
Xi.

213
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,300
Xi!

214
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,650
[Happiness]

215
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,560
Yan,

216
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,400
in this second life,

217
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,550
your determination

218
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,490
has spared me from regret.

219
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,450
However,

220
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,900
the rest of our days will be difficult.

221
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,290
We don't know how many days we have left.

222
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,580
No matter how many days remain,

223
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,510
as long as I'm with you,

224
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:16,890
this life

225
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,110
[Happiness]

226
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,600
will be complete.

227
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,450
This young lady

228
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,950
is already at the end of her life.

229
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,760
Your Highness,
once your fate is linked with hers,

230
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,310
sharing your lifespan with her,

231
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,270
your physical deterioration
will increase daily,

232
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,020
and there's no way to reverse it.

233
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,900
Can you

234
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,440
handle that?

235
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,880
I

236
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,600
would never regret it.

237
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,470
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

238
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,570
Congratulations!

239
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,760
[Virtuous Virtue]

240
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,220
First bow to heaven and earth!

241
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,850
Bow.

242
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,390
Second bow to the parents!

243
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,510
Bow.

244
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,760
Today,

245
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,360
I am greatly comforted

246
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,500
that all my sons
have established families,

247
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,860
and the state affairs

248
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,210
can be entrusted to you.

249
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,000
Husband and wife bow to each other!

250
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,010
Bow.

251
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Wait!
