1
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,900
[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,140
Prince Yan, to have earned your affection

3
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,410
is my fortune.

4
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,120
But we are ultimately
not meant to be together.

5
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,940
We shall never meet again in this life.

6
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,310
This dream

7
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,950
is becoming clearer.

8
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,020
At the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival
of my past life,

9
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,280
death-sworn assassins
came to avenge Princess of Daqing.

10
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,390
But now

11
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,940
the Princess is alive,

12
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,420
so the assassination attempt
shouldn't happen again, right?

13
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,660
And she

14
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,010
won't appear here either.

15
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,630
No matter what method you use,

16
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,510
today

17
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,639
don't let Zhou Ruoxi leave the house.

18
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,800
Yes.

19
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,160
Thank you, Sir.

20
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,140
Let's go.

21
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,980
What a coincidence.

22
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,020
Princess,

23
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,800
are you enjoying
the lantern carnival alone?

24
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,000
How could I be alone?

25
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,050
Haven't you been with me all along?

26
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,840
Princess, there's no need to avoid me.

27
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,370
About what I said last time,

28
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,490
you don't need to respond right away.

29
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,290
I told you

30
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,030
I would wait for you.

31
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,840
The day of the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival

32
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,500
is Yunrui's most festive day.

33
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,880
Indeed.

34
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,700
It's Mid-Autumn Festival.

35
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,080
Princess, you seem troubled.

36
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,360
How is the moonlight

37
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,159
tonight?

38
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,150
Quite beautiful.

39
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,390
I'm reminded of someone from my past.

40
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,480
The moon in the sky is full,

41
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,610
yet in the human world
it stands at mid-month.

42
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,740
There are always many regrets in life.

43
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,720
The changes
and imperfections of this world

44
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,510
are all part of the natural order.

45
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,550
But Princess,

46
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,800
you shouldn't
cling to the regrets of the waning moon...

47
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,120
While neglecting the joy of the full moon.

48
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,320
Yan.

49
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,700
Shu.

50
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,010
Miss Ruoyao.

51
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,840
What a coincidence.

52
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,040
You're both here too.

53
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,750
Princess, it seems you

54
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,950
and Yan

55
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,440
share quite a connection.

56
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,070
In just a few days,

57
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,200
you've become so familiar with each other.

58
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,990
Prince Yan protects the Imperial City.

59
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,630
Since I arrived in Yunrui,

60
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
he has been protecting me all along.

61
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,400
So my closeness to him
is not without cause.

62
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,130
It's not exactly a connection.

63
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,780
If we're talking about true connection,

64
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,200
in this vast lantern market,

65
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,600
with crowds everywhere,

66
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,650
that I could meet
you and Miss Ruoyao here

67
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,890
is what I'd call true connection.

68
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,260
Come one,

69
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,640
come all!

70
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,010
Step right up and take a look!

71
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,610
Let's go take a look.

72
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,840
Given

73
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,520
today's circumstances,

74
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,470
it seems unlikely
that any assassins will appear.

75
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,700
Shu and Miss Ruoyao

76
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,860
are childhood sweethearts,

77
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,060
truly enviable.

78
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,610
As the Crown Prince,

79
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,260
Shu is one
whom countless women yearn for.

80
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,730
Indeed,

81
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,290
he is the best choice
for the peace-making marriage.

82
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,330
But Shu said

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,060
that if Miss Ruoyao

84
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,400
wished to travel,

85
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,280
he

86
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,170
would always wait for her.

87
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,040
So...

88
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,170
-Princess...
-Princess Yan, you don't think...

89
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,630
I have feelings for Crown Prince Shu,
do you?

90
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,320
This peace-making marriage
is simply a duty I must fulfill.

91
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,120
Besides, the princes of Yunrui

92
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,040
aren't like merchandise at this stall

93
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,640
for me to freely choose from.

94
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,780
I have no interest
in what everyone else is fighting over.

95
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,500
After all,

96
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,950
even outside a latrine

97
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,820
you'll find crowds of people.

98
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,400
With all the chatting and laughing,

99
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
it seems you and Yan
are getting along well, Princess.

100
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,280
Perhaps soon

101
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,900
I can start calling you

102
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,990
my sister-in-law.

103
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,330
Crown Prince Shu, since when have you been
able to decide in His Majestyâ€™s stead?

104
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,909
My marriage

105
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,000
will be decided by His Majesty alone.

106
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,200
Princess,

107
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,200
there are
many novelties over there.

108
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,160
Let me show you.

109
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,520
Princess,

110
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,260
Yunrui's Mid-Autumn Festival night market

111
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,460
has many novelties.

112
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,650
Look.

113
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,160
Look at this.

114
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,520
Sweet Osmanthus sachet.

115
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,050
Oh my!

116
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,810
You have excellent taste, Miss.

117
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,170
This sachet design

118
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,730
is unique to Yunrui.

119
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,880
It's typically used as a token of love.

120
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,120
If you like it, Miss,

121
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,420
don't miss out.

122
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,390
I don't like it.

123
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,590
Watch out!

124
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,330
Everyone stand back!

125
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,240
Shu!

126
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,030
Take the princess
and Miss Zhou away first.

127
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,580
Let's go.

128
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,960
How can there still be assassins?

129
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,140
Want to escape?

130
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,120
Dream on!

131
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,870
Yao!

132
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,390
Crown Prince Shu.

133
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,630
Protect Miss Ruoyao!

134
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,060
Fu Wei!

135
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,010
Who sent you to assassinate us?

136
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,230
Go ask the King of Hell yourself!

137
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,980
Attack!

138
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,250
Leave no survivors!

139
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,150
Are you alright?

140
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,680
Your Highness, be careful!

141
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:22,970
Sister,

142
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,230
are you alright?

143
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,710
Your Highness, look out!

144
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,250
Xi!

145
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,240
Don't hurt His Highness!

146
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,960
Xi!

147
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,900
Why did Xi still come?

148
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,390
Stop!

149
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,400
Halt!

150
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,100
Your Highness.

151
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,580
Prince Yan.

152
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
I...

153
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,400
I am willing

154
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,830
to die for you, Prince Yan.

155
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,080
I...

156
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,100
I am willing to die

157
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,450
for you, Your Highness.

158
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,620
Xi!

159
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,790
Xi!

160
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,660
Why?

161
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,630
Xi.

162
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,980
Why are this happening?

163
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,450
What I thought was self-preservation

164
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,940
has unknowingly

165
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,520
accelerated my fall into destiny.

166
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,190
Fu Wei!

167
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,450
Princess.

168
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,990
Princess!

169
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,250
Princess!

170
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,640
Fu Wei.

171
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,160
Xi!

172
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
What should we do?

173
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,600
Please save Xi!

174
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,880
Xi.

175
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,360
Xi.

176
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,680
Master.

177
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,980
Master.

178
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,480
Save me!

179
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,380
You've failed in your task.

180
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,280
What use is there in keeping you?

181
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,470
Master.

182
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,530
Save me!

183
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,420
Thank you, Master.

184
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,680
I have failed in my task.

185
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,230
Please punish me.

186
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,250
Since the mission failed,

187
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,400
we must shift the blame elsewhere.

188
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,560
Enough.

189
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,420
Speak.

190
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,460
Who ordered

191
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,190
yesterday's assassination attempt?

192
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,250
Who was the target?

193
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,640
Don't waste my time.

194
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,100
Just kill me.

195
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,190
If you truly wished to die,

196
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,190
how did you end up in my hands?

197
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,930
The will to survive

198
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,480
is human instinct.

199
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,010
There's no shame in it.

200
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,240
If you tell me everything,

201
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,450
I will spare your life.

202
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,850
Do you mean it?

203
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,290
I always

204
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,740
keep my word.

205
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,540
Okay.

206
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,010
We were

207
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,730
acting on orders from a secret letter.

208
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,790
"At the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival,

209
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,170
kill the Crown Prince."

210
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,980
Where is this letter?

211
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,130
In my hair bun.

212
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,070
Search it.

213
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,310
[Zhou's Mansion]

214
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,800
Father.

215
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,960
Father, you asked for me?

216
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,500
Are you feeling better?

217
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,350
I'm much better now.

218
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,600
Thank you for your concern.

219
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,700
At yesterday's lantern carnival,

220
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,250
it was fortunate you acted so quickly.

221
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:14,840
Look.

222
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,960
These are rewards from His Majesty

223
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,620
and His Highness

224
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,660
for your service.

225
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,240
You have

226
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,420
brought great honor

227
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,100
to the Zhou family.

228
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,140
Being able to protect His Highness

229
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,120
is my blessing.

230
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,480
I'll ask the kitchen

231
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,440
to prepare

232
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,640
some nourishing soup

233
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,770
to help you recover.

234
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,260
I'll have the servants

235
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,080
bring all these to your room.

236
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,670
Thank you, Father.

237
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,920
Well,

238
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,390
I'll take my leave now.

239
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,020
All right.

240
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,630
Fortunately, I shook off Linglan
and went to the lantern carnival,

241
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,690
so I was able to save
Crown Prince Shu.

242
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,230
I won't miss any chance to change my fate.
