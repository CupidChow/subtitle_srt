[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,330
Linglan

3
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,430
is my trusted henchman

4
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,730
stationed in Daqing.

5
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,230
So,

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
from the very beginning,

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,120
I knew your identity.

8
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,930
Now that you know my identity,

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,520
why didn't you expose me?

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,000
The reason is simple.

11
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,060
I initially thought you could be useful.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,400
But I never expected

13
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,800
you would be so stubborn.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
You were constantly at odds with me.

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,630
I'm very curious about one thing.

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,100
Why do you look

17
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,670
so much like Xi?

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,120
What exactly are you going to do?

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,720
That's none of your concern.

20
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,860
Right now,

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,690
you only have two options.

22
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,570
First,

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,070
marry Prince Yan

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,080
to become his princess consort

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,340
and cooperate with me.

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,140
As for the second option,

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,210
you will die in this mansion

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,720
as Miss Zhou Ruoxi.

29
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,920
You did loan sharking to hoard wealth,

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,660
recruited soldiers in the black market,

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,530
took the Military Supply Route permit

32
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,460
and carried on illicit affairs.

33
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,200
You're planning a rebellion, right?

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,890
Though you've figured it out,
what can you do?

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,180
Madam Cui, the mastermind behind
the loan-sharking case,

36
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,400
has already been executed.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,640
Stockpiling weapons

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,500
and plotting rebellion

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,100
are just rumors.

40
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,510
I'd like to advise you'

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,850
to consider your current situation.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,380
If

43
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,300
you don't cooperate with me,

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,460
do you think

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,370
you can leave here alive?

46
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,500
What an evil Minister of Rites!

47
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,550
What a crazy person you are, Lord Zhou!

48
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,180
Go to hell!

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,120
Let's go!

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,880
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

51
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,030
Your Highness!

52
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,010
Your Highness!

53
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,570
How did she get injured like this?

54
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,970
It was Zhou Kui.

55
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,580
He's working for Daqing.

56
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,820
Just now,

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,720
I found

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,250
the Military Supply Route permit
in his room.

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,260
I suspect he wants to transport weapons

60
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,590
into the Imperial City.

61
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,190
Liang Feng,

62
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,320
raid Zhou's Mansion!

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,640
Yes.

64
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,480
Wait.

65
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,860
He has already known my identity.

66
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,520
He'll definitely destroy the evidence.

67
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,930
The raid would be meaningless.

68
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,890
Alright.

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,960
Have a rest first.

70
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,810
We'll discuss

71
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,010
those matters later.

72
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,760
Your Highness.

73
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,850
Put me down.

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,579
It's not good if others see us.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,360
Others?

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,970
There's no one here.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,720
Liang Feng.

78
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,150
Do you see anyone?

79
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,800
No. No.

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
There's nobody.

81
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,730
I'll find a doctor.

82
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,910
Luckily, after the doctor checked on you,

83
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,040
he said you are not seriously injured.

84
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,070
You're awake.

85
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,250
Where else does it hurt?

86
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,940
I need to stay alive

87
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
to marry you.

88
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,850
I'll be fine.

89
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,490
Let me help you up.

90
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,470
Now that you've already noticed

91
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,730
the danger yesterday,

92
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,260
why did you still put yourself at risk

93
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,990
without telling me in advance?

94
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,659
Yesterday,

95
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,700
in the palace,
I saw Linglan with a secret letter.

96
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,680
I wasn't sure about
the content of the letter,

97
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
and I didn't know

98
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,590
who Linglan is working for.

99
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,480
So, I wanted to find evidence
as soon as possible.

100
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,560
Find evidence?

101
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
I won't do this again.

102
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,970
You...

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Earlier,

104
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,000
I found a secret letter

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,460
from the Crown Prince to Zhou Kui
in his room.

106
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,920
The letter instructed

107
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,240
Zhou Kui

108
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,940
to find the missing spies.

109
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,600
As for the matter of those spies,

110
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,460
I've known about it for some time.

111
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,010
When the Princess of Daqing
came for the royal marriage,

112
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,880
Shu learned that

113
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
spies from Daqing had infiltrated
the Imperial City.

114
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,560
So he specifically sent a team
to investigate.

115
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,360
But for some reason,

116
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,880
those spies

117
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,130
have gone missing.

118
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,930
And the tokens they carried

119
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,020
have coincidentally appeared
in the black market.

120
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,870
All the clues we have now

121
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,080
point to the Eastern Palace.

122
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,670
Crown Prince Shu and Zhou Kui

123
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,480
might have been in collusion
for a long time.

124
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,680
As you said,

125
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,340
the evidence is solid.

126
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,840
However,

127
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,360
if you think about this carefully,

128
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,690
you'll find
it doesn't benefit Shu at all.

129
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,330
Since we have different opinions,

130
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,540
why don't we

131
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,440
ask Crown Prince Shu
to clarify this matter?

132
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,450
Then I'll go to
the Crown Prince's Mansion

133
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,680
and ask Shu to come discuss this.

134
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,240
Wait.

135
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,110
Zhou Kui has already known my identity.

136
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,080
And we don't know the situation

137
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,810
in the Crown Prince's Mansion.

138
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,290
Besides,

139
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,040
because of the matter of
the Princess of Daqing before,

140
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,640
you and the Crown Prince
have had a falling out.

141
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,150
I'm afraid he won't come.

142
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,180
It's not entirely impossible.

143
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,020
Your Highness.

144
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,250
Someone just delivered a message.

145
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,270
If you learn the whereabouts of
the Princess of Daqing,

146
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,070
go to the forest outside the city

147
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,420
at 9 o'clock tonight.

148
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,260
The Princess of Daqing?

149
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,730
Isn't she with Yan?

150
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,950
Hya!

151
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,090
Whoa!

152
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,050
Who's there?

153
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,030
Your Highness?

154
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,520
Your Highness?

155
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
Where has His Highness gone?

156
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,880
His Highness is missing!

157
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,600
Split up and search!

158
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,080
Yes!

159
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,560
Yes!

160
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Yes!

161
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,330
Let's go!

162
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:33,840
This way!

163
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,820
Your Highness!

164
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,400
How dare you!

165
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,430
Do you know who I am?

166
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,320
How dare you tie me up?

167
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,409
Untie me!

168
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,760
Untie me!

169
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,060
Let me go!

170
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,250
Hurry up!

171
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,920
You little brat!

172
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,700
You're still laughing?

173
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,790
How dare you tie me up?

174
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,210
Untie me now!

175
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Untie me!

176
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,760
Shu.

177
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,400
Well,

178
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,390
promise me first that

179
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,320
after I untie you,

180
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,640
you should talk with me in peace.

181
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,910
Hurry up!

182
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,190
Hurry up!

183
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,850
You little brat!

184
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,690
Come here!

185
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,750
Come here!

186
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,120
Hurry up!

187
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,060
You little brat!

188
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,470
I'll execute your entire clan!

189
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,590
Your Highness,

190
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,760
you are also a member of

191
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,960
his clan.

192
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,280
Zhou Ruoxi?

193
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,309
It's really you.

194
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,530
You've bewitched Yan

195
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,800
and made him commit

196
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,240
such a disrespectful act!

197
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,570
What are you going to do?

198
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,700
You are planning a rebellion,

199
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,220
huh?

200
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,210
You're stupid!

201
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,850
How dare she insult me?

202
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,640
So what?

203
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,910
Even if you inherit the throne,

204
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,700
you

205
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,690
will only let sycophants rule.

206
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,490
You're just a terrible ruler

207
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,020
who will be easily deceived
and manipulated!

208
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,670
She's slandering me!

209
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
How dare you slander me!

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,800
Shu.

211
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,320
You're stopping me, huh?

212
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,640
Shu.

213
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,560
Why are you just standing there?

214
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,280
Shu.

215
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,570
Are you letting her continue to
speak such filth?

216
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,940
You are a fool!

217
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,070
Why are you insulting him?

218
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,930
If you've got the guts, come at me!

219
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,000
Let me go!

220
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,560
-Let me go!
-Shu!

221
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,120
Let me go!

222
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,880
Shu!

223
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,590
I brought you here today

224
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,420
because we truly have important matters
to discuss.

225
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,420
The Eastern Palace is full of spies.

226
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,000
Your Highness.

227
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,650
Your Highness.

228
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,920
We just wanted you to slip away unnoticed

229
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,180
and avoid prying eyes.

230
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,730
We wanted to find a safe place
to discuss important issues.

231
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,280
Even though there are important matters,

232
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,340
you shouldn't have been so reckless.

233
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,340
We've already known that

234
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,050
behind the loan-sharking case,

235
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,840
someone is seeking personal gain

236
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,720
to forge weapons

237
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,410
with the intention of rebellion.

238
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,900
Your Highness, who do you think

239
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,320
is behind this case

240
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,810
and what is their purpose?

241
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,020
Why is this in your hand?

242
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,810
Your Highness, you don't need
to ask too much.

243
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,940
You only need to know

244
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,200
that this token was last seen

245
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,350
in the black market.

246
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,750
It was used to trade weapons
and arms and ordnance.

247
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,000
You mean

248
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,890
someone wants to place the blame

249
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,790
on me, right?

250
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,260
Who is this person?

251
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,600
This pattern

252
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,140
was traced from Zhou Kui's jade pendant.

253
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,430
According to the Princess of Daqing,

254
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,350
this belongs to the Daqing royal family.

255
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,590
Zhou Kui is a henchman of
the Daqing royal family?

256
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,920
He wants to use me

257
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,830
to commit treason.

258
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,780
I found

259
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,770
the Military Supply Route permit
in Zhou Kui's study.

260
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,770
We suspect

261
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,140
he wants to use the Military Supply Route

262
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,670
to transport weapons
into the Imperial City.

263
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,800
Zhou Kui is cunning.

264
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,520
I'll go arrest him right now.

265
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,320
Wait.

266
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,450
To catch a thief, we need evidence.

267
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,610
All of this is just our speculation.

268
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,040
I urge Your Highness

269
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,190
not to act rashly,

270
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,970
lest we alert our target.

271
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,160
How do you want me

272
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,360
to cooperate with you two?

273
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,160
Set a trap for him.

274
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,980
Let him expose his own weakness.

275
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,530
You're not Zhou Ruoxi, are you?

276
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,160
You've finally vented your revenge.

277
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,280
I was really

278
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,400
worried.

279
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,320
I was afraid your loose talk

280
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
would offend Shu.

281
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,540
Then,

282
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,820
you may get in trouble.

283
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,730
Then why didn't you stop me?

284
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,760
You just let me

285
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,920
speak freely

286
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,540
and insult the Crown Prince.

287
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,110
I love seeing you

288
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,800
speak freely

289
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,720
and settle scores so boldly.

290
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,840
Fu Wei.

291
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,160
When frustrations are bottled
up for too long,

292
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,290
vent your pent-up feelings

293
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,270
is the only way

294
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,630
to relieve yourself.

295
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,720
Aren't you worried that I might
take your brother's life?

296
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,530
You won't.

297
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,230
Because you know

298
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,610
Shu

299
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,560
is merely being deceived and used.

300
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,380
He's certainly not the real culprit.

301
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,310
And the person you want to deal with

302
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,200
isn't him.

303
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,150
Even though His Highness has agreed to
cooperate with us now,

304
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,910
we still

305
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,770
haven't found

306
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,620
any evidence of Zhou Kui's loan sharking

307
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,220
and stockpiling weapons
in the Imperial City.

308
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,850
We don't know his next move either.

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,120
We're exposed

310
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,410
while he operates in the shadows.

311
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,980
I'm worried...

312
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,130
I'm here with you.

313
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,180
No matter what will happen,

314
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,930
I will always be with you.

315
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,430
May I find someone
who loves me wholeheartedly

316
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,890
and stays with me forever.

317
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Yan.

318
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,160
You're truly braver

319
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,990
and more fortunate than me,'

320
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,840
Your Highness!

321
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,790
Something terrible has happened!

322
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,190
His Highness is missing!

323
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,390
Missing?

324
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,580
What do you mean?

325
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,060
Well,

326
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,450
I don't know how it happened.

327
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,920
After he left the city,

328
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,550
he vanished without a trace.

329
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,360
Perhaps we should report this to Lord Zhou

330
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,290
to prepare for all contingencies.

331
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,140
No need.

332
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,940
His Highness's disappearance

333
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,340
concerns the stability of Yunrui's court.

334
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,840
It must not be leaked.

335
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,940
His Highness's disappearance
is very suspicious.

336
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,290
If he were captured by
Prince Yan's men,

337
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,030
the consequences would be terrible.

338
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,110
Perhaps we should inform Lord Zhou,

339
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,190
in case later on...

340
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,660
I said it's not necessary.

341
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,740
I am your master.

342
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,560
Whose orders should you follow?

343
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,420
Please calm down, Your Highness.

344
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,140
Forget it.

345
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,040
Send all our people out

346
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,220
to secretly search
for His Highness's whereabouts.

347
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,260
