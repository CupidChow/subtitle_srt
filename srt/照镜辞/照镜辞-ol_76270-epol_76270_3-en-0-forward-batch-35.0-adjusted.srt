00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,770
[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,870
Princess Fu Wei,

3
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,060
why are you here?

4
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,910
Why did you lie?

5
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,810
Why betray your mother?

6
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,270
Why do things you'd regret?

7
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,700
In what capacity are you
speaking to me like this?

8
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,820
As the noble Princess of Daqing

9
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,190
or as my cousin whom I've never met?

10
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,370
I know Madam Cui has been
oppressing you all these years.

11
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,520
But however hard and dangerous it's been,

12
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,760
you shouldn't betray your own mother.

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Don't you know

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,440
the risk of

15
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,289
bargaining with a tiger?

16
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,890
Everyone understands that.

17
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,480
But does knowing that

18
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,310
actually help people survive

19
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,910
or help them rise to power?

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,320
I can protect you.

21
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

22
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,479
But you're here
for a political marriage.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,720
You may protect us today,

24
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,340
but once you leave the Zhou's Mansion,

25
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,289
how will my mother and I survive here?

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,200
My mother needs more rest.

27
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,890
Please leave, Your Highness.

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,960
Perhaps I shouldn't blame my past self
who's been lost in confusion

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,840
and unable to find a way out.

30
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,610
I need to figure everything out quickly

31
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,520
and find a way

32
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,390
to take Mother and Xi away.

33
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,360
Your Highness,

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,579
your ginseng soup is here.

35
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,240
Don't move.

36
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,670
What are you really after?

37
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,950
Why make me impersonate the Princess?

38
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,090
Your Highness,

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,460
what are you doing?

40
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,630
You are the Princess of Daqing.

41
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,500
Still won't tell the truth?

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,160
Then don't blame me for showing no mercy.

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,960
I'll tell you.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,640
That day when you collapsed
by the roadside,

45
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,320
Princess saved you.

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,850
When you woke up, you were confused

47
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,320
and had forgotten
everything that happened in your past.

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,790
Your appearance happens
to be similar to Princess's,

49
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,910
so Princess

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,210
had you take her place.

51
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,690
Your Princess want me
to die in her place?

52
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,770
Princess simply didn't want
this political marriage.

53
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,840
The encounter with bandits
at the posthouse that day

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,110
was truly an accident.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,110
Princess knew nothing about it.

56
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,630
Where is Princess now?

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,320
I don't know.

58
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,670
It's just that...

59
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,000
Princess told me to keep an eye on you.

60
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,370
Princess and I are not the same person.

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,680
How can I replace her?

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,920
The women of the Daqing royal family

63
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,320
all wear veils in public.

64
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,050
Except for their personal servants,

65
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,860
no one knows what they look like.

66
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,410
Besides,
Princess has the marriage documents.

67
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,010
As long as I stay with you,

68
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,010
you are the Princess.

69
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,360
Your name is Linglan, right?

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,730
From now on, you'll follow me.

71
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,520
However your princess treated you before,

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
that's how I'll treat you.

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,360
But if you dare tell anyone
about this impersonation,

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,829
I won't spare your life.

75
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,230
Yes.

76
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,710
Given how things stand,

77
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,070
I have to take advantage of
the identity of Princess of Daqing,

78
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,270
so that I won't repeat the same mistake.

79
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,290
Your Highness,

80
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,780
do you mean to take my life?

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,830
How do the guards in the royal escort team

82
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,110
compare to you

83
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,380
in martial arts?

84
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,440
I've heard

85
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,519
that Daqing's warriors
are all top-notch fighters.

86
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,579
Their martial arts

87
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,480
are certainly better than mine.

88
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,240
They were all top-notch fighters,

89
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,740
yet they were killed with a single strike,

90
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,670
without even signs of resistance.

91
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,150
This clearly shows

92
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,600
how formidable the killer is.

93
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,470
But

94
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,640
who would dare

95
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,210
to assassinate the princess
sent for marriage alliance?

96
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,740
This could seriously affect
relations between the two states.

97
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:22,580
Father,

98
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
I believe

99
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,270
we must not agree to
Daqing's marriage alliance.

100
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,400
Your Highness,

101
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,060
since Daqing has shown goodwill,

102
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,700
why resort to conflict?

103
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,530
Lord Liu,

104
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,140
a temporary war

105
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,880
is to secure lasting peace.

106
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,470
Don't you understand that?

107
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Regarding this marriage alliance,

108
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,660
I believe

109
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,900
the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

110
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,750
This matter needs no further discussion.

111
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,770
Your Majesty is wise.

112
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,470
This matter is indeed complicated.

113
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,910
I must find out who's behind this.

114
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,770
Your Highness,

115
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,500
we can't find any more clues
from those dead bodies.

116
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,340
What should we

117
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,460
do next?

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,010
Since we can't find more clues

119
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,260
from the dead,

120
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,610
we must look among the living.

121
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,470
[Zhou's Mansion]

122
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,720
She seems somewhat similar

123
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,710
to the person in my dreams.

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,159
Yan.

125
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,180
Prince Yan.

126
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,660
Princess.

127
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,260
The old wound on your left arm
is acting up again.

128
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
How did she know?

129
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,770
And why does she care so much?

130
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,400
Have we met before?

131
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,590
No.

132
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,020
If we've never met,

133
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,270
then why

134
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,380
do you

135
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,760
know so much

136
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,430
about Yunrui's affairs?

137
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,970
You must have carefully arranged

138
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,500
for this marriage alliance

139
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,659
and have a chosen husband in mind.

140
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,159
Are you suggesting

141
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,300
that my carefully selected future husband

142
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
is you?

143
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,750
Could it be

144
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,100
she wants to marry me?

145
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,940
I not only know about
your left arm injury,

146
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,200
but I also know

147
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,470
that the Crown Prince's
childhood sweetheart

148
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,970
is the eldest daughter of the Zhou family,

149
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,620
and even what kind of women
His Majesty prefers.

150
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,750
Doesn't that make me more suspicious?

151
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,790
I came here for a marriage alliance.

152
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,460
What's so weird about
understanding the personalities

153
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,110
and preferences of the royal family?

154
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,930
Do I have to wait until the veil is lifted

155
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,200
in the bridal sedan

156
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,510
to find out who I'm marrying?

157
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,670
It seems

158
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,270
I overthought this.

159
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,060
Regarding the incident at the posthouse,

160
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,210
I have sent people
to investigate it thoroughly.

161
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,130
Except for you

162
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,590
and your maid Linglan,

163
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,350
everyone else

164
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,960
was killed by the bandits,

165
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,170
with no survivors.

166
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,000
But Princess,

167
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,020
why don't you show any grief?

168
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,050
How

169
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,340
should grief be shown?

170
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,320
They were all loyal servants

171
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,120
who accompanied me throughout the journey.

172
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,380
Now that they're dead,

173
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,920
what I can do

174
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,020
is not to wallow in self-pity,

175
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,960
but to seek justice for them.

176
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,580
Prince Yan,

177
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
isn't that right?

178
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,520
But the assassins
weren't some ordinary bandits,

179
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,440
but highly skilled martial artists.

180
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,580
It seems everything

181
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,390
was carefully premeditated.

182
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,540
Premeditated?

183
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,000
Could it be that Princess of Daqing's
death in the previous life

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,460
wasn't an accident at all?

185
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,720
Princess,

186
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,110
have you thought of something?

187
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,340
There was nothing

188
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,920
unusual along the way.

189
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,310
If you have the ability,

190
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,590
you can investigate yourself.

191
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,110
But...

192
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,580
Did you come today

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,130
to interrogate a prisoner?

194
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,170
I'm here to take you to the
Court of Imperial Sacrifices

195
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,310
for registration.

196
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,250
The carriage is ready.

197
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,580
Please, Princess.

198
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,760
Don't touch it.

199
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,170
It hurts.

200
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,470
Mother,

201
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,030
how did you get hurt so badly?

202
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
If you

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,800
hadn't come back,

204
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,480
I'd have been beaten to death.

205
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,610
Every day

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,840
you think about
being with the Crown Prince.

207
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,160
How could you care about my safety?

208
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,360
I went to the mountains to gather herbs.

209
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,490
His Highness was worried about my safety,

210
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,130
so he accompanied me.

211
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,520
His Highness truly cares for you.

212
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,400
You must not disappoint
his sincere feelings.

213
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,000
In my opinion,

214
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,460
you should

215
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,970
get married soon,

216
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
and put my mind at ease.

217
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,180
His Highness truly cares for me.

218
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,210
Does that mean I must marry him?

219
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,540
When His Highness becomes Emperor one day,

220
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,070
he will surely have
thousands of concubines.

221
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,080
I don't want to fight over a man
with a crowd of women.

222
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,870
Foolish!

223
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,880
Mother,

224
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,170
please rest well.

225
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
You're really confused!

226
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,380
So many women are eagerly pursuing

227
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,290
that position of Empress above thousands.

228
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,330
Only you

229
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,640
fail to see its value.

230
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,600
We already had those two,
mother and daughter, at home

231
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,660
who were eyesores.

232
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,300
Now suddenly a Daqing Princess shows up,

233
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,040
and your father takes her side.

234
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,960
He listened to her,

235
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,910
and even punished me.

236
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,450
Yao,

237
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,910
you must put more effort into this.

238
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,630
If you don't try harder,

239
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,060
His Highness will be taken
by someone else.

240
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,050
Someone who can be taken away

241
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,860
isn't truly devoted.

242
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,900
I don't care about that.

243
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
By the way, Mother.

244
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,790
Princess of Daqing has a noble status

245
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,290
and is also Madam Wang's distant relative.

246
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,040
If you keep opposing her,

247
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,310
aren't you just asking for trouble?

248
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
In my opinion,

249
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,900
you shouldn't take
everything so seriously.

250
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,090
Madam.

251
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,360
[Cicada Notebook]

252
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,850
Ruoxi, you're here.

253
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,570
Big Mother,

254
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,940
you wanted to see me?

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,530
Well, Ruoxi,

256
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,170
I have

257
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,720
truly underestimated you.

258
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,950
To save your mother,

259
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,040
you were even willing
to abandon your maternal family.

260
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,880
Did you summon me

261
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,210
just to talk about this?

262
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,040
Of course not.

263
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,720
I'm here to give you

264
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,440
and your mother

265
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,030
a way to survive.

266
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,390
I want that Princess of Daqing

267
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,570
gone from this world.

268
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,780
You want to hire someone to kill her?

269
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,320
What price are you offering?

270
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,850
Have you picked the wrong person?

271
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
What if

272
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,890
it's your mother's life at stake?

273
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,480
I wonder if you think

274
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,730
that's enough.

275
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,650
This poison mixed in tea

276
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,210
has a fragrant aroma

277
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,660
and a lingering taste.

278
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,590
The symptoms of poisoning

279
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,070
resemble tuberculosis.

280
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,920
At best,

281
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,320
she'll be bedridden.

282
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:36,930
At worst,

283
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,420
she won't survive.

284
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,770
You are cousins.

285
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,640
You'll have plenty of opportunities.

286
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,420
Of course,

287
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,550
if you're unwilling,

288
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,650
I certainly won't force you.

289
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,520
It's just

290
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,300
a pity.

291
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,060
Your mother

292
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,850
is already frail,

293
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,920
and now she's been beaten.

294
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,740
Who knows

295
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,060
how many days she has left?

296
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,080
Mother,

297
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,570
I'm well aware of

298
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,680
Madam Cui's wicked intentions.

299
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,440
She simply wants to use me

300
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,100
to poison Princess Fu Wei

301
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,560
to eliminate her threat

302
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,610
and then place all

303
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,970
the blame on me.

304
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,710
Killing two birds with one stone.

305
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,570
Mother.

306
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,060
If anything happens to me,

307
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,170
please don't worry,

308
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,520
and don't blame me.

309
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,100
The current Princess Fu Wei is fake?

310
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,080
Yes.

311
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,340
Master, do you want me to kill her?

312
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,140
No.

313
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,570
Hold your position

314
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,170
and wait for my instructions.

315
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:30,970
Master,

316
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:31,880
I...

317
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,720
It's time now.

318
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,770
Take it.

319
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,020
Thank you, Master.

320
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,280
Xi,

321
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,350
come with me.

322
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,290
What are you doing?

323
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,310
I should be asking you.

324
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,360
What are you going to do?

325
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,020
I'm bringing ginseng tea to Big Mother

326
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,870
to apologize for offending her earlier.

327
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,610
Your Highness, why are you so nervous?

328
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,320
Are you really apologizing to her

329
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,780
or setting a trap yourself

330
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,010
to frame her?

331
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,490
I don't understand what you mean.

332
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,720
You suspect I'm poisoning Big Mother?

333
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,020
You're planning to poison yourself.

334
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,240
You know
with Madam Cui's suspicion of you,

335
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,310
you can't easily poison her.

336
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,370
So you can only poison yourself

337
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
and then frame her for it.

338
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,840
Big Mother...

339
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,280
How cruel of you.

340
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,280
You've poisoned me.

341
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,370
You wretched girl!

342
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,180
How dare you frame Madam!

343
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,810
About this poisoning incident,

344
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,340
let's just forget about it.

345
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,920
Take care of yourself.

346
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,400
Father—

347
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,370
I said,

348
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,060
forget it.

349
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,020
Even if you're willing to risk your life

350
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,340
to drag her down with you,

351
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,030
you should understand that

352
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,860
in this Zhou's Mansion,

353
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,870
no one will protect you

354
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,940
or help you.

355
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,450
Your life

356
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,890
means absolutely nothing.

357
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,960
Even if I know this is
like a moth to a flame,

358
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,850
it's the only plan I could think of.

359
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,780
Your Highness, do you know

360
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,660
this poison

361
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,660
was originally meant for your tea,
on Madam Cui's order?

362
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,790
She wanted to kill you by my hand.

363
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,450
Do you have any

364
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,720
other option besides desperate measures?

365
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,080
Neither of us will die.

366
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,600
Your Highness, what brings you here today?

367
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,120
Mrs. Zhou,

368
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,910
today Xi brought me some new tea.

369
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,290
Since I've been disturbing you
here for so long,

370
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,560
I thought

371
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,270
I'd bring it to you as a small gift.

372
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,579
This tea was brought by Ruoxi?

373
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,740
Yes.

374
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,240
Mrs. Zhou,

375
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,160
please try it.

376
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,670
Alright.

377
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,099
Xi said

378
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,210
this tea

379
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,720
has a wonderful aroma

380
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,310
and a lingering aftertaste.

381
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,040
Please have a taste, Mrs. Zhou.

382
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,600
Recently,

383
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,140
I've been feeling unsettled

384
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,020
and can't sleep

385
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,170
at night.

386
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,520
The doctor said

387
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,650
I shouldn't drink strong tea.

388
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
Can't sleep at night?

389
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,560
Could it be

390
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,930
you've done something unconscionable
to harm someone's life?

391
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,790
I was just joking.

392
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,950
There's no need to be so nervous.

393
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,610
It's just that

394
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,520
this tea

395
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,340
is what I

396
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,460
have bestowed upon you.

397
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,120
So you

398
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,340
must drink it.
