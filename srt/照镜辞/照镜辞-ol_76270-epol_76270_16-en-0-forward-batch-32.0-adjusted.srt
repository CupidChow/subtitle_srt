00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,290
Prince Yan, are you growing roots
at Zhou's Mansion?

3
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,270
Why are you always here?

4
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,400
Ever since you decided
to return to Zhou's Mansion,

5
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,530
I've been restless.

6
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,830
So,

7
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,340
after much consideration,

8
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,550
I had to ask Father

9
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,580
for an imperial decree of marriage.

10
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,120
With you as my future princess consort,

11
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,450
I can protect you fully.

12
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,790
I never expected

13
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,090
to arrive just in time
for this forced marriage drama.

14
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,870
I should have known all along
that Zhou Kui's

15
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,440
sudden move to make me
the Zhou familyâ€™s principal daughter

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,700
couldn't be so simple.

17
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,430
But I didn't expect

18
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,660
he would use this marriage to challenge me

19
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,510
and make me his stepping stone.

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,039
That's perfect then.

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,289
By a twist of fate...

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,480
It worked in my favor.

No matter how much
it was beyond your control,

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,450
you shouldn't have warmed yourself
with others' blood.

In Zhou's Mansion,

there's evidence
of Father's corruption and graft.

It seems Father was the mastermind
behind the loan sharking case.

But Cui Yuan'an came
to assassinate the Crown Prince,

claiming with certainty that he was
behind the loan sharking case.

79

once sent someone
with the Eastern Palace token

to investigate
troop stockpiling in the black market.

After that, the spies
who were sent went missing,

was last seen in the black market.

86

Where is the Crown Princess?

She brought some gifts

and went to pay respects
to the ladies in the inner palace.

It's a marriage bestowed by you, Father.

And it's an alliance
between two countries.

161
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,840
I will certainly treat the Crown Princess

with the utmost care and affection.

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,380
find time to attend our wedding.

175
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,750
Miss Zhou Ruoxi?

176
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,160
Yes.

177
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,840
Wasn't Yan

178
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
in love with Princess Fu Wei before?

179
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,480
Why did he agree
to this marriage so readily?

180
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,670
Marrying Miss Zhou Ruoxi

181
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,250
is Father's decree.

182
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,650
This is my duty as his subject.

183
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,640
Yan.

184
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,200
Yes,

185
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,820
Father.

186
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,920
I previously

187
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,520
arranged for the Princess of Daqing

188
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,240
to marry your brother.

189
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,900
I know you were upset about it.

190
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
But now

191
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,100
you have someone you care for too.

192
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,900
From now on, there should be

193
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,420
no more conflicts
between you brothers over such matters.

194
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,250
Shu.

195
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,370
You must attend

196
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,890
Yan's wedding ceremony

197
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
to add to your brother's happiness.

198
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,740
Rest assured, Father.

199
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,330
I will certainly give Yan

200
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,800
a grand gift.

201
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Linglan?

202
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,230
Here's what His Highness requested.

203
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,510
Our path has been cut off.

204
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,790
We had no choice but to ask for your help.

205
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,880
His Highness?

206
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,700
Fu Wei.

207
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,800
Father has agreed
to attend the wedding ceremony.

208
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
I believe on our wedding day,

209
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,500
it will be extremely lively.

210
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,020
What's the matter?

211
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,180
Is there something wrong?

212
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,380
If there's anything,

213
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,780
you can't hide it from me.

214
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,490
I just can't figure some things out.

215
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,590
What about you?

216
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,280
Are you hiding anything from me?

217
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,190
What could I possibly hide from you?

218
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,320
You know

219
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,780
more than anyone else here.

220
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,880
What's the price of extending life
with the Seven-Star Lamp?

221
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,630
Did you use your own lifespan

222
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,280
to extend mine?

223
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,250
Thank you, Doctor, for extending my life.

224
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,200
There's something I don't understand.

225
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
What is the price of extending life
with the Seven-Star Lamp?

226
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,120
Does it

227
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,000
harm others?

228
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,920
Everything

229
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,120
has its price.

230
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,160
To gain something,

231
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,490
something must be lost.

232
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,310
Is there any way to undo it?

233
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,920
I don't want Prince Yan
to sacrifice for me.

234
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,450
What can I do?

235
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,310
I'm willing to pay any price.

236
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,960
There is no way to reverse it.

237
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,650
Miss,

238
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,780
live in the present

239
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,790
and cherish who you have now.

240
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Fu Wei.

241
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,830
I have something to tell you.

242
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,070
Wonton!

243
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,620
Noodle soup!

244
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,640
Candied haws!

245
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,560
Hya!

246
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,360
Hya!

247
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,540
Where are you taking me?

248
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,460
I've got something new

249
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,970
that I want to show you.

250
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,200
Right here.

251
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,460
Look.

252
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,310
One easily knows
the face of the east wind;

253
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,470
In a thousand shades of purple and red,

254
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,350
all is spring.

255
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,410
Green trees cast deep shade
as summer days grow long;

256
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,330
Pavilions reflect their forms

257
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,360
within the pond.

258
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,960
Maple leaves turn
the mountains crimson bright;

259
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,040
Yellow blossoms

260
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,640
endure the evening breeze.

261
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,640
Who plays the flute
in heaven, none can tell;

262
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,740
Snowflakes drift

263
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,850
and blanket all the world.

264
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,250
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter,

265
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,850
each season holds its charm.

266
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
But without you,

267
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,780
everything loses its luster.

268
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,530
Between us,

269
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,860
let's not speak of debts.

270
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,680
Of all things in this world,

271
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,290
as long as we're together,

272
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,120
that alone

273
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,160
is enough.

274
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,040
Linglan?

275
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,109
She isn't serving the Crown Princess

276
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:00,369
but has come to Zhou's Mansionâ€”what for?

277
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,790
[Pass for the Military Supply Route]

278
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,470
Military Supply Route?

279
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,590
This is what His Highness requested.

280
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,350
What do they need this pass for?

281
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,440
Don't move.

282
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,080
Linglan,

283
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,050
whose side are you really on?

284
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,090
Since you're here,

285
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,890
why not meet me openly,

286
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,960
Princess Fu Wei?
