[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,240
I am your future self,

3
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,700
three years from now.

4
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,750
What nonsense are you talking about?

5
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,280
I know you don't believe me.

6
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,520
That cold winter when you were 7,

7
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,320
the west wing room was freezing.

8
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,400
Mother's old illness
relapsed from the cold.

9
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
You stole coal from Madam Cui's room

10
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,860
and were punished to wash clothes
in the servants' quarters.

11
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,920
The water was bone-chillingly cold,

12
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,650
but you didn't shed a single tear.

13
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,000
When you were 13,
during a banquet at the mansion,

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
you were suddenly inspired

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,400
and recited some poetry.

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,880
Madam Cui accused you
of stealing Ruoyao's spotlight

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,940
and punished you
to copy books for 3 days.

18
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,550
You didn't eat a single grain of rice

19
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,680
and never uttered a word of complaint.

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,830
How do you know all this?

21
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,510
I am you.

22
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,060
I've walked your path.

23
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,630
I know why you staked your life to fight,

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,039
but I also know your ending.

25
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,520
That's why I don't want you

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,740
or us to repeat the same mistakes.

27
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,780
I don't know where you heard all this.

28
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,330
But I

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,560
don't believe you.

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,660
When Zhou's Mansion
was confiscated in the previous life,

31
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,120
the garden rockery
was made of gold and jade.

32
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,120
Coming back in this life,

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000
I didn't see it.

34
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,180
But yesterday,

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,520
I saw it in the garden at Zhou's Mansion.

36
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,900
Gold and jade rockery.

37
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,350
How is it still here?

38
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,660
Mother's death is connected
to the loan sharking case.

39
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,190
Zhou Kui is the real
mastermind behind it all.

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,820
But she was clearly dead at that time.

41
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,440
Father.

42
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,500
You were looking for me?

43
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,240
Xi,

44
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,540
you've been away from home
for so many days.

45
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,500
You must have suffered a lot.

46
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,920
I asked the kitchen

47
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,460
to make some chicken soup for you,

48
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,670
and your favorite

49
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,650
peanut pudding

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,400
and

51
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,540
osmanthus cake.

52
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,140
Thank you for your concern, Father.

53
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,900
But I'm allergic to peanuts.

54
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,579
And I don't eat osmanthus cake either.

55
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,070
You must have forgotten.

56
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,870
My bad.

57
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,420
I must be getting confused.

58
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,050
You're just concerned about me.

59
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,610
You must have been

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,540
exhausted from preparing
for the Princess's wedding.

61
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,850
About what you mentioned earlier,

62
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,340
regarding making me the principal daughter
of the Zhou family,

63
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,670
there's no need to rush.

64
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,930
We can discuss it after you're less busy.

65
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,950
Xi,

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,430
Why do I feel that since you've returned,

67
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,340
you seem different from before?

68
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,740
Father, you must be joking.

69
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,380
How am I different?

70
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,040
When I offered to make you
the Zhou family's principal daughter,

71
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,690
you were in a hurry,

72
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,500
not as composed as you are today.

73
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,829
With your behavior,

74
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,790
I actually think

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,340
you're more like

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,520
the Princess of Daqing.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,220
I was immature before.

78
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,730
Now

79
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,030
it's time to grow up.

80
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,800
I should think of Father

81
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,330
and the Zhou family.

82
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,540
After all, Mother is gone now.

83
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,990
From now on,

84
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,350
you're

85
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,970
my only support.

86
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,900
You're such a good girl.

87
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,790
You just came back.

88
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,530
Get some rest.

89
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,650
I

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,060
have important matters to attend to.

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,950
I'll take my leave.

92
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,130
Go ahead.

93
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,380
It seems

94
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,620
Zhou Kui is already
suspicious of my identity.

95
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,020
I need to act quickly

96
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,850
before things get complicated.

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,310
This mansion isn't
as impenetrable as it seems.

98
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,150
I need to find a chance to escape soon.

99
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,490
Your Highness,

100
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,220
it's time for your medicine.

101
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,730
His Highness instructed me
to take good care of you.

102
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,790
If you're feeling bored,

103
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,710
you can walk around inside the mansion.

104
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,850
I can accompany you.

105
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,480
But as for leaving the mansion,

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,550
don't even think about it.

107
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,640
This is kidnapping and imprisonment!

108
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,550
I won't take the medicine.

109
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,550
Just let me die.

110
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,770
Your Highness can skip

111
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,160
the medicine as you like.

112
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Anyway,

113
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,540
your life has been saved.

114
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,330
As for the remaining poison in your body,

115
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,290
the damage

116
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,440
isn't that serious.

117
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,140
At worst,

118
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,110
you'll just be covered in sores

119
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,990
and your face will be completely ruined.

120
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,170
Don't worry, Your Highness.

121
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,090
When it's safe,

122
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,530
you'll naturally be allowed to leave.

123
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,330
Really?

124
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,290
Yes.

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,410
My Lord!

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,800
What is it?

139
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
The Crown Princess
went to the back garden.

140
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,600
Hurry.

141
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,170
Your Highness,

142
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,140
they're gone.

143

Why are you here?

144
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,390
I was worried you might be in danger.

When Zhou's Mansion was confiscated
in the previous life,

148
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,110
the garden rockery
was made of gold and jade.

149
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,570
It's actually true.

150
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,540
When Madam Cui was alive,

151
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,320
there was no gold and jade rockery
in the mansion.

152

the one who took bribes
was actually Father.

How does Fu Wei know all this?

155
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,240
Could it be

156
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,080
she really came from
three years in the future?

157
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,800
Lord Zhou,

158
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,740
why did you request to see me

159
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,650
so late at night?

160
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,170
Greetings, Your Highness.

161

that you went to the back garden.

163
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,200
I wonder,

164
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,740
did you lose something important?

165
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,660
Since when are my affairs

166
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
any of your business, Lord Zhou?

167
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,060
Your Highness, I certainly

168
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,180
wouldn't dare to interfere.

169

170
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,070
it's my daughter's affairs?

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,150
I've lived long enough

174
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,350
not to be so foolish that I can't

175
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,060
recognize my own daughter.

176
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,730
I just don't understand

177
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,430
why you switched identities

178
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,990
with Princess Fu Wei.

179
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,690
But one thing is certain.

180
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,240
If

181
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,500
you want to secure

182
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,590
your position as the Crown Princess,

183
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,310
you need to cooperate with me.

184
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,470
You don't need to be nervous.

185
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,300
I called you here today

186
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,980
not to expose you,

187
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,450
but to

188
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,150
lend you a helping hand.

189
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,060
After all,

190
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,240
we are the real father and daughter,

191
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,080
sharing honor and disgrace together.

192
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,160
Don't you agree, Xi?

193
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,390
Father,

194
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,770
you're right.

195
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,920
Xi, you're so sensible.

196
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,680
That puts my mind at ease.

197
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,720
Go to the Eastern Palace
with peace of mind

198
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,880
and fulfill your duties
as the Crown Princess.

199
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,940
As for everything else,

200
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,720
I

201
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,500
will naturally take care of it for you.

202
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,560
What do you plan to do?

203
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,720
The Crown Prince has already suspected me.

204
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,130
How should

205
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,390
I deal with him?

206
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,820
Recently, something else happened
at the Crown Prince's Mansion.

207
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,120
I wonder if you know about it, Father.

208
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,790
The youngest son
of the Marquis of Zhenguo, Cui Yuan'an,

209
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,640
broke into the Crown Prince's Mansion,

210
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,100
intending to assassinate the Crown Prince.

211
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,800
He was carrying a token
from the Eastern Palace

212
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,600
accusing the Crown Prince
of masterminding the loan sharking case.

213
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,650
He also claimed

214
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,980
that the Crown Prince made

215
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,730
the Marquis of Zhenguo's family
take the blame,

216
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,460
resulting in their execution.

217
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,360
How would I know about this matter?

218
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,680
Besides,

219
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,860
it has nothing

220
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,690
to do with me at all.

221
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,350
You're right, Father.

222
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,740
Well,

223
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,620
I'll take my leave now.

224
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:38,890
Wait.

225
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,290
As for Fu Wei's matter,

226
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,460
don't concern yourself with it.

227
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,530
I

228
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,730
have my own plans.

229
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,570
Yes.

230
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,680
[Order]

231
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,210
[Order]

232
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,100
It seems Father and the Crown Prince

233
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,420
both have secrets they cannot reveal.

234
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,980
Father, you want to arrange my marriage?

235
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,040
Yes.

236
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,100
I

237
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,310
sympathize with your loneliness.

238
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,530
Therefore,

239
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,470
[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

240
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,440
I've arranged

241
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,240
this marriage for you.

242
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,090
You'll marry the Governor of Yingzhou

243
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,890
as his second wife.

244
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,900
The Governor of Yingzhou's

245
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,820
second wife?

246
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,860
Mm.

247
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,900
Father,

248
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,990
the Governor of Yingzhou is too old.

249
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,540
He already has one foot in the grave.

250
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,170
I won't marry him.

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,740
His age is indeed advanced,

252
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,370
but the Governor of Yingzhou

253
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,730
has considerable influence at court.

254
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,790
Xi,

255
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,150
you're about to become
the principal daughter of the Zhou family.

256
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,630
It's time for you

257
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,250
to contribute to our family.

258
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,850
So you made me
the Zhou family's principal daughter

259
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,250
just to make my sacrifice more meaningful.

260
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,870
How dare you speak like that!

261
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,960
This marriage

262
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,250
is not yours to refuse!

263
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,830
If you're unwilling,

264
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,360
I'll have to go to the palace

265
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,440
and request an imperial decree
from His Majesty.

266
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,970
No need for that, Lord Zhou.

267
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,260
I've already

268
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,900
obtained the decree for you.

269
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,060
[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

270
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,390
Lord Zhou,

271
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,450
I have requested permission from Father

272
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,910
to marry Miss Zhou Ruoxi.

273
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,270
I hope you will grant your approval.
