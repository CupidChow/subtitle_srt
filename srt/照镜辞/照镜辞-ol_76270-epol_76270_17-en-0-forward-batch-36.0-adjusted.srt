[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,330
Linglan

3
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,430
is my trusted henchman

4
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,730
stationed in Daqing.

5
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,230
So,

6
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
from the very beginning,

7
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,120
I knew your identity.

8
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,930
Now that you know my identity,

9
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,520
why didn't you expose me?

10
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
The reason is simple.

11
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,060
I initially thought you could be useful.

12
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,400
But I never expected

13
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,800
you would be so stubborn.

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
You were constantly at odds with me.

15
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,630
I'm very curious about one thing.

16
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,100
Why do you look

17
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,670
so much like Xi?

18
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,120
What exactly are you going to do?

19
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,720
That's none of your concern.

20
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,860
Right now,

21
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,690
you only have two options.

22
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,570
First,

23
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,070
marry Prince Yan

24
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,080
to become his princess consort

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,340
and cooperate with me.

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,140
As for the second option,

27
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,210
you will die in this mansion

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,720
as Miss Zhou Ruoxi.

29
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,920
You did loan sharking to hoard wealth,

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,660
recruited soldiers in the black market,

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,530
took the Military Supply Route permit

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,460
and carried on illicit affairs.

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,200
You're planning a rebellion, right?

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,890
Though you've figured it out,
what can you do?

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,180
Madam Cui, the mastermind behind
the loan-sharking case,

36
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,400
has already been executed.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,640
Stockpiling weapons

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,500
and plotting rebellion

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,100
are just rumors.

40
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,510
I'd like to advise you'

41
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,850
to consider your current situation.

42
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,380
If

43
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,300
you don't cooperate with me,

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,460
do you think

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,370
you can leave here alive?

46
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,500
What an evil Minister of Rites!

47
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,550
What a crazy person you are, Lord Zhou!

48
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,180
Go to hell!

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,120
Let's go!

50
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,880
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

51
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,030
Your Highness!

52
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,010
Your Highness!

53
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,570
How did she get injured like this?

54
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,970
It was Zhou Kui.

55
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,580
He's working for Daqing.

56
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,820
Just now,

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,720
I found

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,250
the Military Supply Route permit
in his room.

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,260
I suspect he wants to transport weapons

60
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,590
into the Imperial City.

61
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,190
Liang Feng,

62
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,320
raid Zhou's Mansion!

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,640
Yes.

64
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,480
Wait.

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,860
He has already known my identity.

66
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,520
He'll definitely destroy the evidence.

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,930
The raid would be meaningless.

68
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,890
Alright.

69
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,960
Have a rest first.

70
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,810
We'll discuss

71
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,010
those matters later.

72
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,760
Your Highness.

73
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,850
Put me down.

74
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,579
It's not good if others see us.

75
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,360
Others?

76
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,970
There's no one here.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,720
Liang Feng.

78
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,150
Do you see anyone?

79
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,800
No. No.

80
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
There's nobody.

81
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,730
I'll find a doctor.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,910
Luckily, after the doctor checked on you,

83
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,040
he said you are not seriously injured.

84
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,070
You're awake.

85
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,250
Where else does it hurt?

86
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,940
I need to stay alive

87
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
to marry you.

88
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,850
I'll be fine.

89
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,490
Let me help you up.

90
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,470
Now that you've already noticed

91
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,730
the danger yesterday,

92
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,260
why did you still put yourself at risk

93
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,990
without telling me in advance?

94
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:17,659
Yesterday,

95
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,700
in the palace,
I saw Linglan with a secret letter.

96
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,680
I wasn't sure about
the content of the letter,

97
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
and I didn't know

98
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,590
who Linglan is working for.

99
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,480
So, I wanted to find evidence
as soon as possible.

100
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,560
Find evidence?

101
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,480
I won't do this again.

102
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,970
You...

103
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Earlier,

104
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,000
I found a secret letter

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,460
from the Crown Prince to Zhou Kui
in his room.

106
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,920
The letter instructed

107
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
Zhou Kui

108
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,940
to find the missing spies.

109
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,600
As for the matter of those spies,

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,460
I've known about it for some time.

111
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,010
When the Princess of Daqing
came for the royal marriage,

112
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,880
Shu learned that

113
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
spies from Daqing had infiltrated
the Imperial City.

114
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,560
So he specifically sent a team
to investigate.

115
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,360
But for some reason,

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,880
those spies

117
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,130
have gone missing.

118
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,930
And the tokens they carried

119
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:17,020
have coincidentally appeared
in the black market.

120
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,870
All the clues we have now

121
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,080
point to the Eastern Palace.

122
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,670
Crown Prince Shu and Zhou Kui

123
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,480
might have been in collusion
for a long time.

124
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,680
As you said,

125
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,340
the evidence is solid.

126
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,840
However,

127
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,360
if you think about this carefully,

128
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,690
you'll find
it doesn't benefit Shu at all.

129
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,330
Since we have different opinions,

130
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,540
why don't we

131
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,440
ask Crown Prince Shu
to clarify this matter?

132
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,450
Then I'll go to
the Crown Prince's Mansion

133
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,680
and ask Shu to come discuss this.

134
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,240
Wait.

135
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,110
Zhou Kui has already known my identity.

136
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,080
And we don't know the situation

137
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,810
in the Crown Prince's Mansion.

138
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,290
Besides,

139
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,040
because of the matter of
the Princess of Daqing before,

140
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,640
you and the Crown Prince
have had a falling out.

141
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,150
I'm afraid he won't come.

142
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,180
It's not entirely impossible.

143
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,020
Your Highness.

144
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,250
Someone just delivered a message.

145
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,270
If you learn the whereabouts of
the Princess of Daqing,

146
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,070
go to the forest outside the city

147
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,420
at 9 o'clock tonight.

148
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,260
The Princess of Daqing?

149
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,730
Isn't she with Yan?

150
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:45,950
Hya!

151
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,090
Whoa!

152
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,050
Who's there?

153
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,030
Your Highness?

154
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,520
Your Highness?

155
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,120
Where has His Highness gone?

156
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,880
His Highness is missing!

157
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,600
Split up and search!

158
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,080
Yes!

159
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,560
Yes!

160
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:08,800
Yes!

161
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,330
Let's go!

162
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:09,840
This way!

163
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,820
Your Highness!

164
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,400
How dare you!

165
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,430
Do you know who I am?

166
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,320
How dare you tie me up?

167
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,409
Untie me!

168
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,760
Untie me!

169
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,060
Let me go!

170
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,250
Hurry up!

171
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,920
You little brat!

172
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,700
You're still laughing?

173
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,790
How dare you tie me up?

174
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,210
Untie me now!

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Untie me!

176
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:41,760
Shu.

177
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,400
Well,

178
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,390
promise me first that

179
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,320
after I untie you,

180
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,640
you should talk with me in peace.

181
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,910
Hurry up!

182
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,190
Hurry up!

183
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,850
You little brat!

184
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,690
Come here!

185
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,750
Come here!

186
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,120
Hurry up!

187
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,060
You little brat!

188
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,470
I'll execute your entire clan!

189
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,590
Your Highness,

190
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,760
you are also a member of

191
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,960
his clan.

192
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,280
Zhou Ruoxi?

193
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,309
It's really you.

194
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,530
You've bewitched Yan

195
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,800
and made him commit

196
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,240
such a disrespectful act!

197
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,570
What are you going to do?

198
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,700
You are planning a rebellion,

199
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,220
huh?

200
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,210
You're stupid!

201
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,850
How dare she insult me?

202
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,640
So what?

203
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,910
Even if you inherit the throne,

204
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,700
you

205
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,690
will only let sycophants rule.

206
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,490
You're just a terrible ruler

207
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,020
who will be easily deceived
and manipulated!

208
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,670
She's slandering me!

209
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,000
How dare you slander me!

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,800
Shu.

211
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,320
You're stopping me, huh?

212
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,640
Shu.

213
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,560
Why are you just standing there?

214
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,280
Shu.

215
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,570
Are you letting her continue to
speak such filth?

216
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,940
You are a fool!

217
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,070
Why are you insulting him?

218
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,930
If you've got the guts, come at me!

219
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,000
Let me go!

220
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,560
-Let me go!
-Shu!

221
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,120
Let me go!

222
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,880
Shu!

223
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,590
I brought you here today

224
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,420
because we truly have important matters
to discuss.

225
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
The Eastern Palace is full of spies.

226
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,000
Your Highness.

227
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,650
Your Highness.

228
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,920
We just wanted you to slip away unnoticed

229
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,180
and avoid prying eyes.

230
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,730
We wanted to find a safe place
to discuss important issues.

231
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,280
Even though there are important matters,

232
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,340
you shouldn't have been so reckless.

233
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,340
We've already known that

234
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,050
behind the loan-sharking case,

235
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,840
someone is seeking personal gain

236
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,720
to forge weapons

237
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,410
with the intention of rebellion.

238
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,900
Your Highness, who do you think

239
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,320
is behind this case

240
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,810
and what is their purpose?

241
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,020
Why is this in your hand?

242
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,810
Your Highness, you don't need
to ask too much.

243
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,940
You only need to know

244
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,200
that this token was last seen

245
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,350
in the black market.

246
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,750
It was used to trade weapons
and arms and ordnance.

247
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,000
You mean

248
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,890
someone wants to place the blame

249
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,790
on me, right?

250
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,260
Who is this person?

251
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,600
This pattern

252
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,140
was traced from Zhou Kui's jade pendant.

253
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,430
According to the Princess of Daqing,

254
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,350
this belongs to the Daqing royal family.

255
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,590
Zhou Kui is a henchman of
the Daqing royal family?

256
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,920
He wants to use me

257
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,830
to commit treason.

258
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,780
I found

259
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,770
the Military Supply Route permit
in Zhou Kui's study.

260
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,770
We suspect

261
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,140
he wants to use the Military Supply Route

262
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,670
to transport weapons
into the Imperial City.

263
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
Zhou Kui is cunning.

264
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,520
I'll go arrest him right now.

265
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,320
Wait.

266
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,450
To catch a thief, we need evidence.

267
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,610
All of this is just our speculation.

268
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,040
I urge Your Highness

269
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,190
not to act rashly,

270
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,970
lest we alert our target.

271
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,160
How do you want me

272
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,360
to cooperate with you two?

273
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,160
Set a trap for him.

274
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,980
Let him expose his own weakness.

275
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,530
You're not Zhou Ruoxi, are you?

276
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,160
You've finally vented your revenge.

277
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,280
I was really

278
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,400
worried.

279
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,320
I was afraid your loose talk

280
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
would offend Shu.

281
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,540
Then,

282
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,820
you may get in trouble.

283
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,730
Then why didn't you stop me?

284
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,760
You just let me

285
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,920
speak freely

286
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,540
and insult the Crown Prince.

287
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,110
I love seeing you

288
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,800
speak freely

289
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,720
and settle scores so boldly.

290
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,840
Fu Wei.

291
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,160
When frustrations are bottled
up for too long,

292
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,290
vent your pent-up feelings

293
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,270
is the only way

294
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,630
to relieve yourself.

295
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,720
Aren't you worried that I might
take your brother's life?

296
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,530
You won't.

297
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,230
Because you know

298
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,610
Shu

299
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,560
is merely being deceived and used.

300
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,380
He's certainly not the real culprit.

301
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,310
And the person you want to deal with

302
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,200
isn't him.

303
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,150
Even though His Highness has agreed to
cooperate with us now,

304
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,910
we still

305
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,770
haven't found

306
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,620
any evidence of Zhou Kui's loan sharking

307
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,220
and stockpiling weapons
in the Imperial City.

308
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,850
We don't know his next move either.

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,120
We're exposed

310
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,410
while he operates in the shadows.

311
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,980
I'm worried...

312
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,130
I'm here with you.

313
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,180
No matter what will happen,

314
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,930
I will always be with you.

315
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,430
May I find someone
who loves me wholeheartedly

316
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,890
and stays with me forever.

317
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Yan.

318
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,160
You're truly braver

319
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,990
and more fortunate than me,'

320
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,840
Your Highness!

321
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,790
Something terrible has happened!

322
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,190
His Highness is missing!

323
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,390
Missing?

324
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,580
What do you mean?

325
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,060
Well,

326
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,450
I don't know how it happened.

327
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,920
After he left the city,

328
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,550
he vanished without a trace.

329
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,360
Perhaps we should report this to Lord Zhou

330
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,290
to prepare for all contingencies.

331
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,140
No need.

332
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,940
His Highness's disappearance

333
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,340
concerns the stability of Yunrui's court.

334
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,840
It must not be leaked.

335
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,940
His Highness's disappearance
is very suspicious.

336
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,290
If he were captured by
Prince Yan's men,

337
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,030
the consequences would be terrible.

338
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,110
Perhaps we should inform Lord Zhou,

339
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,190
in case later on...

340
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,660
I said it's not necessary.

341
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,740
I am your master.

342
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,560
Whose orders should you follow?

343
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,420
Please calm down, Your Highness.

344
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,140
Forget it.

345
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,040
Send all our people out

346
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,220
to secretly search
for His Highness's whereabouts.

347
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,260
