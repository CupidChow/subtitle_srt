[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,240
Your Highness.

3
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,040
I told you I'm a good person.

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,160
What are you doing?

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,400
It's an emergency.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Once we get to where we need to go,

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,560
someone will explain everything to you.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,120
You only need to know that

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,450
I'm here to protect you.

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,750
Let's be clear.

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,880
Do not bite me again!

12
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,630
Okay.

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,230
Help!

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,860
Someone's kidnapping me!

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,330
Help!

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,039
Are they

17
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,840
the people you wanted me to meet?

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,210
They're from the Eastern Palace?

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,550
Hand over the princess quietly

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,850
and I'll grant you an intact corpse.

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,510
Take the princess away first!

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,200
Protect the princess!

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,330
Move quickly!

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,600
Let's go!

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,470
After them!

26
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,750
Don't let them escape!

27

Your Highness!

28
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,600
Your Highness, hurry up and go!

Whoa!

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,840
Surround them!

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,180
It seems Your Highness
is determined to kill us.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,320
You're the real Princess of Daqing, right?

35
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,230
Take them all away!

36
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,250
Your Highness!

37
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,720
I am Prince Yan's lieutenant.

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,440
I cannot obey

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,970
Crown Prince Shu's orders.

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,160
Liang Feng.

41
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,240
Who gave you the courage to defy me?

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,580
I did.

43
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,650
Shu.

44
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,480
Military orders supersede all else.

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,280
You know that.

46
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,550
Yan,

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,390
you arrived quite quickly.

48
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,430
So this means

49
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,350
she is the real Princess of Daqing, right?

50
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,920
Isn't the Princess of Daqing
at your residence?

51
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,960
This woman

52
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,630
is merely a witness to the robbery
at the Princess of Daqing's posthouse.

53
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,960
If she's just a witness,

54
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,360
it makes no difference
whether you take her away

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,280
or I do.

56
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,140
But I am in charge of this case.

57
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,000
So, there's no need to bother you,

58
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,079
lest Father hold me accountable.

59
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,040
Besides,

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,680
many things

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,050
are not what they appear to be.

62
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,150
Shu, if you want to know the truth,

63
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,310
there's no rush.

64
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,490
What if I say no?

65
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,370
What if I insist on keeping her?

66
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,700
Then, I have no choice but

67
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,720
to follow official protocol.

68
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,000
How dare you, Li Yan!

70
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,390
If I forcibly take her today,

71
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,170
things might become difficult to resolve.

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,130
Everyone, stand aside.

73
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,340
Let them go.

75
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,500
Withdraw!

78

to keep

80
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,480
this jade pendant well.

81
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,610
At a critical moment,

82
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,250
maybe

83
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,220
it can save your life.

84
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,960
What's so special about it?

85
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,550
I feel like

86
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,080
I've seen the pattern somewhere before.

87
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,960
What was Mother trying to tell me?

88
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,560
This is
the peace-making marriage document.

[Yunrui-Daqing Peace-Making

There are official seals of both kingdoms
on the document.

91
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,480
But something seems different.

92
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,230
What exactly is different?

93
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,920

Lieutenant Liang.

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,800
What happened?

97
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,290
Your Highness was wounded
by a poisoned arrow.

The doctor is treating her now.

99

How was she injured?

100
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,320
I was ordered by His Highness
to escort the princess back.

101
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,020
But unexpectedly,

102
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,790
we were ambushed by men
of the Crown Prince.

103

The Crown Prince?

104
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,680
Be ambushed?

105
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,010
There are many suspicious points
in this matter.

106
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,930
Liang Feng.

107
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,950
You may leave now.

108
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,230
Your Highness,

109
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,420
I've finished the treatment.

110
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,460
She is conscious

111
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,790
but still very weak.

112
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,320
You may go.

113
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,159
Yes.

114
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
I'll go in and see her.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,080
It's you.

116
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,240
Finally we met,

117
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,440
Princess Fu Wei of Daqing.

118
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,280
I never thought I would see you again.

119
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,490
I made you my stand-in

120
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,650
just because I didn't want
to lose my freedom.

121
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,460
It was a desperate situation.

122
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,990
So, I resorted to this plan.

123
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,720
You didn't want to lose your freedom,

124
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,330
so you thought it was acceptable for me
to die in your place, huh?

125
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,840
About the attack at the posthouse,

126
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,440
I knew it afterward.

127
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
I can promise you that

128
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,030
I had nothing to do with it.

129
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,230
Your jade pendant isâ€¦

130
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,170
This is the royal jade pendant of Daqing.

131
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,710
You mean

132
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,420
the Daqing royal jade pendant
the princess wears

133
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,980
is the same as Madam Wang's?

134
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,790
When I was young,

135
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,270
I saw

136
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,770
the jade pendant on Zhou Kui.

137
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,390
Before my mother died,
she gave me this pendant,

138
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,720
saying it could save me.

139
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,610
What exactly

140
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,370
is the connection between the two things?

141
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,590
Could Zhou Kui

142
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,300
have connections
with the Daqing royal family?

143
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,280
I'm not sure.

144
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,530
But he has served as Minister of Rites
for many years.

145
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,390
He must know many inside stories.

146
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,060
Besides this matter,

147
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,370
there's something else I don't understand.

148
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,670
Why did Crown Prince Shu

149
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,670
want to kill the Princess of Daqing?

150
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,250
What connection is there between them?

151
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,640
The assassins who pursued the princess

152
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,620
carried

153
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,340
tokens of the Eastern Palace.

154
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,250
But

155
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,320
they might not be Shu's men.

156
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,210
Why do you trust him so much?

157
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,160
Then why must you suspect him?

158
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,410
Because I know who he is now

159
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,080
and what a person he will become.

160
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,140
I know how he will ascend to the throne

161
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,650
and what he will do after that.

162
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,760
I also know that one day,

163
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,360
we will be killed by him.

164
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,850
I know it's hard for you

165
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,370
to accept it right now.

166
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,200
But people's minds are unpredictable.

167
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,360
Many things

168
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,250
are destined to happen.

169
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,310
They are destined to happen

170
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,800
but haven't happened yet.

171
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
Isn't that right?

172
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,320
Fu Wei.

173
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,760
I believe in reincarnation

174
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,610
and karma.

175
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,330
Since you've returned before the end,

176
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,690
it proves that

177
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,280
everything here

178
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,470
and every person here

179
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,670
has a chance to be changed and redeemed.

180
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,260
You want to save Miss Ruoxi

181
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,460
and yourself

182
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,900
because you believe everything here

183
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,910
can be changed.

184
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,810
I believe in you.

185
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,330
I also believe in Shu.

186
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,120
I believe in the person I remember.

187
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,280
Life and death

188
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,720
are mutual causation.

189
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,640
Perhaps I shouldn't use memories
from the past life

190
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,210
to prematurely judge

191
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,810
others.

192
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,200
I need to return to Zhou's Mansion.

193
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,280
Do you want to go back as Zhou Ruoxi?

194
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,900
We have to investigate
the loan-sharking conspiracy,

195
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,310
the truth behind the assassination
on the Princess of Daqing,

196
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,310
and whether Zhou Kui
and Crown Prince Shu are involved

197
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,170
from the source.

198
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,500
But do you have to go back?

199
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,630
There might be another way.

200
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,610
I have no choice.

201
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,200
Fu Wei.

202
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,640
Yan.

203
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,280
Wait for me.

204
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,610
Here you are.

205
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,250
Take this.

206
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,420
Since you're going back,

207
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,600
take this with you.

208
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,660
At least

209
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,140
you can have something to
protect yourself.

210
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,400
This is for you.

211
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,210
While I'm away,

212
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,960
you can use it to protect yourself.

213
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,880
I've improved

214
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,010
this crossbow's power

215
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,110
and firing speed.

216
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,840
Try it.

217
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,660
Aim at one spot.

218
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,590
Got it?

219
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,380
Yes.

220
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,120
Your crossbow skills in the past life

221
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,720
was also taught by me, right?

222
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,840
Yes.

223
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,610
Stay safe.

224
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,080
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

225
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,320
The real princess was taken away by Yan.

226
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,360
All leads have gone cold.

227
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,110
A month ago,

228
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,040
during peace marriage negotiations
between Daqing and Yunrui,

229
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,850
[Order]

230
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,690
some disguised Daqing rebels infiltrated
the merchant convoy

231
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,370
and entered Yunrui.

232
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,250
I sent spies to investigate.

233
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,980
Eventually,

234
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,610
I received information about their troop
gathering and smuggling operations.

235
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,140
[Smuggling weapons and money]

236
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,280
However, my spies disappeared.

237
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,510
The Eastern Palace tokens

238
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,510
have also vanished without a trace.

239
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
All of this is because of Daqing.

240
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,720
Now the real princess

241
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,340
is with Yan.

242
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,340
I have no choice but
to use this fake one now.

243

[The princess was shot by a poisoned arrow
and may die soon.]

244

[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

246

Father.

251
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,270
Where have you been these days?

252
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,090
Since my mother passed away,

253
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,940
I've been restless every day.

254
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,620
I wanted to pray for Mother at the temple.

255
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,840
It was wrong of me

256
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,590
for not telling you in advance.

257
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,280
Praying?

258
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,500
Why were you gone for so long?

259
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,000
After I left the temple,

260
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,310
I found the road was washed out by floods.

261
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,710
I searched for a long time

262
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,340
and walked for many days
before I could return.

263

Yes.

268
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,260
Crown Prince Shu has ordered

269
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,650
to lift the Crown Princess's confinement.

270

-Yes.
-Yes.

What is the Crown Prince planning now?

Your Highness.

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,900
The Crown Prince has lifted
your confinement.

276

Has something happened?

You mean at the Crown Prince's residence?

278
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,610
Nothing special happened.

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:51,730
However,

280
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,160
Lady Ruoxi has returned.

281
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,710
Who?

Wasn't she killed by me?

Why is she still alive?

289
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,810
I'm not dead.

290
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,030
You must be disappointed, right?

291
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,750
So what if you're still alive?

292
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,330
Now,

293
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,770
I am the Princess of Daqing.

294
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,600
I am the Crown Princess of Yunrui.

But you

are nothing but a concubine's daughter
of the Zhou family.

297

I won't fight you
for the position of Crown Princess.

301

Because I'm not
the Princess of Daqing at all.

Then who exactly are you?
