00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,570
Zhou Ruoxi!

178
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,880
This is your last chance.

179
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,050
Don't force my hand.

180
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,080
I've struggled so hard

181
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,260
to get where I am.

182
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,260
I am the Empress of Yunrui.

183
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,970
I will

184
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,900
not leave.

185
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,090
Prince Yan, if you

186
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,750
cannot bear to kill me...

187
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,560
Then go.

188
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,600
Xi, don't blame me.

189
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,040
Only if the evil empress dies

190
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,970
can Zhou Ruoxi live.

191
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,530
How did we end up like this?

192
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,540
Have you truly forgotten

193
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,780
all those memories we shared?

194
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,420
Prince Yan, you accepted my sachet,

195
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,080
which means we're betrothed.

196
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,690
To avenge my mother,

197
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,650
I can only rely on
the Crown Prince's power.

198
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,370
Prince Yan,

199
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,850
you cannot give me these.

200
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,410
Don't move.

201
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,620
Why did you save me?

202
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,270
I told you I wouldn't leave.

203
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,440
I am the Empress of Yunrui.

204
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,490
I will wait here
for His Majesty to return.

205
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,320
The Empress of Yunrui

206
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,540
is there.

207
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,530
Li Yan.

208
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,900
What are you going to do?

209
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:08,970
Zhou Ruoxi.

210
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,800
You should thank me.

211
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,560
I arranged for a death row prisoner
to take your place.

212
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,860
Otherwise,

213
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,590
at today's execution by fire,

214
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,990
you would be the one dying.

215
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,870
No!

216
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,840
It's not like that.

217
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,480
It's not like that.

218
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,380
It's not like that.

219
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,100
Don't move.

220
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,330
You need to witness
your fate with your own eyes.

221
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
Execute the evil empress!

222
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,680
Safeguard peace!

223
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,930
Execute the evil empress!

224
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,290
Safeguard peace!

225
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,800
Execute the evil empress!

226
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,340
Safeguard peace!

227
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,750
Execute the evil empress!

228
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,110
Safeguard peace!

229
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,620
Execute the evil empress!

230
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,160
Safeguard peace!

231
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,330
Whoa!

232
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,180
Who goes there?

233
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,800
[Qingzhou]

234
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,980
Yan!

235
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,900
What a coincidence.

236
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,490
You've done great service
in defense of the throne.

237
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,950
Why not wait
for your reward before leaving?

238
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Brother, I heard that you've been

239
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,220
suffering from a long illness

240
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,340
and couldn't even leave your bed.

241
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,210
And then you vanished without a trace.

242
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,300
But now it seems

243
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,700
that was just a false rumor.

244
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,750
Your Majesty!

245
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,450
[Qingzhou]

246
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,260
Your Majesty!

247
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,590
Your Majesty!

248
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,190
You've finally come.

249
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,440
I...

250
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,910
The evil Empress Zhou

251
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,090
was burned at the stake
at the Meridian Gate last night.

252
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,810
Yan.

253
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,200
Why is she still alive?

254
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,120
Your Majesty.

255
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,250
Zhou Ruoxi's crimes are unforgivable.

256
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,730
But everything she did

257
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,790
was for the sake of Yunrui.

258
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,210
I beg you to spare her life.

259
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,630
I nurtured her ambition bit by bit,

260
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,960
all for this day.

261
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,610
Yet you ask me to spare her?

262
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,570
Your Majesty.

263
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,290
You want to kill me?

264
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,710
Zhou Ruoxi.

265
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,210
You caused
your elder sister Ruoyao's death.

266
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,880
You killed the woman I loved most.

267
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,800
Should I not kill you?

268
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,520
Yan.

269
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,360
Kill her now,

270
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,000
and your merit in serving the throne

271
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,440
shall remain.

272
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
I cannot

273
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,620
obey this order.

274
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,200
Fine.

275
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,970
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

276
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,550
Liang Feng!

277
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,000
Prince Yan!

278
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,220
Yan!

279
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,870
Yan!

280
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,570
Xi.

281
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
It's been so long

282
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,570
since you called me that.

283
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,070
If you care for him so deeply,

284
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,510
why didn't you marry him back then?

285
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,340
What are you laughing at?

286
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,920
I laugh at how pitiful Your Majesty is.

287
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,810
You kept claiming
how much you loved my sister,

288
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,780
but when her face was disfigured,

289
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,470
you didn't dare
to propose to her immediately.

290
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,400
That's how I got the position.

291
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,440
Li Shu,

292
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,920
what you love

293
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,650
and what you care about

294
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,010
from beginning to end

295
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,790
has only been yourself.

296
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,460
What right do you have to accuse me?

297
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,760
Isn't everything happening now

298
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,120
your own doing?

299
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,960
Yes,

300
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,190
but wasn't everything that led me here

301
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,440
part of Your Majesty's plan?

302
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,560
Your Majesty used me
to eliminate the aristocratic clans,

303
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,820
made me the target of everyone's hatred,

304
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,370
then used
the aristocratic clans' vengeance

305
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,900
to kill me.

306
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,390
After my execution,

307
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,440
Your Majesty will take over a clean court.

308
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,640
Shut up!

309
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,830
Yan,

310
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,630
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,140
Xi.

312
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,380
I've kept it all this time.

313
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,100
I got you into this.

314
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,120
If there's a next life,

315
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,760
please don't

316
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,890
meet me again.

317
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,840
I willingly

318
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,630
accept

319
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
this fate.

320
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,240
In my entire life,

321
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,570
I've schemed and plotted,

322
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,770
only to end up like this.

323
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,600
It's unbearable to accept.

324
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,230
When clouds drift to the open wild,

325
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,050
dreams turn dark and deep.

326
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,920
A mournful wind stirs the pale mist,

327
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,150
entombing the fragrance of blossoms
throughout the city.

328
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,060
When clouds drift to the open wild,

329
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,860
dreams turn dark and deep.

330
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,780
A mournful wind stirs the pale mist,

331
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,320
entombing the fragrance of blossoms
throughout the city.

332
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,250
When clouds drift to the open wild,

333
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,760
dreams turn dark and deep.

334
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,600
A mournful wind stirs the pale mist,

335
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,860
entombing the fragrance of blossoms
throughout the city.

336
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,780
Miss Ruoxi.

337
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,490
Yan.

338
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,620
Miss Ruoxi.

339
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,570
Prince Yan.

340
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,120
She is Zhou Ruoxi?

341
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,440
Then who am I?
