Mrs. Zhou,

3
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,680
this tea is what I've granted to you.

4
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,570
Mrs. Zhou,

5
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,810
you must drink it.

6
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,210
I really

7
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,280
cannot drink it.

8
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,180
Why are you so resistant, Mrs. Zhou?

9
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,710
Could there be something wrong
with this tea?

10
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,920
This does not make sense.

11

If there is something wrong with this tea,

12
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,190
how would you know about it, Mrs. Zhou?

13
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,300
No...

14
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,060
There's nothing wrong with it.

15
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,390
How could there be?

16
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,820
Is there really nothing wrong with it?

17
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,200
Would it cause something like

18
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,400
tuberculosis,

19
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,890
which might make a person bedridden?

20
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,950
The poisoning symptoms

21
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,440
are like those of tuberculosis.

In mild cases,

a person may become bedridden.

25

may even die.

from Daqing Wolf Camp.

Your Highness, you're finally awake.

You've been unconscious for so long.

Where is Madam Wang?

How is she?

Madam Wang...

212
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,400
Madam Wang has passed away.

How could this happen?

217
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,630
It was that bowl of medicine.

218
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Someone must have put poison
in that bowl of medicine.

219
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,120
Lord Zhou has already sent people
to investigate it.

220
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,220
They said
there was nothing wrong with the medicine.

221
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,420
The doctor said

222
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,000
Madam Wang had been ill
from years of overwork,

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,080
and after being flogged,

224
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,720
she failed to survive.

Your Highness!

228
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,550
This substitute
not only resembles Miss Zhou Ruoxi,

229
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,650
but she's also heartbroken
about Madam Wang's death.

230
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,930
Why is that?

231
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,760
Why?

232
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,630
Why was the ending still the same

233
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,080
after I came back to this life?

234
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,340
I couldn't save

235
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,510
those who I wanted to save.

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,050
I couldn't keep

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,910
those who I wanted to keep.

238
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,060
Why did Heaven let me come back?

239
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,960
This is just a joke.

240
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,210
A joke.

241
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,840
Princess,

242
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,910
you're drunk.

243
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,510
Since you're here,

244
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,820
why don't you have a drink with me?

245
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,320
Let me tell you a story.

246
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
Once upon a time,

247
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,130
there was a person
who was alone and helpless.

248
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,520
Even her closest one was killed, too.

249
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,930
She wanted to take revenge,

250
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,610
but she didn't have such ability.

251
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,670
She could only take advantage of others.

252
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
She thought
after she gained a high status,

253
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,960
everything would be different.

254
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,740
But in the end,
she still caused her own death.

255
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,990
She also caused the death
of the only person who cared about her.

256
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,320
She was not willing to accept this ending.

257
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,170
Fortunately, Heaven pitied her

258
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,560
and gave her a chance to start over.

259
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,920
But she still messed things up.

260
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,860
She was so useless.

261
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,580
Nothing was changed in the end.

262
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,070
No.

263
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,000
It was worse than before.

264
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,740
It was more tragic than before.

265
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
It was...

266
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,570
It was more tragic than before.

267
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,920
Princess.

268
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,850
Gains, losses, glory and failure
are all determined by Heaven.

269
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,120
What we can do as humans

270
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,420
is to do our best
and strive for what we want.

271
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,040
I believe

272
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,270
you're not someone
who would give up easily.

273
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,750
Isn't that right?

274
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,910
Yes, that's right.

275
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,930
I shouldn't give up so easily.

You formed a connection‌
