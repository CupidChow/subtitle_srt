1
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,900
[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,140
Prince Yan, to have earned your affection

3
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,410
is my fortune.

4
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,120
But we are ultimately
not meant to be together.

5
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,940
We shall never meet again in this life.

6
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,310
This dream

7
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,950
is becoming clearer.

8
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,020
At the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival
of my past life,

9
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,280
death-sworn assassins
came to avenge Princess of Daqing.

10
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,390
But now

11
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,940
the Princess is alive,

12
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,420
so the assassination attempt
shouldn't happen again, right?

13
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,660
And she

14
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,010
won't appear here either.

15
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,630
No matter what method you use,

16
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,510
today

17
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,639
don't let Zhou Ruoxi leave the house.

18
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,800
Yes.

19
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,160
Thank you, Sir.

20
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,140
Let's go.

21
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,980
What a coincidence.

22
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,020
Princess,

23
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,800
are you enjoying
the lantern carnival alone?

24
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,000
How could I be alone?

25
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,050
Haven't you been with me all along?

26
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,840
Princess, there's no need to avoid me.

27
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,370
About what I said last time,

28
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,490
you don't need to respond right away.

29
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,290
I told you

30
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,030
I would wait for you.

31
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,840
The day of the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival

32
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,500
is Yunrui's most festive day.

33
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,880
Indeed.

34
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,700
It's Mid-Autumn Festival.

35
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,080
Princess, you seem troubled.

36
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,360
How is the moonlight

37
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,159
tonight?

38
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,150
Quite beautiful.

39
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,390
I'm reminded of someone from my past.

40
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,480
The moon in the sky is full,

41
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,610
yet in the human world
it stands at mid-month.

42
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,740
There are always many regrets in life.

43
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,720
The changes
and imperfections of this world

44
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,510
are all part of the natural order.

45
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,550
But Princess,

46
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,800
you shouldn't
cling to the regrets of the waning moon...

47
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,120
While neglecting the joy of the full moon.

48
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,320
Yan.

49
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,700
Shu.

50
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,010
Miss Ruoyao.

51
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,840
What a coincidence.

52
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,040
You're both here too.

53
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,750
Princess, it seems you

54
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,950
and Yan

55
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,440
share quite a connection.

56
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,070
In just a few days,

57
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,200
you've become so familiar with each other.

58
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,990
Prince Yan protects the Imperial City.

59
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,630
Since I arrived in Yunrui,

60
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
he has been protecting me all along.

61
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,400
So my closeness to him
is not without cause.

62
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,130
It's not exactly a connection.

63
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,780
If we're talking about true connection,

64
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,200
in this vast lantern market,

65
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
with crowds everywhere,

66
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,650
that I could meet
you and Miss Ruoyao here

67
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,890
is what I'd call true connection.

68
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,260
Come one,

69
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,640
come all!

70
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,010
Step right up and take a look!

71
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,610
Let's go take a look.

72
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,840
Given

73
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
today's circumstances,

74
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,470
it seems unlikely
that any assassins will appear.

75
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,700
Shu and Miss Ruoyao

76
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,860
are childhood sweethearts,

77
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,060
truly enviable.

78
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,610
As the Crown Prince,

79
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,260
Shu is one
whom countless women yearn for.

80
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,730
Indeed,

81
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,290
he is the best choice
for the peace-making marriage.

82
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,330
But Shu said

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,060
that if Miss Ruoyao

84
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,400
wished to travel,

85
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,280
he

86
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,170
would always wait for her.

87
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
So...

88
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,170
-Princess...
-Princess Yan, you don't think...

89
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,630
I have feelings for Crown Prince Shu,
do you?

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,320
This peace-making marriage
is simply a duty I must fulfill.

91
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,120
Besides, the princes of Yunrui

92
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,040
aren't like merchandise at this stall

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,640
for me to freely choose from.

94
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,780
I have no interest
in what everyone else is fighting over.

95
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,500
After all,

96
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,950
even outside a latrine

97
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,820
you'll find crowds of people.

98
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,400
With all the chatting and laughing,

99
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
it seems you and Yan
are getting along well, Princess.

100
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,280
Perhaps soon

101
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,900
I can start calling you

102
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,990
my sister-in-law.

103
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,330
Crown Prince Shu, since when have you been
able to decide in His Majestyâ€™s stead?

104
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,909
My marriage

105
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,000
will be decided by His Majesty alone.

106
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Princess,

107
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,200
there are
many novelties over there.

108
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,160
Let me show you.

109
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,520
Princess,

110
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,260
Yunrui's Mid-Autumn Festival night market

111
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,460
has many novelties.

112
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,650
Look.

113
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Look at this.

114
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,520
Sweet Osmanthus sachet.

115
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,050
Oh my!

116
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,810
You have excellent taste, Miss.

117
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,170
This sachet design

118
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,730
is unique to Yunrui.

119
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,880
It's typically used as a token of love.

120
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,120
If you like it, Miss,

121
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,420
don't miss out.

122
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,390
I don't like it.

123
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,590
Watch out!

124
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,330
Everyone stand back!

125
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,240
Shu!

126
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,030
Take the princess
and Miss Zhou away first.

127
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,580
Let's go.

128
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,960
How can there still be assassins?

129
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,140
Want to escape?

130
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,120
Dream on!

131
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,870
Yao!

132
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,390
Crown Prince Shu.

133
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,630
Protect Miss Ruoyao!

134
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,060
Fu Wei!

135
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,010
Who sent you to assassinate us?

136
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,230
Go ask the King of Hell yourself!

137
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,980
Attack!

138
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,250
Leave no survivors!

139
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,150
Are you alright?

140
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,680
Your Highness, be careful!

141
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:31,970
Sister,

142
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,230
are you alright?

143
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,710
Your Highness, look out!

144
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,250
Xi!

145
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,240
Don't hurt His Highness!

146
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,960
Xi!

147
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,900
Why did Xi still come?

148
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,390
Stop!

149
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,400
Halt!

150
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,100
Your Highness.

151
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,580
Prince Yan.

152
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,000
I...

153
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,400
I am willing

154
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,830
to die for you, Prince Yan.

155
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,080
I...

156
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,100
I am willing to die

157
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,450
for you, Your Highness.

158
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,620
Xi!

159
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,790
Xi!

160
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,660
Why?

161
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:51,630
Xi.

162
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,980
Why are this happening?

163
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,450
What I thought was self-preservation

164
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,940
has unknowingly

165
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,520
accelerated my fall into destiny.

166
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,190
Fu Wei!

167
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,450
Princess.

168
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,990
Princess!

169
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,250
Princess!

170
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,640
Fu Wei.

171
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,160
Xi!

172
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
What should we do?

173
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,600
Please save Xi!

174
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,880
Xi.

175
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,360
Xi.

176
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,680
Master.

177
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,980
Master.

178
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,480
Save me!

179
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,380
You've failed in your task.

180
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,280
What use is there in keeping you?

181
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,470
Master.

182
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,530
Save me!

183
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,420
Thank you, Master.

184
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,680
I have failed in my task.

185
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,230
Please punish me.

186
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,250
Since the mission failed,

187
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,400
we must shift the blame elsewhere.

188
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,560
Enough.

189
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,420
Speak.

190
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,460
Who ordered

191
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,190
yesterday's assassination attempt?

192
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,250
Who was the target?

193
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,640
Don't waste my time.

194
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,100
Just kill me.

195
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,190
If you truly wished to die,

196
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,190
how did you end up in my hands?

197
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,930
The will to survive

198
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,480
is human instinct.

199
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,010
There's no shame in it.

200
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,240
If you tell me everything,

201
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,450
I will spare your life.

202
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,850
Do you mean it?

203
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,290
I always

204
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,740
keep my word.

205
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,540
Okay.

206
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,010
We were

207
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,730
acting on orders from a secret letter.

208
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,790
"At the Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival,

209
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,170
kill the Crown Prince."

210
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,980
Where is this letter?

211
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,130
In my hair bun.

212
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,070
Search it.

213
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,310
[Zhou's Mansion]

214
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,800
Father.

215
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,960
Father, you asked for me?

216
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,500
Are you feeling better?

217
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,350
I'm much better now.

218
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,600
Thank you for your concern.

219
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,700
At yesterday's lantern carnival,

220
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,250
it was fortunate you acted so quickly.

221
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,840
Look.

222
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,960
These are rewards from His Majesty

223
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,620
and His Highness

224
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,660
for your service.

225
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,240
You have

226
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,420
brought great honor

227
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,100
to the Zhou family.

228
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,140
Being able to protect His Highness

229
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,120
is my blessing.

230
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,480
I'll ask the kitchen

231
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,440
to prepare

232
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,640
some nourishing soup

233
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,770
to help you recover.

234
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,260
I'll have the servants

235
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,080
bring all these to your room.

236
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,670
Thank you, Father.

237
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,920
Well,

238
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,390
I'll take my leave now.

239
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,020
All right.

240
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,630
Fortunately, I shook off Linglan
and went to the lantern carnival,

241
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,690
so I was able to save
Crown Prince Shu.

242
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,230
I won't miss any chance to change my fate.
