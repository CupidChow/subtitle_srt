You accepted my sachet,

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,660
which means we're betrothed.

104

Fu Wei.

105
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,910

107
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,710
I never thought

108
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,400
that in this lifetime,

109
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,910
I would meet you again.

110
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,200
Have we met before?

111
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,240
With 2 lifetimes entangled,

112
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,440
I should have cut ties long ago.

113
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,630
But when we met again,

114
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,460
I pushed you away time and again.

115
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,820
Yet you kept

116
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,170
pulling me closer.

117
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,060
I saw you looking at it for so long,

118
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,260
so I bought it

119
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,620
to give to you as a gift.

120
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,400

121

125
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,310
you, Brother.

126
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,400
Does it still hurt?

127
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,020
Why put yourself through this?

128

All this suffering for matters of love.

129
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,380
Go apologize to Father.

130
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,000
He will forgive you.

131

132
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,820
Do you even like Princess?

133

Why agree to this marriage?

134

Many things

135

require us to consider the bigger picture,

Marrying the Princess of Daqing

is your duty as a subject.

142
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,920
I understand the political situation,

143
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,800
but I still cannot accept it.

Yan,

148
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,470
your so-called undying love

149
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,970
is nothing but self-deception.

150

Did she ever love you?

come to the ceremony.

157
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,850
It will be a good chance to put

158
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,530
your feelings to rest.

159
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,730

been delivered?

The Crown Prince has received
the portrait of the real princess.

162
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,370
Since the Emperor
has betrothed that fake princess

163
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,130
to the Crown Prince,

164
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,050
we might as well
et the deception continue

165
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,440

destroy each other.

But even I don't know
where the real princess is.

168

Yes, Your Highness.

177
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,820
Come in and close the door.

178
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,210
Xi,

179
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,200
you're here.

180
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,000
Your Highness,

181
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,690
why did you call me here?

182
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,740
I've purchased a house in Liangzhou.

183
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,240
I want to ask you,

184
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,840
what kind of decor do you prefer?

185
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,560
Should we add
some flowers and plants in the courtyard?

186
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,340
Also,

187
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,740
how many servants and staff
will we need?

188
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,670
What are you talking about?

189
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,080
What are you going to do?

190
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,960
I told you before

191
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,720
that I would take you away.

192
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,410
Xi,

193
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,960
we'll be able to leave here soon.

194
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,250
Your Highness!

195
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,110
Your Highness!

196
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,490
[Happiness]

197
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,660
Your Highness.

198
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,140
Your Highness.

199
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,920
Your Highness.

200
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,300
Oh no.

201
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,700
[Happiness]

202
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,250
Lord Zhou,

203
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,060
something's wrong.

204
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,220
The princess is missing.

205
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,810
I've searched the entire Zhou's Mansion

206
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,870
but there's no sign of her.

207
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,740
The princess is missing?

208
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,580
Yes.

209
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,600
Why are you just standing here?

210
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,640
Go find her immediately!

211
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,440
Yes.

212
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,160
Why did you drug me?

213
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,500
Where is this place?

214
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,830
Where are you taking me?

215
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,960
We've already left Qingzhou.

216
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,120
Once we cross this river,

217
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,260
we'll be on the road to Liangzhou.

218
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,900
You're running away from the wedding?

219
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,210
Aren't you afraid of
His Majesty's punishment?

220
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,680
Don't worry.

221
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,560
No one knows

222
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,630
about our escape.

223
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,510
I have His Majesty's token.

224
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,880
Our journey will be smooth and unhindered.

225
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,369
By the time
people at Zhou's Mansion realize,

226
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,760
we'll be far away.

227
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,800
We can finally escape all the conflicts

228
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,859
and leave everything behind.

229
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,650
From now on,

230
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:05,560
we'll live only for ourselves.

231
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,650
Yeah,

232
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,080
living only for ourselves from now on.

233
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,690
Your Highness,

234
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,470
I should thank you.

235
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,110
But if we leave,

236
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,380
who will marry His Highness?
