[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,130
Your Highness, I can't give you

3
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,150
the response you want.

4
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,850
Why do you

5
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,950
always push me away?

6
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,990
Your Highness.

7
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,190
You're awake.

8
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:37,280
Why are you here?

9
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,090
Princess, were you frightened

10
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,890
by yesterday's assassination?

11
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,010
We've been through together
for several times,

12
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,930
I think you know

13
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,889
I'm not the type of woman who would be

14
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:59,090
thrown into panic
by an assassination.

15
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,830
Indeed.

16
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,120
Shu has captured the assassin.

17
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,740
I believe there will be some clues soon.

18
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,740
The assassin was targeting me.

19
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,060
Could the mastermind this time

20
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,990
be different from my previous life?

21
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,960
Things are getting more complicated.

22
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,420
I need to find a way to get out of here
with Xi as soon as possible.

23
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,250
Yesterday,

24
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,880
I saw you staring at this for a long time.

25
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,890
So I bought it.

26
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,610
I want to give it to you.

27
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,020
Yesterday is already gone.

28
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,110
What's missed

29
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,910
shouldn't be clung to.

30
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,610
I don't understand
why you keep denying your feelings.

31
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,950
But my intuition

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
won't be wrong.

33
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,150
I've always believed

34
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,850
that people destined to meet

35
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,550
will eventually reunite.

36
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,150
So will

37
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,890
the things meant to be together.

38

Where is Fu Wei, the Princess of Daqing?

39

Shu.

40
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,019
What are you going to do?

41
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,550
Princess, who did you think

42
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:11,100
was behind Yesterday's assassination

43
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,780
and what was their purpose?

44
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,170
It seems Crown Prince Shu

45
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,640
has had a conclusion.

46
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,260
I have already investigated

47
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,720
the one behind the assassination.

48
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,280
It was you, Princess Fu Wei.

49
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,909
Shu, you must be joking.

50
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,170
How could Princess

51
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,640
order an assassination on herself?

52
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,470
Yan,

53
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,650
his target

54
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,190
was me.

55
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,700
So you've had evidence then?

56
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,550
This is a secret letter I found

57
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,190
carried by the assassin,

58
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,990
bearing the seal of Daqing.

[Assassinate Crown Prince Shu
at the Lantern Carnival]

60
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,720
If Crown Prince Shu
truly believed this,

61
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
you wouldn't have come to me, right?

62
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,540
You know it's a frame-up,

63
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,910
but you can't suppress your doubts.

64
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,510
I don't believe it, of course.

65
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,080
But I don't trust you either.

66
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,820
Since the moment you entered
the Imperial City of Qingzhou,

67
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,080
everything has something to do with you.

68
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,680
Your Highness,

69
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,080
the imperial marriage decree has arrived.

70
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,960
Princess Fu Wei of Daqing

71
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,640
is to be married to Crown Prince Li Shu.

72
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,159
Please accept the decree, Your Highness.

73
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,130
Married to the Crown Prince?

74
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,730
Father!

75
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,050
Father.

76
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,730
I think

77
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,110
Shu is the Crown Prince of Yunrui.

78
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,850
But Fu Wei

79
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,140
is a foreign princess.

80
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,860
She's not the most suitable candidate

81
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,220
for the Crown Princess.

82
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,820
Crown Prince.

83
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,240

86
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,370
Think twice

87
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,650
before answering me.

88
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,640
You are the heir to Yunrui.

89
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,670
You should know which weighs more,
state affairs or personal feelings.

90

91

I...

92
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,360
I know

93
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,280
why you surrounded Zhou's Mansion
with troops today.

94
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,010
Let me remind you of something.

95
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,040
A sword

96
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,800
is only reliable

97
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,250
when it is held in your own hands.

98

I

99
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,980
will obey your orders, Father.

Father, please

104
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,970
reconsider your decision.

105
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,530
Please let Fu Wei

106

marry me instead.

107
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,320

You are my son,

and a general of Yunrui.

111
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,040
You should have great ambitions

112
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,220
and protect our country.

113
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,750

Don't kneel here.

116

Kneel outside!

117
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,760
You may rise

118
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,320
when you realize your mistake.

119
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,600
Father, you taught me

120
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,380
that if I want something,

121
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,750
I should strive for it with all my might.

Let go of me.

128

However,

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,550
I approve.

177
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,550
Thank you, Your Majesty.

178
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,320
Since I cannot refuse,

179
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,610
I have to accept.

180
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,100
Following heaven's will

181
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,310
can also change one's fate.

182
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,850
Fu Wei.

183
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,840
I have already accepted
the marriage arrangement.

184
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,690
From now on,

185
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,860
I am the Crown Princess of Yunrui.

186
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You should forget

187
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,730
whatever happened between us.

188
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,770
Please

189
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,940
bear in mind who you are.

190
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,000
Do not overstep your boundaries.

191
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,410
Are you truly willing

192
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,110
to accept this marriage?

193
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,430
Can you really

194
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,280
let everything between us go?

195
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,910
Look at me.

196
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,090
Look at me.

197
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,240
About all that happened in the past,

198
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,370
I have already forgotten completely.

199
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,930
I am willing to marry Crown Prince Shu.

200
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,740
Prince Yan, please let me go.

201
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:11,970
Fu Wei.

202
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,300
Fu Wei.

203
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Fu Wei.

204
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,740
Fu Wei.

205
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,390
Yan.

206
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,990
In this lifetime,

207
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,570
we cannot be entangled anymore.

208
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,630
Only by staying away from me,

209
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,480
can you survive.
