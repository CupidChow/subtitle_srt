[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,240
Your Highness.

3
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,040
I told you I'm a good person.

4
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,160
What are you doing?

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,400
It's an emergency.

6
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Once we get to where we need to go,

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,560
someone will explain everything to you.

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,120
You only need to know that

9
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,450
I'm here to protect you.

10
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,750
Let's be clear.

11
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,880
Do not bite me again!

12
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,630
Okay.

13
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,230
Help!

14
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,860
Someone's kidnapping me!

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,330
Help!

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,039
Are they

17
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,840
the people you wanted me to meet?

18
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,210
They're from the Eastern Palace?

19
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,550
Hand over the princess quietly

20
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,850
and I'll grant you an intact corpse.

21
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,510
Take the princess away first!

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
Protect the princess!

23
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,330
Move quickly!

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,600
Let's go!

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,470
After them!

26
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,750
Don't let them escape!

27
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,390
Your Highness!

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,600
Your Highness, hurry up and go!

Whoa!

32
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,840
Surround them!

33
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,180
It seems Your Highness
is determined to kill us.

34
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,320
You're the real Princess of Daqing, right?

35
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,230
Take them all away!

36
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,250
Your Highness!

37
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,720
I am Prince Yan's lieutenant.

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,440
I cannot obey

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,970
Crown Prince Shu's orders.

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,160
Liang Feng.

41
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,240
Who gave you the courage to defy me?

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,580
I did.

43
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,650
Shu.

44
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,480
Military orders supersede all else.

45
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,280
You know that.

46
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,550
Yan,

47
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,390
you arrived quite quickly.

48
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,430
So this means

49
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,350
she is the real Princess of Daqing, right?

50
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,920
Isn't the Princess of Daqing
at your residence?

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,960
This woman

52
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,630
is merely a witness to the robbery
at the Princess of Daqing's posthouse.

53
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,960
If she's just a witness,

54
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,360
it makes no difference
whether you take her away

55
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,280
or I do.

56
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,140
But I am in charge of this case.

57
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,000
So, there's no need to bother you,

58
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,079
lest Father hold me accountable.

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,040
Besides,

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,680
many things

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,050
are not what they appear to be.

62
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,150
Shu, if you want to know the truth,

63
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,310
there's no rush.

64
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,490
What if I say no?

65
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,370
What if I insist on keeping her?

66
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,700
Then, I have no choice but

67
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,720
to follow official protocol.

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
How dare you, Li Yan!

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,640
Shu!

70
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,390
If I forcibly take her today,

71
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:51,170
things might become difficult to resolve.

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,130
Everyone, stand aside.

73
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,340
Let them go.

75
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,500
Withdraw!

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,360

[Adorable House]

78
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,600
Remember

to keep

80
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,480
this jade pendant well.

81
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,610
At a critical moment,

82
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,250
maybe

83
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,220
it can save your life.

84
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,960
What's so special about it?

85
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,550
I feel like

86
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,080
I've seen the pattern somewhere before.

87
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,960
What was Mother trying to tell me?

88
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,560
This is
the peace-making marriage document.

[Yunrui-Daqing Peace-Making

90

There are official seals of both kingdoms
on the document.

91
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,480
But something seems different.

92
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,230
What exactly is different?

93
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,920

Lieutenant Liang.

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,800
What happened?

97
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,290
Your Highness was wounded
by a poisoned arrow.

The doctor is treating her now.

99

How was she injured?

100
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,320
I was ordered by His Highness
to escort the princess back.

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,020
But unexpectedly,

102
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,790
we were ambushed by men
of the Crown Prince.

103
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,830
The Crown Prince?

104
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,680
Be ambushed?

105
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,010
There are many suspicious points
in this matter.

106
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,930
Liang Feng.

107
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,950
You may leave now.

108
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,230
Your Highness,

109
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,420
I've finished the treatment.

110
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,460
She is conscious

111
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,790
but still very weak.

112
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,320
You may go.

113
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,159
Yes.

114
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,320
I'll go in and see her.

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,080
It's you.

116
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,240
Finally we met,

117
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,440
Princess Fu Wei of Daqing.

118
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,280
I never thought I would see you again.

119
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,490
I made you my stand-in

120
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,650
just because I didn't want
to lose my freedom.

121
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,460
It was a desperate situation.

122
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,990
So, I resorted to this plan.

123
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,720
You didn't want to lose your freedom,

124
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,330
so you thought it was acceptable for me
to die in your place, huh?

125
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,840
About the attack at the posthouse,

126
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
I knew it afterward.

127
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,240
I can promise you that

128
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,030
I had nothing to do with it.

129
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,230
Your jade pendant isâ€¦

130
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,170
This is the royal jade pendant of Daqing.

131
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,710
You mean

132
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,420
the Daqing royal jade pendant
the princess wears

133
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,980
is the same as Madam Wang's?

134
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,790
When I was young,

135
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,270
I saw

136
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,770
the jade pendant on Zhou Kui.

137
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,390
Before my mother died,
she gave me this pendant,

138
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,720
saying it could save me.

139
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,610
What exactly

140
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,370
is the connection between the two things?

141
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,590
Could Zhou Kui

142
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,300
have connections
with the Daqing royal family?

143
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,280
I'm not sure.

144
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,530
But he has served as Minister of Rites
for many years.

145
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,390
He must know many inside stories.

146
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,060
Besides this matter,

147
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,370
there's something else I don't understand.

148
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,670
Why did Crown Prince Shu

149
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,670
want to kill the Princess of Daqing?

150
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,250
What connection is there between them?

151
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,640
The assassins who pursued the princess

152
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,620
carried

153
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,340
tokens of the Eastern Palace.

154
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,250
But

155
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,320
they might not be Shu's men.

156
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,210
Why do you trust him so much?

157
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,160
Then why must you suspect him?

158
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,410
Because I know who he is now

159
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,080
and what a person he will become.

160
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,140
I know how he will ascend to the throne

161
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,650
and what he will do after that.

162
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,760
I also know that one day,

163
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,360
we will be killed by him.

164
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,850
I know it's hard for you

165
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,370
to accept it right now.

166
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,200
But people's minds are unpredictable.

167
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,360
Many things

168
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,250
are destined to happen.

169
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,310
They are destined to happen

170
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,800
but haven't happened yet.

171
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
Isn't that right?

172
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,320
Fu Wei.

173
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,760
I believe in reincarnation

174
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,610
and karma.

175
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,330
Since you've returned before the end,

176
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,690
it proves that

177
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,280
everything here

178
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,470
and every person here

179
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,670
has a chance to be changed and redeemed.

180
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,260
You want to save Miss Ruoxi

181
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,460
and yourself

182
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,900
because you believe everything here

183
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,910
can be changed.

184
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,810
I believe in you.

185
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,330
I also believe in Shu.

186
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,120
I believe in the person I remember.

187
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,280
Life and death

188
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,720
are mutual causation.

189
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,640
Perhaps I shouldn't use memories
from the past life

190
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,210
to prematurely judge

191
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,810
others.

192
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,200
I need to return to Zhou's Mansion.

193
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,280
Do you want to go back as Zhou Ruoxi?

194
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,900
We have to investigate
the loan-sharking conspiracy,

195
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,310
the truth behind the assassination
on the Princess of Daqing,

196
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,310
and whether Zhou Kui
and Crown Prince Shu are involved

197
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,170
from the source.

198
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,500
But do you have to go back?

199
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,630
There might be another way.

200
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,610
I have no choice.

201
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,200
Fu Wei.

202
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,640
Yan.

203
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,280
Wait for me.

204
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,610
Here you are.

205
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,250
Take this.

206
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,420
Since you're going back,

207
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,600
take this with you.

208
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,660
At least

209
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,140
you can have something to
protect yourself.

210
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,400
This is for you.

211
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,210
While I'm away,

212
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,960
you can use it to protect yourself.

213
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,880
I've improved

214
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,010
this crossbow's power

215
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,110
and firing speed.

216
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,840
Try it.

217
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,660
Aim at one spot.

218
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,590
Got it?

219
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,380
Yes.

220
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,120
Your crossbow skills in the past life

221
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,720
was also taught by me, right?

222
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,840
Yes.

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,610
Stay safe.

224
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,080
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

225
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,320
The real princess was taken away by Yan.

226
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,360
All leads have gone cold.

227
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,110
A month ago,

228
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,040
during peace marriage negotiations
between Daqing and Yunrui,

229
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,850
[Order]

230
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,690
some disguised Daqing rebels infiltrated
the merchant convoy

231
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,370
and entered Yunrui.

232
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,250
I sent spies to investigate.

233
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,980
Eventually,

234
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,610
I received information about their troop
gathering and smuggling operations.

235
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,140
[Smuggling weapons and money]

236
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,280
However, my spies disappeared.

237
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,510
The Eastern Palace tokens

238
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,510
have also vanished without a trace.

239
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
All of this is because of Daqing.

240
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,720
Now the real princess

241
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,340
is with Yan.

242
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,340
I have no choice but
to use this fake one now.

243

[The princess was shot by a poisoned arrow
and may die soon.]

244

[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

246

Father.

251
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,270
Where have you been these days?

252
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,090
Since my mother passed away,

253
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,940
I've been restless every day.

254
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,620
I wanted to pray for Mother at the temple.

255
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,840
It was wrong of me

256
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,590
for not telling you in advance.

257
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,280
Praying?

258
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,500
Why were you gone for so long?

259
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,000
After I left the temple,

260
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,310
I found the road was washed out by floods.

261
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,710
I searched for a long time

262
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,340
and walked for many days
before I could return.

263
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,030

Yes.

268
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,260
Crown Prince Shu has ordered

269
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,650
to lift the Crown Princess's confinement.

270

-Yes.
-Yes.

What is the Crown Prince planning now?

Your Highness.

274

Your Highness.

275
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,900
The Crown Prince has lifted
your confinement.

276

Has something happened?

You mean at the Crown Prince's residence?

278
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,610
Nothing special happened.

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,730
However,

280
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,160
Lady Ruoxi has returned.

281
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,710
Who?

Wasn't she killed by me?

Why is she still alive?

289
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,810
I'm not dead.

290
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,030
You must be disappointed, right?

291
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,750
So what if you're still alive?

292
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,330
Now,

293
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,770
I am the Princess of Daqing.

294
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,600
I am the Crown Princess of Yunrui.

But you

are nothing but a concubine's daughter
of the Zhou family.

297

I won't fight you
for the position of Crown Princess.

301

Because I'm not
the Princess of Daqing at all.

Then who exactly are you?
