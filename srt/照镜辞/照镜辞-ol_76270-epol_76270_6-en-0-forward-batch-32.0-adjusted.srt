How could this happen?

172

My Lord,

173
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,260
we have no idea.

174
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,510
The fire suddenly broke out.

175
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,360
Put out the fire quickly!

176
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,760
Put out the fire quickly!

177
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,730
Hurry and put out the fire!

178
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,360
Hurry! Hurry up!

179
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,060
This place!

180
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,130
Xi!

181
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,960
How could...

182
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,840
Xi!

183
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,600
Let me do it.

184
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,200
This place!

185
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,230
Here!

186
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,040
Hurry!

187
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,480
Here is water!

188
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,320
Xi!

189
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,270
Miss Ruoxi,

190
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,030
it's too dangerous inside.

191
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,540
You can't go in!

192
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,250
Get out of my way!

193
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:18,770
Move!

194
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,500
It's too dangerous!

195
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,980
I am Princess Fu Wei!

196
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,800
Move aside!

197
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,200
Xi!

198
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,850
Xi!

199
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,630
Xi!

200
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,000
Xi,

201
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,040
are you alright?

202
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,700
How...

203
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,740
How can there be two Xi?

204
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,490
Madam Cui,

205
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:51,940
I will

206
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,130
let you pay the price.
