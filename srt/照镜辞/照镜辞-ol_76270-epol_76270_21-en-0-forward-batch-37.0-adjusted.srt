Xi,

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,460
don't you think

7
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,510
you should explain yourself to me?

8
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,430
Xi?

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,500
Father, what do you

10
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,460
mean by that?

11
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,210
What do I mean?

12
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,360
The Crown Prince's poisoning was fake.

13
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,030
The Red-armored Army's token
was also fake.

14
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,210
Could it be

15
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,960
you're working with them?

16
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,380
I failed to discover
the Crown Prince's scheme.

17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,700
That was my fault.

18
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,640
But if I had ill intentions toward you,

19
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,210
I wouldn't have taken Ruoyao hostage

20

26

27
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,930
that I've lost the Red-armored Army

suddenly appeared

51

52

I thought Zhou Ruoxi replaced the poison

53
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,490
because she shared our goals.

54

Today Xi helped Zhou Kui escape.

Yan,

85
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,680
have you considered

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,320
that Zhou Kui might not leave at all,

87
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,100
but instead burn his bridges

88
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,360
and fight to win or die?

89
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,850
Do you know anything else?

90
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,750
Do you know

91
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,550
how His Majesty died

92
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,140
in the previous life?

93
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,840
In the 11th year of Xinshou reign,

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
His Majesty fell gravely ill

95
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,930
and when he was on his deathbed,

96
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,190
he passed the throne to the Crown Prince.

97
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,650
But His Majesty had always
been in good health.

98
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,650
How could he suddenly become so ill?

99
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,180
Are you saying

100
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,890
Father was also killed by Zhou Kui?

101
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,780
Although there's no concrete evidence,

102
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,750
thinking about it carefully now,

103
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,700
it could indeed
have been Zhou Kui's doing.

104
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
At that time,

105
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,120
I had already married Li Shu

106
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,850
and became the Crown Princess.

107
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,650
After His Majesty passed away,

108
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,780
he left the throne to the Crown Prince.

109
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,230
And I became the mistress
of the imperial harem.

110
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,360
Zhou Kui used my position as Empress

111
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,890
to throw his weight around.

112
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,140
Plus, I saw Linglan

113
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,960
secretly meeting with
someone from the palace.

114
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,230
Zhou Kui must have planted spies
around His Majesty,

115
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,360
otherwise he couldn't have done this.

116
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,530
Then I'll go to the palace

117
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,210
and warn Father to be more vigilant.

118
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,970
Also,

119
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,010
increase patrols inside the Imperial City.

120
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,340
Post guards at the city gates.

121
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,670
I feel Zhou Kui still
has some backup plan.

122
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,390
I'll be going then.

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,230
Your Highness,

177
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,060
Your Grace,

178
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,600
I was patrolling the city as ordered

179
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,160
and discovered something suspicious.

180
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,960
What is it?

181
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,600
Near the Imperial City,

182
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,410
there seems to be the smell of gunpowder.

183
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,910
I just sent someone to investigate

184
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,170
and found traces of sulfur and charcoal.

185
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,660
It's not the Fireworks Festival.

186
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,720
Why would there be gunpowder and charcoal?

187
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,250
Gunpowder and charcoal...

188
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,760
Lieutenant Liang,

189
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,950
are you certain?

190
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,650
I smelled it clearly.

191
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,650
My hometown is known
for gunpowder production.

192
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,270
Since childhood,

193
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,000
I grew up surrounded
by black powder and fire caltrops.

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,730
Most people wouldn't notice this smell,

195
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,530
but I recognize it immediately.

196
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,490
Lieutenant Liang,

197
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,030
I need you to do something for me.

198
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,580
This dragon throne

199
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,240
is truly magnificent.

200
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,200
It's comfortable to sit on too.

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,120
No wonder so many people

202
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,320
fight desperately

203
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
to sit on this throne.

204
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,560
You've sat here long enough.

205
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,600
Make way

206
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,620
and let someone else have a turn.

207
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,220
Zhou Kui,

208
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,400
how dare you!

209
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,510
A mere Minister of Rites

210
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,750
with ambitions to usurp the throne.

211
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,370
Usurp?

212
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,080
The empire

213
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,540
belongs to the virtuous.

214
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,140
In both civil and military affairs,

215
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,700
I can say without doubt

216
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,100
that I'm second to none.

217
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,970
Why shouldn't this empire

218
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,390
be mine to rule?

219
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,210
Not to mention that since 30 years ago,

220
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,020
Yunrui should have been destroyed.

221
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,000
This should have been mine all along!

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,910
If you hadn't supported the Daqing rebels,

223
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,460
how would I have ended up like this?

224
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
You are...

225
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,820
the Crown Prince
of the former Daqing dynasty?

226
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,720
30 years.

227
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,420
It has been 30 years.

228
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,230
No one has addressed me that way.

229
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,960
But the good thing is

230
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,140
now I've returned to this court

231
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,040
and sit on this dragon throne!

232
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,560
Get off my throne now!

233
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,550
You'd better understand the situation.

234
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,640
Now

235
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,110
it's not up to you.

236
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,400
Zhou Kui,

237
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,460
Yunrui has never mistreated you.

238
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,150
I have treated you well.

239
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,120
Why would you do this?

240
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,440
Shut up!

241
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,470
For you,

242
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,940
titles and rewards

243
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,810
are the greatest gifts!

244
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,950
But for me...

245
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,280
For me,

246
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,480
I can't forget all these years

247
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,740
of humiliation,
begging at your feet like a dog.

248
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,090
I will avenge this shame

249
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,510
and reclaim the throne!

250
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,840
I want Yunrui's empire

251
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,540
to exact my revenge.

252
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:48,970
I

253
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,260
will not let you have your way.

254
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,660
Now,

255
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,160
you

256
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,980
and your son

257
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,570
are both in my hands.

258
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,680
You have no choice but to comply.

259
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,880
My Li family

260
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,760
only has martyrs who protect the state,

261
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,880
not hostages who fear death.

262
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,040
Well said!

263
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,840
Good!

264
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,870
Such eloquent words

265
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,240
and noble integrity.

266
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,390
But have you considered?

267
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,450
What if

268
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,340
I take the citizens of the Imperial City

269
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,860
as hostages?

270
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,490
What would you do then?

271
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,120
What did you say?

272
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,360
Are you saying

273
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,910
Zhou Kui planted explosives
in the Imperial City?

274
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,350
Yes.

275
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,390
Your Highness,

276
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,960
we should hurry to the palace.

277
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,740
I'm really worried about Prince Yan.

278
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,300
Alright.

279
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,160
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

280
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,450
By order of His Majesty,

281
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,300
the Crown Prince and his party

282
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,390
are to enter the palace immediately.

283
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,800
Your Majesty,

284
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,670
the life and death of

285
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,350
tens of thousands of citizens

286
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,250
in the Imperial City Qingzhou

287
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,360
depends solely

288
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,980
on Your Majesty's decision.

289
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,130
Zhou Kui,

290
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,740
what exactly are you trying to do?

291
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,790
He planted explosives
around the Imperial City!

292
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,350
Fu Wei.
