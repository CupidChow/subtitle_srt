1
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,760
[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,250
Brother.

3
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,880
I've ordered people

4
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,070
to close the Military Supply Route.

5
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,870
Zhou Kui can't transport
his arms and ordnance in.

6
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,670
I'm afraid Zhou Kui

7
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,260
still has a backup plan.

8
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,450
How did I not notice

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,400
Zhou Kui's treacherous ambitions before?

10
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,720
Brother,

11
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,380
you used to

12
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,410
see him only as your father-in-law.

13
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,830
You were too busy trying to please him.

14
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,720
So how could you

15
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,020
be suspicious of him?

16
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,890
Why have you been with the Princess

17
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,560
for so long that

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,400
your tongue has become so sharp?

19
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,850
I think it's better this way.

20
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,080
Always holding back and pleasing others

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,940
is exhausting.

22
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,860
Yan,

23
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,970
you seem to know her well.

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,370
I've known her for two lifetimes.

25
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,970
How could I not know her well?

26
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:20,880
Brother,

27
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,580
don't blame her.

28
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,180
She's just been through too much

29
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,060
and harbors hatred toward you.

30
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,620
Hatred?

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,280
I just can't understand

32
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,730
where this hatred

33
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,870
comes from.

34
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,310
Is it merely because

35
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,580
I previously suspected her

36
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,710
of orchestrating the assassination?

37
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,170
Brother,

38
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,790
right now

39
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,090
we're facing a great enemy.

40
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,290
The most important thing is

41
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,190
whether you and Fu Wei
can resolve your differences

42
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,250
and work together.

43
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,530
Hmm.

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,880
Also,

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,430
Brother,

46
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,990
there are things

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,420
you need to tell her yourself.

48
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,170
We are both princes of Yunrui,

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,620
yet now we're worrying ourselves sick
over the women we love.

50
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,980
If Father found out,

51
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,690
he would surely scold us

52
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,820
for being pathetic.

53
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,620
I'm thinking,

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,320
after everything settles down,

55
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,280
we'll go find Ruoyao

56
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,800
and travel the world together,

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,890
living carefree lives.

58
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,030
I hope that day

59
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,010
comes soon.

60
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,720
Crown Prince Shu,

61
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,690
you wanted to see me?

62
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,170
Did you call me here
to listen to the rain?

63
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,310
I

64
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,350
asked you to come here today

65
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,960
to apologize for everything

66
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
that happened before

67
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,950
and ask for your forgiveness.

68
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,350
What you should apologize for

69
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,589
is more than just this.

70
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,290
I still don't understand

71
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,120
where all your hatred toward me

72
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,830
comes from.

73
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,370
Do you really want to know?

74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,730
What do you mean?

75
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,040
Now

76
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,730
we're even.

77
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,690
Li Shu,

78
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,560
there will be no more hatred

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
between us

80
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
from now on.

81
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,900
Yan is right.

82
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,960
Since I've been given a second life,

83
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,820
I shouldn't be burdened
by the shackles of the past.

84
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,770
Crown Prince Shu,

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,870
you should return to your residence soon.

86
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,190
There's still a play

87
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,810
that you need to perform.

88
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,360
Also,

89
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,260
I would trouble you

90
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,190
to deliver a message for me.

91
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,680
It's been several days,

92
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,010
and there's still no sign of His Highness.

93
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,420
It seems I can't hide it anymore.

94
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,390
Xi.

95
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,800
Father.

96
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,420
It's so late.

97
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,740
Why are you here?

98
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,370
I've come to see His Highness

99
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,970
to report some matters.

100
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:30,670
Where is His Highness?

101
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,300
Are you hiding something

102
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,910
from me?

103
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,360
Has the Crown Prince gone missing?

104
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,430
No.

105
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,140
His Highness is here in the mansion.

106
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,320
He...

107
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Let me tell you,

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,790
we're in the same boat now.

109
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,880
Don't you dare try

110
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,140
any tricks with me!

111
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,790
I wouldn't dare.

112
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,930
Then where is he?

113
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,430
Keep drinking!

114
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,600
Lord Zhou!

115
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,370
Let's continue!

116
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:10,950
Your Highness.

117
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,710
Don't leave.

118
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,659
Keep drinking.

119
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,980
Your Highness,

120
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,260
let me attend to you.

121
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,760
Don't you touch me!

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,710
Who are you really?

123
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,090
What's wrong, Your Highness?

124
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,010
I'm Fu Wei, your Crown Princess.

125
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,350
I know you're not her.

126
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,120
My Crown Princess...

127
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,220
My Crown Princess isn't that ugly!

128
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,250
Lord Zhou!

129
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,420
Don't go.

130
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Keep...

131
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,980
Keep drinking.

132
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,120
Keep drinking.

133
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,090
Drunk like this,

134
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,440
he hardly looks like
an heir to the throne.

135
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,520
Father,

136
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,970
His Highness

137
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,650
has been drinking every day

138
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,790
because of what happened to Ruoyao.

139
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,260
He hasn't attended
to state affairs for days.

140
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,220
That's fine.

141
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,960
If he's so lovesick,

142
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,780
then let's make him never wake up.

143
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,850
Come.

144
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,300
This is Xiaoyao Powder.

145
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,750
Mix it into

146
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,140
his meals every day.

147
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,210
Soon,

148
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,740
the state of Yunrui

149
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,130
will be in our hands.

150
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,430
His Majesty is still in power.

151
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,250
His Highness

152
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,300
hasn't inherited the throne yet.

153
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,820
How can we seize power?

154
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,160
Don't worry about that.

155
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,010
Just do as I say.

156
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,010
Just remember this.

157
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,720
I can raise you above thousands,

158
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,320
but I can also make you

159
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,730
fall into eternal damnation.

160
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,360
Take it.

161
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,320
Take it!

162
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,940
Don't you touch me!

163
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,550
You're here.

164
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,200
Why did you ask me to come here?

165
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
Today's Mother's birthday.

166
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,300
I was afraid you'd forget.

167
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,410
My mother's affairs

168
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,590
are none of your business.

169
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,380
Xi,

170
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,030
even now, don't you understand

171
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,980
why Mother died

172
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,690
and who killed her?

173
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,820
She discovered Zhou Kui
was from the Daqing royal family,

174
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,180
so Zhou Kui got rid of her
through Madam Cui's hands.

175
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,910
Mother was killed by Father?

176
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,990
Why would he do that?

177
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,320
Zhou Kui has been plotting for years,

178
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,910
all for that one day

179
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,910
he could seize power.

180
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,270
He won't let anyone
who knows his secret live.

181
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,360
He's hiding your identity now

182
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,670
just to make you a pawn in his game,

183
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,070
a stepping stone.

184
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,300
Even if what you say is true,

185
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,000
what difference does it make?

186
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,460
Mother is already dead.

187
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,270
In this world,

188
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,530
Father is my only support.

189
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,740
Since he's willing

190
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,790
to raise me above all others,

191
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,770
then I'm willing

192
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,170
to be his pawn

193
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,200
and stepping stone.

194
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,610
Xi,

195
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,760
why won't you turn back even now?

196
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,380
One turns back when there's a way out.

197
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,600
But now,

198
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,080
beneath my feet
are mountains of blades and seas of fire,

199
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
and behind me is a bottomless abyss.

200
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,450
What way out do I have?

201
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,110
How can I turn back?

202
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,380
Everywhere in this world

203
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,610
is like a prison.

204
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,700
Now that you have a second life,

205
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,220
you shouldn't be trapped here.

206
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,260
Mother's affairs,

207
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,420
the Zhou family's business,

208
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,450
even the politics of Yunrui court—

209
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,080
none of them concerns you.

210
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,970
You should leave this place

211
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,260
and find somewhere you can be free.

212
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,150
Xi.

213
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,300
Xi!

214
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,650
[Happiness]

215
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,560
Yan,

216
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,400
in this second life,

217
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,550
your determination

218
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,490
has spared me from regret.

219
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,450
However,

220
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,900
the rest of our days will be difficult.

221
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,290
We don't know how many days we have left.

222
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,580
No matter how many days remain,

223
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,510
as long as I'm with you,

224
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,890
this life

225
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,110
[Happiness]

226
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,600
will be complete.

227
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,450
This young lady

228
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,950
is already at the end of her life.

229
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,760
Your Highness,
once your fate is linked with hers,

230
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,310
sharing your lifespan with her,

231
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,270
your physical deterioration
will increase daily,

232
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,020
and there's no way to reverse it.

233
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,900
Can you

234
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,440
handle that?

235
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,880
I

236
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,600
would never regret it.

237
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,470
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

238
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,570
Congratulations!

239
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,760
[Virtuous Virtue]

240
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,220
First bow to heaven and earth!

241
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,850
Bow.

242
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,390
Second bow to the parents!

243
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,510
Bow.

244
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,760
Today,

245
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,360
I am greatly comforted

246
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,500
that all my sons
have established families,

247
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,860
and the state affairs

248
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,210
can be entrusted to you.

249
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,000
Husband and wife bow to each other!

250
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,010
Bow.

251
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Wait!
