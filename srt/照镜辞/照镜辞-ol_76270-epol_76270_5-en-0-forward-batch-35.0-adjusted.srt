[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,360
Your mother

3
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,830
will never be honored
in the ancestral hall of Zhou's Mansion.

4
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,890
Who says my aunt wanted to be honored
in the ancestral hall of Zhou's Mansion?

5
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,660
[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

6
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,050
Move aside.

7
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,710
My aunt

8
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,750
is the Empress of Daqing's sister.

9
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,900
After her death,

10
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,410
her coffin should be returned to Daqing

11
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,569
for a grand funeral.

12
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,920
But...

13
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,300
Madam Wang
was still a member of the Zhou family.

14
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,100
Even if she can't be honored
in the ancestral hall,

15
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,230
she should still be buried
in her husband's family tomb.

16
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,030
Sharing a bed in life and a grave in death

17
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,590
refers to loving couples.

18
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,770
But now,

19
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,650
does Uncle Kui have

20
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,190
even the slightest affection
left for my aunt?

21
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,020
Your Highness.

22
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,680
Madam Wang
was a concubine in our Zhou's Mansion.

23
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,680
This should be our responsibility...

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,479
Uncle Kui, if you disagree,
then dissolve the nominal bond with her.

25
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,560
As long as Xi agrees,

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,539
my aunt

27
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,759
will no longer
be part of the Zhou's Mansion

28
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,690
and won't have to follow its rules.

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,040
Your Highness,
since this is your kind intention,

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
the master certainly won't refuse.

31
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,600
After all,

32
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,250
being buried
as the Empress of Daqing's sister

33
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,840
would certainly be more prestigious
than the current arrangement.

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,760
In three days,

35
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,420
I will send people

36
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,030
to take my aunt's coffin

37
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,020
back to Daqing.

38
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,290
Mother is already dead.

39
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,420
In my previous life,

40
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,370
I went down a path of no return.

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,680
In this life,

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,750
I hope you, Xi,
can live a pure and good life.

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,570
As for everything else,

44
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,380
leave it to me.

45
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,610
That medicine was given by His Highness.

46
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,110
Since it comes from

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,760
the palace,

48
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,420
Xi should recover faster.

49
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,070
I've also asked the servants
to prepare some medicinal soup.

50
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,470
After such a beating,

51
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,860
her body will need careful tending.

52
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,690
Miss Ruoyao.

53
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,920
You really care about your sister.

54
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,740
Your Highness must have heard some gossip,

55
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,740
thinking that the Zhou family's true-born
and concubine-born daughters

56
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,140
have always been at odds.

57
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,710
Is it just gossip?

58
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,160
She's my only sister.

59
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,070
How could I not treat her well?

60
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,700
It is only that birth sets us apart.

61
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,360
My mother runs the household.

62
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,680
If I were too close to Xi,

63
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,160
the suffering she would endure

64
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,680
would be ten or a hundred times worse.

65
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,340
So I've misunderstood Ruoyao all along.

66
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,390
And to marry the Crown Prince,

67
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,900
I brought about her disfigurement
and her tragic suicide.

68
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,510
Ruoyao.

69
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,870
What Your Highness said
in the hall yesterday

70
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,070
was excellent.

71
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,760
Who says that after a woman dies,

72
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,420
she must be buried
in her husband's family tomb?

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,490
I think

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,280
that after a woman dies,

75
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,000
people tend to remember her

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,260
only as someone's wife

77
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,579
or mother,

78
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,279
rather than recall

79
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,959
her true name,

80
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,560
what she accomplished,

81
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,050
or the contributions she made.

82
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,660
I believe

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,500
that regardless of status

84
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
or gender,

85
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,670
what matters

86
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,860
is the path one has traveled.

87
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,500
Do you really think so?

88
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
That's why I admire Your Highness so much.

90
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,840
You're bold and spirited,

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,250
never concerning yourself with status

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,159
or hierarchy.

93
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,100
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,659
I'm the one who should apologize.

95
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,440
What's wrong?

96
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,640
I just feel

97
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,200
that you and I are very compatible.

98
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,900
I also feel a connection
with Your Highness,

99
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,740
as if we've known each other
for a long time.

100
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,130
But actually,

101
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,510
Your Highness's way of doing things
is more similar to Xi's.

102
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,600
It's just that Xi is still young

103
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,390
and lacks
Your Highness's insight and courage.

104
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,180
If back then I had

105
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,440
been willing to remove my shackles

106
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,110
and paid more attention
to those around me,

107
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,090
perhaps

108
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,550
the outcome
would have been different long ago.

109

[Memorial Tablet of My Late Mother,
Madam Wang of the Zhou Family]

110
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
Didn't Your Highness say

111
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,090
you would protect us?

112
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,660
Why did my mother still die?

113
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,150
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,400
Indeed, others cannot be trusted.

115
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,280
I can only rely on myself.

116
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,660
Xi.

117
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,780
Xi!

118
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,440
What are you going to do?

119
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,920
Mother didn't die from illness.

120
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,460
She was murdered.

121
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,100
Why is this fragrance getting stronger?

122
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,780
Could it be

123
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,710
Mother died of poisoning?

124
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,460
It was Madam Cui.

125
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,670
Madam Cui killed her.

126
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,140
I'm going to kill her.

127
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,820
I will kill her!

128
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,320
I must have revenge!

129
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,150
Xi.

130
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,190
Xi.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,430
Acting so rashly

132
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,570
will only implicate yourself.

133
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,790
Then what does Your Highness think

134
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,800
I should do?

135
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,520
I have arranged everything.

136
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,960
Trust me.

137
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,080
I will

138
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,470
take this revenge with you.

139
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,000
Why should I trust you?

140
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,230
How could this be?

141
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,890
Lieutenant Liang,

142
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,870
show yourself.

143
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,580
How did Your Highness know I was nearby?

144
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,080
There are no such coincidences
in this world.

145
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,170
That day when I saw
your master at the tavern,

146
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,310
I realized

147
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,550
he had placed spies around me.

148
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,340
His Highness
is only concerned for your safety.

149
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,290
Go tell your master

150
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,920
to prepare a carriage.

151
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,850
At midnight tonight,

152
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,600
meet me at the back gate
of Zhou's Mansion.

153
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,230
Yes.

154
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:13,970
Your Highness.

155
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,429
The princess arranged to meet at midnight.

156
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,559
Do we really need to arrive this early?

157
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:18,870
It's so late.

158
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,650
Yet the princess still asked to meet me.

159
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,580
What urgent matter could she have?

160
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,710
Your Highness.

161
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,010
Miss Ruoxi.

162
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,870
I'm Fu Wei.

163
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,790
Miss Ruoxi.

164
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,030
Today,

165
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,840
the princess requested this meeting.

166
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,860
Please stop this nonsense...

167
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,220
I really am Fu Wei.

168
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,400
We've known each other for so long.

169
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,160
How could I not recognize you?

170
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,540
Gains, losses, glory and failure
are all determined by Heaven.

171
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,140
The only thing a person can do

172
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,090
is to strive for it on their own.

173
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,930
Your Highness, do you think

174
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm someone who gives up easily?

175
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,100
Do you believe me now?

176
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,860
Xi and I are cousins.

177
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,190
We look alike.

178
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,880
What's so strange about that?

179
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:20,890
Well,

180
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,280
Princess,

181
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,210
shall we get in the carriage first?

182
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,840
I can't believe there're two people
in the world who look so similar.

183
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,940
So where are we going now?

184
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,750
The Wang family in Yuzhou.

185
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,310
Hya!

186
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,700
Your face...

187
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,320
How is it identical to mine?

188
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,440
I can't explain

189
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,440
this matter clearly right now.

190
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,640
But please trust me.

191
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,080
I will go to Yuzhou
to investigate the loan sharking case

192
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,480
and clear my aunt's name.

193
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,850
During this time,

194
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,790
you'll stay at Zhou's Mansion
using my identity

195
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,030
to avoid suspicion.

196
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,380
Though I look identical
to Princess Fu Wei,

197
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,910
our fates couldn't be more different.

198
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,840
Madam.

199
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,790
I just saw Miss Ruoxi leaving the mansion

200
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,500
and don't know where she went.

201
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,100
Keep a close eye on her.

202
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,810
You must be careful.

203
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,360
If necessary,

204
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,270
eliminate her completely.

205
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,690
Yes.

206
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,870
By the way...

207
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,940
Watch the princess closely too.

208
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,340
Report to me immediately

209
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,890
if anything seems suspicious.

210
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,650
Yes.

211
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,080
Zhou Ruoxi.

212
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,540
You want to avenge your mother?

213
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,040
Soon you'll learn what it means

214
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,300
to be an ant
trying to shake a mighty tree.

215
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,530
[Wang's Mansion]

216
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,260
News of the loan sharking case
has reached the Imperial City.

217
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,440
The Wang family knows
they're under suspicion,

218
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,510
yet they're making no attempt
to hide anything.

219
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,510
Instead, their doors are wide open.

220
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,120
Don't you think

221
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,200
there's something suspicious about that?

222
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,780
Look.

223
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,620
That vendor
selling fried snacks by the door.

224
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,440
Though his movements seem practiced,

225
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,920
his apron

226
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,740
doesn't have a single oil stain.

227
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,260
And we've been sitting here

228
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,540
for 10 minutes.

229
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,860
He hasn't fried a single snack.

230
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,160
Also,

231
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,780
that vendor carrying vegetable baskets
and shouting

232
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,340
has passed by the Wang family gate
three times already.

233
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,220
So,

234
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,390
while they appear open and welcoming,

235
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,590
in reality, the surroundings

236
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,340
are full of ambushes.

237
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,420
In that case,

238
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,350
the Wang family is definitely suspicious.

239
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,080
Whether they're guilty or not,

240
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,010
we'll find out soon enough.

241
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,800
This tea is excellent.

242
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,090
Try some.

243
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,970
It's astringent.

244
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,370
I used to find this tea
bitter and astringent too.

245
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,900
But after drinking it for a while,

246
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,050
I began to taste its sweet aftertaste.

247
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Many things can't be rushed.

248
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,970
They need to be savored slowly.

249
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,350
Madam.

250
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,120
Your Highness.

251
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,590
Mrs. Zhou, please rise.

252
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,930
Yes.

253
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,230
Your Highness,

254
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,650
I have urgent matters,

255
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,330
so I must take my leave.

256
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,990
Since she thinks I'm Fu Wei,

257
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
I'll use my identity as princess

258
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,590
to teach her a lesson.

259
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,820
The main gate is wide open,

260
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,970
but the side door is tightly shut.

261
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,110
It seems the Wang family

262
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,200
truly has secrets they can't reveal.

263
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,180
Since the door is sealed tight,

264
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,890
how can we find out
what's really going on?

265
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,010
The Wang family
all enter through the side door,

266
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,780
and

267
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,780
this position is closer to the main hall.

268
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,490
Perhaps we can

269
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,440
learn something from here.

270
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,820
It seems you

271
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,100
not only resemble
Miss Ruoxi in appearance,

272
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,660
but also know everything

273
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,890
about her maternal family's affairs.

274
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,240
Hey!

275
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,170
You two!

276
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,800
What are you doing
sneaking around our gate?

277
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,510
It seems your method

278
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,650
won't work.

279
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,590
Right now,

280
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,050
what should we do?

281
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,190
Hold me.

282
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,230
I'm talking to you!

283
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,750
What are you doing here?

284
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,910
Oh, meeting your lover in secret.

285
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,050
I thought you were thieves.

286
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Go away!

287
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,720
Get going!

288
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,440
Princess.

289
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,750
Using someone and then discarding them

290
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,880
is not a good habit.

291
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,200
Now

292
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,610
we're even.

293
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,640
Continue.

294
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,040
Madam,

295
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,410
the princess is here.

296
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,040
Your Highness, you've come unexpectedly.

297
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,440
What brings you here?

298
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,420
Kneel.

299
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,590
Did I tell you to rise?

300
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,540
My aunt's coffin
has now arrived in Daqing.

301
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,520
But I thought it over.

302
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,320
Lord Zhou and my aunt
were husband and wife.

303
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,850
My aunt's memorial tablet

304
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,720
should be placed
in the ancestral hall of Zhou's Mansion.

305
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,640
Mrs. Zhou,

306
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
what do you think?

307
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,100
Well...

308
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,880
This goes against proper etiquette.

309
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,480
I cannot make this decision.

310
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,310
I must

311
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,830
consult with the master first.

312
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,950
What if I insist
that you make this decision?

313
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,310
I...

314
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,880
I would still prefer
to wait for the master's return to decide.

315
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,720
Mrs. Zhou,

316
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,070
I want

317
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,350
my aunt's memorial tablet

318
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,280
placed in the Zhou's Mansion's
ancestral hall now.

319
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Madam Wang

320
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,960
was only a concubine
in the Zhou's Mansion.

321
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,350
I dare not rashly...

322
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,800
-You...
-Madam.

323
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,840
What?

324
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,690
You dare to defy me?
