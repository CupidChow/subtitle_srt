[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,130
Your Highness, I can't give you

3
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,150
the response you want.

4
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,850
Why do you

5
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,950
always push me away?

6
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,990
Your Highness.

7
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,190
You're awake.

8
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,280
Why are you here?

9
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,090
Princess, were you frightened

10
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,890
by yesterday's assassination?

11
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,010
We've been through together
for several times,

12
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,930
I think you know

13
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,889
I'm not the type of woman who would be

14
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,090
thrown into panic
by an assassination.

15
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,830
Indeed.

16
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,120
Shu has captured the assassin.

17
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,740
I believe there will be some clues soon.

18
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,740
The assassin was targeting me.

19
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,060
Could the mastermind this time

20
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,990
be different from my previous life?

21
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,960
Things are getting more complicated.

22
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,420
I need to find a way to get out of here
with Xi as soon as possible.

23
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,250
Yesterday,

24
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,880
I saw you staring at this for a long time.

25
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,890
So I bought it.

26
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,610
I want to give it to you.

27
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,020
Yesterday is already gone.

28
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,110
What's missed

29
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,910
shouldn't be clung to.

30
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,610
I don't understand
why you keep denying your feelings.

31
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,950
But my intuition

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,920
won't be wrong.

33
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,150
I've always believed

34
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,850
that people destined to meet

35
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,550
will eventually reunite.

36
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,150
So will

37
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,890
the things meant to be together.

38

Where is Fu Wei, the Princess of Daqing?

39

Shu.

40
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,019
What are you going to do?

41
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,550
Princess, who did you think

42
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,100
was behind Yesterday's assassination

43
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,780
and what was their purpose?

44
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,170
It seems Crown Prince Shu

45
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,640
has had a conclusion.

46
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,260
I have already investigated

47
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,720
the one behind the assassination.

48
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,280
It was you, Princess Fu Wei.

49
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,909
Shu, you must be joking.

50
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,170
How could Princess

51
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,640
order an assassination on herself?

52
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,470
Yan,

53
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,650
his target

54
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,190
was me.

55
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,700
So you've had evidence then?

56
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,550
This is a secret letter I found

57
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,190
carried by the assassin,

58
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,990
bearing the seal of Daqing.

[Assassinate Crown Prince Shu
at the Lantern Carnival]

60
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,720
If Crown Prince Shu
truly believed this,

61
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
you wouldn't have come to me, right?

62
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,540
You know it's a frame-up,

63
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,910
but you can't suppress your doubts.

64
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,510
I don't believe it, of course.

65
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,080
But I don't trust you either.

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,820
Since the moment you entered
the Imperial City of Qingzhou,

67
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,080
everything has something to do with you.

68
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,680
Your Highness,

69
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
the imperial marriage decree has arrived.

70
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,960
Princess Fu Wei of Daqing

71
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,640
is to be married to Crown Prince Li Shu.

72
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,159
Please accept the decree, Your Highness.

73
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,130
Married to the Crown Prince?

74
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,730
Father!

75
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,050
Father.

76
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,730
I think

77
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,110
Shu is the Crown Prince of Yunrui.

78
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,850
But Fu Wei

79
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,140
is a foreign princess.

80
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,860
She's not the most suitable candidate

81
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,220
for the Crown Princess.

82
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,820
Crown Prince.

83
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,240

86
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,370
Think twice

87
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,650
before answering me.

88
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,640
You are the heir to Yunrui.

89
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,670
You should know which weighs more,
state affairs or personal feelings.

90

91

I...

92
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,360
I know

93
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,280
why you surrounded Zhou's Mansion
with troops today.

94
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,010
Let me remind you of something.

95
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,040
A sword

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,800
is only reliable

97
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,250
when it is held in your own hands.

I

99
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,980
will obey your orders, Father.

Father, please

104
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,970
reconsider your decision.

105
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,530
Please let Fu Wei

106
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,930
marry me instead.

107
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,320

109

You are my son,

and a general of Yunrui.

111
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,040
You should have great ambitions

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,220
and protect our country.

113
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,750

Don't kneel here.

116
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,290
Kneel outside!

117
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,760
You may rise

118
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,320
when you realize your mistake.

119
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,600
Father, you taught me

120
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,380
that if I want something,

121
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,750
I should strive for it with all my might.

Let go of me.

128

00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,550
I approve.

177
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,550
Thank you, Your Majesty.

178
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,320
Since I cannot refuse,

179
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,610
I have to accept.

180
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,100
Following heaven's will

181
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,310
can also change one's fate.

182
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,850
Fu Wei.

183
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,840
I have already accepted
the marriage arrangement.

184
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,690
From now on,

185
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,860
I am the Crown Princess of Yunrui.

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You should forget

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,730
whatever happened between us.

188
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,770
Please

189
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,940
bear in mind who you are.

190
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,000
Do not overstep your boundaries.

191
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,410
Are you truly willing

192
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,110
to accept this marriage?

193
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,430
Can you really

194
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,280
let everything between us go?

195
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,910
Look at me.

196
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,090
Look at me.

197
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,240
About all that happened in the past,

198
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,370
I have already forgotten completely.

199
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,930
I am willing to marry Crown Prince Shu.

200
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,740
Prince Yan, please let me go.

201
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:24,970
Fu Wei.

202
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,300
Fu Wei.

203
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Fu Wei.

204
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,740
Fu Wei.

205
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,390
Yan.

206
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,990
In this lifetime,

207
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,570
we cannot be entangled anymore.

208
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,630
Only by staying away from me,

209
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,480
can you survive.
