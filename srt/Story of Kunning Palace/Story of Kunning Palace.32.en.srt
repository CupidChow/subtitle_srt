As long as I can take over Ning'an Palace,

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm willing to pay any price.

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,460
Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

The cinnabar imperial brush determines one's life and death.

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,870
Everything

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,410
is like a dream.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,550
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,860
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,660
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,540
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,150
There are things

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,020
you can't give me.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,300
But he can.

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,090
To keep my life,

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,940
only you, Sir, can help me.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,300
Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

18
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,010
But I'm the only one who can't.

19
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,420
I want to do my best to make up for

20
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,180
my past regrets and wrongdoings.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,520
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,020
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,150
Welcome, Your Highness.

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,970
Welcome, Your Highness.

25
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,289
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

26
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,220
Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

27
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,280
But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,900
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,590
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,660
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,570
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,870
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,450
A life of absurdity, a story of mistakes and regrets.

36
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,310
Your mother

37
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,640
is not feeling well today.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,910
Let me send you off.

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,770
Let's go.

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,720
Wait.

41
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,380
My Lady.

42
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,690
Are you feeling better?

43
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,350
Look.

44
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,940
Our daughter is leaving.

45
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,210
She changed into the clothes you gave her.

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,080
It means she has you in her heart.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,050
This amulet

48
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,380
is an extra I got from Baiguo Temple

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,710
a few days ago.

50
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,650
Keep it with you.

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,600
May it keep you safe.

52
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,300
Remember.

53
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,990
When you're out there,

54
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,510
you must be careful with your words and actions.

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,410
Don't cause any trouble.

56
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,140
Most importantly,

57
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,390
don't disgrace the Jiang family's reputation.

58
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,470
Understand?

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,700
Alright.

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,520
You obviously couldn't bear to see her go.

61
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,410
Why couldn't you say something nice instead?

62
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,579
Ning.

63
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,510
I must tell you the truth.

64
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,600
She didn't

65
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,210
get you this amulet on a whim.

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,820
She got this for you

67
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,890
a few months ago

68
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,060
and kept it with her.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,950
She was just too prideful

70
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,130
to take it out.

71
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,300
My Lord.

72
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,620
Actually, I was against

73
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,850
your decision to leave.

74
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,250
It was not easy for me

75
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,760
to reunite with you after we were separated for so long.

76
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,860
How can you be so heartless

77
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,460
and leave just like that?

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,490
Don't you know your personality?

79
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,329
At home,

80
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,370
everyone gives in to you.

81
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,470
But after leaving this door,

82
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,170
no one else will.

83
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,380
I don't want anything from you.

84
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,690
I just hope

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,430
you could be safe

86
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
and sound.

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,290
All these years,

88
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,550
I know I've caused a lot of trouble

89
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,840
and made you and Father worry.

90
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,150
I just didn't know

91
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,970
how to let go.

92
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:49,650
I didn't know how to tell you my feelings.

93
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,710
I didn't know how

94
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
to be close to you like my elder sister.

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,850
It's actually my fault as your mother.

96
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,050
I didn't know

97
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,670
how to face a stubborn

98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,580
and sensitive child.

99
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,950
You refused to listen when I was too slack.

100
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,470
But you retaliated

101
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,050
when I was too strict.

102
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,080
When I see you,

103
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,110
I think that

104
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,080
we both have the same temper.

105
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,920
You can't blame me for that.

106
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,860
You gave birth to me.

107
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,880
Of course, I'm like you.

108
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
That's right.

109
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,110
You gave birth to her.

110
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,830
Of course she resembles you.

111
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,170
Ning, you too.

112
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,130
If you had understood this sooner,

113
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,500
you would not have argued with your mother so much.

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,409
It gave me so much headaches.

115
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
The scar left back then...

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,620
Although it has faded,

117
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,830
it still left a scar on Mother's heart.

118
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,160
Now that I'm leaving, I...

119
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't know when I can return.

120
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,920
I can't be filial to you.

121
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,360
I'm afraid I'll make you sad again.

122
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,740
Parents never keep score

123
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,340
with their children.

124
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,380
Your father is right.

125
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,520
The child has grown up.

126
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,240
She has her own way to go.

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,610
Since you've made up your mind,

128
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,040
just go.

129
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,750
But remember,

130
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,340
when you're out there,

131
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,330
no matter if you're tired,

132
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,750
jaded, or hurt,

133
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,580
your home

134
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,860
will always be open to you.

135
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,550
Your father and I

136
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,740
will always be your backup.

137
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,300
All right, go.

138
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,280
Get in.

everything in the capital?

169
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,300
With your help,

170
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,070
I've hidden it from my family.

171
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
I've talked to Fangyin too.

172
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,580
She's very good at

I can rest assured too.

176

The most important thing now

177
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,790
is my promise to Her Highness.

178
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,390
I must welcome her back with this sack of homeland soil.

195
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,840

197

199

Where is this?

200
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,690
I studied the map on the carriage.

201
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,810
♫But it's not you and me in the end♫

202
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,520
This place is in the northwest.

203
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,290
That mountain terrain

204
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,310
is dangerous.

205
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,030
♫I really want to ask you♫

206
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,980
Maybe we can use that to escape the chase.

207
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,820
What kind of mountain is so cold?

208
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,040
♫Why?♫

209
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,230
It's like we're in winter.

210
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,200
Why does it feel like it's about to snow?

♫From now on, will you and I measure♫

215
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,800

♫The abyss-like distance between us♫

217
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,720
Moving on,

218
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,340
we have to travel on foot.

219
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,230
What about Dao Qin and Jian Shu?

220
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,010

Don't worry.

223
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,400
With their skills,

224
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,830
as long as they don't need to protect us,

225
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,670
those people

226
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,600
are no match for them.

227
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,030
I left marks along the way.

228
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,760
They should be able to find us soon.

I didn't bring any medicine with me.

If you fall and hurt yourself,

240
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,030
it'll be harder for you to walk.

I don't mean...

256
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,680

♫Have we even met?♫

260
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,660

♫The abyss-like distance between us♫

265
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,620

266
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,380

♫The reflection of time will one day♫

268
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,940
they shouldn't have been able to catch up this quickly.

269
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,400
In that case,

270
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,380
♫Engulf you and me♫

271
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,650
they are likely assassins sent by the Xue family.

272
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,470
They found out you were protecting the Yan family,

273
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,810
so they decided to attack you?

274
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
It's hard to say for now.

275
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,940
But since they have sent assassins after us,

276
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,890
they won't stop so easily.

277
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,480
They must have planted deadly traps

278
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,240
on the usual path to the border.

279
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,830
Then where should we go now?

280
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,640
We'll take a detour to Datong Mansion,

281
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,060
and then head to the border.

282
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,790
Do you know how to get there?

283
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,610
The Datong Mansion is on the west of this mountain.

284
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,660
We just need to cross this mountain.

285
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,960
What?

286
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,830
Are you scared?

287
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,470
I'm not.

288
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm just a little tired,

289
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,490
so I'm stretching my legs.

290
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,510
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

291
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,080
This mountain is dangerous and filled with beasts.

292
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,480
Even those killers

293
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,610
may not dare to come in.

294
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,190
But we're taking this path?

295
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,320
No beast is more dangerous than human beings.

296
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,550
Let's go.

297
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,200
Sir, what's wrong?

298
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,550
Nothing.

299
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,060
The weather is getting worse.

300
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,140
I'm afraid the weather is about to change.

301
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,270
It's fine if it rains.

302
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,839
But if it really snows...

303
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,750
Let's find a cave for tonight.

304
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,000
We'll get going tomorrow.

305
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,290
Let's go.

306
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,930
Sir.

307
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,020
The fire is ready.

308
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,110
Come and warm yourself.

309
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,800
Sir?

310
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:44,930
Sir.

311
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,310
Sir!

312
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,340
Why is it so hot?

313
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,120
When did he

314
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,570
get bitten?

315
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,350
There's no time to think about it.

316
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,380
Sir.

317
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,910
You didn't pass out from the poison?

318
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,580
Are you still afraid of dead people?

319
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,040
I was just resting on my back.

320
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,310
Did the same quack

321
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,230
who taught you to cut your wrist and feed me your blood

322
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,900
teach you to detoxify snake venom this way?

323
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,010
The snake's venom is weak.

324
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,480
Besides, I've already sucked the venom out just now.

325
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,570
If you could first tell the difference

326
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,460
between fainting

327
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,990
and resting,

328
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,330
maybe your mediocre medical skills

329
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,100
can hurt fewer people.

330
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,970
We're already in this situation,

331
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,100
but you're still in the mood

332
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,940
to make fun of me with matters of the past?

333
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,260
No matter how bad my medical skills were,

334
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,920
I didn't kill you, did I?

335
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,460
Weak venom is still venom.

336
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,200
Look, you're having a fever.

337
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,500
We're in the middle of nowhere,

338
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,980
let's hope the past won't repeat itself.

339
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,380
You loved the qin so much.

340
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,960
Back then, on the way to the capital,

341
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,420
you protected the qin even at the critical moment.

342
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,650
What are you doing?

343
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,360
Today, you ruined another good qin because of me.

344
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,200
In the future, I will choose a better one

345
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,320
to compensate for your loss.

346
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:23,760
Compensate?

347
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,480
Do you really want to get even with me

348
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,450
and calculate our every exchange clearly?

349
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,700
I...

350
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,300
It's getting late.

351
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,640
Get some rest.

352
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,380
We have a long distance to cover tomorrow.

353
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,860
If the same thing as back then happens again,

354
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,660
just abandon me.

355
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,440
Escape by yourself

356
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,610
and go as far as possible.

357
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Don't look back anymore.

358
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,840
Miss Jiang!

359
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,770
Mr. Xie!

360
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,270
Dao Qin, I found the horse.

361
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,320
How is it?

362
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,200
Did you find them?

363
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,190
He must have left a mark for us.

364
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,310
Search carefully.

365
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,820
Oh no. Hurry!

366
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,290
We must find him as soon as possible.

367
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:31,950
Let's go.

368
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,880
Hurry!

369
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,710
Sir!

370
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,720
It's okay.

371
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,570
Take your time.

372
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,010
You have a long way to go.

373
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,230
You've always been smart, Fei.

374
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,530
I believe

375
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,070
you will master this.

376
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,990
Mother, when I finally master this song,

377
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,160
you'll be the first person I play it for.

378
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:33,760
Here.

379
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,020
Let me teach you.

380
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,930
Your Majesty.

381
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,850
The Imperial City has been breached.

382
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,340
We can't hold it any longer.

383
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,660
Please open the secret passage

384
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,940
and hide in the underground palace.

385
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,330
The rebels have given the final notice to the capital.

386
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,080
If no one shows up

387
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,230
and Lord Pingnan continues to kill the innocent,

388
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,830
won't it stir up civil unrest?

389
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,610
By then,

390
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,120
even if we expel the rebels and suppress the rebellion,

391
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,500
how do you know it won't cause turmoil in the court?

392
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,650
How will the righteous people

393
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,050
of this world criticize the royal family?

394
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,790
But Your Majesty,

395
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,830
he hasn't even celebrated his seventh birthday.

396
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,690
How old do you think the Crown Prince is?

397
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,940
Do you want my son to die?

398
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,960
Then why must my son die instead?

399
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,990
Because my son is the ruler.

400
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,330
My son is the ruler.

401
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,890
He is a subject.

402
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,610
It's natural for the subject

403
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,870
to die for the ruler.

404
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,620
Because he is more dignified than your son.

405
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,070
because your son is inferior!

406
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,090
Your Majesty.

407
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:58,950
Your Majesty!

408
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,720
Your Majesty!

409
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,770
Fei.

410
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,150
Dingfei.

411
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,970
Dingfei.

412
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,240
What are you doing?

413
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,010
Let go of me!

414
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,630
Mother!

415
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,500
-Dingfei.
-Fei.

416
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,190
Here.

417
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,120
Fei.

418
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,820
Don't go there.

419
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,930
Come to me, come to your aunt.

420
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,280
Let go of me!

421
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,010
What's wrong?

422
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,810
Can't sleep?

423
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,730
Great.

424
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,530
I have something to discuss with you.

425
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,230
According to the sages in the books,

426
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,170
the subject

427
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,660
should be loyal to his ruler,

428
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,640
right?

429
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,880
Now,

430
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,460
there are bad people outside.

431
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,000
They want to capture the Crown Prince.

432
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,730
You are the Crown Prince's study partner

433
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,080
and his cousin.

434
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,570
You are about the same age.

435
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,410
You've been in the palace since young.

436
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,410
You are familiar with everything in the palace.

437
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,320
You know your manners and how to present yourself too.

438
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,390
So...

439
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,990
So I

440
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,610
want you to pretend to be the Crown Prince.

441
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,860
Are you willing?

442
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,250
No!

443
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,070
Your Majesty.

444
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,130
There must be another way.

445
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,660
I...

446
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:11,970
Dingfei.

447
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,540
You've been smart since young,

448
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,940
and you're most sensible.

449
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,230
So,

450
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,420
you should know how to give and take.

451
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,860
Look at your mother.

452
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,620
She has been locked up here for days.

453
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,470
She's suffocating and going crazy.

454
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,250
You should know how to protect your mother,

455
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,010
understand?

456
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,590
Aunt,

457
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,430
I'm willing to go on behalf of the Crown Prince.

458
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,600
As his servant,

459
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,220
I'm willing to go on behalf of the ruler.

460
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,640
Good child.

461
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,590
Good child.

462
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,710
Hurry.

463
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,450
Go find your mother.

464
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,510
Go now.

465
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,700
Fei.

466
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,500
You're not going anywhere.

467
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,440
Fei.

468
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,450
Look at me.

469
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,240
I won't let you go anywhere.

470
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,400
You listen to me the most,

471
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,540
right?

472
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,250
Mother.

473
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,330
Don't be afraid.

474
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,990
I have this.

475
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,320
Mother.

476
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,670
Mother!

477
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,110
Mother!

478
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,840
Mother!

479
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,530
Mother!

480
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,180
Mother!

481
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,410
Mother.

482
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,310
Why is he burning up even more?

483
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,520
It's snowing now.

484
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,790
What should I do if his dementia acts up again

485
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,890
when he wakes up?

486
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,170
Dingfei will go.

487
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,980
Dingfei will go.

488
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,320
Dingfei will go.

489
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,270
Dingfei will go.

490
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,450
Mother.

491
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,020
Dingfei?

492
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,980
Mother, don’t be afraid.

493
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,240
You are Shen Lang?

494
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,650
I am!

495
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,040
Ning'er.

496
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,740
Don't be afraid, Sir.

497
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,390
I'm here.

498
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,380
Sir, it's okay.

499
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,230
Why?

500
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,230
I'm so bad.

501
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,810
Why are you so soft-hearted?

502
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,700
You should have left.

503
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,250
You shouldn't have stayed here.

504
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,170
It's too late

505
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,120
for you to leave now.

506
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,350
Too late.

who those people were?

672
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,220
We've checked their clothes and weapons.

673
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,370
Though they deliberately disguised themselves,

674
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,720
they were most likely Xingwu Guards.

675
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,180

676
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,250

No matter what,

678
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:50,850
we'll go to the border first.

687
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,070

688
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,900

Don't you know that this is bad for you?

Why do you hurt your body this way?

693
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,620
People like you

694
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,060
shouldn't be controlled by medicine.

695
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,010
Dementia may be difficult, but it's still a sickness of the mind.

696
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,250
There must be other ways to cure it.

697
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,170

00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,850
What help?

711
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,790
Can't you tell?

712
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,020
Tell what?

713
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,700
I'll do it myself.

714
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,380
You were so scared.

715
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,420
Why did you still try to protect me?

716
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,460
I couldn't possibly

717
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,030
watch you get torn apart by the bobcats.

718
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,440
You haven't repaid me yet.

719
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,080
Didn't you say that you didn't care

720
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,460
for such things back in Lord Linzi's Mansion?

721
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,170
But now I do.

722
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,770
Can’t I?

723
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,950
Did Xue Yuan send those assassins?

724
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,160
Yes.

725
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,530
Does he really want to kill you?

726
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,530
Are you really asking about Xue Yuan,

727
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,460
or is there something else?

728
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,250
What else can I ask about?

729
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,070
I just want to know

730
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,750
what to do next.

731
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,060
We'll depart in a while.

732
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,020
We'll take the side path to the border

733
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,910
and meet with Yan Lin there.

734
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,700
Duke.

735
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,650
The soldiers we sent out

736
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,570
failed to carry out the assassination.

737
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,310
And...

738
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,900
We also lost track of Xie Wei.

739
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,130
A bunch of losers.

740
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,610
Can't you even do this right?

741
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,790
Did Xie Wei report the incident to the authorities

742
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,090
or send news

743
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,750
to the capital?

744
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,080
No.

745
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,140
It seems

746
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,980
there is something more important

747
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,020
waiting for him to deal with

748
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,020
at the border.

749
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,060
Send someone to Huangzhou

750
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,510
to see how the Yan family's father and son are doing.

751
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,790
Yes, Duke.

752
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,450
♫The story seems to be about me♫

753
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,680
Mother.

754
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,170
Dingfei will go.

755
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,280
Mother,

756
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,860
Dingfei will go.

757
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:30,830
♫I love this bitter happiness too♫

758
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,250
Dingfei will go!

759
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,640
If he is the real Xue Dingfei,

760
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,970
♫I shall embrace my last loneliness♫

761
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,050
what kind of torture must he have endured

762
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,720
to survive in Jinling?

763
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,610
When he returned,

764
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,330
how painful it must have been

765
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:43,150
♫ And not focus on the ending ♫

766
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,030
for him to face the Yan and Xue family.

767
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:43,080
He is the one

768
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,530
without a day of peace

769
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,830
and a night of good rest.

770
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:49,450
♫How many times have I jumped over that cliff♫

771
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,670
♫A fate of conspiring with love is too twisted♫

772
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:02,460
♫Even if it's a whirlpool of darkness♫

773
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,470
Jiang Xuening.

774
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,120
Won't you

775
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,880
die here

776
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:03,640
with me?

777
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,460
♫I'm willing to fall for you♫

778
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:16,140
♫I tried to escape like a shooting star♫

779
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,550
♫Being enemies with love is just a weak excuse♫

780
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,230
♫But when I hold fate tight in my hands♫

781
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,670
♫I miss out on you instead♫
