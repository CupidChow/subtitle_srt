00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,540
Speaking of that night,

42
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,590
I heard that you met with Junior Preceptor Xie

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,670
after you left Tai'an Hall.

44
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,980
Besides,

45
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,950
I also heard that

46
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,820
the two scholars Junior Preceptor Xie kicked out of Hanlin Academy

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,360
both punished you before.

48
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,820
It seems what Zheng Bao said is true.

49
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,310
Is the Xue family trying to frame Xie Wei?

both the Yan family and I will suffer.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,350
Actually, I also feel that

55
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,590
the way Junior Preceptor Xie treats me is a bit different.

56
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,340
What do you mean?

57
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,280
He is close to my father.

58
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,400
I met him a few times at home before.

But somehow,

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,910
things became more different since I entered the palace.

61
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,750
You know what, Your Majesty?

62
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,760
Junior Preceptor Xie even asked me to learn how to play the qin from him alone.

63
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,980
How inappropriate.

64
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,250
Why are you laughing at me, Your Majesty?

65
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,670
I only told you about this, Your Majesty.

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,990
You can't let others know.

67
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,190

Since you're here to be a study partner,

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,500
you should focus on your studies.

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,470

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,140

really childish.

If it weren't me who thought for Official Xie,

79
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,690
he wouldn't be able to get married any time soon.

Everyone says Shen Lang is paranoid.

81
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,330

Yes.

97
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,190
I've returned the marriage certificate.

When I have time in a few days,

99
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,430

to send back the engagement gifts the Yao family gave me.

Because of you,

108
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,260
the Ministry of Justice has greatly offended the Xingwu Guards.

109
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,909
Now that Minister Yao appreciates you

110
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,070
and wants you to marry his daughter,

111
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,770

If you offend him,

115
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,590
your life in the Ministry of Justice will be very hard.

116
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,810
I got my job here through official examination.

117
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,980
I have no intention of becoming a high-ranking official or earning a high salary.

118

If the Ministry of Personnel dismisses me for private matters,

119
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,909
I'll go back to the local government of my hometown

120

Stop right there!

155
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,430
I'm grateful that you took the risk

156
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,650
and entered the palace to save me last time, Mr. Chen.

157
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,110
But I have to remind you.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
Do you know

159
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,420
how Zhang Zhe became an official in the court

160
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,440
from a civil servant?

161
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,620
I only know that he got in through official examination.

162
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,440
I didn't inquire about it any further.

163
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,150
Zhang Zhe was born poor.

164
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,400
In order not to put more burden on his widowed mother,

165
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,690
he gave up the imperial examination and took the official examination instead.

166
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,970
The so-called official examination

167
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,540
is not for recruiting formal officials.

168
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,770
It's usually for emergencies, and when the emergencies are dealt with, those temporary officials will be laid off.

169
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,700
But Gu Chunfang, Investigating Censor of the Jibei Circuit,

170
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,150
has sharp eyes.

171
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,230
He loves Zhang Zhe's talent,

172
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,210
made an exception and recommended him to the court.

173
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,660
Gu Chunfang is not only

174
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,910
a talent scout to Zhang Zhe,

175
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,230
but he also helped him clear his father's name.

176
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,780
The relationship between these two is nothing casual.

177
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,160
So Mr. Gu assigned Zhang Zhe to the Ministry of Justice

178
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,740
on purpose?

179
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,250
Mr. Gu has been working outside the capital for many years.

180
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,870
He will return to the capital soon,

181
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,620
and the position of the Minister of Justice has been vacant for years.

182
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,930
Does His Majesty intend to let Mr. Gu...

183
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,169
Mr. Xie, you're so observant.

184
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,390
You even know so well about a low-ranking official.

185
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,159
It's really admirable

186
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,590
that you think 10 steps ahead when you take one step.

187
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,360
You're flattering me, Mr. Chen.

188
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,100
It's only because I'm also quite curious

189
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,450
about Mr. Zhang.

190
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,750
If you have any news about Mr. Zhang in the future,

191
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,100
please also exchange information

192
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,950
with me, Mr. Chen.

193
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,000
No problem, Sir.

194
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,730
I, Chen Ying, am willing to do anything for you, Sir.

195
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,150
Miss. Miss.

196
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,460
Miss, you're finally back.

197
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,590
What's wrong? Did someone treat you badly?

198
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,660
This morning,

199
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,430
a lot of rewards were sent from the palace.

200
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,420
His Lordship asked someone to inquire about it

201
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,100
and got to know that you suffered a lot in the palace.

202
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,220
Lian'er is worried about you.

203
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,470
I'm back safely, right?

204
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,620
Let's go. I'll greet father

205
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,020
so that he doesn't have to worry anymore.

206
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,380
Greetings, Father and Mother.

207
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,190
I'm your daughter Xuening.

208
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,030
It's good that you're back.

209
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,010
What exactly happened in the palace?

210
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,630
Tell us about it.

211
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,740
Look at you.

212
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,430
You should have informed us

213
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,310
about such an important matter.

214
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,110
Do you know

215
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,000
how worried your mother, your sister and I

216
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,240
have been?

217
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,330
I just don't understand.

218
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,700
There are so many study partners in the palace.

219
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,360
Why do you have to be the one that causes trouble?

220
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,280
Maybe you should ask her

221
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,170
what she has done herself.

222
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,630
-Alright.
-Mother.

223
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,260
I am asking, aren't I?

224
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,780
I knew it.

225
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,940
Back then,

226
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,100
I didn't agree when you wanted to enter the palace.

227
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,660
With your temper,

228
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,830
you'll only cause trouble by acting recklessly.

229
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,890
Look.

230
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,190
Now that something happened, you finally learned your lesson.

231
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,070
I've always been reminding you

232
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,910
to follow the rules in the palace.

233
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,730
But you

234
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,680
never took it seriously.

235
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,870
Xuening.

236
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,030
Can't you take care of your own life

237
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,590
and stop letting the whole family worry about you?

238
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,490
Save me some trouble, okay?

239
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,040
So in your eyes,

240
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,930
everything is my fault, Mother?

241
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,470
You never fail

242
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,630
to surprise me.

243
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,550
How can you talk to me like that?

244
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,910
-Alright. Alright.
-What kind of attitude is that?

245
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,990
Stop it. Enough.

246
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,740
Ning, you just came back from the palace.

247
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,410
You must be tired.

248
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,630
Go back to your room and have a rest.

249
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,180
Come on. Take her back to rest.

250
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,550
Look at her.

251
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,450
How can she be like this?

252
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,290
Alright. Leave her alone.

253
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,870
Look.

254
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,060
Look at them.

255
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,460
Was that a cat seeing a mouse

256
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,020
or a tiger seeing a pig?

257
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,950
Do they have to eat each other alive or what?

258
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,630
Mother.

259
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,930
You're here.

260
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,350
Are you still angry?

261
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,600
I heard a saying.

262
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,850
It goes, "Love well, whip well."

263
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,170
I don't understand what it means.

264
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,560
Can you explain it to me, Mother?

265
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,240
You've learned how to

266
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,110
beat around the bush.

267
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,590
Mother.

268
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,860
Actually, we only heard about

269
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,800
what happened to Ning in the palace.

270
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,940
We didn't see it with our own eyes.

271
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,880
So it might not be Ning's fault.

272
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,560
I know it might not be her fault.

273
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,430
But don't forget

274
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,130
that is the royal palace.

275
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,140
What kind of place is that?

276
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,040
That's a place where

277
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,590
your life is at risk all the time.

278
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,710
If anything goes wrong,

279
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,700
you may get executed.

280
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,750
But look at her temper.

281
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,170
If she were half as disciplined and steady as you,

282
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,850
I wouldn't have to be like this.

283
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,250
Actually, Ning is becoming more sensible

284
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,510
as she gets older.

285
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,420
I think maybe you should worry less.

286
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,070
Since you brought the matter of age up,

287
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,620
you're right on the point.

288
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,540
Come here.

289
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,780
Since you two have both grown up,

290
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,180
it's time to start thinking about your marriages.

291
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,620
But look at her temper.

292
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,960
I'm so worried.

293
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,870
What kind of family would want her?

294
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,730
Mother, don't worry.

295
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,150
Father has made a lot of friends in the court.

296
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,200
He will find someone nice for Ning.

297
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,950
Don't worry too much.

298
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,680
Alright, let's not talk about her for now.

299
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,590
Let's talk about you.

300
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,610
Given your condition,

301
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,360
it shouldn't be hard for you

302
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,970
to marry into a good family.

303
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,330
But now,

304
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,620
you're more or less affected by your sister Ning.

305
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,960
What should I do?

306
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,490
Marriage is predestined. It can't be forced.

307
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,110
What's coming will come.

308
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,750
Look at you. You're always like this.

309
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,400
People will take advantage of you.

310
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,820
When everything's perfect, that's when losses come. But when you're at a loss, that's when opportunities come.

311
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,240
Losing is a blessing.

312
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,120
Look at you.

313
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,370
You're even more eloquent than me.

314
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,460
[Caution]

315
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,220
Father.

316
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,560
I knew you'd come to see me.

317
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,620
Come here.

318
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,140
Caution means worry.

319
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,770
Father, are you worried about the relationship between the Jiang family and the Yan family?

320
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,950
As for the case of rebellious phrases in the palace,

321
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,070
Empress Dowager Xue did try to use me

322
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,790
to frame the Yan family.

323
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,860
Fortunately,

324
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,210
Mr. Zhang from the Ministry of Justice

325
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,860
has cleared my name.

326
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,340
The matter in the palace have been solved.

327
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,030
But a few days ago,

328
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,970
something happened to the Yan family as well.

329
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,070
Did you hear about it in the palace?

330
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,670
From my point of view,

331
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,030
although it's unknown why Marquis of Yan got hurt,

332
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,790
the Xue family locked down the city that very night to search.

333
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,410
That means the relationship between the two families

334
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,130
has become as incompatible as water and fire.

335
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,650
You've grown up even more after going to the palace.

336
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,160
You can see around corners and find out the truth.

337
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,440
The grudges between the Yan and Xue families

338
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,990
have been accumulated for 20 years.

339
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,100
There's a lot of bad blood between them.

340
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,710
I'm afraid it's hard to resolve.

341
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,030
Besides...

342
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,020
Father, you're talking about

343
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,510
Viscount Dingfei, right?

344
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,950
I heard the story of 300 Loyal Souls.

345
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,540
It's said that the Yan and Xue families broke up after this.

346
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,370
But I think

347
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,450
many of the details are unreasonable.

348
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,770
Do you know what happened exactly back then, Father?

349
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,770
Back then,

350
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,200
Lord Pingnan

351
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,850
massacred the palace

352
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,380
when the former emperor was critically ill.

353
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,530
Many stories were told

354
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,840
by the only survivors.

355
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,330
You know.

356
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,020
Many things people say are untrustworthy.

357
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,890
Later, as erroneous information spread,

358
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,690
the truth got totally mixed up with the rumors.

359
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,180
It's hard to tell the truth.

360
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,270
What we know is that

361
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,920
the former emperor died of severe illness.

362
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,270
The young emperor ascended the throne and the Empress Dowager became the regent.

363
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,300
She assisted the Xue family.

364
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,640
It was only a few years ago when His Majesty got married that he got his rule back.

365
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,840
And these are the only facts

366
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,570
we can see with our own eyes.

367
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,260
Now the Xue family's forces are everywhere.

368
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,150
Is there really no solution

369
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,650
to the Yan family's plight?

370
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,920
Yan Lin

371
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,950
is your childhood friend.

372
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,120
Although every time he came here,

373
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,660
he'd climb over our wall

374
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,450
and I'd scold him every time I saw him.

375
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,970
But in fact, I quite like him.

376
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,700
He's good at both literature and martial arts.

377
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,420
He's different from those playboys

378
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,510
in the capital.

379
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,490
I thought you would get married sooner or later.

380
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,200
But now it seems

381
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,020
this marriage is not going to happen.

382
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,410
I'm worried that you'll take it too hard

383
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,630
and you'll be sad.

384
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,510
But I promise you.

385
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,260
If you are willing,

386
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,290
I'll find you someone new.

387
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,060
I won't let my daughter suffer.

388
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,650
No matter what happens in the future,

389
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,200
you won't get involved again.

390
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,710
Father, don't worry.

391
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,880
I only take Yan Lin as a friend.

392
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,400
We're not in love.

393
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,410
And I definitely don't want to get married hastily because of this.

394
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,640
I beg to ask you a favor, Father.

395
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,550
I'm indebted to Yan Lin.

396
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,600
If the Yan family really gets in trouble,

397
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,560
I want to do my best to help.

398
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,180
I won't get our family implicated.

399
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,190
Please agree to my unreasonable request, Father.

400
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,420
Good.

401
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,860
Good.

402
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,780
I thought

403
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,350
you were still that thoughtless little girl.

404
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,130
I didn't expect you to become so sensible

405
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,960
and grateful.

406
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,260
I'm really glad.

407
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,590
I promise you.

408
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,630
If I have a chance to speak

409
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,210
in the court,

410
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,590
I'll choose to side with the Yan family.

411
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,950
Duke.

412
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:02,870
Who's that?

413
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,060
Over there.

414
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:06,880
Go after him!

415
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,220
Yes.

416
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,910
Go after him!

417
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,840
Duke.

418
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,720
[Dear Lord Pingnan]

419
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,250
God is indeed on my side.

420
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,300
Guards. Into the palace.

421
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,020
Yes.

422
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,710
[Imperial Study]

423
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,060
Greetings, Your Majesty.

424
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,480
Duke.

425
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,650
Official Xie, take a look at this.

426
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,990
Duke of Xue received a secret report today.

427
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,670
Someone handed in this half of a letter

428
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,340
between Marquis of Yan and Lord Pingnan.

429
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,420
This is a crime of treason.

430
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,600
What do you think is the appropriate punishment for this, Official Xie?

431
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,210
In my opinion,

432
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,470
we don't know where this half letter came from.

433
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,000
And according to the letter,

434
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,120
it's just someone asking Lord Pingnan

435
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,790
about Viscount Xue's premature death.

436
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,280
There's no Yan family's official seal

437
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,990
or words of treason in it.

438
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,680
It shouldn't be regarded as solid evidence.

439
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,560
If someone with ulterior motives

440
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,430
says this letter was written by Duke of Xue,

441
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,480
it also makes sense.

442
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,740
Are you suspecting that the Xue family colluded with the enemy, Junior Preceptor?

443
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,680
Or are you suspecting that

444
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,360
I'm framing the Yan family?

445
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,240
Everyone knows how loyal you are, Duke.

446
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,090
What I meant is that

447
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,890
since there's a first half of this letter,

448
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,590
there should be a second half.

449
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,260
Why don't we give the Ministry of Justice more time to search?

450
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,300
When they find the second half of the letter

451
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,680
with the Yan family's official seal or the signature of Marquis of Yan,

452
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,220
we can convict the Yan family more justly.

453
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,750
Everyone knows Yan Mu is full of wild ambitions.

454
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,470
Why do we need more evidence?

455
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,280
Your Majesty.

456
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,290
The Ministry of Justice has been in charge of the Rebels Case for a long time.

457
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,380
There has been no progress at all.

458
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,900
And now there's a fuss

459
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,030
over Ruyi jade in the palace.

460
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,280
It shows that

461
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,120
the rebels have infiltrated the palace with the Yan family's help.

462
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,430
If this goes on,

463
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,090
I'm afraid

464
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,680
it will cause great trouble.

465
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,820
Your Majesty.

466
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,590
You've waited for 20 years.

467
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,720
It'll just take a few more months. There's no need to hurry.

468
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,060
Why should we wait?

469
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,630
If Yan's troops

470
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,780
join forces with Lord Pingnan's army to attack the capital,

471
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,890
it will be too late.

472
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,320
Alright.

473
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,990
Official Xie is right.

474
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,850
To shut people's mouths,

475
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,910
we need a justifiable reason.

476
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,560
But since it concerns the foundation of our country,

477
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,530
I can't make any mistakes.

478
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,900
From now on,

479
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,340
the Yan family will be confined in their mansion

480
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,790
and cooperate with the investigation of Xingwu Guards.

481
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,530
Before the truth is revealed,

482
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,690
we can't allow any threat.

483
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,790
Uncle.

484
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,480
You must find

485
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,840
the remaining half of the letter as soon as possible

486
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,170
and find out the truth.

487
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

488
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,210
[Yan Mansion]

489
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,630
Xue Ye.

490
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,410
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

491
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,150
You came at the right time, Viscount Yan.

492
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,100
Open your eyes and see clearly.

493
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,740
The Yan family colluded with the rebels of Lord Pingnan.

494
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,660
From now on, you'll be confined in your mansion,

495
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,030
and you must cooperate with Xingwu Guards' investigation.

496
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,550
Go look after Father.

497
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,470
Don't let this disturb him.

498
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,790
I'll take care of this.

499
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,110
Yes.

500
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,930
What are you waiting for?

501
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,040
Hurry and get your dogs out of the way.

502
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,250
I want to go in and search.

503
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,350
Mr. Xue,

504
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,100
His Majesty’s order

505
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,440
only requested the Yan family to cooperate with the investigation,

506
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,790
and it did not convict the Yan family of any crimes.

507
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:39,510
[Mansion of Marquis of Yan]

508
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,510
The Yan family has been innocent and loyal for generations.

509
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,400
The truth will eventually be revealed.

510
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,410
Before that,

511
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,450
I will not tolerate

512
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,360
you guys wrecking havoc under my family's roof.

513
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,820
Alright, Yan Lin.

514
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,600
Don't you dare think that I'll let you go so easily.

515
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,540
All of you in the Yan family

516
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,750
are just barely surviving.

517
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,240
When Xingwu Guards find the evidence,

518
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,940
I'll kill your whole family.

519
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,640
Well then, let's wait until Xingwu Guards find the evidence.

520
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,540
Before that,

521
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,520
the Yan family is still innocent and loyal.

522
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,510
No one can slander us.

523
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,780
Keep an eye on them.

524
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,650
Not even an ant shall escape.

525
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:10,840
Yes.

526
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,950
Why did he suddenly

527
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,720
suddenly pass an order?

528
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,250
We've been investigating the rebels for so long.

529
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,100
I don't know if we'll be implicated.

530
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,700
It's really a fight between the immortals,

531
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,740
but you and I suffer in the end.

532
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,710
Mr. Zhang, say something.

533
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,370
I am just in charge of investigating the case.

534
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,920
I have nothing to do with any other matters.

535
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,950
You still want to continue investigating the case?

536
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,270
Didn't you hear from His Majesty?

537
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,310
The Yan family is under the jurisdiction of Xingwu Guards.

538
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,810
Besides, it's not easy for you to be summoned by His Majesty today.

539
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Your career looks promising.

540
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,070
You need to stop investigating any further.

541
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,230
No way.

542
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,700
The investigation into the rebels is already showing some clues.

543
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,210
Wouldn't it be unfavourable for the case if we hand it over to others now?

544
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,000
It seems like Mr. Zhang

545
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,040
is blaming His Majesty?

546
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,420
It seems that you guys at the Ministry of Justice is dissatisfied with the imperial edict.

547
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,240
Mr. Yao, you must have been mistaken.

548
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,330
We were just talking about official matters.

549
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Please be generous,

550
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,540
and not take issue with our words.

551
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,120
I've been in charge of the Ministry of Personnel for decades.

552
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,730
I know how to differentiate between personal and official matters.

553
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,660
Mr. Zhang,

554
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,060
you might think that you are talented.

555
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,650
But if you want to have a real foothold in the court,

556
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,860
I'm afraid

557
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,540
you need more practice.

558
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,330
Yes, yes.

559
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,740
He has always been acting arbitrarily.

560
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,720
I don't know how many people he has offended.

561
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,750
Last time, His Majesty blamed us for the Xingwu Guards incident.

562
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,230
It was resolved all thanks to your kind words.

563
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,250
All of us at the Ministry of Justice were very thankful.

564
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,060
Am I right, Zhang Zhe?

565
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,470
Thank you.

566
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,590
Thank you.

567
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,220
You are welcome.

568
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,900
Look at you.

569
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,580
What a good marriage it could have been,

570
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,040
alongside a great official career.

571
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,040
You just have to ruin it for yourself, don't you?

572
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,530
I work with my heart.

573
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,300
I intend to work hard and pursue a career in this position.

574
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,770
I will continue to investigate the rebels.

575
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,540
As for my personal matters,

576
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,440
please don't mention it again,

577
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,420
so as not to ruin a girl's reputation.

578
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,150
Okay, I'm just being nosy.

579
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,740
Why are you still investigating?

580
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,160
Zhang Zhe.

581
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:20,900
A letter?

582
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,370
Where is this letter from?

583
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,930
Wasn’t it forged by the Xue family?

584
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,820
No.

585
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,100
Up to now,

586
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,640
I have never stolen His Lordship's official seal.

587
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,840
That half of the official seal

588
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,770
was shot at the Duke's Mansion with an arrow.

589
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,940
As for who was behind it,

590
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,370
even the Duke himself has no idea.

591
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,490
If your previous investigations were correct,

592
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,520
and Marquis of Yan had indeed corresponded with Lord Pingnan,

593
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,950
then this half of the seal

594
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,590
would naturally be from the rebels.

595
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,750
Yes, I think so too.

596
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,390
It's useless to say anything now.

597
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,540
Someone in the shadows is trying to stir up the capital.

598
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,280
It's hard to guard against it.

599
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,580
Marquis of Yan is still recuperating.

600
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,300
If Xingwu Guards continue to attack,

601
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,980
I'm afraid it'll affect his health.

602
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,490
Do you have any solutions?

603
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,510
Mr. Zhou,

604
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,330
people who waver never end well

605
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,590
since the ancient times.

606
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,580
Now that you're on my boat,

607
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,390
you should walk with me till the end.

608
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,620
Isn't it too late for you

609
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,630
to turn to the Xue family?

610
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,010
You worry too much.

611
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,730
We've been on the same boat for a long time.

612
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,050
You steer the ship while I'm the oar.

613
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,240
But the only reason the oar can still carry the boat

614
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,540
is because it's not broken.

615
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,450
Since investigating the Yan family,

616
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,440
the Duke has repeatedly pressed me.

617
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,300
If I don't get any more reliable information,

618
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,690
the Duke will definitely suspect me.

619
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,590
When it comes to a suspicious piece of trash,

620
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,560
the Duke will not only discard it,

621
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,110
but will also get rid of it.

622
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,310
Without me as the oar,

623
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,150
who will be the next one?

624
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,570
Are you trying to say that

625
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,910
without the oar, the ship will go astray?

626
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,040
And without you,

627
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,340
I may not be able to

628
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,670
control whoever comes next?

629
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,520
You're exaggerating.

630
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,610
That's not what I meant.

631
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,570
Then tell me,

632
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:04,880
what are your plans?

633
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,040
From today on,

634
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,850
if there's any information that I have managed to find out about the Yan family,

635
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,840
I will also present it to the Duke,

636
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,010
after informing you about it.

637
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,870
Mr. Zhou,

638
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,960
I heard there is the role of a banker in the casino.

639
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,930
This person is observant and alert,

640
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,780
and likes to take advantage of everybody.

641
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,430
I admit that

642
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,880
Zhou Yinzhi is a person who is greedy for wealth and power.

643
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,980
But I dare not,

644
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,770
and I don't have what it takes to be the banker.

645
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,110
Today, I promise you that

646
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,470
you will be the first to know

647
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,830
any information regarding the Yan family, ahead of the Duke.

648
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,130
Then I ask that Mr. Zhou,

649
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,760
you remember your promise.

650
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,810
Zhou Yinzhi.

651
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,370
This time,

652
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,160
don't let me down again.

653
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,780
Miss, are you moving?

654
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,080
Why are you packing things up?

655
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,890
You guys came at the right time.

656
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,570
How much cash do we currently have?

657
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,000
Including your monthly salary

658
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,090
and His Lordship's allowances over these few years,

659
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,730
as well as the gifts sent to you

660
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,910
during festivals and your birthday,

661
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,450
and then deducting the 400 taels you took the last time,

662
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,210
there is about 300 taels left.

663
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,440
So little?

664
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,070
What about these?

665
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,580
How much would these be worth

666
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,530
if we pawned or sold them?

667
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,470
Miss, what are you talking about?

668
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,810
How can a lady from a rich family

669
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,220
sell away her jewelry and treasures?

670
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,420
Not to mention, most of these are given to you by His Lordship and Madam,

671
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,160
or Viscount Yan.

672
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,090
Even if you were to pawn it,

673
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,540
no one will accept

674
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,070
so many at once.

675
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,900
Miss, are you in some trouble lately?

676
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,890
Maybe you can ask His Lordship for help.

677
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,760
He's always loved you. He won't leave you alone.

678
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,370
It's not yet the time to alarm Father.

679
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,170
How about this, Tang.

680
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,010
You secretly go to You Mansion,

681
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,020
give some money to the servant at the back door,

682
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,750
and ask him to send a message to Fangyin.

683
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,920
Tell her I will be waiting for her at Julai Inn.

684
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,510
Sir, you haven't slept all night.

685
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,640
How about you get some rest first?

686
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,750
No need.

687
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,610
Tell Chen Ying

688
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,610
to arrange a banquet for his colleagues at a restaurant.

689
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,980
I want to meet Zhang Zhe.

690
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:13,880
Yes.

691
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:16,870
By the way,

692
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,180
Have you found Deputy Gong Yi?

693
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,280
We've searched the capital.

694
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,440
There is no trace of him.

695
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,320
Then search along the water and land, towards the perimeter.

696
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,680
It took him so much effort.

697
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,900
He won't leave so easily.

698
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,970
Yes.

699
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,880
What about Ning? Any news about her?

700
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,270
She's fine.

701
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,550
She went home yesterday on her day off.

702
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,840
She then went to meet Zhou Yinzhi today.

703
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,060
She's busier than an official.

704
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,330
Zhou Yinzhi?

705
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,980
It looks like she already knows about the Yan family.

706
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,600
Tell the doorman

707
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,240
not to stop her if she comes to look for me.

708
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,170
Yes.

709
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,590
[Julai Inn]

710
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,120
Take a look.

711
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,540
With a capital of only 400 taels,

712
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,060
even if you managed to earn four times more, that's just 1,600 taels.

713
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,580
At maximum, you should only have 2,000 taels if we include your capital.

714
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,270
Where did you get these 2,500 taels?

715
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,910
I only earned 1,600 taels from selling my accessories.

716
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,260
But after I sold the silk,

717
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,470
Mr. Xu insisted to give me a bit more no matter what.

718
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,420
So...

719
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,830
Xu Wenyi gave you money?

720
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,190
Mr. Xu was afraid that I would be taken advantage of as an outsider to the industry,

721
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,030
so he only gave me 30% of his silk.

722
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,700
He sold the rest

723
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,910
to someone surnamed Lyu

724
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,850
at last year's market price.

725
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,350
Then, the price of silk shot up.

726
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,510
They managed to sell

727
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,590
all the silk back in their hometown,

728
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,560
and made a lot of money.

729
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,370
The sericulturists and him were very happy.

730
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,750
At first, he actually insisted on giving me an additional 1,000 taels.

731
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,660
I wouldn't change my mind,

732
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,760
and I persuaded him for a long time,

733
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,510
before he finally agreed to give only 500 taels.

734
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,950
Actually, they want to thank you.

735
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,920
The way you are now,

736
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:52,900
you seem to be doing well.

737
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,830
But,

738
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,390
you told Xu Wenyi that the silk price would rise?

739
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,150
When I first went there,

740
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,180
I knew nothing,

741
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,270
so I told him.

742
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,670
But don't worry,

743
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,950
I didn't mention your identity.

744
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,260
He asked me who you are,

745
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,670
but I didn’t tell him a single word.

746
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,540
You asked You Fangyin to buy Xu Wenyi's raw silk.

747
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,960
Was it also for the Yan family?

748
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,510
But I am more interested to know

749
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,210
why you so firmly believe that

750
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,050
the price of raw silk will definitely rise?

751
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,250
Is that how he knew?

752
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,530
You said

753
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,850
the person who bought the silk with Xu Wenyi is called Lyu...?

754
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,470
Lyu...

755
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
Lyu Xian! Lyu Xian!

756
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,820
It's that unscrupulous businessman, Lyu Xian.

757
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,680
He's in cahoots with Xie Wei?

758
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,830
Miss,

759
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,370
did I cause you trouble?

760
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,350
If this news gets out,

761
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,900
it will indeed cause trouble.

762
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,640
But this time, fortunately,

763
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,960
only he found out.

764
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,190
He...

765
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,840
Don't worry, it's over.

766
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,260
Let's consider 500 taels as your capital.

767
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,690
We'll split the rest evenly between the both of us.

768
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,610
Take this 1,500 taels.

769
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,360
What are you doing?

770
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,980
I know I'm stupid.

771
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,590
I dare not bother you.

772
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,090
But, you were the one who came up with this money-making idea.

773
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,469
Even if you want to send me away,

774
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,639
I will not accept the money.

775
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,469
What are you thinking?

776
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,920
I gave you money,

777
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,100
because I want you to have an easier life in the You family.

778
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,420
You Yue will be returning home in a few days.

779
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,889
If you don't have a bit of money,

780
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,370
I'm afraid you can't even come out to meet me.

781
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,310
Well,

782
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,080
I'll take just one piece.

783
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,760
You should take the rest back.

784
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,100
That won't do.

785
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,550
Then you're going to lose your capital.

786
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,060
Take it.

787
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,210
The capital is yours too.

788
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,630
Next time.

789
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,610
I'll try harder next time,

790
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,100
and make a lot of money for you.

791
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,550
Silly girl.

792
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,720
Fangyin,

793
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,350
I don't want to stand on ceremony with you.

794
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,740
This time,

795
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,090
it's true that I urgently need money to settle a matter.

796
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,350
But this matter

797
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,040
is not something that can be settled with 1,000 or 2,000 taels.

798
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,240
I asked to meet you here today,

799
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,730
because I would like you to help me with another deal.

800
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,070
Are you willing?

801
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,700
But this time,

802
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,190
can you share with me the secrets of buying and selling?

803
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,490
I've been learning accounts from Mr. Xu for a long time.

804
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,420
Perhaps, I can offer some advice.

805
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,680
[Yao Mansion]

806
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,100
Take them away.

807
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:51,940
Father,

808
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,530
are all these from the Zhang family?

809
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,340
Father, are you angry

810
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,110
because the Zhang family's betrothal gifts are not enough?

811
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,680
The Zhang family is poor.

812
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,520
The betrothal gifts are just a formality.

813
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,120
I don't mind.

814
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,010
I hope Father you can...

815
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,030
Shut up!

816
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,290
Open your eyes and look carefully.

817
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,090
This is the engagement letter returned by the Zhang family.

818
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,580
Now, they have also returned

819
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,580
all the engagement gifts.

820
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,930
Break off the engagement?

821
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,150
How is this possible?

822
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,500
How is this possible?

823
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,180
Tell me,

824
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,290
what did you say and do in the palace?

825
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,600
How dare you try to ruin a man's honor

826
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,920
and reputation?

827
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,490
What have I taught you

828
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,150
growing up?

829
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,970
Have you lost all your upbringing?

830
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,630
It's not me.

831
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,750
Mr. Zhang already knows

832
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,940
what you've been up to.

833
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,680
He said nothing about you

834
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,440
only because he wanted to preserve your dignity.

835
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,470
I only learned of what you did

836
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,450
from someone else.

837
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,680
How could you do

838
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,860
such a stupid thing?

839
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,890
Zhang Zhe has been holding back for so long.

840
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,030
Before this,

841
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,870
I was so hard on him.

842
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,780
I really shouldn't have.

843
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,700
Father...

844
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,430
Don't call me Father!

845
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,820
You've thoroughly disgraced

846
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,560
the Yao family.

847
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,880
Father!

848
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,590
Please.

849
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,700
A toast to you, alright.

850
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,610
Mr. Li, let me pour it for you.

851
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,400
Here.

852
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,980
Come on, don't be shy.

853
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,560
Come on. Drink!

854
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,850
It's good wine. Let's eat.

855
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,940
Come on.

856
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,940
Good food with good wine.

857
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,110
Let's not talk about official matters.

858
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,910
Let's just eat.

859
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,370
Mr. Zhang.

860
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,750
Come, let's have a drink.

861
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,730
-Come on.
-Mr. Chen.

862
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,310
I have something to do at home.

863
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,100
I will get going.

864
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,470
Mr. Zhang,

865
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,490
you don't have your own family. What can happen?

866
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,440
Our colleagues from the Ministry of Justice are all here.

867
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,100
We rarely come out for a drink.

868
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,290
Don't spoil the mood.

869
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,030
Come on, cheers to Mr. Zhang.

870
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,780
Here, Mr. Zhang.

871
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,110
Mr. Zhang, a toast to you.

872
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,360
I never drink.

873
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,910
Drink it by yourselves first.

874
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,490
Just do me a favor.

875
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,190
Stay for another hour.

876
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,970
Tomorrow, I'll write your warrants,

877
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,260
and let you continue investigating the case on the rebels.

878
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,760
What do you think?

879
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,730
I don't like this place.

880
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,940
I will wait outside.

881
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,060
He's going out for a moment.

882
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,320
It's okay. Let's drink.

883
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:42,950
Here.

884
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,280
Okay.

885
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,050
It's suddenly raining so heavily.

886
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,190
It's raining.

887
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,900
I don't know where the carriage is.

888
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,200
Please wait here.

889
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:53,920
I'll be right back.

890
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,450
[Julai Inn]

891
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,430
[Liuxi Pavilion]

892
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,450
Zhang Zhe, Vice Minister of Justice.

893
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,780
You are the one who has been

894
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,620
making things difficult for Zhou Yinzhi in court,

895
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,590
and said that I colluded with the officials.

896
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,400
We are just avoiding the rain.

897
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,100
Why don't you dare to face me?

898
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,270
Are you afraid I'll eat you up?

899
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,780
Forgive me, Your Highness.

900
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,050
I'm just an outsider.

901
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,180
I dare not offend you.

902
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,600
Please look after yourself, Your Highness.

903
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,680
Why are you still here?

904
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,320
I thought you'd rather get wet

905
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,970
than

906
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,530
be under the same roof as me?

907
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,380
I wouldn't dare to ask Your Majesty to move.

908
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,170
But I also have a message for Your Majesty.

909
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,670
You must know that a man who is greedy for his own profit, and who seeks the skin of a tiger,

910
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
does not know that the tiger is a tiger.

911
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,810
That's because he's born with a vicious nature that doesn't change.

912
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,950
If you seek a tiger's skin today,

913
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,890
you will be devoured by a tiger someday.

914
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,400
Your Majesty, take care.

915
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,230
Hurry up.

916
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,930
What a heavy rain.

917
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,370
♫We made a promise♫

918
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,860
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

919
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,970
Miss, are you okay?

920
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,470
The carriage is over there.

921
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,130
♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

922
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,310
The rain is getting heavier.

923
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,430
Let's go back.

924
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,520
♫Without you♫

925
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,570
♫Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winter♫

926
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,630
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

927
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:28,110
♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

928
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,450
I heard she's been going out a lot lately.

929
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,710
What has she been up to?

930
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,370
I am not sure either.

931
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,510
What's the point of raising you if you don't know anything?

932
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,230
I'd like to see what that bitch

933
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,080
is up to.

934
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,320
Come here.

935
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,040
I'll take you to a nice place.

936
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,170
Sit down.

937
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,660
Let me introduce.

938
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,330
This is the most trusted person of His Majesty,

939
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,940
Xie Wei, Mr. Xie.

940
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,530
I know.

941
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,420
But I am sorry Mr. Xie,

942
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,580
I can't help you with your request.

943
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,150
I didn't say anything.

944
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,770
Xie Ju'an, from Jinling.

945
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,510
Five years ago, he won three consecutive awards at the imperial examinations.

946
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,760
When he entered the palace, he took the position of the Crown Prince's Junior Preceptor.

947
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,200
He's been in court for four years,

948
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,030
and has made friends with the Ministry of Justice.

949
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,830
The recent case of the rebels

950
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,690
took a turn for the worse last night to this morning.

951
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,330
Then you asked Mr. Chen

952
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,150
to meet me.

953
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,700
There's no need to say anything more about how it all connects.

954
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,120
It is said that

955
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,110
Mr. Zhang is very capable in solving cases.

956
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,130
You live up to your name indeed.

957
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,220
Mr. Xie, no need to flatter me.

958
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,900
If you want to get something from me,

959
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,290
or you want me to do something,

960
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,260
you should say no more.

961
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,040
The only thing that

962
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,450
I believe in is justice.

963
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,180
With these words from Mr. Zhang,

964
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,690
I’m relieved.

965
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,940
The Ministry of Justice and Xingwu Guards

966
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,810
are all involved in the Rebels Case,

967
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,930
and there are interdependent trade-offs.

968
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,940
I’m just worried that the truth

969
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,680
will get foggy and be lost.

970
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,710
Mr. Xie, you seem convinced that there is injustice in this case?

971
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:30,860
That is what you, Mr. Zhang, should investigate.

972
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,280
I just know

973
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,800
the rebels committed crimes repeatedly in the capital.

974
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,020
Although it seems unrelated,

975
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,750
there must be some cause and effect.

976
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,020
If the plan succeeds,

977
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,920
I'm afraid it'll be a repeat of the Lord Pingnan's case from 20 years ago.

978
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,070
That is not what I would like to see,

979
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,500
and I am sure that's not what you want either.

980
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,090
I will investigate the case,

981
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,870
but it has nothing to do with others.

982
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,730
Junior Preceptor Xie, you don't have to look for me anymore.

983
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:58,640
Goodbye.

984
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,930
You...

985
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,350
I have told you before.

986
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,790
He's a cesspit of a rock.

987
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:05,990
If it was not for the fact that Mr. Gu

988
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,110
is about to take office,

989
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,080
I would have kicked him out of the Ministry of Justice.

990
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,730
A sharp sword

991
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,480
will have its time and place to prove its worth.

992
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:13,790
Besides,

993
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,720
doesn't the court need people

994
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,860
who don't form cliques?

995
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,800
Yes.
