00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,200
As long as I can take over Ning'an Palace,

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,380
I'm willing to pay any price.

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,410
Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,590
The cinnabar imperial brush determines one's life and death.

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,810
Everything

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,650
is like a dream.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,510
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,820
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,690
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,450
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,160
There are things

13
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,110
you can't give me.

14
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,230
But he can.

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,080
To keep my life,

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,990
only you, Sir, can help me.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,340
Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,860
But I'm the only one who can't.

19
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:20,370
I want to do my best to make up for

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,190
my past regrets and wrongdoings.

21
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,479
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,990
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

23
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,150
Welcome, Your Highness.

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,000
Welcome, Your Highness.

25
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,300
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

26
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,030
Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,180
But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,789
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,600
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,680
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,650
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,740
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,470
A life of absurdity, a story of mistakes and regrets.

[Episode 38]

36
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:07,910
Miss Jiang.

37
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,020
I had no choice.

38
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,430
The Duke forced me.

39
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,920
He knew I was helping you and Junior Preceptor Xie.

40
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,530
If I didn’t do this,

41
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,690
he'd have killed me.

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,940
Only you know

43
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,840
that You Fangyin is on my side.

44
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,980
If it weren't for your betrayal,

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,270
how would the Xue family know about her?

46
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,300
I'm guilty.

48
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,530
It's all my fault.

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,880
But have you forgotten how much I've helped you

50
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,030
all this time?

51
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,760
For the Yan family's matter,

52
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,180
if it weren't for me,

53
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,180
Marquis Yan and Viscount Yan would have long been dead!

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,240
Shut up!

55
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,950
Among

56
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,890
all the numerous conspirators in the world,

57
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,660
you're the worst.

58
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,550
I told you long ago

59
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,060
that one who changes one's loyalty frequently won't end well.

60
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,910
The most regretful thing

61
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,750
in my life

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,610
is trusting you again

63
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,990
for Yan Lin.

64
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,930
Dao Qin.

65
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,780
Kill him!

66
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,810
You can't kill me!

67
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,910
Jiang Xuening!

68
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,980
You can't kill me.

69
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,450
The Xue family...

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,100
The Xue family has launched the palace coup.

71
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,120
Xie Wei will definitely die today.

72
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,660
If you kill me,

73
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,060
no one will work for you anymore.

74
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,170
In your heart,

75
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,830
everyone is connected by interests.

76
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,650
Do you think I won't kill you

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,220
just because you're of value to me?

78
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,540
Listen.

79
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,370
Your life

80
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,150
is nothing compared to You Fangyin's.

81
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,690
Kill him!

82
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,450
Jiang Xuening!

83
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,990
Sir, this way.

84
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,850
Sir.

85
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,810
You...

86
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,260
What's wrong?

87
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,850
It's just an old injury.

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,100
It's no big deal.

89
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,070
This is the token given by His Majesty.

90
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,730
You can enter the palace at will.

91
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,760
With it,

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,440
you can deploy the Yan's troops from outside the city

93
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,870
to help you pacify the rebellion.

94
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,530
Why are you helping me?

95
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,090
People aren't all good or all bad.

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,850
Xie Wei bears the righteousness of a sage.

97
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,720
But in order to protect some people

98
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,150
and to deal with some people,

99
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,110
he had to disguise himself

100
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,580
and do those so-called bad things.

101
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,580
But I hope you can see

102
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,630
his original intention

103
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,660
and persistence.

104
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,570
I was initially suspicious

105
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,410
of Junior Preceptor Xie's character.

106
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,810
I've also tried testing his character.

107
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,470
Someone like him

108
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,000
shouldn't just die in a petty conspiracy like this.

109
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,210
Because someone like you

110
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,170
shouldn't just die here like this.

111
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,470
Let's go.

112
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,670
Mr. Xie.

113
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,520
No.

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,260
I should call you Dingfei.

115
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,900
I really didn't expect

116
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,860
that you've been hiding

117
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,170
under my nose for so many years.

118
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,140
You're really capable.

119
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,420
You’re indeed my son.

120
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,390
It’s just that you’re still one move behind.

121
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,980
Today, at this place,

122
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,890
it's still the two of us, father and son.

123
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,260
I didn't kill you back then.

124
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,720
That's why there are so many disasters in the present.

125
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,090
You lived 20 years more than you should.

126
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,930
It can also be considered as God's mercy to you.

127
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,500
Junior Preceptor Xie.

128
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,300
What does Duke Xue mean by this?

129
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,960
Back then,

130
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,760
it was in this Imperial City

131
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,580
where Xue Yuan went against Marquis Yan's plan

132
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,980
and rushed to attack the city first

133
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,440
in order to seize power and the top position,

134
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,050
resulting in great bloodshed.

135
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,410
Even the innocent children

136
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,020
weren't spared.

137
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,700
Everyone knows that Lord Pingnan

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,130
is shameless and violent.

139
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,080
But little do they know that Xue Yuan

140
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,400
is also a deceitful and inhumane man with a false reputation.

141
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,340
He...

142
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,350
is also a sinner of the State of Qian who should be condemned.

143
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,830
That's where you're wrong.

144
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,730
A person's nobility depends on God's will.

145
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,590
If commoners want to climb up the social ladder,

146
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,940
they still need the help of those high-ranking nobles.

147
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,460
Either as a slave or a minister,

148
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,360
you should make good use of your life, talents,

149
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,480
and everything else you have to offer.

150
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,730
What's wrong with that?

151
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,440
For a neglected commoner who had nothing like me

152
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,540
to have come this far,

153
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,310
it's because I've been gradually building towards my goal

154
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,190
and willing to sacrifice everything I had.

155
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,940
That's how I could establish such a great cause.

156
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,000
So what if it's millions of people,

157
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,460
innocent children,

158
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,780
and my biological son whom are implicated?

159
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
Even if I had to do it again,

160
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,990
I'd still do the same!

161
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,960
Nonsense!

162
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,770
You never

163
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,030
sacrificed yourself

164
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,190
but others.

165
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,240
Twenty years ago,

166
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,180
you even abandoned

167
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,990
your own son and wife.

168
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,110
In the future,

169
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,380
won't you abandon

170
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,690
those who work for you?

171
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,570
Deep down, other than concern for the Yan family,

172
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,900
do you still remember that your last name is Xue?

173
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,310
Since you're an insatiable ingrate,

174
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,940
why should I be merciful to you?

175
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,130
Then what about my mother?

176
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,100
She never betrayed you.

177
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,500
She treated you wholeheartedly.

178
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,320
But what about you?

179
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,760
You only treated her and the Yan family as stepping stones!

180
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,980
At this point,

181
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,780
what's the point of talking about this?

182
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,040
Anyway,

183
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,750
all of you must die here today.

184
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,270
Guards!

185
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,430
Kill them all!

186
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,650
Mr. Xie used to

187
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,190
hide in the palace's underground tunnel when he was a child.

188
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,780
He knows that the city's entrance leads directly to the palace.

189
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,830
Miss Jiang.

190
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,310
Are you okay?

191
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,630
Don't worry about me. 
Saving people is more important.

192
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,310
Okay, take care then.

193
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,090
Let's go.

194
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,290
Your Majesty.

195
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,310
It's time to take your medicine.

196
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,100
Jian Shu!

197
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,230
Duke, we've been tricked!

198
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,250
Capture Xie Wei!

199
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:07,870
Shoot!

200
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,380
Xue Yuan!

201
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,020
You’re doomed!

202
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,790
We've captured Xue Ye.

203
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,950
I advise you to surrender.

204
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,600
You set me up

205
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,640
and lured me here.

206
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,990
Your intention lies in

207
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,790
firstly, murdering His Majesty,

208
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,660
and secondly,

209
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,730
keeping an eye on me and Yan Lin.

210
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,670
But you neglected Tongzhou in the south.

211
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,430
His Majesty had secretly ordered

212
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,810
the Yan's troops' elites in Tongzhou

213
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,620
to hide in the palace's underground tunnel

214
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,300
and wait for the right moment to move in for the kill.

215
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,420
You didn't expect that

216
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,480
the secret tunnel of the past would have such an effect now, right?

217
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,830
Impossible.

218
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,590
I’d already sent my men to keep an eye on the palace.

219
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,430
You couldn't have had a chance to conspire with Shen Lang.

220
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,520
Your ambition is obvious.

221
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,250
Before I left the capital,

222
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,920
I'd already set up my plan with His Majesty.

223
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,750
Official Xie, is there anything else?

224
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,870
Your Majesty, please forgive me for deceiving you.

225
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,810
Deception?

226
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,310
Your Majesty, do you remember

227
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,700
the incident 20 years ago

228
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,870
in the palace's underground tunnel,

229
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,750
where we each wore a half of a pair of Tiger Head shoes?

230
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,870
You...

231
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,150
Uncle said

232
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,020
that one who can fight a tiger is a hero.

233
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,080
You and I each had a half of a pair of Tiger Head shoes.

234
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,240
You and I will each wear one shoe.

235
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,370
Then, both of us won't be afraid anymore.

236
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,060
Dingfei?

237
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,290
You...

238
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,750
You're the real Xue Dingfei.

239
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,670
Then that other...

240
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,330
No wonder.

241
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,450
No wonder the other Xue Dingfei

242
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,650
felt somewhat different from when he was young.

243
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,470
Even his personality was very different.

244
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,250
But

245
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,110
you've been back at the capital for many years.

246
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,490
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

247
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,900
Your Majesty.

248
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,350
I chose to reveal my identity to you now

249
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,780
in hopes that

250
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
you wouldn't let the Xue family take power again

251
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,420
because of your fear of the Yan family.

252
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,750
The Xue family

253
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,230
is the tumor of our country.

254
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,740
We have to get rid of them.

255
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,200
The Xue family is also your family.

256
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,550
You hired a substitute

257
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,670
and subdued the Xue family.

258
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,230
Are you still holding a grudge against the matter of 
being my substitute in the past?

259
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,780
And...

260
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,610
do you still hate me?

261
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,630
Your Majesty.

262
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,320
All these years,

263
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,540
I

264
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,780
did have a plan in mind.

265
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,140
But

266
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,070
it's not for my own grudge,

267
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,290
but for the martyrs who died in vain

268
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,770
and the Qian people back then.

269
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,550
Just like the people in the world,

270
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,050
you thought that all the 300 Loyal Souls died

271
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,390
because of Lord Pingnan's murderous nature.

272
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,840
Actually, that's not true.

273
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,110
Back then, to force you to show up,

274
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,070
Lord Pingnan did kill some people.

275
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,830
The remaining people

276
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,890
were used by Lord Pingnan

277
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,060
to threaten Xue Yuan to retreat.

278
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,650
But in order to take the credit for seizing that broken city,

279
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,900
he completely ignored the plan

280
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,700
he'd agreed upon with Marquis Yan beforehand,

281
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,290
and disregarded the lives of the soldiers in the front line

282
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,740
and the lives of the people in the city.

283
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,800
As a result, Lord Pingnan was enraged

284
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,650
and started a killing spree in the Imperial City.

285
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,710
Xue Yuan is responsible

286
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,790
for half of the crime back then.

287
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,089
They actually kept this from me for so many years.

288
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,170
Since then,

289
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,790
Xue Yuan became even more ambitious.

290
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,630
He not only formed a clique for personal gains and eliminated dissidents,

291
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,780
but also deceived everyone and raised private soldiers.

292
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,720
Because of the rise of military affairs,

293
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,319
he embezzled the disaster relief funds,

294
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,870
stole weapons and sacrificed human lives.

295
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,110
He even

296
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,420
raided Marquis Yan's mansion

297
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,780
on unfounded charges.

298
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,980
Not to mention countless other cases

299
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,950
where he monopolized power, acted arbitrarily,

300
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,210
and oppressed good people.

301
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,680
However, the Xue family is well established

302
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,880
and has an intricate network of relationships.

303
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,240
I'm afraid

304
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,630
that when you head to the border this time,

305
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,940
no one can defend you anymore.

306
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,100
The Xue family's disloyalty has begun.

307
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,860
The palace coup will be triggered.

308
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,100
By then,

309
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,200
no one can stop him.

310
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,420
To think that Xue Yuan is so ambitious.

311
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,760
I really raised a beast myself.

312
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,800
Your Majesty.

313
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,100
Your health...

314
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,330
Dingfei.

315
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,220
To be honest,

316
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,490
the imperial physician said

317
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,010
that

318
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,220
my days are numbered.

319
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,200
The future young monarch is frail,

320
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,950
but Xue Yuan owns an important army.

321
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,950
Externally, we have the strong enemy of the State of Yue,

322
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,070
and internally, we have Jinling watching us covetously.

323
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,040
What should my son do?

324
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,540
What would become

325
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,360
of the world?

326
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,060
Your Majesty.

327
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,490
We're

328
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,660
not at the end of our rope yet.

329
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:53,930
If you

330
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
can trust me,

331
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,030
I have a solution.

332
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,010
Go on.

333
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,680
On the surface, you'll issue an edict

334
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,940
for me to lead the Tongzhou garrison to the border for peace talks.

335
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,750
In secret,

336
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,060
with

337
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,200
your other edict,

338
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,190
I'll head to the border

339
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,060
to pardon Yan family's father and son of their crime.

340
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,150
At that time,

341
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,010
the two halves of the Yan's troops will reunite at the border.

342
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,340
They'll definitely dampen the State of Yue's spirit.

343
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,500
To settle the border into a ten-year period of peace,

344
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,090
this is one of the key points.

345
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,320
Secondly,

346
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,420
Jinling has been watching Tongzhou for many years.

347
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,160
They'll definitely take this chance when the troops are gone

348
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,750
to attempt to infiltrate the capital.

349
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,910
However,

350
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,570
Feng Mingyu is dead.

351
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,620
Lord Pingnan doesn't have many useful men left.

352
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,980
With his paranoid personality,

353
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,250
he'll most likely

354
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,450
personally take charge.

355
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:48,980
At that time,

356
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,660
Yan Mu, Yan Lin, and I

357
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,310
will use the troops at the border

358
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,990
to disintegrate Lord Pingnan's power.

359
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,490
Even so,

360
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,770
the capital will still be under the Xue family's control.

361
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,450
This...

362
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,430
So,

363
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,360
I need your cooperation in an act.

364
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,300
Give them ammunition

365
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
and appear weak to dispel their caution.

366
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,530
When confronted with a deadly situation,

367
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,170
one will fight to live.

368
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,290
It wasn't some forged edict

369
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,150
that pardoned the Yan family of their crimes

370
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,100
and let Marquis Yan and Yan Lin go to the border

371
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,620
to take over the military power of Yan’s troops

372
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,040
and send troops to the State of Yue to eliminate Lord Pingnan.

373
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,300
His Majesty

374
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,630
had already approved everything beforehand.

375
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,560
Every step was a part of the plan.

376
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,150
Do you think His Majesty didn't know

377
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,770
about your plan with Consort Xian to poison him?

378
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,370
It was just an act

379
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,660
so that you'd let your guard down.

380
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,670
Guards!

381
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,740
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

382
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,750
Take action!

383
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,660
Hurry up! Arrest her!

384
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,740
-Yes. 
-How dare you!

385
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,380
You set a trap

386
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,910
and lured me into it.

387
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,910
On the charge of treason,

388
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,340
you want to get rid of the Xue family once and for all!

389
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,070
You chose your own path!

390
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,430
Since you raised your private soldiers,

391
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,060
your ambition has long exceeded that of attaining the Duke position.

392
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,520
In that case,

393
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,170
why did His Majesty order me to come and have peace talks?

394
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,980
The crimes of the Xue family

395
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,690
has been kept under wraps for a long time.

396
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,090
I want to redress the injustice of the martyrs

397
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,420
and the civilians from 20 years ago.

398
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,820
We need an upright man like you, Mr. Zhang.

399
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,260
Killing three birds with one stone.

400
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,600
I admit

401
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:46,930
defeat.

402
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,330
But the only thing that comforts me

403
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,220
is that I lost to my own son.

404
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,040
So what if you win?

405
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,190
Even if I'm a heinous person,

406
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,340
I'm still your biological father.

407
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,590
As an official, ruler, father, or son,
each role has its own duties.

408
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,240
If you kill me,

409
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,370
you'll be killing your father.

410
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,310
How will you face the endless gossip from others

411
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,590
in the future?

412
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,520
Dingfei.

413
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,940
We're truly related by blood.

414
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,570
Between father and son,

415
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,670
there's no animosity that can't be overcome.

416
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,530
Why do you have to help Shen Lang?

417
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,170
Back then, Empress Dowager forced you out

418
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,490
with the threat of your mother's life

419
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,190
because of him.

420
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,270
Because of the so-called rule that

421
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,200
noble or lowly, officials should die for the emperor.

422
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,940
Don't you hate him?

423
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,700
Now,

424
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,720
the whole palace is under our control.

425
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,140
With my private soldiers

426
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,540
and your Yan's troops,

427
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,900
there's no one in the entire State of Yue who can stop us.

428
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,080
As long as we work together,

429
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,500
the Shen family can be easily taken down.

430
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,220
By then,

431
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,900
you can do whatever you want.

432
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,670
No one will have the right to talk to you about the so-called rule that

433
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,800
noble or lowly, officials should die for the emperor.

434
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,900
Xue Yuan.

435
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,590
Stop talking nonsense.

436
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,050
My brother is righteous.

437
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,350
How could he be incited by you?

438
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,910
I told you

439
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,420
that when I return to the capital,

440
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,980
I'll make you pay with your blood.

441
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,480
It's time to settle the score with you

442
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,780
for what you did to the Yan family.

443
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,730
Dingfei.

444
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,430
I'm your father.

445
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,760
Are you really going to kill me?

446
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,560
My last name is no longer Xue.

447
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,230
Kinship by blood, and gratitude for the one who raised me.

448
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,470
Today,

449
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,920
I will truly

450
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,070
return everything to you!

451
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,090
You're indeed a member of the Xue family.

452
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,340
You’re so cruel and merciless.

453
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,920
Xue Yuan.

454
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,110
Even if I don’t kill you,

455
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,190
your crimes in the past 20 years

456
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,640
are innumerable.

457
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,410
So, His Majesty will kill you,

458
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,650
the people will kill you,

459
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,880
and the law will also kill you.

460
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,330
When you die and end up in the netherworld,

461
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,580
in face of the numerous wronged souls

462
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,020
and my biological mother,

463
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:39,800
you...

464
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,960
will have to personally atone for your sins.

465
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,420
Mr. Zhang.

466
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,130
This case involves 20 years of interwoven complications.

467
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,140
It involves the royal family and the treacherous rebels.

468
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,340
Do you...

469
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,870
dare to take this case?

470
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,730
I, Zhang Zhe,

471
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,690
will live up to the law and the people.

472
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:44,960
Mr. Xie!

473
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,320
Xie Wei!

474
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,190
-Mr. Xie!
-Xie Wei.

475
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,340
Xie Wei.

476
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,380
Xie Ju'an.

477
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,170
Xie Wei.

478
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:47,820
You...

479
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,290
Open your eyes and look at me.

480
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,760
You can't die.

481
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,960
I haven't fulfilled my promise to you yet.

482
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,010
I still have to play the qin for you every day.

483
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,280
I still have to spend my future with you.

484
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,970
You can't die!

485
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,380
Xie Ju'an!

486
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,150
I promise I won't be willful anymore.

487
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,610
I promise I'll listen to you.

488
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,100
Don't abandon me.

489
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,230
W-When you wake up,

490
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,110
I'll marry you.

491
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,350
Okay?

492
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,210
Don't abandon me.

493
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,520
So,

494
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,240
only in this way

495
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,490
will you promise me.

496
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,380
I heard everything

497
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,950
you just said.

498
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,040
You can't go back on your word.

499
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,330
I won't.

500
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,900
Xie Ju'an.

501
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,430
Let's get married.

502
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,990
Okay.

503
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,020
The sinner Xue Yuan

504
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,020
colluded with the sinner Xue Shu

505
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,670
in a rebellion and launched a palace coup.

506
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,740
Although Xue Yuan died,

507
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,410
the nine familial exterminations should be carried out.

508
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,650
However, following the prince's birth,

509
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,610
His Majesty decided to show mercy.

510
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,180
Hence, he issued an edict stating that

511
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,050
the Empress Dowager, who belongs to the Xue family,

512
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,290
has indulged the sinner Xue Yuan

513
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,280
and the sinner Xue Shu in their plot to kill the emperor.

514
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,120
She has committed a grave mistake.

515
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,360
She's ordered to guard the imperial mausoleum

516
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,290
and banned from returning to the capital.

517
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,160
The sinner Xue Shu will be given poisoned wine.

518
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,450
The rest shall be exempted from the death penalty,

519
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,600
exiled to Huangzhou, and banned from returning to the capital.

520
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,670
Consort Xian.

521
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,530
I'm here to send you off.

522
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,180
This is His Majesty's order.

523
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,740
Please.

524
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,140
No.

525
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,510
I can’t die.

526
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,230
I am the legitimate daughter of the Xue family.

527
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,240
I am the Noble Consort of the State of Qian!

528
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,130
What are you waiting for?

529
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,710
Shen Lang promised me.

530
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,200
He can’t kill me!

531
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,060
He can’t kill me.

532
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,480
Shen Lang can’t kill me.

533
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,170
He can’t kill me.

534
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,150
[You family's ancestor, Immortal Fangyin]

535
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,770
In the 24th year of Wanzhen,

536
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,480
the state of Qian's Emperor Kang Jing passed away,

537
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,520
and Noble Consort Qin's son ascended the throne.

538
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,870
He appointed the Crown Prince's junior preceptor Xie Wei
as the Prime Minister

539
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,690
to assist the court.

540
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,490
Marquis Yan Mu,

541
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,640
Justice Minister Gu Chunfang,

542
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,680
and Minister of Personnel Yao Qingyu 
are appointed as the Ministers of Duty.

543
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,490
All officials should be united and assist the ruler

544
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,800
to stabilize the court and the country.

545
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,870
Don't cry.

546
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,500
Your belly is much bigger.

547
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,970
The scar is gone.

548
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,510
Yeah, somehow

549
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,870
the scar just suddenly disappeared.

550
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,949
Now that the scar is gone, my wound's also healed.

551
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,320
Are you having fun?

552
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,330
The sage.

553
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,600
The Emperor's teacher.

554
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,239
The loyal official.

555
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,100
The rebel.

556
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,790
Titles attributed to one.

557
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,870
At the end of the day,

558
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,060
who are you?

559
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,810
Even if you're in command of the entire world,

560
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,570
you're still someone

561
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,210
who should have died 20 years ago.

562
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,760
When you look back,

563
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,410
it'll be a comedy.

564
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,300
What is this emptiness

565
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,520
in this solitary world?

566
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,660
So what if you managed to calculate everything?

567
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,230
In the end, you don't want to keep anyone or anything.

568
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,640
Because you can't keep anyone or anything.

569
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
You've taken revenge

570
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,570
and paid your debts.

571
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,960
It's better to leave

572
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,180
as you came.

573
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,160
You owe a life.

574
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,930
You'll have to pay it back eventually.

575
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,190
The wind blows away

576
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,790
the heavy snow in the mortal world.

577
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,110
When the sage sees through it,

578
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,470
he can only die.

579
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,590
What's wrong?

580
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,480
I had a nightmare just now.

581
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,240
I dreamed of someone.

582
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,650
I dreamed of a saying.

583
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,350
He said

584
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,020
that if the sage sees through it, he can only die.

585
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,970
It's just a dream. Don't mind it.

586
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,080
Brother, the eyes are wrong.

587
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,740
Yes, Mother said

588
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,400
that Father has eyes like peach blossoms.

589
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,420
But this is a plum blossom.

590
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,580
It's the same thing.

591
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,250
He'll listen to Mother anyway.

592
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,110
But what if Father doesn’t like it?

593
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,420
You're still young. You don't understand.

594
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,230
Others listen to Father,

595
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,970
but others also listen to Mother.

596
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,980
And Father also listens to Mother.

597
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,980
So, Mother must be more powerful.

598
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,770
Brother, I was only born 30 minutes later than you.

599
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,110
You're still younger than me.

600
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,290
I don't want to hear it.

601
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:35,890
Not bad.

602
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,610
He's quite like you.

603
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:40,720
Come here.

604
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,900
Mother.

605
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,140
Yun.

606
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,350
Father.

607
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,470
A gentleman has to be dignified.

608
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,590
Who's bullying my Tian?

609
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,520
You're here.

610
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:55,350
Here.

611
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,570
Ning. Mr. Xie.

612
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,820
We're here to greet you for New Year's Eve.

613
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,760
It's enough that you're here.
Why did you bring gifts?

614
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,140
You're really insightful.

615
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,140
You chose to settle in such an idyllic place.

616
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,860
It's so peaceful.

617
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,130
Unlike the noisy capital.

618
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,300
Not only that,

619
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,760
they didn't even bring Dao Qin and Jian Shu.

620
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,150
They said they wanted them to live their own lives,

621
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,340
but I think

622
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:12,870
they just don't want them

623
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,710
to disturb their divine marriage life.

624
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,210
Mr. Zhang is here too.

625
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,560
Happy new year.
May all go well with you.

626
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,600
Thank you.

627
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,410
Alright, let's not stand around outside.

628
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,450
The food is ready.

629
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,180
Let's go inside.

630
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:24,930
Okay.

631
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,880
Father!

632
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,300
Father! Father!

633
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,950
Is that the Mr. Zhang who revised the law?

634
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,580
He's amazing.

635
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,570
Brother, why did you fall?

636
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,390
Father, you tripped me.

637
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,320
You're too young to walk steadily.

638
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,430
It's normal to fall down.

639
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,370
Let's go.

640
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,870
It's good that Mr. Zhang is so amazing.

641
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,610
You complain that I'm harder to teach than Mother,

642
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,140
and don't want to teach me anymore.

643
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,450
I need a teacher to start my education.

644
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,950
Mr. Zhang is perfect for the job.

645
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,390
Father, what do you think?

646
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,300
Father, I'll do as you say.

647
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,440
I'm not as good as you.

648
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,780
I'll listen to you.

649
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,790
In our family, no one is forced to do anything.

650
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,420
I'll hire whomever you want

651
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,700
as your teacher.

652
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,540
Don't do anything against your conscience.

653
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,390
It's not good to start going against your conscience

654
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,450
at such a young age.

655
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,930
The reform law is nothing.

656
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,250
It's not good at all.

657
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,090
I didn't go against my conscience.

658
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,410
I said this based on my conscience.

659
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,650
What are you three doing?

660
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,580
Why aren't you coming in?

661
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,280
Let's go.

662
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,800
Father, a gentleman has to be dignified.

663
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,290
Is that so?

664
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,010
You just said that.

665
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,140
I forgot.

666
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,230
Let's go.

667
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,250
♫We made a promise♫

668
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,630
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

669
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,100
♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

670
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:22,360
♫Without you♫

671
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,740
♫Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winter♫

672
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,510
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

673
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:36,270
♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

674
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,330
♫Wind blows gently♫

675
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:46,740
♫The fallen flowers bloom in my heart♫

676
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,030
♫Your whisper under the moonlight sounds beautiful♫

677
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,360
♫Getting closer gently♫

678
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,670
♫The season stays in dreamland♫

679
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,140
♫The snow is very light♫

680
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:15,150
♫It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eaves♫

681
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,530
♫You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snow♫

682
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,510
♫They're about to be erased now♫

683
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,750

♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

691
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,020
I just finished writing and was about to send it to you.

692
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,800
Stop rushing me.

693
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,440
I'm confident

694
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,800
in your speed.

695
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,580
I just want to tell you

696
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,480
that I plan to publish your "Story of Kunning Palace"

697
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,960
as a printed book.

698
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,710
The company has asked the editor-in-chief

699
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,960
to communicate with you face to face,

700
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,920
to see if you have any other opinions

701
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,400
about the layout design.

702
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,250
He'll be there soon.

703
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,240
Already? Are you kidding me?

704
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,540
Miss Jiang.

705
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,130
I'm your editor, Xie Juan.

706
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,070
I think

707
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,610
I've seen you somewhere before.

708
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,340
[The End]
