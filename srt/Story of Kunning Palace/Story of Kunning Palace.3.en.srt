00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,910
I'm the one you have a grievance against,

191
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,270
so let the innocent lady go.

192
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,610
Easy for you to say.

193
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,290
You helped that tyrant

194
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,240
kill so many of my brothers.

195
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,980
Weren't they innocent as well?

196
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,880
Sure enough, you answer to Lord Pingnan.

197
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,430
Poor me.

198
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,840
Why did I run into him again and again?

199
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,750
Xie Wei is cold-blooded and cruel.

200
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,620
He only wants to test this guy.

201
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,260
I can't count on him to save my life.

202
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,340
Lord Pingnan's forces are not in the capital.

203
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,490
But recently,

204
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,710
his lackeys have been sowing chaos in the capital.

205
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,190
Has someone in the court defected?

206
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,220
You even tried to frame the Yan family.

207
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,030
What on earth do you want?

208
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,480
Xie Wei, my life is hanging by a thread!

209
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,870
Can't you put politics aside for one second?

210
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,670
You don't need to doubt

211
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,370
that I'll put your safety before politics.

212
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,610
I bet you don't want to die here, Sir.

213
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,760
If you are willing to let her go,

214
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,870
I can ask my men to give you a pass

215
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,060
and open the gate for you.

216
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,120
You'll be able to leave unscathed.

217
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,170
I don't believe you're so kind.

218
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,980
I've always

219
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,470
been a man of my word.

220
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,750
If you want to save her,

221
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,180
let me take you hostage instead.

222
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,050
You're a much better pass.

223
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,230
Otherwise,

224
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,300
I'll kill her now.

225
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,480
Sir! Sir!

226
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,450
You… I, I...

227
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,730
Can you ask for something else?

228
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,950
He's a high-ranking official.

229
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,380
-Why would he... -Shut up.

230
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,200
I'll count to ten.

231
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,280
If you still can't decide…

232
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,070
No need to count.

233
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,070
Bring her over.

234
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,790
Take me instead.

235
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,480
He's willing to save me?

236
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,810
Impossible.

237
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,080
Xie Wei is anything but compassionate.

238
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,050
He'll in no way let this rebel escape.

239
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,420
He must have a backup plan.

240
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:06,960
I knew it!

241
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,050
Xie Wei

242
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,270
doesn't care about my life at all.

243
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,160
Does he want to take this chance

244
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,130
to shut me up forever?

245
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,690
Whatever.

246
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,140
Being bold is better than getting killed.

247
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,110
[Dao Qin, Xie Wei's guard]

248
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,200
Send his body to Chen Ying.

249
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,310
Besides,

250
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,490
don't tell anyone

251
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,110
about her being here today.

252
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,200
Yes.

253
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,110
[Four years ago]

254
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,120
You can't sleep.

255
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,240
Wan Niang said if you sleep now, you'll never wake up.

256
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,380
You can't sleep.

257
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,270
Wake up.

258
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,630
Qin.

259
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,030
Carrying you alone is hard enough.

260
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,040
I can't carry that qin too.

261
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,060
Let go!

262
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,460
You're dying.

263
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,990
This useless qin is the last thing you should care about.

264
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,710
Someone like you doesn't deserve to live.

265
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,480
I admire your bravery,

266
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,270
but you used it at the wrong time.

267
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,050
Follow me.

268
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,800
It's a pity that such a good qin was ruined.

269
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,580
You must have been frightened.

270
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,630
Not at all.

271
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,140
I'm lucky to have met you.

272
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,820
I knew you could save me.

273
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,640
So I was not frightened.

274
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,270
Really?

275
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,420
But why did you sound like

276
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,720
you didn't want the rebel

277
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,470
to think we know each other?

278
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,360
Am I mistaken?

279
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,990
He asked me. I had to answer.

280
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,040
I didn't want to cause you trouble by replying honestly.

281
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,540
So I lied.

282
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,050
Why?

283
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,460
Should I have been honest?

284
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,550
Is this how you

285
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,570
wrap Yan Lin around your little finger?

286
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

287
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,810
You were quite smart out there.

288
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,840
You understood everything I said.

289
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,970
I was scared out of my crap just now.

290
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,290
I didn't hear anything.

291
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,220
You mentioned Lord Pingnan and rebels,

292
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,970
which doesn't make any sense to me.

293
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,600
Please let me go home.

294
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,680
I promise I won't mention this again.

295
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,230
OK?

296
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,950
Yan Lin is my student.

297
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,600
You can't ruin his bright future.

298
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,810
You're a smart girl

299
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,270
and must know that scheming is not right.

300
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,120
Since it's not right,

301
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,720
it'll get you nowhere in the end.

302
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,900
If you really like him,

303
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,250
you shouldn't have lied to him.

304
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,740
If you don't have feelings for him,

305
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,710
you should leave him alone.

306
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,340
What's going on between me and Yan Lin

307
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,830
is nothing more than a love affair

308
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,840
between two young people.

309
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,130
I didn't do anything wrong.

310
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,089
Why are you sure that I'm deceiving him and will hurt him?

311
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,069
Are you

312
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,099
biased against me for some reason

313
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,480
so you think I have ulterior motives

314
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,790
and whatever I do is wrong?

315
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,560
What's so funny?

316
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,579
If you had talked with me like this sooner,

317
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,020
I wouldn't have beaten around the bush with you.

318
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,910
Then tell me.

319
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,810
If I hadn't pushed that guy away,

320
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,480
would you have shot me too

321
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,910
to get rid of me for good?

322
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,950
What do you think?

323
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,040
Since you know I want to kill you

324
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,630
and I can kill you,

325
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,520
you should know

326
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,340
what you should and shouldn't do.

327
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,350
You tell him.

328
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,220
Sir.

329
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,770
Viscount Yan keeps trying to break in.

330
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,990
[Cengxiao Restaurant]

331
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,680
We can't stop him for long.

332
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,310
It's fine.

333
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,810
Walk Miss Xuening out.

334
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,070
Yes.

335
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,560
I've made inquiries.

336
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,660
Viscount Yan was indeed supposed to meet Miss Jiang here today.

337
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,050
That assassin

338
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,350
was a rebel hidden in the capital.

339
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,510
It was just a coincidence.

340
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,740
Well...

341
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,560
Go ahead.

342
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,370
It's Jian Shu's question.

343
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,840
Sir,

344
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,940
why didn't you tell to Miss Jiang that you had no intention

345
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,050
to kill her?

346
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,450
It's good that she's afraid of me.

347
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,930
Fear

348
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,320
makes her behave.

349
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,240
Ning.

350
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,030
Ning, I was worried sick.

351
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,930
They told me everything.

352
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm so shocked

353
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,580
that you ran into a rebel in broad daylight.

354
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,920
Are you okay?

355
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,220
Don't worry. I survived just fine.

356
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,460
Don't be afraid.

357
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,570
I'm here now.

358
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,400
I won't let anyone hurt you.

359
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,810
It's all my fault.

360
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,900
If I hadn't wasted my time

361
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,430
in the You Mansion

362
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,050
and let you wait for me at Cengxiao Restaurant alone,

363
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,550
you wouldn't have met that assassin.

364
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,110
It's not the assassin who I'm afraid of.

365
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,850
Yan Lin,

366
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,730
I didn't know you and Mr. Xie are close.

367
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,810
Mr. Xie is the Junior Preceptor.

368
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,670
He's our teacher,

369
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,430
so we meet a lot,

370
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,640
but I wouldn't say we're close.

371
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,270
Why?

372
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,970
Was he hard on you?

373
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,020
They're definitely

374
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,580
not just teacher and student.

375
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,550
Xie Wei seems to be Yan Lin's friend

376
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,920
instead of enemy.

377
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,620
That's good news.

378
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,830
Let's leave these unhappy things behind.

379
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,740
You said you'll take me to see the lanterns.

380
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,480
Let's go.

381
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,930
But you just had quite a fright.

382
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,650
-We can see them next year. -No.

383
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,180
I want to go.

384
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,810
Fine, if that's what you wish.

385
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,690
How about Tang'er?

386
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,980
I've sent her and the coachman back.

387
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,840
Tonight,

388
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,210
no one can disturb you.

389
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,610
Let's go.

390
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,920
See? I didn't lie to you.

391
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,180
There are so many people this year.

392
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,090
They're the delicious sugar figurines I mentioned.

393
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,700
See if you like anything.

394
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,580
They're all freshly made

395
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,780
and very delicious.

396
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,620
We'll take this one.

397
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,640
Thank you, Sir.

398
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,610
Congratulations. You're right.

399
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,660
They're posing lantern riddles over there.

400
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,000
Congratulations.

401
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,930
You're so smart.

402
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,650
Thank you.

403
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,550
Bravo!

404
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,540
Why don't we give it a shot too?

405
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,730
Next riddle.

406
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,180
What has lots of bark,

407
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,150
but no bite?

408
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,010
Who will take a guess?

409
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,520
Tree.

410
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,780
The winner gets a reward.

411
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,220
I know.

412
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,880
Sir.

413
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,860
It's tree.

414
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,870
Correct.

415
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,580
Come on.

416
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,210
Let's have more fun.

417
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,810
Next riddle.

418
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,450
Are they fox nuts?

419
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,750
Yes, Miss.

420
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,460
They're first-class fox nuts

421
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,780
shipped from Suzhou a few days ago.

422
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,490
The Cao River has been turbulent recently.

423
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,960
They can't be from Suzhou.

424
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,620
Even royal tributes

425
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,600
can't arrive so quickly.

426
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,290
They must be from some lake nearby.

427
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,350
You're an expert.

428
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,250
But their taste

429
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,510
is comparable to those from Suzhou.

430
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,370
Try one.

431
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,000
Is it good?

432
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,130
Then I'll buy all of them

433
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,430
together with the basket.

434
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,560
Thank you, Sir.

435
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,760
Keep the change.

436
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,720
Thank you, Sir.

437
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,400
Let's go.

438
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,890
The evening chanting has long ended.

439
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,070
Why did you take me to the temple?

440
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,620
This is the place I carefully selected.

441
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,280
Come on.

442
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,130
Look.

443
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,710
What a view!

444
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:44,850
Here.

445
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,740
You're the same as you always were.

446
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,380
You eat like a little chick.

447
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,470
Isn't it good to stay the way I was?

448
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,550
Yes.

449
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,700
It is.

450
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,320
But Ning,

451
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,850
I'll come of age soon.

452
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,880
Yan Lin,

453
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,870
you're so nice to me.

454
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,200
What do you see in me?

455
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,380
The moment I laid my eyes on you,

456
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,710
I knew you were different from those girls in the capital.

457
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,580
Your eyes

458
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,010
are starry.

459
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,800
You never hide your emotions.

460
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,160
I still remember the first time I saw you.

461
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
You were truthful at that time.

462
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,440
You took what you wanted

463
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,430
and didn't fake smiles when you were moody.

464
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,030
When you were happy,

465
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,110
you could be so sweet and adorable.

466
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,090
When you were sad,

467
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,800
you hid up and cried alone.

468
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,840
At that time, I thought

469
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,020
you were a girl who should be doted on.

470
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,500
I never thought

471
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,430
that you'd turn out to be the best liar I've ever known.

472
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,950
I know you're awake.

473
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,840
Jiang Xuening.

474
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,480
You're a liar.

475
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,200
But no one likes me.

476
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,210
Wan Niang didn't like me.

477
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,620
Mother doesn't like me.

478
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,110
The servants in the mansion don't like me.

479
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,910
Everyone else in the capital doesn't like me either.

480
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,950
So,

481
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,770
have you ever thought

482
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,670
that you've fallen in love with the wrong person?

483
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,100
Nonsense.

484
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:16,970
Think about it.

485
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,440
Wan Niang

486
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,180
didn't have to let your father know

487
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,880
that you and your sister were swapped.

488
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,270
If she had kept quiet,

489
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,870
your sister would still

490
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,210
be the only legitimate daughter of the Jiang family.

491
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,760
When Wan Niang died,

492
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,120
she'd bring the secret

493
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,320
with her to the grave.

494
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,910
She could've done that,

495
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,610
but before she died,

496
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,380
she revealed the truth

497
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,930
and sent you back to the capital

498
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,740
despite the risk

499
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,040
of making her own daughter suffer.

500
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,470
If you see things this way,

501
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,930
you can't say that she didn't love you.

502
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,800
My Ning

503
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,580
deserves the best love in the world.

504
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,180
But I won't always be the girl

505
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,440
who settles for

506
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,180
just being the apple of your eye.

507
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,120
I'll grow up.

508
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,040
I'll become a bad woman.

509
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,490
You won't.

510
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,990
You'll always be the best.

511
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:18,570
♫How many people can one love in a lifetime?♫

512

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:05,930
Ning.

564
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,510
After my coming-of-age ceremony,

565
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,210
marry me.

566
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,630
Miss.

567
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,520
Miss.

568
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,040
You're finally back.

569
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,380
I was so worried.

570
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,010
Are you hurt?

571
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,770
I'm fine.

572
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,700
Still in one piece.

573
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,290
Miss, His Lordship and Her Ladyship asked for you.

574
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,170
Have they known that I was held hostage?

575
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,730
No.

576
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,110
Mr. Xie's men said

577
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,410
what happened today must be a secret,

578
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,260
so I didn't tell His Lordship and Her Ladyship.

579
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,630
It's about something else.

580
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,280
Hui.

581
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,780
My Lady.

582
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,210
Stay quiet when you watch us play.

583
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,460
Don't give her any clues.

584
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,010
Hui has improved.

585
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,080
You can't give her advice.

586
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,470
She has to rely on herself.

587
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,070
What will you do next?

588
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,350
Mother, look.

589
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,020
I told you

590
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:14,950
you should play it this way.

591
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,030
-Father. -You…

592
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,690
Ning, you're back.

593
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,280
Did you have fun tonight?

594
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,230
You asked for me.

595
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,650
Here's the thing.

596
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,060
I heard

597
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,200
that Princess Leyang went to the You Mansion

598
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,070
and talked to you.

599
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,500
So I guess

600
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,920
you must have known about that matter.

601
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,890
Do you mean

602
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,490
entering the palace as a study partner?

603
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,000
Yes.

604
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,180
Father and Mother

605
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,500
didn't mean to keep it from you.

606
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,670
You know

607
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,080
that one can't be too careful

608
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,950
in the palace.

609
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,920
You'd be uncomfortable there.

610
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,030
So it's better to let your sister go.

611
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,290
I know

612
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,520
it's unfair for you.

613
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,520
I can understand

614
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,740
if you're angry with us.

615
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,910
I have no objections.

616
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,340
After all, it's related to…

617
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,140
What did you say?

618
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,180
I'm not interested in entering the palace.

619
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,220
Really?

620
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,220
Ning, you...

621
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,220
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

622
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,860
Good night, Ning.

623
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,760
Ning has grown up.

624
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,860
She's so thoughtful now.

625
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,190
You heard her?

626
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,210
She didn't make things hard for us

627
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,890
and made sacrifices for her sister.

628
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,610
This feels so unreal to me.

629
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,950
You're paranoid.

630
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,400
It's weird.

631
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,100
Mr. Chen has looked into it.

632
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,190
The assassin today

633
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,080
had the tattoo of the rebels.

634
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,220
The knife he used had the stamp of Lord Pingnan's troops.

635
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,790
He was indeed a rebel.

636
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,390
Lately,

637
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,400
many high-ranking officials in the capital

638
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,190
have been assassinated by rebels.

639
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,080
No wonder Xue Yuan

640
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,370
wanted to take the chance to slander the Yan family.

641
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,040
But…

642
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,960
The rebels in the capital

643
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,130
are all at your disposal.

644
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,040
How come that assassin

645
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,720
didn't know who you are?

646
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,190
This is so strange.

647
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,380
It seems

648
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,970
that Lord Pingnan is getting suspicious of me.

649
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,010
Dao Qin.

650
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,500
Send a letter to Jinling.

651
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,660
Find out

652
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,360
who sent that assassin.

653
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,550
Yes.

654
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,480
Sir.

655
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,430
Isn't it too risky?

656
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,800
You came here to carry out

657
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,270
Lord Pingnan's order of weakening the forces in the capital.

658
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,240
The Xue family and the Yan family are at each other's throats now.

659
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,880
It's exactly what Lord Pingnan wants to see.

660
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:46,760
You helped the Yan family

661
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,010
again and again.

662
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,500
If Lord Pingnan finds out

663
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,810
and exposes your identity,

664
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,010
the court won't let you off.

665
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,940
That came out wrong.

666
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,470
I'll go to work now.

667
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,440
[Mansion of Duke of Xue]

668
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,900
Yesterday,

669
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,710
another assassination happened.

670
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,490
Xie Wei was the target this time.

671
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,330
The Ministry of Justice is conducting interrogations.

672
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,130
The military officer from Yan's troops

673
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,270
was interrogated too.

674
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,190
In your opinion,

675
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,810
what should we do?

676
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,160
Duke,

677
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,480
we did our best

678
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,790
during the interrogation.

679
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,550
Those rebels are tough,

680
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,790
especially that military officer.

681
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,140
No matter how we grilled him,

682
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,370
he wouldn't tell us

683
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,430
who is the mastermind in the capital.

684
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,460
Listen.

685
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,630
You're a moron!

686
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,410
I've made it very clear.

687
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,820
Arresting and grilling the rebels

688
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,560
is not the goal!

689
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,220
What I want

690
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,120
is to get the evidence of the Yan family's treason

691
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,950
from those rebels.

692
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,330
You didn't get anything out of them!

693
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,920
If Chen Ying finds out about my plan,

694
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,170
do you know

695
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,650
what the consequence will be?

696
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,920
Sorry. I failed you.

697
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,040
I'm incompetent.

698
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,420
Enough!

699
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,659
I don't need someone useless like you.

700
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,570
Guards!

701
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:31,810
Duke.

702
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,699
Duke.

703
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,340
Please spare my life!

704
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,010
Duke.

705
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:35,810
Please spare my life!

706
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,480
Duke.

707
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,800
-I've worked hard for so long, -Please spare my life.

708
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,290
but still can't bring down the Yan family.

709
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,900
Power struggles are never easy.

710
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,840
I'm at the end of my wits now.

711
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:52,909
Duke,

712
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,170
I think

713
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,330
the current situation

714
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,880
can be a blessing in disguise.

715
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,200
Everyone knows

716
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,010
that the Xue family and Yan family are at odds.

717
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,020
Now,

718
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,830
the Ministry of Justice is in charge of the investigation.

719
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,340
No matter what the result is,

720
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,430
at least we're spared

721
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,060
from gossip and speculations.

722
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,610
The Yan family's days are numbered.

723
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,810
It'll topple sooner or later.

724
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,640
His Majesty is paranoid.

725
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,570
To achieve your great plan,

726
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,800
you need a drastic measure.

727
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,630
Over the past years,

728
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,710
that old coot Yan Mu

729
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,810
has always had it in for me.

730
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,830
Since we can't find any evidence,

731
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,580
we'll create some.

732
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,660
Go find someone capable

733
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,090
in Xingwu Guards.

734
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,560
Tell him to penetrate the Yan family.

735
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,940
I want to get

736
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,060
Yan Mu's handwriting

737
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,430
and seal.

738
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
Yes, Duke.

739
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,070
Xingwu Guards. We're ordered

740
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,080
to search for rebels here.

741
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,150
Get out of the way!

742
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,000
His Majesty has made

743
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,710
the Ministry of Justice in charge of the purge of rebels.

744
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,220
May I ask

745
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,670
who gave you that order?

746
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,030
Don't tell me it's Duke of Xue.

747
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,890
Viscount Yan.

748
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,210
Be careful with what you say.

749
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,660
Duke of Xue

750
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,890
sent us here to search for rebels

751
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,800
for the peace of the State of Qian.

752
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,350
Are you stopping us from searching

753
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,470
because you're afraid that we may find something?

754
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,720
Have you really

755
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,550
hidden someone in Tongzhou Camps?

756
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,620
Nonsense!

757
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,650
Wait, My Lord!

758
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,560
Kill them!

759
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,600
Kill!

760
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,600
Hey, guy!

761
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,440
Stop!

762
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,520
Guys!

763
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,450
Stop fighting!

764
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,660
Stop fighting!

765
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,400
Sir.

766
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,940
Zhou Yinzhi, what're you doing?

767
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,190
[Zhou Yinzhi, Sergeant of Xingwu Guards]

768
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,410
Duke of Xue asked us to investigate

769
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,270
instead of searching.

770
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,140
The soldiers in the camps are all protesters of the people.

771
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,780
Why do we have to fight them?

772
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,250
Get away!

773
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,780
Which side are you on?

774
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,360
Do you still want to work in Xingwu Guards?

775
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,470
Stop fighting!

776
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,200
Stop!

777
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,920
In Tongzhou Camps,

778
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,290
everyone should obey the rules set by the Yan family's ancestors.

779
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,560
This is a military base,

780
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,540
so unless with an imperial edict,

781
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,160
no one can enter it.

782
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,140
The Yan family's spears

783
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,770
killed countless enemies.

784
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,460
If anyone ignores our rules,

785
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,460
I don't mind teaching them a lesson.

786
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,670
Sir.

787
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,800
Let's wait and see.

788
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,960
You're a good man.

789
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,900
Xingwu Guards are corrupt.

790
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,390
You deserve a better position.

791
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,280
How about

792
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:48,940
coming to work for me?

793
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,000
Thank you for your kind offer.

794
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,680
My name is Zhou Yinzhi.

795
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,510
I'm used to staying in Xingwu Guards.

796
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,420
I'll just stay this way.

797
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,480
I won't force you.

798
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,150
You fought well just now.

799
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,130
Come here to spar with the soldiers when you're free.

800
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,450
I will.

801
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,590
Yan Lin.

802
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,960
Xie Wei.

803
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,640
The Yan family.

804
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,190
The Xue family.

805
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,310
I want to save the Yan family,

806
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,250
but I'm nobody now.

807
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,790
Who can I ask for help?

808
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,410
Zhou Yinzhi?

809
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,440
Back then, to strengthen my position as the empress,

810
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,650
I put him in an important position to do my dirty work.

811
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,350
He's a dangerous man.

812
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,990
[Zhou Yinzhi, Commander of Xingwu Guards]

813
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,160
But given the circumstances,

814
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,630
he seems to be the only person

815
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,730
I can take advantage of.

816
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,420
[Zhou Yinzhi]

817
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,130
Back then, Xingwu Guards revealed that the Yan family

818
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,540
played a part in Lord Pingnan's rebellion

819
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,580
and led the investigation.

820
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,580
Zhou Yinzhi should be a Sergeant in Xingwu Guards now.

821
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,450
Maybe he can help me get some information.

822
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,120
Wait.

823
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,530
Sergeant.

824
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,220
To keep an eye on Yan Lin,

825
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,340
I introduced Zhou Yinzhi to him.

826
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,290
Before the Yan family was charged with treason,

827
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,520
Zhou Yinzhi suddenly became Staff Sergeant

828
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,580
and then Sergeant First Class after the incident.

829
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,670
I thought he got promoted so fast because he was able,

830
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:16,930
but in retrospect,

831
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,640
he may have been involved in the Yan family's doom.

832
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,390
Coming.

833
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,330
Who are you?

834
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,250
Is Mr. Zhou home?

835
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,380
He went to work early in the morning.

836
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,550
I don't know when he'll be back.

837
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,280
If you want to see him,

838
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,790
you can come in and take a seat.

839
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,410
I'll send someone to inform him immediately.

840
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,670
Don't mention my coming.

841
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,890
Just tell Zhou Yinzhi

842
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,020
that his beloved horse is dying

843
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,680
and he should come back to see it one last time.

844
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,780
Yinzhi.

845
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,930
You came back quickly.

846
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,560
I haven't visited you in a long time.

847
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,520
How impertinent of me.

848
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,900
Sorry that you had to come here in person.

849
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,160
Please forgive me.

850
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,880
You came at a good time.

851
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,990
I was about to go to you.

852
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:37,840
Really?

853
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,080
You came to the capital four years ago.

854
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,680
At first, you were just a coachman in my house.

855
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,030
Now you work in Xingwu Guards.

856
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,270
I don't see why you should

857
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,710
bother to pay me a visit.

858
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,950
Please don't say that, Miss Jiang.

859
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:49,730
If it weren't for you,

860
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,990
I'd still be feeding horses in the countryside.

861
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,310
I came to the capital thanks to you.

862
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,060
I'll never forget

863
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,380
your kindness to me.

864
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,830
Save the pleasantries.

865
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,380
In the past few days,

866
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,340
Zhang Zhe, the Supervising Secretary for the Division of Criminal Justice,

867
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,890
impeached your superior.

868
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,300
And rebels kept making attempts

869
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,210
to assassinate court officials.

870
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,790
If His Majesty wants

871
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,640
to attribute them to Xingwu Guards' negligence,

872
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,020
I'm afraid your life

873
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,450
will be quite hard.

874
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,780
I know you.

875
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,060
You're a clever man

876
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,340
and have ambitions.

877
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,120
But you have neither money

878
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,280
nor connections.

879
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,830
That's why you thought of me, right?

880
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,450
I guessed right.

881
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,780
It seems that if I want to get to him,

882
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,190
I have to take my chances

883
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,250
and break him down mentally first.

884
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:30,860
Mr. Zhou.

885
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,220
I might as well take another guess.

886
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm just a powerless woman.

887
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,680
What you want to make use of

888
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,080
is my relationship with Yan Lin.

889
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,720
Instead of cozying up to

890
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,020
your superiors in Xingwu Guards,

891
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,500
you tried to get close to the Yan family which is the implacable enemy of Xingwu Guards.

892
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,020
I'm afraid you're up to something else.

893
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,400
I guessed right again.

894
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,060
It seems that he really played a part

895
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,460
in the Yan family's destruction.

896
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,230
Are you afraid

897
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,760
because I guessed everything right?

898
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,220
Let me give you some advice.

899
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,700
Stay out of the fight between the Yan family and the Xue family.

900
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,310
No matter what mission the Xue family gave you,

901
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,670
if you succeed,

902
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,150
you may have a meteoric rise to fame and fortune,

903
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,940
but you'll be disposed of as a useless pawn eventually.

904
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,090
I'm afraid one day,

905
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,100
you'll come to a violent demise

906
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,090
with no one to lay you to rest.
