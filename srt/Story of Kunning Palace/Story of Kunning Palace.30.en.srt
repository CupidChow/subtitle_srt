00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,000
As long as I can take over Ning'an Palace,

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,330
I'm willing to pay any price.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,430
Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,590
The cinnabar imperial brush determines one's life and death.

6
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,870
Everything

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,950
is like a dream.

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,610
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,920
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,690
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,400
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

12
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,190
There are things

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,820
you can't give me.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,440
But he can.

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,130
To keep my life,

16
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,970
only you, Sir, can help me.

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,360
Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

18
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,880
But I'm the only one who can't.

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,470
I want to do my best to make up for

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,220
my past regrets and wrongdoings.

21
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,310
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,060
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,190
Welcome, Your Highness.

24
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,970
Welcome, Your Highness.

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,270
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

26
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:51,180
Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,250
But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,710
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,630
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,680
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,630
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,780
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,460
A life of absurdity, a story of mistakes and regrets.

[Story of Kunning Palace]

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,630
[Episode 30]

36
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,310
Jiang Xuening has no respect

37
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,270
and violated the palace rules

38
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,420
as a subordinate.

39
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,910
Beat her!

40
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,060
Sir!

41
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,620
The plan failed.

42
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,480
The princess didn't leave.

43
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,560
Has Ning'er come out?

44
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,720
I was about to tell you.

45
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,300
Shunzhen Gate has been surrounded.

46
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,200
But Miss Jiang hasn't come out.

47
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,230
I'm afraid...

48
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,330
Stop.

49
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,480
I'll give you a chance.

50
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,270
If you beg for mercy,

51
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,800
I'll let you go.

52
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,900
A long time ago, I was just like you.

53
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,490
I would do anything to achieve my goal.

54
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,080
If you don't wake up,

55
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,810
retribution will eventually come.

56
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,700
It's just a matter of time.

57
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,580
Continue beating her!

58
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,490
Wait, Consort Xian.

59
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,900
What is it?

60
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,890
Your Ladyship.

61
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,240
The Princess's sedan has left the palace.

62
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,930
Hearing that Miss Jiang is still in the palace, Junior Preceptor Xie

63
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,960
came to ask for her.

64
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,190
Right now,

65
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,540
he is waiting outside the palace.

66
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,850
Your Ladyship, what do we do?

67
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,010
Junior Preceptor Xie?

68
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,120
Since Junior Preceptor Xie wants her,

69
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,600
I'll show him some respect.

70
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,670
But please send a message for me.

71
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,220
Since Miss Jiang is Junior Preceptor's disciple,

72
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,430
please discipline her in the future.

73
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,890
If she

74
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,950
dares to talk back to me

75
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,490
like this in the future,

76
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,030
I won't let her off easily.

77
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,140
I will deliver the message.

78
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,540
Miss Jiang.

79
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,880
Who hurt you?

80
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,660
Xue Shu.

81
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,820
Please don't be angry.

82
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,990
Consort Xian punished her on her own accord.

83
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,330
But there's a reason for her to do so.

84
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,610
If we make a fuss now,

85
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,130
it will only harm Miss Jiang.

86
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,880
Why don't we treat her first

87
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,620
in case she gets sick.

88
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,690
Ning'er.

89
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,450
She doesn't want to leave the palace.

90
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,670
I know.

91
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,580
You don't have to say anything.

92
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,140
Let's go home and heal first.

93
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:04,130
♫I tried to escape like a shooting star♫

94
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,940
♫Being enemies with love is just a vulnerable excuse♫

95

♫When fate is held tight♫

96
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,940
♫But you were missed♫

97
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,120
♫So reluctant♫

98
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,130
♫I still remember the wound♫

99
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,900
♫I wanted to be free like rain♫

This is the last thing

102
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,660
she left to me.

103
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,580
♫But the closer it gets to the chest♫

104
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,610

♫Only then will the pain heal♫

107
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,570
This is her choice after all.

108
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,440
If she doesn't want to,

109
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
what can we do?

110
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,840
You're right.

111
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,440
I only have a temper,

112
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,060
but am not capable.

113
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,140
I thought I could change someone's fate.

114
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,300
But in the end, I'm just a clown.

115
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,310
I can't save

116
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,760
nor protect anyone.

117
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,630
You're not.

118
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,470
Ning'er.

119
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,700
There are many twists and turns in this world.

120
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,720
It's hard for you

121
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,590
to change others' fate.

122
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,300
There are many people who take

123
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
the easy path.

124
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,700
But it takes courage

125
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,110
to take the rough path.

126
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,360
Trust me.

127
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,320
As long as you don't give up,

128
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,430
there will be a chance.

129
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,460
You've suffered a lot today.

130
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,760
I will

131
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,280
get it back for you in multiple folds in the future.

132
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
Just be patient.

133
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,650
Be a little more patient.

134
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,590
All right?

135
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,670
What about Her Highness then?

136
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,550
When can the State of Qian

The forecourt reported that

the carriage sent to pick up Second Young Lady

150
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,510
didn't manage to get her.

151
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,340
Second Young Lady hasn't come back yet.

152
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,240
It's already so late.

153
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,010
Is she still walking around outside at this hour?

154
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,150
All right.

155
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,070
There are many people on the street watching the send-off ceremony today.

156
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,680
Maybe she was delayed somewhere.

157
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,280
I'll take someone to look for her.

158
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,700
Be careful, Master.

159
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,570
Okay.

160
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,850
Sir, we are here.

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,620
Sir.

162
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,340
Lord Jiang.

163
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,610
Go get Lian and Tang.

164
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,070
Help Young Lady in!

165
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,280
Yes.

166
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,010
Sir.

167
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:29,990
Mr. Jiang.

168
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,310
It's not what you think.

169
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,120
Since that day

170
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,070
His Majesty scolded me in the court,

171
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,570
Xingwu Guards suffered a lot under the Ministry of Justice.

172
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,160
Now,

173
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,360
the disaster relief money and Tongzhou arms case

174
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,700
are still unsolved.

175
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,390
I feel

176
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,530
so uneasy.

177
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,690
Duke.

178
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,510
Is there any news

179
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,740
from the Empress Dowager?

180
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,170
Since that evil man

181
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,200
did that ridiculous thing,

182
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,410
the Empress Dowager and I drifted apart.

183
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,350
Now she can't even protect the princess,

184
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,730
let alone protecting the Xue family.

185
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,520
Duke,

186
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,990
after observing things these few months.

187
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,020
I think something is fishy.

188
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,620
Fishy?

189
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,380
Be it Yan family's change,

190
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,570
or capturing the Tongzhou rebels,

191
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,170
these things were supposed to be beneficial to us.

192
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,700
But at the last moment,

193
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,050
there were always changes.

194
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,990
The ending is not as we expected.

195
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,540
I'm afraid

196
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,390
there's someone behind this.

197
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,450
Let go of me!

198
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,460
Let go of me!

199
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,720
Let go of me! Let go of me!

200
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,880
Duke!

201
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,790
Kneel!

202
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,230
What's going on?

203
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,500
Father.

204
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,630
According to your order,

205
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,700
I kept a lookout at Xingwu Guards' prison

206
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,190
to watch Zhang Zhe's actions

207
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,280
to guard against those who are being sneaky.

208
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,500
What I didn't expect was to find this guy

209
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,490
sneaking through the old files.

210
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,200
Duke.

211
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,170
Duke.

212
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,870
It's not like that.

213
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,890
It's all a misunderstanding.

214
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,620
Recently, Mr. Zhang

215
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,140
has been investigating Xingwu Guards.

216
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,150
I'm afraid that the opportunities will be affected, Duke.

217
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,970
The Yan family official seal.

218
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,150
The prison break.

219
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,110
Everything is related to you.

220
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,150
Now, you're getting yourself involved

221
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,580
in old cases too.

222
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,530
So you are the mole

223
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,720
that's hiding beside me.

224
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,710
Duke.

225
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,150
Duke, it's not like that. Listen to me.

226
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,940
It's all a misunderstanding.

227
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,970
Shut up!

228
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,050
I don't have time to listen to you quibble.

229
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,140
If you tell me

230
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,850
who is behind you,

231
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,660
I might spare your life.

232
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,730
Otherwise...

233
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,670
Duke!

234
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,340
I have never been disloyal to you

235
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,000
in my life!

236
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,130
Go to hell!

237
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
Duke! Duke, please hold on.

238
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:04,780
Mr. Zhou.

239
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,730
What you are worried about now

240
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,430
is that your life will be in danger if you tell the truth now.

241
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,810
As you know,

242
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,970
there are many pairs of eyes in the court

243
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,300
looking at the Duke's Mansion.

244
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,940
We don't want any trouble.

245
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,170
If you tell us

246
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,870
who you are working for,

247
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,900
I

248
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,460
will promise you,

249
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,000
in the Duke's stead,

250
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,220
to keep you alive and wealthy.

251
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,180
But if

252
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,220
you refuse to say it,

253
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,090
It's Junior Preceptor Xie!

254
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,230
It's Junior Preceptor Xie.

255
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,150
Junior Preceptor Xie asked me to collect evidence for your crimes

256
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,790
and plans to plot against you.

257
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,330
Please investigate it, Duke.

258
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,770
Xie Ju'an.

259
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,180
It's you.

260
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,310
Junior Preceptor Xie.

261
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,530
Junior Preceptor Xie.

262
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,349
Mr. Jiang.

263
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,780
What can I do for you?

264
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,010
Don't put it that way.

265
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,140
Sir.

266
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,520
You are a talent

267
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,740
on the rise.

268
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,750
Yet you haven't gotten mattied.

269
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,610
Although my daughter is playful,

270
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,330
she's now at the ripe age of 19 years old.

271
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,610
You've worked hard

272
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,140
to teach her to be polite and righteous.

273
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,930
I'm very grateful.

274
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,100
But you are

275
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,680
her teacher after all.

276
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,760
One's teacher is like one's father.

277
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,080
So please,

278
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,460
watch your words and actions.

279
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,200
Don't cause

280
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,660
any misunderstandings.

281
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,710
Mr. Jiang,

282
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,930
what do you mean?

283
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,720
You...

284
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,770
Don't play dumb with me.

285
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,800
Fine.

286
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,510
I'll be straightforward.

287
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,100
Although Ning

288
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,430
has a bad reputation,

289
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,470
she's not a bad person.

290
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,080
As her teacher,

291
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,150
you should pay more attention to your words and actions.

292
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,780
You can make mistakes yourself,

293
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
but don't make others make mistakes!

294
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,930
I did teach her some poems

295
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,580
and some qin.

296
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:29,800
But...

297
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,390
So what?

298
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,690
What do you mean?

299
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,450
What else do you want?

300
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,470
When I came to the capital,

301
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,230
I was already friends with her.

302
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,190
She was born in the Jiang family

303
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,900
but was treated unfairly several times.

304
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,500
She is playful.

305
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,910
But in my eyes,

306
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,160
she’s unique.

307
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,770
Moreover,

308
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,140
these aside,

309
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,720
what I want to do,

310
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,530
is not decided by the world.

311
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,540
You

312
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,220
understand these, right?

313
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,570
You are...

314
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,910
You're so stubborn.

315
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,100
It's against ethics!

316
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,060
Why call me over

317
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,340
in such a hurry?

318
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,980
This morning,

319
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,950
Xue Yuan didn't come claiming to be ill.

320
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,610
I was worried

321
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,800
and I asked someone to check out Xingwu Guards prison.

322
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,940
It's been said that there hasn't been any movements

323
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,580
in Duke's Mansion for a few days.

324
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,210
Xue Yuan is obsessed with power.

325
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,330
This is not like him.

326
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,160
There is indeed something wrong.

327
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,700
Xue Yuan has hidden a lot of troops in the dark.

328
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,660
If a change to the troops happen suddenly,

329
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,420
we won't be able to handle it.

330
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,030
So,

331
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,250
go to Huangzhou secretly for me.

332
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,540
Are you planning to secretly get Marquis Yan

333
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,040
out of the exile personally?

334
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,120
Exactly.

335
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,000
Our men are among the guards in Huangzhou.

336
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,410
If you go,

337
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,350
you just need to send them to the border quickly

338
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,430
and secretly control

339
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,080
the Yan's troops stationed there for defense.

340
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,280
At that time,

341
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,180
even if there is a change in the capital,

342
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,740
we can deal with it.

343
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,510
Got it.

344
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,080
Do you think Xue family

345
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,410
really has the nerve to rebel?

346
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,810
They have evil intentions.

347
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,730
It's only a matter of time

348
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,910
for them to set off on this path.

349
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,520
However,

350
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,560
if we can push them to move faster,

351
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,830
it may be

352
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,970
a good thing to us.

353
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,750
Are you trying to instigate them to rebel?

354
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,930
Poor bandits entering an alley,

355
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,620
whether they surrender or rebel,

356
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,020
depends on their own choice.

357
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,160
But if the Xue family gets desperate,

358
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,510
you will be in danger.

359
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,900
If that happens,

360
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,910
the world is set,

361
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,610
and I will be tamed.

362
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,250
Danger

363
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,190
is nothing.

364
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,720
You came at the right time. Come here.

365
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,610
Did anything happen in the palace today?

366
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,810
Why does he look strange?

367
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,650
Look at your face. Something really happened.

368
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,290
Tell me.

369
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,450
Is it the Xue family

370
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,320
or His Majesty?

371
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:23,840
Come.

372
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,970
I...

373
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,690
Tell me. You're making me so anxious.

374
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,740
It's neither of them?

375
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,360
This...

376
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,680
Sit down.

377
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,760
Sir...

378
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,730
Tell me.

379
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,990
All right, all right.

380
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,660
Sir kissed Miss Jiang last night.

381
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,350
How dare he–

382
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,170
Keep your voice down.

383
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,540
I see.

384
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,060
He finally understood.

385
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,450
What do you mean?

386
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,070
Your master

387
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,420
never hesitates.

388
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,390
He must get

389
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,240
what he wants.

390
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,800
We are outsiders.

391
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,620
So we could see

392
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,110
his feelings for Jiang Xuening a long time ago,

393
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,990
but he may not know it himself.

394
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,060
Miss Jiang was injured yesterday.

395
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,330
He was pushed

396
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,350
and understood his own feelings now.

397
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,030
But I’m afraid it won't be reciprocated.

398
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,940
Miss Jiang

399
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,700
has always been

400
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,940
respecting and fearing him as a teacher.

401
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,540
I'm afraid

402
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,780
it will be difficult this time.

403
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,220
That's better.

404
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,710
Jiang Xuening is sharp-tongued.

405
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
She always makes Sir angry.

406
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,940
Maybe he's just looking for something fresh

407
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,520
and will forget it soon.

408
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,160
Is this your first day knowing him?

409
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,420
For so many years,

410
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,080
have you ever seen him so devoted to someone?

411
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,390
Anyway, as compared to this,

412
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,950
I have other concerns.

413
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
The world is set,

414
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,160
and I will be tamed.

415
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,280
I just hope Jiang Xuening can hold him back

416
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,720
and don't let him do anything crazy.

417
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,420
Master.

418
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,260
How is Ning?

419
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,210
I just applied medication for her.

420
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,910
She's resting in her room.

421
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,290
But she's much better than yesterday.

422
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:18,640
That's good.

423
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,760
Go ahead.

424
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,870
Yes.

425
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,940
Master.

426
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,940
You may leave.

427
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,120
I have something to say to Ning.

428
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,180
Yes.

429
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,730
All right.

430
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,140
Father.

431
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,780
I heard that you are getting better.

432
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,070
I'm relieved.

433
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,990
Yesterday I asked you

434
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,460
where the wound came from.

435
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,240
If you don't want to tell me,

436
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,250
then fine.

437
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,810
I won't force you.

438
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,220
I came here today

439
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,630
for something important.

440
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,150
In a few days,

441
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,740
your sister will get married soon.

442
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,720
Next,

443
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,940
your marriage

444
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,690
will be in the talks.

445
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,160
I am thinking of

446
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,510
asking your mother to arrange it.

447
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,080
But before that,

448
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,290
I still want to

449
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,810
ask you for your opinion first.

450
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,840
Do you have someone in your mind?

451
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,220
No, I don't.

452
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,480
I don't want to talk about marriage either.

453
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,570
Please agree.

454
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,980
After Sister gets married,

455
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,140
allow me to leave the capital

456
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,300
and go back to my hometown.

457
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,890
That's good too.

458
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,840
After Tongzhou returned,

459
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,010
things have been complex.

460
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,960
You can go back and rest for a bit

461
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,860
if you want to.

462
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,980
Not for a bit.

463
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,330
I'm leaving.

464
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,090
Why?

465
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,100
Father, there's something you don't know.

466
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,840
When Mr. Zhang revealed Xue Shu's crime in court that day,

467
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,090
it was also related to me.

468
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,170
I stayed in the palace for a long time yesterday

469
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,850
was to stop the marriage

470
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,360
and rescue the princess from the palace.

471
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,170
Aren't you curious about my injury?

472
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,790
It's all thanks to Consort Xian.

473
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,990
She found out about

474
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,650
what I did.

475
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:15,820
How dare you–

476
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,620
For six months,

477
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,960
I acted recklessly.

478
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,310
I have offended everyone in the palace.

479
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,750
If I stay in the capital for any longer,

480
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,560
it will only bring disaster to the Jiang family.

481
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,200
All the people I miss have left.

482
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,340
All my wishes fell through.

483
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,590
I

484
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,950
only wish to leave the capital.

485
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,020
Please grant my wish.

486
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,530
Sir.

487
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,880
Did you deliver it?

488
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,510
I sent layered walnut cake over

489
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,610
as you ordered.

490
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,340
But Mr. Jiang seemed to have instructed

491
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,890
that nothing in our mansion

492
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,810
is allowed inside.

493
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,120
Got it.

494
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,220
Sir.

495
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,440
I was careless

496
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,000
about what happened that day.

497
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,340
Please punish me.

498
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,430
It's fine.

499
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,510
They'd have found out sooner or later.

500
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,090
This is good too.

501
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,670
Actually, Sir,

502
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,730
Lord Linzi's wedding is tomorrow.

503
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,230
Concubine Jiang will surely attend the ceremony.

504
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,400
If you have something to tell Jiang family's Second Young Lady,

505
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,190
why don't you take advantage of tomorrow?

506
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,870
Mother.

507
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,730
Did you call me?

508
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,790
This is Wan Niang's bracelet, right?

509
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,650
All these years,

510
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,030
I have always treated you

511
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,010
as my own daughter,

512
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,250
afraid that others will look down on you

513
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,890
and mistreat you.

514
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,370
I thought

515
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,290
we could be close even without blood relation.

516
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,390
I didn't expect

517
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,140
you still disobeyed me

518
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,980
and chose this path.

519
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,490
I've let you down.

520
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,020
Please forgive me.

521
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,740
Get up.

522
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,550
Sit.

523
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,370
This is also my fault.

524
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,050
Mother has always

525
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,680
abided by the family rules

526
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,920
and been strict.

527
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,160
I forcibly put my wishes upon you.

528
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,190
But I never knew

529
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,820
nor thought about

530
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,810
what you really want.

531
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,100
I didn't let you go for the consort selection

532
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,260
because I didn't want you to suffer.

533
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,970
I'm also afraid that you'll get involved in the feud between the royal family and the Xue family.

534
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,500
Your father and I

535
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,500
can be counted to be from similar backgrounds.

536
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,440
But after the wedding,

537
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,730
it was Wan Niang who entered the family.

538
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,430
Not to mention the royal family.

539
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,140
Do you think it's easy to be a consort?

540
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,410
I made this wedding dress

541
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,410
personally

542
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,650
over all these years.

543
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,200
I wanted you

544
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,290
to be happy

545
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,790
on your wedding day.

546
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,990
But now you are the concubine of Lord Linzi.

547
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,990
The palace will prepare

548
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,600
another dress for you.

549
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,680
This dress

550
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,510
shall stay with me

551
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,530
as a memory.

552
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,080
I will consider it

553
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,510
fulfilling our fate as mother and daughter.

554
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,420
Mother.

555
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,140
I've broken your heart.

556
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,430
Please don't hate me.

557
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,530
Please.

558
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,710
Silly girl.

559
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,440
Since you call me mother,

560
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,720
I just hope you can

561
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,530
have a good life in the future.

562
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,680
Don't let him let your love down.

563
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,110
Congratulations.

564
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,870
It's magnificent.

565
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,250
Mrs. Liu, you're here too.

566
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,420
Yes, long time no see.

567
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,990
I thought

568
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,100
the Duke's already considered really rich.

569
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,130
As expected of a prince.

570
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,200
One can live in such a huge mansion when they get married to the prince.

571
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,210
No wonder everyone wants to be part of the royal family.

572
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,750
Right?

573
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,940
Watch your words.

574
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,530
You're here, Mr. Xie.

575
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,560
Viscount is here too.

576
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:45,870
Mr. Gu.

577
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,540
Mr. Zhang is here too.

578
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,020
I'm still in my mourning period.

579
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,230
I shouldn't have come.

580
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,470
The Ministry of Justice has many cases to deal with various ministries.

581
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,410
Mr. Zhang is now the judge of the Ministry of Justice.

582
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,550
In such occasion,

583
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,290
he should meet

584
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,740
colleagues like you.

585
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,720
Don't just stand there.

586
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,370
Go and congratulate Lord Pingnan.

587
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,720
Please.

588
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,350
Please.

589
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,460
Mr. Wang, please.

590
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,990
Are you hungry?

591
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,130
You haven't eaten since last night.

592
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,980
I'll get you some food.

593
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,070
Sister,

594
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,370
Her Majesty said

595
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,190
we should focus on the overall situation today

596
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,090
and not be biased.

597
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,330
According to the rules in the palace,

598
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,000
Concubine Rong and her subordinates

599
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,200
shouldn't leave this place.

600
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,800
You can eat after

601
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,670
Her Ladyship and Lord Pingnan has wedded.

602
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,070
But the wedding is at night.

603
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Does our Young Lady

604
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,570
have to starve before this?

605
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,980
This is the palace's rule.

606
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,650
I'm not putting you on the spot.

607
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,360
Please forgive me.

608
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,830
You keep calling me a concubine.

609
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,490
Aren't concubines the mistress?

610
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,110
Forget it.

611
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,560
Mei, come back.

612
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,520
Greetings, Matron Su.

613
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,940
I need to talk to Concubine.

614
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,910
You may leave.

615
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,910
Do you want me to invite Lord Pingnan here personally?

616
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,080
We dare not.

617
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,690
This way, Matron.

618
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,590
Greetings, Concubine.

619
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,930
Miss Jiang prepared this lunch box.

620
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,650
Please enjoy.

621
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,120
Second Young Lady is so thoughtful.

622
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,910
Your Highness,

623
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,720
Lord Pingnan came to the courtyard just now.

624
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,320
He asked me to give this to you.

625
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,730
The palace sent someone to keep an eye on him today.

626
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,290
His Highness is afraid that the closer he gets to you to protect you,

627
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,740
the more trouble he will cause you.

628
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,830
So you can only bear it for now.

629
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,670
But his feelings for you

630
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,300
are like this one-heart knot.

631
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,910
It has never changed.

632
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,880
Mr. Jiang, here.

633
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,040
Long time no see.

634
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,090
Come, please.

635
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,320
All right.

636
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,560
Let's drink.

637
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,670
Mr. Gu.

638
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,320
Mr. Xie.

639
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,220
Come, have a seat.

640
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,580
Have a seat, Mr. Gu.

641
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,389
Why do I feel that Minister Jiang

642
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,170
is shooting daggers at you with his eyes?

643
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,909
Why did you offend him?

644
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,370
Minister Jiang's daughter is getting married today.

645
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,800
You should drink more.

646
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:20,860
Yes.

647
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,600
My eldest daughter is sensible and obedient.

648
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,810
This marriage

649
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,780
is considered smooth too.

650
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,550
But

651
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,710
I have a second daughter.

652
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,840
She's just a devil.

653
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,550
I'm afraid her marriage will be tricky.

654
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,219
Since Second Young Lady is the princess's study partner,

655
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,000
she's well-educated.

656
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,590
Now, she's praised by His Majesty

657
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,980
and is very loyal,

658
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,239
don't mind the rumors outside.

659
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,650
Yes.

660
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,430
Today is Lord Linzi's wedding too.

661
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,340
All the young talents in the Imperial City are gathered here.

662
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,300
Why don't you look for

663
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,710
a son-in-law at the banquet?

664
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,630
Mr. Chen is right.

665
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,650
Today is a good opportunity.

666
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,140
By the way, Mr. Gu,

667
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,370
as far as I know,

668
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,270
Mr. Zhang is also around 25 years old.

669
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,310
He still hasn't had marriage plans, right?

670
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,840
S-something is wrong.

671
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,130
Why do I feel that

672
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,280
Minister Jiang wants Zhang Zhe to marry Second Young Lady?

673
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,740
That won't do.

674
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,950
Say something.

675
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,220
Mr. Zhang?

676
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,830
Minister.

677
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,450
There's something you don't know.

678
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm stubborn

679
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,060
and have an unfortunate life.

680
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,790
I dare not bring trouble to others.

681
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,600
Mr. Zhang,

682
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,600
those are all nonsense.

683
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,270
Mr. Zhang,

684
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,880
you're not afraid of those with power.

685
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,120
In the court,

686
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,450
you speak your mind.

687
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,820
I admire you very much.

688
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,070
Mr. Gu is your teacher. And some say teachers are like fathers.

689
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,490
Why don't we just...

690
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,780
Mr. Jiang.

691
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:08,920
Mr. Xie

692
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,940
What can I do for you?

693
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,620
Please don't say that.

694
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,900
But I think it’s necessary to remind you

695
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,010
Mr. Zhang is still mourning.

696
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,720
It's inappropriate to talk about this.

697
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,230
Many officials are present today.

698
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,220
Please mind your words, Mr. Jiang.

699
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,180
You...

700
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,610
Mr. Jiang.

701
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,560
Junior Preceptor Xie is right.

702
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,600
Today is not a good time to discuss this.

703
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,450
Let's drink.

704
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,550
Yes.

705
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,330
Let's

706
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,450
drink more.

707
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,580
Please.

708
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,660
Let's continue. Let's drink.

709
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,710
Look at that, Xie Ju'an.

710
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,580
How dare you say that to your future father-in-law?

711
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,140
So bold!

712
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,700
Miss,

713
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,480
I've asked Matron Su

714
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,920
to send the things you've prepared for First Young Lady.

715
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,190
Let’s go back to the banquet.

716
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,890
Master specially brought you out for a walk

717
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,640
to feel the lively atmosphere.

718
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,920
You can't drink here alone.

719
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,580
It's a wedding banquet.

720
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,930
It doesn't matter where I drink

721
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,330
as long as my well wishes have been conveyed.

722
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,270
People come and go in the banquet

723
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,440
to socialize.

724
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,680
It's too noisy.

725
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,320
I'll go there when the wedding is about to start.

726
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,450
All right.

727
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,810
But it's windy in the courtyard.

728
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,550
Your wound just recovered.

729
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,030
I'll get you a cape.

730
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:34,920
No need.

731
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,490
I'm not that weak.

732
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,300
Go back to the banquet.

733
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,370
I want to be alone for a while.

734
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,610
Xie Wei and Yan Lin have invaded the Imperial City.

735
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,310
I don't know how long my sickly body

736
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,730
can last.

737
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,520
If I pass on,

738
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,120
this is the will.

739
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,440
The son of the Shen family will ascend the throne.

740
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,150
You'll supervise the state.

741
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,360
Miss Jiang.

742
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,520
Miss Jiang.

743
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:12,950
Your Highness.

744
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,890
Did Your Highness go to see my sister?

745
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,690
I wanted to see her,

746
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,860
and I have a lot to tell her.

747
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,590
But I'm afraid she'll be punished again.

748
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,250
This time,

749
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,420
she has suffered a lot.

750
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,900
She will understand

751
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,800
your feelings.

752
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,900
Since it's fate to meet you here,

753
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,700
I want to propose a toast to you.

754
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,060
I was also taken care of by Your Highness.

755
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,710
Today is Your Highness's wedding.

756
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,010
I should propose a toast

757
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,360
to congratulate Your Highness's happiness.

758
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,110
I promised your sister

759
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,910
that I would marry her as consort, but I wasn't able to.

760
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,690
This can't be considered as a happy day.

761
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,370
There are various things in the past

762
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,290
which feel unreal.

763
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,750
Compared to falling in love with the wrong person,

764
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,410
and wasting your life,

765
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,670
how do you know

766
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,260
this is not a better result?

767
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,400
This marriage

768
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,800
is far more difficult

769
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,090
than you think.

770
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,750
But at least this time,

771
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,980
you can stay with

772
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,190
the one you really want.

773
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,600
Although she's a concubine,

774
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,170
please treat her well.

775
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,730
Miss Jiang...

776
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Are you drunk?

777
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:21,790
Yes.

778
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,340
I'm drunk.

779
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,100
This toast

780
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,550
is to wish Your Highness

781
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,630
a smooth life.

782
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,510
Although I don't understand what you said,

783
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,630
thank you for your nice words.

784
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,080
Yan Lin is still exiled.

785
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,330
The princess still engaged.

786
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,790
But at least

787
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,010
I've paid off my debt

788
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,520
for the marriage that belonged to you two.

789
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,910
It's the auspicious time.

790
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,670
Please hold the wedding ceremony, Prince and Princess.

791
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,720
Kneel.

792
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,560
♫That story sounds like♫

793
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,130
Take four bows.

794
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,360
First bow to heaven and earth as witness.

795
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,940
♫I fell in love with this bitter happinesss too♫

796
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,840
Rise.

797
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:32,180
♫Even if I embrace my last loneliness♫

798
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,300
Second bow to a lifetime of peace between you two.

799
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,740
♫And disregard the result♫

800
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,360
Rise.

801
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,960
Third bow to growing old and dying together.

802
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,850
♫How many times have I jumped over that cliff?♫

803
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:50,780
♫The fate that conspired with love is too twisted♫

804
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,480
Rise.

805
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,360
Fourth bow to many children and grandchildren.

806
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:57,740
♫Even if I'm in the whirlpool of darkness♫

807
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,390
Rise.

808
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,500
♫I'm willing to fall for you♫

809
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:08,950
♫I wanted to be free like rain♫

810
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,210
♫A flower that can bloom even among mud♫

811
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,720
♫But the closer it gets to the chest♫

812
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,700
♫My heart will be pierced♫

813
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,640
♫Let's make an alliance with love♫

814
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,930
♫Only then will the pain heal♫

815
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,450
Sir.

816
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,990
Why are you here too, Sir?

817
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,120
What about you?

818
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,200
Why are you here alone?

819
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,660
I've already seen the ceremony.

820
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,110
It's noisy to stay in the banquet.

821
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,900
It's better to come here for a peace of mind.

822
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,610
You too, Sir?

823
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,080
Have a seat.

824
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,900
Did you drink?

825
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:14,800
What?

826
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,670
As your teacher,

827
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,920
can't I drink?

828
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,900
No.

829
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,180
It's just that you're usually upright

830
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,140
and you believe in morals.

831
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,720
I thought you would abstain

832
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,510
and not drink.

833
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,260
You must have mistaken me.

834
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,190
I've never been an upright person.

835
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,210
How was your injury that day?

836
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,090
Thanks to you,

837
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,400
I'm almost recovered.

838
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,420
That’s good.

839
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,340
About the Xue family,

840
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,470
give me more time.

841
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:45,510
I...

842
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:45,990
Sir,

843
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,810
I don't want to fight the Xue family anymore.

844
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,030
Why?

845
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,500
Didn't you always tell me

846
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,750
not to act tough

847
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,280
and not to get involved in the court?

848
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,040
But I can't do it.

849
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,180
I caused you a lot of trouble.

850
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,170
Now I have figured it out.

851
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,300
I'm willing to do it.

852
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,700
So even if I leave the capital someday,

853
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,410
you should be rest assured about me.
