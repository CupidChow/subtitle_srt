[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,260
As long as I can take over Ning'an Palace,

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,520
I'm willing to pay any price.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,440
Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,580
The cinnabar imperial brush determines one's life and death.

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,850
Everything

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,030
is like a dream.

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,580
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,940
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,850
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,550
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

12
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,180
There are things

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,910
you can't give me.

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,380
But he can.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,300
To keep my life,

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,920
only you, Sir, can help me.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,350
Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,900
But I'm the only one who can't.

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,450
I want to do my best to make up for

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,280
my past regrets and wrongdoings.

21
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:38,539
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,120
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

23
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,180
Welcome, Your Highness.

24
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,000
Welcome, Your Highness.

25
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,039
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

26
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,220
Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

27
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,250
But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,950
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,610
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,620
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,590
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,380
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,420
A life of absurdity, a story of mistakes and regrets.

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,570
[Story of Kunning Palace]

35
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,420
[Episode 28]

36
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,340
Who're you? Why are you trying to enter the capital in the middle of the night?

37
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,030
Emergency news from the border.

38
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,120
Request to see His Majesty.

39
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,360
As expected from the vicious State of Yue.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,270
Not long ago, they sent an envoy to submit a credential,

41
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,780
in which they proposed a marriage of state.

42
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,600
Later on, they assembled troops to the border and provoked us repeatedly.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,770
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,220
This move of the State of Yue

45
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,640
is clearly a threat.

46
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,510
They're trying to tell us, the State of Qian,

47
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,920
that if we don't promise them profits,

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,470
they'd resort to arms.

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,610
They've shown their greedy and cruel nature.

50
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,860
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,570
Since the era of Taizu, the State of Yue

52
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,150
has been expelled 300 miles away from the State of Qian.

53
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,310
Over the years, half of Yan's troops have been garrisoning at the border

54
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,920
to intimidate the State of Yue.

55
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,770
Now, why does

56
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,260
the State of Yue have the courage

57
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,040
to invade our border for no reason?

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,040
You're underinformed, Mr. Yao.

59
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,230
The troops at the border

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,190
were supposed to be replaced every three years.

61
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,660
Now, since the Yan family was exiled, the troops lost their commander-in-chief.

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,230
The garrison suffered heavy casualties.

63
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,720
If they switch shifts with the troops in Tongzhou according to the old practice,

64
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,210
it'll require a large amount of military pay.

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,630
It must be because the State of Yue witnessed this that they rebelled.

66
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,490
Minister Jiang.

67
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

68
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,450
If we go to war with the State of Yue now,

69
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,130
how much military pay can the Ministry of Revenue raise?

70
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,100
Your Majesty.

71
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,530
Over the past three years,

72
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,600
there've been floods in Huaizhou

73
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,960
and locust plagues in Qianzhou.

74
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,810
The government has repeatedly reduced or exempted taxes.

75
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,650
So now, the state's coffers are rather empty.

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,310
If we want to start a war,

77
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,660
I'm afraid it won't be in our favor.

78
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,420
So we can neither switch troops

79
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,640
nor declare war.

80
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,770
Are we just going to wait around for the State of Yue to send troops south

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,750
and invade our State of Qian?

82
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,210
Your Majesty.

83
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,090
I'm willing to lead troops to the border

84
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,240
and go onto the battlefield myself.

85
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,900
Please allow me, Your Majesty.

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,350
Your Majesty.

87
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,290
I think

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,270
it's inappropriate.

89
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,110
Why?

90
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,880
Wars mainly depend on soldiers,

91
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,350
while soldiers mainly depend on the commander.

92
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,250
Duke Xue hasn't led the army for a long time.

93
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,150
He's not familiar with military affairs and the tactical situation at the border.

94
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,480
Besides, the case of embezzlement on disaster relief funds in Jiangnan hasn't been cleared yet.

95
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,150
Duke Xue is still a suspect.

96
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,230
If he led the army to go to war at this time,

97
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,310
I'm afraid the public wouldn't be convinced.

98
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,190
Zhang Zhe.

99
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,120
Are you suggesting that we State of Qian just endure the humiliation

100
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,480
and send Her Highness there for peace-making marriage?

101
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,160
The matter of leading the army

102
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,640
is vital.

103
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,000
It needs to be treated with great care.

104
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,740
From what you said,

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,550
do you have a better recommendation?

106
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,930
Your Majesty.

107
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,610
If the State of Qian is really going to fight with the State of Yue,

108
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,030
for the country and the people,

109
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,380
Old General Yan Mu

110
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,510
is the most suitable person.

111
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,470
Ridiculous.

112
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,470
Your Majesty.

113
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,840
Colluding with the rebels

114
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,850
equals treason.

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,850
Yan Mu has been exiled thousands of miles away.

116
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,980
How can he be qualified to lead the army?

117
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,570
Although I have my wrongdoings,

118
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,870
I'm more than loyal to our state

119
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,060
and Your Majesty.

120
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,610
I'm willing to lead the army to the border,

121
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,650
to redeem myself

122
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,060
and serve Your Majesty.

123
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,590
Even if I may die on the battlefield,

124
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,510
I have no regrets.

125
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,930
Enough.

126
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,690
I need time to think about it.

127
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:00,950
Let's discuss it later.

128
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,800
Xue Yuan?

129
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,890
He's that old,

130
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,280
and his body was drained by his lust for alcohol and women.

131
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,240
He wants to lead the army to war?

132
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,030
What a joke.

133
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,720
Xue Yuan is a man who only does things for profit.

134
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,200
I'm afraid

135
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,320
his proposal of leading the army isn't that simple.

136
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,340
He has many private soldiers.

137
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,140
If he took this opportunity to lead the army north,

138
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,500
then after several battles,

139
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,100
he'd be able to secretly recruit his private soldiers into the army.

140
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,730
That would be his leverage to control the State of Qian.

141
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,580
That old bastard.

142
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,909
He's really full of dirty tricks.

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,290
What should we do?

144
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,200
Today in the court,

145
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,670
I wanted to take the chance

146
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,750
of the State of Yue invading the border

147
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,230
to suggest recalling Marquis Yan and Yan Lin to the capital.

148
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,830
I didn't expect Zhang Zhe would have thought the same thing.

149
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,420
He proposed it to His Majesty faster than me.

150
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,030
His Majesty agreed?

151
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,040
If His Majesty agreed,

152
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,080
would he look

153
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,490
so worried now?

154
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,260
So he didn't agree.

155
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,140
His Majesty won't send Her Highness there to get married for peace, will he?

156
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,670
Or, will he let that glutton

157
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,090
Xue Yuan lead the army?

158
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,660
The Xue family is a danger to His Majesty.

159
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,120
But in his heart, the Yan family is also a threat.

160
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,040
He worked so hard

161
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,840
to regain the Yan family's military power.

162
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,950
He wouldn't let the Yan family get back on their feet so easily.

163
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,560
His Majesty's mind is unpredictable.

164
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,100
Whether there'll be a war or a peace-making marriage

165
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,250
is all up to him.

166
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,140
My Lady.

167
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,010
Are you really not going to see First Young Lady?

168
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,900
If she likes kneeling so much, just let her be.

169
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,920
My Lady.

170
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,159
Things may not be as serious as you think.

171
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,520
Didn't other families' age-appropriate daughters

172
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,700
also participate in the election?

173
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,580
The Xue family couldn't just frame whoever participated, right?

174
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,670
But other daughters didn't offend the Xue family

175
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,990
or have an affair with Lord Linzi.

176
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,220
Now,

177
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,400
even His Majesty and the Empress Dowager know about this.

178
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,830
I didn't raise and teach her for over 10 years

179
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,610
to let her

180
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,920
jump into the fire pit and suffer.

181
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,260
My Lady.

182
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,800
Someone who claims to be Her Highness is waiting outside.

183
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,050
She's in the front hall now.

184
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,650
Why did Her Highness

185
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,200
come to our home for no reason?

186
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,520
Don't worry, My Lady.

187
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,610
It doesn't look like something bad happened.

188
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,990
Her Highness didn't bring any attendant.

189
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,640
Besides, her outfit is...

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,650
Let's go.

191
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,120
Madam Jiang.

192
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,980
Greetings, Your Highness.

193
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,280
I didn't know you'd come to my humble residence, Your Highness.

194
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,180
I'm on a private visit.

195
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,440
No need to stand on ceremony, Madam.

196
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm here for Ning.

197
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,720
Why did you suddenly come out of the palace, Your Highness?

198
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,570
Because I missed you, of course.

199
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,870
Jie's marriage

200
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,470
caused so many troubles.

201
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,760
Now, Mother doesn't allow you to come into the palace to accompany me anymore.

202
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,680
I was so bored by myself,

203
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,320
so I asked Mother for a day off

204
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,070
to have fun out of the palace.

205
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,200
You rarely come out of the palace, Your Highness.

206
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,400
I'll be your guide today

207
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,680
and take you to have some fun.

208
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,160
Keep your word.

209
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,170
I didn't bring any money.

210
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,510
I'm going to use up your money today.

211
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,630
There's indeed the most beautiful scenery in the capital here.

212
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,070
No wonder Yan Lin used to boast about it to me a lot.

213
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,200
It turns out that the world outside the palace is so wonderful.

214
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,750
No one would choose to be born to be trapped in a cage.

215
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,310
Those outside the palace try their best to get in.

216
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,210
But after entering the palace,

217
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,530
they'd find there's no turning back.

218
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,730
Yes.

219
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,670
Who wouldn't want to leave that place?

220
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,030
Unfortunately, Yan Lin had a choice,

221
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,800
but I...

222
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,300
Your Highness.

223
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,950
I always look happy to you, right?

224
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,360
Actually,

225
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,810
I've always been pretending.

226
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,160
Ning.

227
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,950
At first, like them, you also thought

228
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,020
I was a fussy and domineering princess

229
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,940
who enjoys the bustle of life, right?

230
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,040
Actually, I know

231
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,900
that I

232
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,970
have a bad temper,

233
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,380
and I'm not well-educated.

234
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,720
Others respect me and awe me,

235
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,490
but they wouldn't connect with me.

236
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,410
Only you and Yan Lin

237
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,190
would talk to me sincerely.

238
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,750
Now, Yan Lin is gone,

239
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,330
Jie

240
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,950
is getting married soon,

241
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,660
things ended up like that

242
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,200
for Shu,

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,430
and conflicts are surging

244
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,700
between Lang and Mother.

245
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,480
I thought

246
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,560
as long as I keep living carefreely,

247
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,530
these things would have nothing to do with me.

248
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,280
Unfortunately...

249
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,860
In life,

250
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,990
we all have our own responsibilities to bear.

251
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,790
Your Highness, you were born noble,

252
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,120
so you don't have to suffer from hunger and coldness.

253
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,600
You have your family to keep you company,

254
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,070
and you made many friends.

255
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,990
Although you have things to worry about,

256
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,630
you're still quite lucky.

257
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,780
Is that so?

258
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,700
If things could start over,

259
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,500
I'd rather not have this luck.

260
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,480
If possible,

261
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,660
I don't want to be born in the royal family.

262
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,540
I also want to leave the palace

263
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,930
and explore the vast world.

264
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,470
Your Highness.

265
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,570
What's the matter with you today?

266
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,270
Did something happen in the palace?

267
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,370
No.

268
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,800
I'm just chatting with you.

269
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,770
When I get the chance,

270
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,750
I'll ask Lang to issue an edict

271
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,090
and allow us to travel around the world.

272
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,600
Shuzhong,

273
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,420
Jinling,

274
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,770
and that sea in the south.

275
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,550
We'll go to all those places together.

276
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,120
We must ask Yan Lin to join us.

277
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,740
Yes.

278
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,270
By then,

279
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,660
Yan Lin must have become a general.

280
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,990
He'll have a sword and golden armor.

281
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,630
He'll escort us

282
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,730
to leave the capital

283
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
and never come back.

284
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:37,950
Okay.

285
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,870
Your Highness.

286
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,570
It's time to return to the palace.

287
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,790
I was permitted one day's leave.

288
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,550
Why?

289
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,620
It's not time yet.

290
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,390
It's already dark.

291
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,940
His Majesty and the Empress Dowager

292
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,240
are both worried about Your Highness's safety.

293
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,080
If you want to stay a little longer, Your Highness,

294
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,010
we'll stay here to keep you safe.

295
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,760
No need.

296
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,520
I'll go back with you now.

297
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,470
Yes.

298
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,780
Ning.

299
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,030
I'm leaving.

300
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,300
There're lots of things going on in the palace lately.

301
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,570
Don't come into the palace.

302
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,510
Your Highness.

303
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,670
What happened exactly?

304
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,970
Everything is fine.

305
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,830
Don't worry.

306
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,900
Let's go.

307
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,550
Something wasn't right with Her Highness today.

308
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,590
Did something happen?

309
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,240
Miss!

310
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,740
Miss!

311
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,300
Miss!

312
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,630
-I...
-What's wrong?

313
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,490
Chang Zhuo told us

314
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,350
that...

315
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,190
What did he say?

316
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,180
He said

317
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,160
he heard that

318
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,930
the State of Yue submitted a credential and proposed a marriage of state.

319
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,590
His Majesty is considering it.

320
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,470
[Coffin of Princess Leyang]

321
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,150
No wonder she acted like that today.

322
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,100
But why did it happen even earlier?

323
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,210
What happened earlier?

324
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,390
No.

325
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,720
I have to go into the palace.

326
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:17,810
Miss.

327
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,910
What nonsense are you talking about?

328
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,920
The palace's gate has long been closed at this hour.

329
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,100
You may leave now.

330
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,840
I want to be alone for a while.

331
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,800
The State of Yue?

332
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,630
Peace-making marriage?

333
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,390
She will die.

334
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,770
No way.

335
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,370
Absolutely not.

336
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,230
Sir.

337
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,060
Have a seat.

338
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,950
Sir, so you know that Her Highness

339
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,590
is going to be married there for peace?

340
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,050
His Majesty hasn't issued the edict yet.

341
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,650
Since you knew it,

342
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,070
why didn't you tell me earlier, Sir?

343
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,130
Are you here to question me today?

344
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,570
Sir.

345
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,280
Her Highness can't agree to that peace-making marriage.

346
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,770
It's exactly because the imperial edict hasn't been issued that there's still a chance to change it.

347
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,970
You want to get involved in this?

348
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,020
You know

349
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,330
how well she treats me.

350
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,730
On my way here,

351
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,350
I heard some rumors

352
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,090
and came up with a plan.

353
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,660
But

354
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,890
I have some doubts and I'm a bit hesitated.

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,310
So I wanted to ask you, Sir.

356
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,070
Why don't you play a game with me first?

357
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,730
I'm not good at the game of Go.

358
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,450
I can't think many moves ahead of my next move.

359
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,950
I'm no match for you, Sir.

360
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,450
Playing Go does require calculation.

361
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,910
It's indeed a method.

362
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,310
But when we talk about the game of Go,

363
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,420
it's more about momentum.

364
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,300
Calculation is only a method,

365
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,900
but if you can seize the momentum,

366
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,350
that's the essence.

367
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,230
Momentum?

368
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,800
The Go board is like the territory,

369
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,420
and the stones are like the soldiers.

370
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,250
Since ancient times, the water that bears the boat

371
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,329
is the same that swallows it up.

372
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,700
Losing one stone may be negligible,

373
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,230
but as time goes on, the losses may accumulate to form a momentum.

374
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,770
By that time, the problem will be hard to solve,

375
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,930
and it will cause trouble.

376
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,380
Therefore,

377
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,410
a Go player should take advantage of the momentum.

378
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,950
Ruling the people and flood control are the same.

379
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,510
How can you compare people to stones?

380
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,750
A stone is controlled by the player,

381
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,810
but everyone has a mind

382
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,200
of their own.

383
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,560
You can control stones when playing Go,

384
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,290
but if you want to talk about controlling people's minds...

385
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,310
Times make heroes,

386
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,820
and heroes shape the times.

387
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,340
Although it's hard to predict people's attitude,

388
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,370
if they don't think clearly,

389
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,330
once others fan the flames,

390
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,790
it's not hard

391
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,860
for a person's mind to follow the momentum.

392
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,460
I understand.

393
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,450
Thanks a lot, Sir.

394
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,400
So you're not going to ask?

395
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,680
I already got the answer.

396
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,310
However,

397
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,710
I want to borrow someone from you, Sir.

398
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,250
Look at the Xue family.

399
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:19,400
[Candidate, Weng Ang]

400
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,280
What a bunch of losers.

401
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,090
They plotted and schemed for a long time

402
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,520
to take down the Yan family,

403
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,820
causing the shortage of manpower at the border.

404
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,300
Therefore, we failed to keep the State of Yue outside the border.

405
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,890
Now,

406
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,090
they've started to invade the border,

407
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,220
and the safety of the State of Qian

408
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,800
can only be secured

409
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,980
by sending the princess there for peace-making marriage.

410
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,930
How gritty!

411
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,030
Well done!

412
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,640
Qifan.

413
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,600
You can drink as you wish,

414
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,550
but you can't talk nonsense like that.

415
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,560
Are you drunk?

416
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,630
I'm more than sober.

417
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,280
In my opinion,

418
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,860
whoever caused the trouble

419
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,710
should be the one to solve it.

420
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,790
We may as well send

421
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,190
the daughter of the Xue family to the State of Yue for peace-making marriage.

422
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,100
Isn't that good?

423
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,480
She has good looks,

424
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,060
and she's of high status.

425
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,660
The State of Yue must be happy with it.

426
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,500
Qifan.

427
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,630
Let's go somewhere else.

428
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,840
There are too many people here watching.

429
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,220
I'm not drunk yet.

430
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,790
It's okay. Let's go.

431
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,440
I'm not drunk.

432
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,790
Let's go somewhere else.

433
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,570
I know that man.

434
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,930
He comes to Cengxiao Restaurant for drinks a lot.

435
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,020
I heard that he's a candidate.

436
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,810
His name is Weng Ang.

437
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,030
People call him Weng Qifan.

438
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,890
He's very talented.

439
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,650
That's why

440
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,710
he's arrogant

441
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,650
and dares to say anything.

442
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,590
What?

443
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,400
Miss Jiang, do you have a crush on him?

444
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,660
Are you serious?

445
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,130
What do you see in him?

446
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,200
The will of the people.

447
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,170
In the streets,

448
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,460
one or two people's words

449
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,600
may be negligible

450
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,670
and will disappear in an instant.

451
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,170
But the voices of thousands of people

452
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,000
are different.

453
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,230
I wanted to see you here

454
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,150
for this.

455
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,700
You're thinking about controlling the will of the people?

456
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,620
Not controlling,

457
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,130
but guiding according to the momentum.

458
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,040
The will of the people already exists.

459
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,660
Everyone

460
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,410
has their own judgment.

461
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,020
Weng Ang is like that.

462
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,690
It's also true for others.

463
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,880
As for the State of Yue's disruption of the alliance and troublemaking,

464
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,500
Her Highness's peace-making marriage,

465
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,040
and the doings of the Xue family,

466
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,410
there're already lots of voices against those

467
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,580
among the public.

468
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,280
But those voices are too scattered and too weak.

469
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,030
What I want

470
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,400
is to amplify the people's voices

471
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,710
to form a torrent,

472
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,070
which will become the power to stop Her Highness from getting married.

473
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,710
You've been in the streets for a long time.

474
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,150
You must have your connections.

475
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,060
You can count on me

476
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,190
for this.

477
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,680
But...

478
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,580
But what?

479
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,010
If you want more people,

480
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,090
this is a must.

481
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,930
30,000 taels.

482
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,110
Ask me for more if it's not enough.

483
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,300
This...

484
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,540
Really?

485
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,760
I didn't know

486
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,020
you are so rich.

487
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,950
This was meant for someone else.

488
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,480
I didn't expect after what happened,

489
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,000
this money would be used here.

490
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,940
But you...

491
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,690
You can ask someone else to do this.

492
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,280
Why

493
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,920
does it have to be me?

494
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,250
Because your surname is Xue.

495
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,830
If you get caught,

496
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,070
the Xue family will be the one to blame.

497
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,320
It'll have nothing to do with the Jiang family.

498
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,170
I...

499
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,590
How is the investigation going?

500
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,830
The case Minister Jiang brought up is well hidden.

501
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,360
Since the government's money for disaster relief

502
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,980
is specially marked,

503
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,030
I used my connections in business to investigate,

504
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,420
found the private bank that specializes in erasing the marks

505
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,680
in the dark market,

506
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,000
and finally found a clue.

507
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,410
It's said that

508
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,800
after the Xue family embezzled the money,

509
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,860
they bought a lot of military supplies with that money.

510
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,400
The arms of Tongzhou Army

511
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,090
and the military supplies here.

512
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,510
How many soldiers is Xue Yuan maintaining exactly?

513
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,380
But

514
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,150
why does he need so many soldiers?

515
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,970
Is he planning to rebel?

516
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,760
That's too bold.

517
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,350
He's eager for quick success.

518
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,850
It's not surprising that he has such thoughts.

519
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,710
Besides, Xue Yuan is very scheming.

520
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,620
I'm afraid he also hid it from the Empress Dowager.

521
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,170
If so,

522
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,860
our plan to deal with the Xue family needs to be adjusted,

523
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,830
in case they get irritated and act on impulse.

524
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,450
How's it going with Ning'er?

525
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,220
She's generous.

526
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,760
She offered me tens of thousands of taels

527
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,220
without even blinking.

528
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,870
In order to save Her Highness,

529
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,170
she's willing to sacrifice anything.

530
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,040
Sir.

531
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,020
Zhou Yinzhi is waiting outside. He wants to see you.

532
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,860
Zhou Yinzhi?

533
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,410
Why haven't I heard of him?

534
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,310
Who's that?

535
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,850
He's one of the Xingwu Guards.

536
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,810
Xingwu Guards?

537
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:12,540
Wait.

538
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,070
Why does he want to see you?

539
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,730
He must have his own reasons.

540
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,860
Greetings, Mr. Xie. I'm Zhou Yinzhi.

541
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,230
What brings you here

542
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,860
in the middle of the night, Mr. Zhou?

543
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,800
To be honest,

544
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,960
I've been suspected

545
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,490
by Duke Xue since I helped Miss Jiang several times.

546
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,930
Now in the Xingwu Guards,

547
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,430
my hands are tied.

548
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,300
So I specially came here tonight to ask you

549
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,040
what I should do in the future, Mr. Xie.

550
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,170
Please enlighten me.

551
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,940
I heard that

552
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,710
Duke Xue maintained some unregistered Xingwu Guards

553
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,220
near the capital.

554
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,880
The Ministry of Justice has also been investigating this case recently.

555
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,170
If you really want to defect to us, Mr. Zhou,

556
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,910
why don't you look carefully for some evidence first?

557
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,830
When I report to His Majesty about this,

558
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,410
I won't forget your contribution, Mr. Zhou.

559
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,810
I understand

560
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,010
what you mean, Mr. Xie.

561
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,090
Have you heard?

562
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,740
His Majesty has been investigating

563
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,820
the embezzlement of disaster relief funds in Jiangnan from 3 years ago.

564
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,520
It's said that Duke Xue was the mastermind behind it.

565
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,730
Yes.

566
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,320
So many people died in Jiangnan back then.

567
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,460
If it really was the Xue family that did it,

568
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,290
we can't let them get away with this.

569
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,660
This is serious.

570
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,600
Let me tell you.

571
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,150
If back then, the Xue family...

572
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,780
The Xue family

573
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,860
not only embezzled money,

574
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,120
but they also tried to attain power.

575
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,140
The Yan family was persecuted because of this.

576
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,760
If the Yan family was still there,

577
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,400
why would Her Highness have to get married for peace?

578
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,160
I heard that

579
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,100
not long ago,

580
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,430
Miss Xue abused her power in Xingwu Guards

581
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,960
and framed others with rumors.

582
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,200
But she didn't get punished at all after things got exposed.

583
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,450
Is that the privilege of the Xue family?

584
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,800
Why is it not the Xue family

585
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,400
that marries their daughter to the State of Yue?

586
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,350
What kind of world is this?

587
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,750
Exactly. What kind of logic is this?

588
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,540
If there will be a peace-making marriage,

589
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,440
the daughter of the Xue family should be the bride.

590
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,830
The Xue family should be the one to do it, right?

591
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,920
Why should they just enjoy the privileges and not take the responsibility?

592
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,850
Why should the Xue family just enjoy the privileges and not take the responsibility?

593
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,890
Exactly.

594
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,940
Mr. Xie.

595
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,020
Have you heard about

596
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,230
the public opinion on the Xue family in the capital?

597
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,460
What public opinion?

598
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,410
I've been busy recently,

599
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,270
so I didn't notice.

600
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,860
I don't know what happened exactly,

601
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,210
but in the streets, there've been voices that demand

602
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,750
the Xue family to confess their crimes.

603
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,330
They also said Miss Xue should be sent there for peace-making marriage instead of Her Highness.

604
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,880
In short, the public is very dissatisfied with the Xue family.

605
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,340
There are always criticisms in the streets.

606
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,190
Soon, they'll disappear.

607
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
Besides,

608
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,020
Duke Xue will handle these things himself.

609
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,320
-We don't have to worry about it.
-Yes.

610
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,690
Yes.

611
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,350
We should just keep investigating.

612
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,340
Who do you think

613
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,150
leaked the crimes

614
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,850
of the Xue family?

615
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,390
There are many people involved in the case investigation.

616
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,190
And countless Xingwu Guards were investigated.

617
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,570
Anyone is possible.

618
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,960
I'm afraid the source

619
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,750
cannot be traced.

620
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,210
[Cengxiao Restaurant]

621
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,770
The poem you wrote

622
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
is really wonderful, Su.

623
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,440
Wonderful.

624
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,580
If it were a little subtler...

625
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,240
Are you Weng Ang?

626
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,610
Yes, I am.

627
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,720
Who are you, may I ask?

628
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,600
Why did you hit me?

629
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,110
So you were the one

630
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,150
who spread the rumor and criticized the Xue family.

631
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,110
So you're Mr. Xue.

632
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,240
Come on, everyone.

633
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,980
Come and take a look.

634
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,120
See if I'm right.

635
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,310
The Xue family is tyrannical

636
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,350
and bullies others.

637
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,230
What Mr. Xue is doing right now

638
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,500
is the best evidence.

639
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,310
I'm more or less a man of honor,

640
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,390
yet you dare to hit me in public.

641
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,310
If I were a commoner,

642
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,950
he might do something even wilder.

643
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,350
If you keep talking nonsense,

644
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,990
I'll teach you how to behave.

645
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,810
We studied hard for more than 10 years

646
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,460
and passed the imperial examination

647
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,770
with the aim of seeking justice

648
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,680
and voicing injustice,

649
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,660
not begging for mercy from you powerful people.

650
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,490
I won't change my word

651
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,100
even if you beat me to death today.

652
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,340
Fine.

653
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,700
You're a tough one.

654
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,430
I'll take you back and loosen your bones.

655
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,820
Arrest them!

656
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,820
What are you doing?

657
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,550
What are you doing?

658
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,900
What are you doing?

659
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,380
Let go! Let go!

660
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,130
Let go of me!

661
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,100
The Xue family are all degenerates.

662
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,510
I would say the same thing even if you arrest me.

663
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,610
Does the imperial court

664
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,460
belong to the Xue family?

665
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,270
Someone is going to be killed.

666
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,140
Look, everyone.

667
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,350
Xue felt guilty.

668
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,570
He wants to kill me in public.

669
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,300
Is there any law?

670
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,030
Is there any justice?

671
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,200
Exactly. So outrageous.

672
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,410
Am I right?

673
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,560
Is there any justice?

674
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,650
-Go.
-Let go of me!

675
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,230
Don't let him get away.

676
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,680
-Don't run if you dare.
-Move!

677
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,740
Stop him, everyone.

678
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,800
Scum of the Xue family!

679
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,440
Don't run if you dare!

680
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,360
Stop!

681
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,730
You heard it all?

682
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,390
You asked me to leak the information of Weng Ang to Xue Ye.

683
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,150
Is that what you want? Public anger?

684
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,490
The Xue family's foundation is martial arts after all.

685
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,150
They don't know the pride

686
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,660
or the anger of scholars.

687
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,470
Weng Ang is not someone Xue Ye can beat.

688
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,600
The Xue family

689
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,960
will be vilified by the scholars all over the country.

690
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,510
Aren't you afraid that

691
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,730
Weng Ang would be beaten to death by them?

692
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,780
Didn't Teacher send Dao Qin to protect him?

693
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,510
He wouldn't die.

694
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,300
But it hurt.

695
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,640
No wonder even someone like him is under your control.

696
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
So cruel.

697
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,520
Bastard!

698
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,330
I told you to stay at home,

699
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,050
yet you went out to cause trouble.

700
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,370
Do you think the trouble is not enough?

701
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,640
Father.

702
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,720
It's because that Weng Ang went too far.

703
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,320
He criticized our Xue family everywhere he went

704
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,490
in the name of a candidate.

705
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,560
He even said that our Xue family is viciously ambitious,

706
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,720
and we should send Shu to the State of Yue for peace-making marriage.

707
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,020
The peace-making marriage is nothing

708
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,480
compared to the collapse of the Xue family.

709
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,410
Can't you even tell what's more important?

710
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,920
Look at you.

711
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,430
How can you be the viscount of the Xue family?

712
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,520
Father.

713
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,590
Father, I know I was wrong.

714
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,500
I'm sorry.

715
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,130
Please give me another chance, Father.

716
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,820
Go away!

717
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,600
You are a man.

718
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,570
How inappropriate!

719
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,180
Get up!

720
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,030
Father.

721
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,000
What should we do now?

722
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,040
If we want to win the people back,

723
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,210
we can only follow the will of the people,

724
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,710
not against it.

725
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,930
You mean

726
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,490
we should follow the will of the people

727
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,680
and send Shu there for peace-making marriage?

728
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,460
Please save me, Aunt.

729
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,590
I really don't want to be sent there for peace-making marriage.

730
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,620
Please, Aunt.

731
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,350
If you didn't

732
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,760
use that stupid trick to frame Jiang back then

733
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,100
and didn't get the Xue family involved,

734
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,250
I might be able to defend you today.

735
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,020
After all, the Xue family is powerful.

736
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,810
If you're sent there for peace-making marriage,

737
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,310
it'll be like a thorn in His Majesty's heart.

738
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,030
He also doesn't want the Xue family to collude with the State of Yue.

739
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,180
But look at you.

740
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,890
You handed the knife to His Majesty yourself,

741
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,200
so that he could use that excuse to weaken the Xue family.

742
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,090
But your stupid move

743
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,870
somehow probed His Majesty's mind

744
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,990
by chance.

745
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,690
I have to clean up

746
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,360
the mess you made.

747
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,450
As for the peace-making marriage,

748
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,090
there's nothing I can do even if I want to.

749
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,000
I only agreed to see you today

750
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,430
because you

751
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,420
kneeled outside the palace for hours.

752
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,860
You may leave now.

753
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,370
From now on,

754
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,840
you don't have to enter the palace anymore.

755
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,780
Are you really going to watch

756
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,650
me go to that dangerous State of Yue for peace-making marriage, Aunt?

757
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,220
Zhiyi is my own child.

758
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,950
She can go, so why can't you?

759
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,800
There're no family ties in the royal family.

760
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,180
You are too stupid.

761
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,520
It's not that I'm too cruel.

762
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,080
Aunt.

763
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,180
Aunt!

764
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,780
Please, Aunt!

765
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,900
Aunt!

766
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,650
-I beg you, Aunt!
-Huang Renli.

767
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,400
-Guards!
-Aunt.

768
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,500
Aunt!

769
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,270
Aunt, please!

770
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,670
Aunt!

771
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,620
[Tai'an Hall]

772
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,210
The eunuchs in the palace must have been careless.

773
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,780
How could this thing be here?

774
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,400
[No animal was harmed during filming]

775
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:31,900
Give it to me.

776
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,520
I know the routes in the palace.

777
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,880
I want to be alone for a while.

778
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,730
I can get out of the palace by myself.

779
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:38,960
Yes.

780
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,540
If we want to win the people back,

781
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,230
we can only follow the will of the people,

782
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,670
not against it.

783
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,870
You may leave now.

784
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,430
From now on,

785
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,900
you don't have to enter the palace anymore.

786
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,760
Are you really going to watch me

787
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,320
go to that dangerous State of Yue for peace-making marriage, Aunt?

788
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,670
You dragged Xingwu Guards,

789
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,350
your father,

790
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,810
and I into this.

791
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,739
How can I show you mercy?

792
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,570
Bastard!

793
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,070
You're a disgrace to the Xue family.

794
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,300
Your Majesty.

795
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,080
Where are you resting tonight?

796
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,760
Nobel Consort Qin has been pregnant for a long time.

797
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,080
If I don't go see her tonight,

798
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,400
I'm afraid she'll come and make trouble again.

799
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,100
Your Majesty.

800
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,470
Miss Xue from Mansion of Duke Xue

801
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,130
has something important to tell you.

802
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,870
Let her in.

803
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,230
Yes.

804
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,470
Your Majesty.

805
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,590
So about Nobel Consort Qin...

806
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,560
It's fine.

807
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,920
I can go later.

808
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,350
You've never been

809
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,860
close to me, Cousin.

810
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,350
Now the palace gate is going to be closed.

811
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,260
Why are you here?

812
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,860
I'm here

813
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,530
to surrender to you, Your Majesty.

814
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,890
We are family.

815
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,170
What are you talking about?

816
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,180
Your Majesty, you work hard to govern our state,

817
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,220
and you're in your prime.

818
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,560
Now that Nobel Consort Qin is carrying a royal heir,

819
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,220
you should have attained great power.

820
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,040
However, the Empress Dowager is interfering with the court affairs,

821
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,930
and the Xue family is deeply rooted so you can't get rid of it.

822
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,030
Your Majesty,

823
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,540
your hands are always tied.

824
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,820
Although someone in the court

825
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,520
dug up an old case which might shake the Xue family,

826
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,470
Rome wasn't built

827
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,810
in a day.

828
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,980
Likewise, the roots of a giant tree can't be pulled out

829
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,230
within a day.

830
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,660
If you want to get rid of the Xue family, Your Majesty,

831
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,760
I'm willing to offer my help.

832
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,270
You're willing to be my knife?

833
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,740
Yes.

834
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,330
Don't forget

835
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,000
your surname is Xue.

836
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,440
Why should I believe you?

837
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,910
My surname is Xue, so what?

838
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,460
In Father and Aunt's eyes,

839
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,470
I'm just a pawn.

840
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,160
When I'm no longer useful,

841
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,160
they can throw me away anytime.

842
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,620
Since I'm destined to be a pawn,

843
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,680
of course

844
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,060
I'd rather be a pawn

845
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,650
for the most noble person in this world.

846
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,060
Shu didn't come back all night.

847
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,470
Could something have happened to her?

848
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,610
Didn't the maid say she went into the palace yesterday?

849
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,870
Maybe she stayed in the palace to serve the Empress Dowager.

850
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,200
It's nothing unusual.

851
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,560
I don't think we need to worry about her.

852
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,510
But this time, she went out

853
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,940
without my order.

854
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,650
When she comes back,

855
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,060
I must punish her by the family rule.

856
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,120
Eunuch Wang.

857
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,870
Congratulations, Duke Xue.

858
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,870
What for?

859
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,320
Your daughter slept in the Imperial Study last night.

860
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,760
She got conferred the title of Consort Xian this morning.

861
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,910
His Majesty ordered me to deliver the edict.

862
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,810
Of course I should congratulation you, Duke.

863
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,000
[Tai'an Hall]

864
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

865
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,560
Who asked her to come?

866
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,950
Get out.

867
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,670
Mother, calm down.

868
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,660
Yes.

869
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,580
Don't get mad and ruin your health

870
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,680
for some

871
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,020
disgraceful hussy.

872
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,730
It's the palace rule

873
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,640
that consorts should greet Your Majesty every day.

874
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,460
Since you are not in a good mood today,

875
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,520
I'll come again tomorrow.

876
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,740
I'll take my leave.

877
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,040
Shu.

878
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,990
You have something to say to me, Your Highness?

879
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,980
Why did you do that?

880
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,360
What did I do?

881
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,690
Shameless?

882
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,140
Getting into His Majesty's bed?

883
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,540
Why don't you ask yourself, Your Highness?

884
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,810
Wasn't it because of you all

885
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,950
that I became who I am today?

886
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,310
When did I ever do anything to you?

887
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,720
You didn't.

888
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,570
We've known each other for years.

889
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,080
But in your heart,

890
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,190
I'm not even as important as Jiang Xuening.

891
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,630
I was born to be a perfect match for Lord Linzi.

892
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,510
But he fell in love with Jiang Xuehui

893
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,380
who's inferior to me in every aspect.

894
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,060
Where were you

895
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,260
when he refused to marry me?

896
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,650
And where were you

897
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,940
when I was abandoned by the Xue family, Your Highness?

898
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,750
Now,

899
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,970
the State of Yue is invading.

900
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,830
You should be the one who marries there.

901
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,870
Why should I go instead of you?

902
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,790
So you think

903
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,730
everything you did

904
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,260
is right?

905
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,030
Are you talking about right and wrong with me?

906
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,770
Your Highness, you've never experienced the taste of losing everything.

907
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,780
When that day comes,

908
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,630
you will know that

909
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,330
everyone

910
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,510
will make the same choice as me.

911
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,750
There is only victory or defeat in this world.

912
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,160
There's no right or wrong.

913
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,680
She actually did that?

914
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,440
I thought

915
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,660
she was supposed to be arrogant and conceited.

916
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,600
I didn't expect her

917
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,200
to disgrace herself like this now that the situation changed.

918
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,330
But walls have ears.

919
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,430
The rumor has started outside.

920
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,040
Even if she was conferred the title of consort,

921
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,010
her reputation would still be ruined.

922
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,410
She seems to have ruined her reputation,

923
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,860
but she saved herself.

924
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,980
Now Her Highness

925
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,800
is faced with the dead end again.

926
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,020
Your Majesty, you still haven't made up your mind to issue an edict?

927
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,450
She is my own sister.

928
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,120
But she's also the Princess of the State of Qian.

929
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,240
She's supposed to share your burden, Your Majesty.

930
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,820
Now you're in a dilemma.

931
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,850
On the one hand, you don't trust the Yan family.

932
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,150
On the other hand, you can't hand the military power over to the Xue family.

933
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,570
There's no capable general in the court that can be of use,

934
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,350
so there's no chance of winning if you declare war.

935
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,230
I also think

936
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,750
it's better not to go to war now.

937
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,950
Why do you say so?

938
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,490
The State of Yue is experiencing the change of royal power.

939
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,710
The new emperor has just ascended the throne.

940
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,520
They also don't necessarily

941
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
want to go to war.

942
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,820
In my opinion,

943
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,000
it's just a means for the new emperor of the State of Yue

944
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,830
to win over the people.

945
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,120
But maybe

946
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,070
a peace-making marriage is what they actually want.

947
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,210
The State of Yue is viciously ambitious.

948
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,250
The peace-making marriage can only suppress them for now.

949
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,750
If I really let Zhiyi get married to stop the war,

950
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,970
the people will

951
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,100
spit on me.

952
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,660
I know it's hard for you, Your Majesty.

953
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,800
But it's only called peace-making marriage if we were defeated.

954
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,720
We only want to make that marriage happen

955
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,320
to build a good relationship between the two states.

956
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,580
If a marriage can stop a war,

957
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,940
the people will only be grateful to you, Your Majesty.

958
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,250
Actually, speaking of which,

959
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,760
Zhiyi is not young anymore.

960
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,920
She's already age-appropriate for marriage.

961
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,870
Getting married far away

962
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,270
is just a temporary measure.

963
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,440
When the tactical situation becomes stable at the border,

964
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,300
and when you gain steady control over the court, Your Majesty,

965
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,460
we can get her back.

966
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,440
The biggest taboo

967
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,980
is someone else sleeping on the emperor's bed.

968
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,770
His Majesty wouldn't have conferred her the title of concubine for no reason.

969
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,100
Especially

970
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,560
at this critical moment.

971
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,520
After thinking about it,

972
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,770
there's only one possibility.

973
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,060
Xue Shu cut off her family ties herself

974
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,300
and drew a line.

975
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,460
From now on, she'll change her target

976
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,010
and fight against the Xue family for His Majesty.

977
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,750
It's a good thing

978
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,550
that she'll fight against the Xue family.

979
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,750
But it's not a good thing for Her Highness.

980
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,790
If Her Highness really leaves for the peace-making marriage,

981
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,140
she will be the first one to die

982
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,250
when we go to war with the State of Yue in the future.

983
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,280
How do you know there will be a war?
