Naturally, we'll enter the General's Mansion

How can we mobilize without an imperial edict?

Even if the soldiers acknowledge me as a Marquis,

46
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,570
the court will surely hold me accountable in the future.

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,690
We mustn't do that.

But if this means that Junior Preceptor Xie 
has to bear the crime of forging the imperial edict,

58

I'd have shared some of your burden.

189
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,840
Every time I think about what a carefree life I led

190
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,270
in the capital

191
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,630
while my brother was suffering alone,

192
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,420
my heart breaks.

193
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,850
My child.

194
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,190
It must have been tough on you to be alone

195
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,950
all these years.

196
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,160
Although we're now far away from the capital

197
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,690
and there's no ancestral temple to witness this,

198
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,050
wherever we are

199
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,330
is home.

200
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,680
You're finally home.

201
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,340
Uncle.

202
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,980
It's good that you're back.

203
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,520
In that case,

204
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,490
I can finally explain to your mother.

205
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,220
Back then,

206
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,380
I couldn't protect you and your mother.

207
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,330
As your uncle, I'm sorry.

208
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,380
No.

209
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,110
The ones who should repent

210
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,690
and atone for it

211
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,710
are Lord Pingnan

212
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,830
and Xue Yuan.

213
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,210
You win.

214
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,590
In order to gain merit,

215
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,730
you even risked your own son's life.

216
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,700
I really underestimated you.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,690
Fine.

218
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,970
You don’t care about this one,

219
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,560
but don’t forget, Xue Yuan,

220
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,590
that I still have

221
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,400
the lives of hundreds of children

222
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,520
and all the lives of the city's people in my hands.

223
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,820
Do you not care about them?

224
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,710
I'm warning you one last time.

225
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,850
Retreat immediately.

226
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,980
Otherwise,

227
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,940
I'll kill them all!

228
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,460
The safety of the Empress and the Crown Prince

229
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,960
concerns the country.

230
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,150
Even millions of people's lives

231
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,470
can't threaten me.

232
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,480
Besides, you can't find them anyway.

233
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,120
Otherwise, you wouldn't have been in the city for days

234
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,720
yet only found a fake one.

235
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,650
All soldiers,

236
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,940
listen to my order.

237
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,700
Take back the Imperial City

238
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,250
at all costs.

239
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,270
Attack!

240
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,810
Kill!

241
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,900
Yan Min is dead.

242
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,230
Xue Yuan remarried.

243
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,250
And you

244
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,930
died in the chaos in the capital.

245
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,740
I spared your life

246
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,990
because you're useful.

247
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,480
If you're useless,

248
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,200
you should die.

249
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,950
Do you know

250
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,620
what it means to you

251
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,520
to give up your last name?

252
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,860
Yes.

253
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,790
Are you still going to give it up?

254
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,740
My mother has passed away.

255
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,750
My father is unworthy.

256
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,910
I hate that I have the last name that he's disgraced.

257
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,820
I don't want

258
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,830
such a last name.

259
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,410
Thank God for your mercy.

260
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,600
In a crisis, one sees one's true nature.

261
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,880
I, Ju'an, dare not forget it.

262
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,270
-I'm willing to give up my old last name.
-I'm willing to give up my old last name.

263
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,690
-Abandon my old name
-Abandon my old name

264
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,100
-and my old identity.
-and my old identity.

265
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,820
-No matter how hard it is,
-No matter how hard it is,

266
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,020
-I won't change my mind.
-I won't change my mind.

267
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,050
I'm no longer Xue Dingfei,

268
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,230
much less a viscount of the Xue family.

269
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,230
All I have

270
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,440
is the Yan family's blood.

271
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,140
And my name

272
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,150
is Xie Wei.

273
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,650
Not only do I live for myself,

274
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,260
but also for the 300 Loyal Souls.

275
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,870
I vow

276
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,460
to never let it go

277
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,130
and seek justice for them.

278
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,360
Okay.

279
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,310
It doesn't matter what your name is.

280
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,380
You'll always be the child of the Yan family.

281
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,810
Uncle.

282
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,090
The current situation is turbulent

283
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,110
and the future is unclear.

284
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,290
In front of others,

285
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,720
we shouldn't make any changes.

286
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,160
I'm still your junior

287
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,380
and Yan Lin's teacher.

288
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,740
You don't want others to know

289
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,940
because you're afraid that someone might play tricks,

290
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,980
and also because you want

291
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,310
to take the blame for forging the imperial edict alone,

292
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,410
right?

293
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,190
Now that Yan Lin and I've come all the way here,

294
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,610
we're prepared to face the worst outcome.

295
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,860
You don't need to bear the responsibility alone.

296
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,390
The crime of forging the imperial edict

297
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,410
can be offset by the contributions

298
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,280
of saving the princess and pacifying the State of Yue.

299
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,230
It's not a dead end.

300
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,200
But now,

301
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,880
there's one thing I need to verify first.

302
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,200
What is it?

303
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,320
Yan Lin told me

304
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,780
that the State of Yue has been acting abnormally lately.

305
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,890
I suspect they are secretly in cahoots with someone

306
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,980
and are doing this on purpose.

307
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,380
If we can't guarantee the safety behind the front line

308
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,690
and blindly start a war,

309
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,540
it'll only make us vulnerable on both ends.

310
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,750
I heard

311
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,030
that on your way here,

312
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,240
you were attacked by the Xue family.

313
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,340
Could it be them?

314
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,520
If the Xue family wanted to start a war,

315
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,760
they wouldn’t have tried to assassinate me

316
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,300
unnecessarily on the way.

317
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,610
Judging from the handwriting,

318
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,820
it looks like someone else did it.

319
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,320
My darling Hong Jian.

320
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,710
I missed you so much.

321
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,970
Xiao Bao? Xiao...

322
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,870
Lord...

323
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,790
Lord Pingnan?

324
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,790
W-Why are you here?

325
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,770
Why am I here?

326
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,030
You're becoming more and more independent.

327
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,319
You gave me such a big gift in Tongzhou.

328
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,609
Tell me.

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,369
How can I not visit you personally?

330
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,450
It's a misunderstanding.

331
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,089
A huge misunderstanding.

332
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,040
It was because the court's people were there that day.

333
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,369
Xie Wei and I

334
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,280
were afraid that we'd ruin your plan.

335
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,550
That's... That's why...

336
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,430
That's why?

337
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,460
Really?

338
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,700
You go by the name of Xue Dingfei,

339
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,290
but you're so uneducated.

340
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,170
If the actual Xue Dingfei were here,

341
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,490
he'd have come up with a reason

342
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,330
that I'd have to believe.

343
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,560
Yes.

344
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,190
You're right, Lord Pingnan.

345
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,290
I am stupid.

346
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,210
But I know

347
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,770
you've helped us a lot.

348
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,550
So...

349
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,050
Of course I'm loyal to you.

350
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,690
How could I go against you?

351
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,940
This is loyalty?

352
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,100
I raised you two as my own children.

353
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,630
But what about you?

354
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,770
Is this how you repay me?

355
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,110
Spare the rod and spoil the child.

356
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,260
Looks like it's time

357
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,670
to teach you two a lesson.

358
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,360
Have a look!

359
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,550
Have a look.

360
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,710
-Do you like spicy food? 
-I'll leave the money here.

361
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,110
Flower cloth!

362
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,150
General Yan.

363
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,090
This is the first time you brought a lady here.

364
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,260
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

365
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,340
I won't pay if you keep talking nonsense.

366
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,690
You brought your beloved one here.

367
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,940
How can I charge you?

368
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,380
Eat as much as you can.

369
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,460
Eat as much as you want.

370
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,790
I'll get back to work.

371
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,680
Get more yourself if it's not enough.

372
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,310
Looks like you're doing well here.

373
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,350
It's only been a while but you already get along with everyone.

374
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,730
This place is different from the capital.

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,070
There aren't many rules.

376
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,280
I feel more at ease.

377
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,510
Yan Lin.

378
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,790
You've really matured a lot.

379
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,540
What about you?

380
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,510
How have you been?

381
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,950
Of course I've been doing well.

382
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,290
Are you

383
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,400
with Mr. Zhang Zhe?

384
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,610
♫How many people can one love in a lifetime?♫

385
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,090
♫Can you understand the love and hate♫

386
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,520
♫In the eyes looking at you?♫

387
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:22,480
♫How much true love exists in this vast world♫

388
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,080
No big deal.

389
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,680
I just saw this by the street

390
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,420
and picked it for you.

391
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,830
♫To be worthy of so many poems?♫

392
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,680
Don't be upset.

393
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,940
♫There are too many stories to be written♫

394
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,190
♫Youths know no worries♫

395
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,660
So,

396
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,190
♫We drank under the moon amidst flowers♫

397
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,970
even without Mr. Zhang,

398
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,870
it still isn't me, right?

399
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,170
♫We saw flowers blooming yesterday♫

400
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,740
♫And thought they'd still be blooming tomorrow♫

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,800
Yan Lin.

402
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,580
Find a girl who loves you

403
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,610
♫When we were young♫

404
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,600
and live happily.

405
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,410
Don't worry.

406
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,570
♫We believed that as long as we could♫

407
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,570
I will.

408
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,650
By then,

409
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,660
♫Hold those warm hands♫

410
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,580
after I finish the war

411
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:55,890
and earn the marquis title,

412
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,000
♫We could be with our beloved one forever♫

413
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,980
I'll marry a good girl

414
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,630
and dote on her endlessly.

415
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,450
♫Time flies and everything's like a dream♫

416
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,500
By then,

417
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,970
it'll be too late for you to be envious.

418
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:15,380
♫I traveled so far but still can't forget you♫

419
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,650
The rescue of the princess is imminent

420
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,890
and the war is about to start.

421
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:22,000
♫I spent half my life loving you but ended up being a joke♫

422
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,530
Yan Lin.

423
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,630
You must take care of yourself.

424
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,290
One can be easily harmed by weapons in combat.

425
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,490
Be careful.

426
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,520
Don't worry.

427
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,130
♫My heart is broken♫

428
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,890
I will.

429
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,310
♫But I never regret loving you♫

430
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,030
Miss Jiang.

431
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,500
Mr. Xie's looking for me?

432
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,090
Yes.

433
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,170
What's the matter?

434
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,290
You'll know when you get there.

435
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,180
Sir, Miss Jiang is here.

436
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,080
You're back.

437
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,700
Mr. Xie, this is...

438
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,890
I'm new to the border.

439
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,410
I'm not used to the food,

440
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,990
so I cooked myself some dishes.

441
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
I thought you haven't had dinner,

442
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,760
so I'm inviting you to join me.

443
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,700
Dinner?

444
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,030
But I've already...

445
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,550
Why? You don't want to eat?

446
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,120
If I'd known,

447
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,080
I wouldn't have eaten that bowl of wontons.

448
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,490
But if I say I've eaten,

449
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,600
it'll spoil his mood.

450
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,710
I'd rather die from eating too much food.

451
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,640
Of course not.

452
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,860
I just didn't expect

453
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,480
that you could cook so well.

454
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,720
I learned some skills in my early years of travel.

455
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,240
You're back so late.

456
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,590
You must be hungry.

457
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,740
Eat up.

458
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,870
Why is it so sour?

459
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,740
Is it sour?

460
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,690
I think it's okay.

461
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm in a bad mood,

462
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,400
so it's natural that my food is seasoned a little too sour.

463
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,390
The border

464
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,120
is not as clean as the capital.

465
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,410
Don't eat outside again.

466
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,070
Otherwise...

467
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,150
I won't eat them.

468
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,050
Even if you force me, I won't eat them anymore.

469
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,340
Well, then, these dishes...

470
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,730
Take them to feed the dog.

471
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,950
What should we do if even the dog

472
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,810
wouldn't eat these dishes?

473
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,330
Either the dog dies,

474
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,220
or

475
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,110
you die.

476
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,430
Who are you?

477
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,560
What's going on?

478
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,770
-Let's go. Don't stay here.
-Okay.

479
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,860
What does it say?

480
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,390
Prince of Yue wants me to meet him tomorrow.

481
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,630
How did he know you're at the border?

482
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,240
Don't tell me someone conveyed the news to him?

483
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,100
How is the investigation in the capital?

484
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,860
I'm here to talk about this.

485
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,920
Xue Dingfei sent a letter that says

486
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,400
that the person who tried to assassinate you

487
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,180
was sent by Xue Yuan indeed.

488
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,910
But there were no further actions afterwards.

489
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,630
I also asked about the situation at Jinling

490
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,930
according to what you told me.

491
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,560
They said nothing happened.

492
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,280
Nothing happened on both sides.

493
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,000
That's even stranger.

494
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,470
Ju'an.

495
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,900
What should we do next?

496
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,640
Do you have any plans?

497
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,110
Keep the appointment as scheduled.

498
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,060
Are you crazy? This is obviously a trap.

499
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,980
How can you go?

500
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,000
We can't delay any longer

501
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,930
or the princess will be in danger.

502
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,820
Yan Lin.

503
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,060
Go to the army and order a troop of soldiers

504
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,180
to ambush near the post house tomorrow

505
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,410
and wait for the chance to move in for the kill.

506
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:00,910
Yes.

507
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,500
Mr. Xie?

508
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,980
I heard you didn't have dinner again.

509
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,950
I no longer go out to eat.

510
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,190
I just have no appetite today.

511
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,820
You don't have to cook again.

512
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,420
Your cooking skills are amazing.

513
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,420
I'm deeply grateful.

514
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,820
There's really no need...

515
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,290
Layered walnut cakes?

516
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,980
You don't even eat when you're troubled.

517
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,810
You're starving yourself,

518
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,200
yet you still want to take care of others.

519
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,030
Why does it taste so familiar?

520
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,960
It's delicious.

521
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,270
It's fragrant and not too sweet.

522
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,550
It tastes like it does in the olden days.

523
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,540
Mr. Xie.

524
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,390
Where did you buy it?

525
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,340
It was prepared in the palace.

526
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,260
The chef made it.

527
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,710
If you like it,

528
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,850
you can take them all.

529
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Thank you then, Mr. Xie.

530
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,160
Back in the palace,

531
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,570
the layered walnut cakes you gave me

532
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,980
were personally made by you?

533
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,760
Why? Is it strange?

534
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,020
But...

535
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,110
But at that time, we were just...

536
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,330
Just what?

537
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,970
What about now?

538
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,980
What are we now?

539
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,310
We're going to bring the princess back tomorrow.

540
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,680
Stay in the city.

541
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,510
Don't wander around.

542
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,450
What about you?

543
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,860
I'm here to help you

544
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,160
bring your princess back.

545
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,230
You...

546
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,940
have nothing to say to me?

547
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,850
About what?

548
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,440
Yan Lin is skilled in martial arts

549
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,560
yet you knew to tell him to be careful.

550
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,650
Something is definitely strange about tomorrow.

551
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,610
Aren't you worried about me...

552
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,410
You're extraordinarily clever.

553
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,800
Since you've decided to go,

554
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,530
you must have a solution.

555
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,210
I don't trust others,

556
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,660
but I trust you.

557
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,000
Xie Ju'an may not win forever,

558
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,270
but he'll never lose.

559
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,420
I believe

560
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,410
you'll bring the princess back safely.

561
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,070
You and your eloquence.

562
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,970
Do I have to

563
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,660
thank you for your kind words

564
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,760
and your respect then?

565
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,040
What are you waiting for? Go back to sleep.

566
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,540
Mr. Xie, this is my room.

567
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,200
This must be Mr. Xie.

568
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,420
The prince ordered

569
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,260
that you can only go there alone.

570
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,930
These two are just my servants.

571
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,090
Don't tell me that the Prince of Yue is even afraid of the servants too?

572
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,710
Mr. Xie, you don’t have to provoke us.

573
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,740
This is

574
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,080
Dao Qin, who's good at archery.

575
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,270
This is

576
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,370
Jian Shu, who's good at close combat.

577
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,620
Both of them are brave and highly-skilled warriors.

578
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,010
We have to guard against them.

579
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,110
Besides,

580
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,610
the prince only invited you.

581
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,620
Of course,

582
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,830
the others aren't qualified to see him.

583
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:38,840
Mr. Xie.

584
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,270
-We...
-It’s fine.

585
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,590
I'll go by myself.

586
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,380
This way, please.

587
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,890
So this is Mr. Xie.

588
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,220
I thought it was someone

589
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,110
extraordinarily capable and powerful.

590
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,100
You seem to be just a weak scholar.

591
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,830
The State of Qian is skilled in literature 
while the State of Yue has a strong military force.

592
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,120
They're fundamentally different.

593
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,850
But if military force alone suffices,

594
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,280
you wouldn't have

595
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,160
invited me here today.

596
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,290
Do you know why I want to see you?

597
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,080
According to the State of Yue's rules,

598
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,720
when the older brother dies, the younger brother ascends the throne.

599
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,780
Last year, the State of Yue's former king passed away.

600
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,900
Among all the princes in the State of Yue,

601
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,250
you're the oldest

602
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,370
and have received a lot of support.

603
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,530
Unfortunately,

604
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,650
over half of the 16 tribes in the State of Yue

605
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,940
support your uncle to ascend the throne.

606
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,460
Now that your uncle has the throne,

607
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,070
although you appear to have yielded,

608
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,040
deep down, have you really accepted it?

609
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,340
I’m afraid you're meeting me

610
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,610
for the position of King of Yue,

611
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,310
and perhaps...

612
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,930
even more.

613
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,060
Mr. Xie, you sure know a lot about what's going on

614
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,880
in our grasslands.

615
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,400
I dare not say that.

616
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,010
It's just that the battles of the world

617
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,680
are always about a few common themes.

618
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,000
You gave your uncle advice

619
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,970
and repeatedly tested the State of Qian's limit

620
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,770
and tried to help the State of Yue head south.

621
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,090
It seems like a plan for the State of Yue and the new king,

622
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,820
but in fact...

623
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,190
Go on.

624
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,510
In fact?

625
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,590
You took the chance to propose marriage in the name of the State of Yue.

626
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,670
In fact, you wanted to use the power and prestige of the State of Qian

627
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,870
to form an alliance

628
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,350
and seize the throne.

629
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,240
But you suddenly changed your mind

630
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,870
and didn't enter the State of Yue's imperial court.

631
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,360
Instead, you chose to stay here.

632
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,100
I'm afraid you changed your plan

633
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,190
because of some sudden changes.

634
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,320
But you have to think it through.

635
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,070
Compared to those empty promises,

636
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,890
what the State of Qian can give you

637
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,180
is more practical.

638
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,410
I’m here

639
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,620
to negotiate with you with His Majesty’s edict.

640
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,600
But

641
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,060
I need to see the princess first.

642
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,490
It’s said that the Qian people are arrogant and hypocritical.

643
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,930
Seeing you today has confirmed that saying.

644
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,580
You're right.

645
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,580
I want to seize the throne.

646
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,590
However,

647
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,780
it's a matter of the State of Yue.

648
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,510
What does it have to do

649
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,770
with an outsider like you?

650
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,410
What do you mean?

651
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,380
Under the guise of a negotiation with me,

652
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,290
you secretly got Yan Lin to surround this place.

653
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,890
You're capricious.

654
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,480
You really are a scoundrel.

655
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,090
Unfortunately,

656
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,880
I already expected it.

657
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,580
As for you,

658
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,000
you'll have to die here.

659
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,900
Get into formation!

660
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,610
Fight!

661
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,110
Kill!

662
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,860
Wait.

663
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,580
There’s one more thing I don’t understand.

664
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,730
Go ahead.

665
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,460
I won't let you die in vain.

666
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,480
Kill me

667
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,240
and you'll become the enemy of the entire State of Qian.

668
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,570
In front of you are tens of thousands of Qian soldiers in the border.

669
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,590
Behind you

670
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,420
is the imperial court's scheme.

671
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,040
Are you really not afraid of being attacked from both sides

672
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,050
and becoming destroyed for good?

673
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,770
Xie Wei!

674
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,630
You know about my State of Yue.

675
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,280
Do you think I'm just a good-for-nothing?

676
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,800
As long as you die,

677
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,580
Duke Xue will definitely do whatever it takes

678
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,900
to get rid of the Yan family's father and son.

679
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,690
Without the commander-in-chief,

680
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,250
the Yan's troops will be fragmented.

681
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,790
By then,

682
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,260
Lord Pingnan will lead his army north

683
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,960
and I'll take the chance to head south.

684
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,000
Then, the whole country

685
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,760
will be ours.

686
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,010
So you're really colluding with Lord Pingnan.

687
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,230
So what if you know?

688
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,280
You're

689
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,510
going to die soon.

690
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,310
You think?

691
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,100
No way.

692
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,750
How did you get in?

693
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,670
I clearly sent my men to keep guard!

694
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,230
If it's something that you can think of,

695
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,870
why do you think Mr. Xie can't?

696
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,220
Do you think you discovered

697
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,420
Viscount Yan's whereabouts and ambush because you're smart?

698
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,699
Mr. Xie deliberately let you find them.

699
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,580
Yan Lin.

700
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,739
Go to the army and order a troop of soldiers

701
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,540
to ambush near the post house tomorrow

702
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,670
and wait for the chance to move in for the kill.

703
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,670
However,

704
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,350
Yan Lin's troops

705
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,050
are just soldiers to distract Prince of Yue and arouse his suspicion.

706
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,630
Yan Lin is leading an army out of the city. 
I'll follow them.

707
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,170
Send a message to the prince immediately.

708
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,090
To succeed tomorrow,

709
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,909
I still need your help, Uncle.

710
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,409
Let's go.

711
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:48,810
Go!

712
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,250
You thought you knew the whole situation

713
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,430
and was so sure of your victory that you got carried away.

714
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,800
You let your guard down and are doomed to lose.

715
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,170
If you don't want more casualties,

716
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,590
give up your weapons and surrender.

717
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,380
What? Surrender?

718
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,940
Just with you lot?

719
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,830
Do you think the Yue warriors are useless?

720
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,180
Kill them!

721
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,330
You are...

722
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,890
I'm Dao Qin.

723
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,380
Princess, by Mr. Xie's order,

724
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,780
I'm here to escort you back to the city.

725
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,330
Prince of Yue said he wants someone's life.

726
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,860
I'm afraid it's Mr. Xie he wants.

727
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,780
Go and save him now.

728
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,560
My mission

729
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,550
is to take you back.

730
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,400
As for the rest, Mr. Xie has his own arrangements.

731
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,270
But...

732
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,010
Princess, please pardon me.

733
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,990
Stop!

734
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,390
Don't get carried away too soon.

735
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,320
After the ambush outside the post house

736
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,810
deals with Yan Lin,

737
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,520
you'll die.

738
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,290
It's not too late for you to surrender.

739
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,420
I’m afraid I’ll have to let you down.

740
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,340
The State of Yue's cavalry and warriors are indeed invincible

741
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,990
in the grasslands.

742
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,810
But you

743
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,220
chose to stay here

744
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,270
because of your amibitious scheming.

745
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,550
Then you should know

746
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,000
that this is not a grassland after all.

747
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,970
Fighting in the mountain forest

748
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,510
is not just about fighting head-on.

749
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,060
Retreat!

750
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,290
Capture them!

751
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:22,960
Get up!

752
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,510
Despicable! Shameless!

753
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,620
Arrest him!

754
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,260
Let go of me!

755
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,090
I am a prince of the State of Yue.

756
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,870
How dare you offend me?

757
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,270
You killed so many Qian people

758
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,900
at the border of the State of Qian.

759
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,050
Let alone offense,

760
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,890
even killing you is letting you off easy.

761
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,960
Kill me?

762
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,690
You'll start a war if you do.

763
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,890
Do you dare?

764
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,980
Kill you?

765
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,230
Why would we kill you?

766
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,620
If we kill you,

767
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,290
who will pay for the humiliation

768
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,340
the princess suffered?

769
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,600
What... What do you want?

770
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,000
I will send you to the State of Yue's imperial court

771
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,610
and tell your uncle

772
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,540
everything you did

773
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,160
to let him know

774
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,590
that instead of going south,

775
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,340
he should discipline the people

776
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,620
within the State of Yue first.

777
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,130
We'll send you there

778
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,090
as a first meeting gift.

779
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,880
The State of Qian helped him get rid of a huge time bomb.

780
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,790
We can ask for a new alliance

781
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,680
in exchange.

782
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,790
As for how the State of Yue will deal with traitors,

783
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,470
I don't think you need me to tell you.

784
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,250
Xie Wei! Xie Wei!

785
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,980
Why don't you kill me now?

786
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,820
Kill me.

787
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,590
Xie Wei.

788
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,880
Kill me.

789
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,700
Kill me!

790
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,410
Take him away.

791
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,690
Xie Wei. Xie Wei!

792
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,160
Xie Wei! Why don't you kill me now?

793
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,280
Kill me, Xie Wei! Kill me!

794
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,970
For the King of Yue to consolidate his throne,

795
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,620
he must eliminate the corruption from within first.

796
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,890
In the near future,

797
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,030
he won't be able to think about heading south.

798
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,350
When the King of Yue is done with it,

799
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,980
the strength of the State of Yue will have suffered.

800
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,510
Now, the King of Yue's only choice

801
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,510
is to re-establish the alliance with the State of Qian.

802
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,440
The border can finally settle down for some time.

803
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,560
Ju'an.

804
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,660
Well done.

805
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,990
[Yan]

806
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,670
Princess!

807
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,750
-Ning!
-Princess.

808
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,060
Princess!

809
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,110
I thought I'd never see you again.

810
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,180
You're so ridiculous.

811
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,890
How dare you come to the border?

812
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,140
Aren't you afraid of danger?

813
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
You're not afraid.

814
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,680
Why should I be afraid?

815
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,850
Luckily, you're fine.

816
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,740
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to live in peace.

817
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:51,940
Princess.

818
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,120
The soil of your homeland,

819
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,690
your country,

820
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,020
and your capital.

821
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,300
Welcome, Your Highness.

822
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,840
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

823
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,210
Welcome, Your Highness.

824
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,510
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

825
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,900
Welcome, Your Highness.

826
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,320
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

827
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,110
Ning, you silly girl.

828
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,010
Duke! Duke!

829
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:15,550
Bad news!

830
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,800
The spy sent a message.

831
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,800
Not only did the Yan family's father and son not get exiled,

832
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,190
but they even went to the border and took over Yan's troops.

833
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,370
Here, take a look at this letter.

834
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,940
Lord Pingnan's emblem?

835
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,980
When did you get in touch with Lord Pingnan?

836
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,330
Read carefully.

837
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,100
Xie Wei is the real Viscount Dingfei?

838
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,570
I suddenly received this secret letter today.

839
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,670
In the letter,

840
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,160
not only did it report about Xie Wei forging the imperial edict,

841
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,170
but also revealed his true identity.

842
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,140
No wonder Xie Wei always protected the Yan family

843
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,880
and always went against me.

844
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,170
No wonder the Xue Dingfei in his mansion was always acting weird.

845
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,160
It turns out he's a fake.

846
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,670
It seems that

847
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,380
they all work for Lord Pingnan.

848
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,990
I’m afraid that was the case before.

849
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,700
But this time, Lord Pingnan purposely sent a letter

850
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,510
to expose their real identities.

851
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,340
It should be that they have

852
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,680
an internal strife.

853
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,600
Xie Wei has made many contributions with regards to the rebels.

854
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,320
I think he ruined Lord Pingnan's scheme

855
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,140
and enraged him.

856
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,130
He didn't hesitate to sacrifice his right-hand men.

857
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,390
He wants to use me

858
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,430
to subdue Xie Wei.

859
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,380
Duke, no matter what Lord Pingnan wants,

860
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,040
Yan's troops have regained military power.

861
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,080
If Xie Wei allied with Yan's troops,

862
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,570
when they return to the capital,

863
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,040
we'll be the ones to suffer.

864
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,650
Lord Pingnan knew that

865
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,490
I have to take this bait.

866
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:03,910
How despicable.

867
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,380
But now that things have come to this,

868
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,630
the damage to our father-and-son relationship

869
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,510
is irreversible.

870
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,720
Now, I'm afraid Xie Wei

871
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,050
hates me the most.

872
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,530
So no matter what,

873
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,960
we can't let him return to the capital again.
