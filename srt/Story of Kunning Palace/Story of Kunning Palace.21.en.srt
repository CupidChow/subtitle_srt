it may not necessarily take a turn for the worse.

But if we report it now,

158
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,220
it will ruin His Majesty's plan

159
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,659
and inevitably invoke his fury.

160
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,390
Secondly, Ning'er is a girl after all.

161
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,010
This will definitely ruin her reputation.

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,830
go to the prison of all places?

165
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,230
She even met the rebels!

166
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,060
What will I ever do?

167
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,210
Mr. Jiang,

168

what happened tonight

169
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,520
was caused by me.

170
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,200
I will take full responsibility

171
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,150
for Ning'er's safety.

172
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,410
But

173
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,250
there are many people in your mansion.

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,480
Have you figured out

175
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,000
how to hide the news from them?

176
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,750
Then I'll say that

177
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,680
she went to the temple

178
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,360
outside of the city to pray on behalf of her mother.

179
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,190
She needs to stay in the temple for a few days.

180
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,230
This way, I believe

181
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,770
we can fool them for some time.

182
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,450
That's good.

183
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,080
After dawn,

184
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,370
I'll report to the palace and ask for permission

185
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,919
to go to Tongzhou and rescue her.

186
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,000
We can definitely save her before New Year.

187
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,039
Okay.

188
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,159

189
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,030
This girl has suffered a lot since she was young.

190
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
I really feel guilty towards her.

191
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,420
This time...

192
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,140
No matter what,

193
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,670
make sure she comes back safely.

194
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,630
Come take a seat.

195
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,470
Wait.

196
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,810
Did he use brush and ink?

197
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,700
Xiao Bao, give me some water.

198
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,460
I'm not thirsty.

199
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,460
I drank it before, and my lips touched it.

200
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,880
So you dare not drink it?

201
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,740
There's a difference between the ruler and the subject.

202
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,740
Your Majesty, please stop joking.

203
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,040
Are you afraid of offending me?

204
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,500
Last night, when the rebels tried to kill me,

205
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,510
who protected me in his arms

206
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,570
and wouldn't let go even when his leg was broken?

207
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,990
I didn't expect Mr. Dujun

208
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,610
to be such a meticulous person.

209
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,410
You're rather kind to your younger sister.

210
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,560
He's a man of elegance, after all.

211
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,290
Even when he's escaping,

212
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,930
he gets to cradle a beauty in his arms.

213
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,430
We are not like that...

214
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,160
Is there a separate resting place in this temple?

215
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,420
My sister is a lady after all.

216
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,040
It's inconvenient for her to stay here.

217
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,570
Yes.

218
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,720
You and your sister can rest here.

219
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,720
Don't worry about us.

220
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,530
Thank you.

221
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,830
Mr. Zhang...

222
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,900
I didn't mean to offend you.

223
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,570
But while we're with the rebels,

224
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,370
it's safer to make them misunderstand

225
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,070
our relationship.

226
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,850
The situation doesn't seem right.

227
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,160
It seems that they haven't cleared up their doubts.

228
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,540
By logic,

229
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,790
they should leave the capital as soon as possible.

230
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,620
But they insisted on waiting for General Feng.

231
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,360
I think he must also be

232
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,950
a high-ranking member of the rebels.

233
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,710
Looks like there will be a tough battle tomorrow.

234
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,880
Don't worry.

235
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,790
I will protect you.

236
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,270
When we get to the next city,

237
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,920
I'll find a way to help you escape.

238
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,590
But before that,

239
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,610
I'm afraid you'll have to make do.

240
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,850
At any time,

241
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,810
I will trust you, Mr. Zhang.

there's something between us.

Desperate times call for desperate measures.

284

Let's rest here together.

285
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,310
Besides,

286
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,840
I'm a little scared by myself.

287
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,180
[Imperial Study]

288
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,310
Your Majesty, Mr. Xie has urgent matters to see you.

289
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,220
Your Majesty. State Duke.

290
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,040
Junior Preceptor Xie.

291
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,510
His Majesty and I are discussing

292
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,090
the prison break that happened last night.

293
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,360
Please leave.

294
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,290
I’m also here for this matter.

295
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,680
How did you know about this?

296
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
The prison incident last night

297
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,010
was a plan Official Xie and I came up with.

298
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,430
We lured the rebels to break into the prison

299
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,900
to let Zhang Zhe sneak into the group

300
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,440
and investigate the location of the rebels' strongholds.

301
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,090
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

302
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,960
Do you not trust me?

303
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,820
This is my idea.

304
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,610
This is a dangerous plan.

305
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,140
The less people know, the better.

306
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,640
Besides, last night,

307
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,359
the Duke reinforced the Xingwu Guards.

308
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,670
I'm afraid the rebels have noticed something's wrong.

309
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,550
I came here today

310
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,780
to ask Your Majesty to give me the Yan Family's official seal.

311
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,119
This way, I can go to Tongzhou to assist them.

312
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,170
This won't do.

313
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,900
You have never led an army.

314
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,960
How can you accomplish the task?

315
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,280
Last night, Xingwu Guards have killed many rebels.

316
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,390
So this matter

317
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,790
should be done by me instead.

318
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,850
I disagree.

319
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,750
I came up with this plan.

320
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,890
The one who knows the details best

321
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,730
-is...
-Enough.

322
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,850
So many people died in prison last night.

323
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,120
Uncle, please go back

324
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,690
and help the Ministry of Justice sort out the prisoners' files.

325
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,670
As for this matter, I'll discuss it with Official Xie

326
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,820
before making a decision.

327
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,760
I'll take my leave.

328
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,990
Didn't you say

329
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,480
to let the Duke of Xue send people to assist in Tongzhou?

330
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,540
Why did you change your mind?

331
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,620
After I went back, I thought about it for a long time.

332
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,370
The rebels suffered a great loss this time.

333
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,420
They'll certainly be more careful in the future.

334
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,510
Duke Xue is not familiar with the plan.

335
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,110
If we go there rashly,

336
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,860
we might alert them instead.

337
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,720
Besides, you just got the commander's tally back.

338
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,150
If I go,

339
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,390
I can subdue Yan's troops for you too, Your Majesty.

340
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,870
Won't it be a win-win situation?

341
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,660
But to be safe,

342
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,460
you should go to the barracks first.

343
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,550
In a few days,

344
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,040
I'll ask Duke Xue to lead the Xingwu Guards and support you in secret.

345
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,210
We must not let a single rebel escape.

346
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,100
Yes.

Gongyi Cheng might betray us,

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,990
why didn't you inform Jinling in time?

371
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,920
After Gongyi Cheng was arrested,

372
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,030
I don't know how many spies in the capital's vicinity

373
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,430
had been exposed.

374
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,350
If I act rashly,

375
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,960
I'm afraid I'll ruin Lord Pingnan's years of hard work.

376
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,140
This is

377
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,600
a good excuse.

378
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,160
It's just that Mr. Dujun is elusive

379
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,340
and we have never met him in person.

380
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,550
Mr. Gongyi is missing.

381
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,800
There is no evidence for your identity.

382
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,740
But you are in a high position,

383
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,820
you should know us.

384
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,890
Why don't you tell me

385
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,880
why I am here?

386
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,950
I came to the capital many years ago.

387
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,990
I haven't been up to date about matters in Jinling for a long time.

388
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,040
But since you hold Lord Pingnan's military powers,

389
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,110
you must be here for Tongzhou.

390
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,350
These are just your guesses,

391
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,680
not evidence.

392
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,130
It's not enough to prove your identity.

393
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,380
Although Mr. Zhang is observant,

394
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,260
it's not easy to fool Feng.

395
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,180
Our role is too passive.

396
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,750
We have to find a way.

397
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,730
Brother.

398
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,520
At this point,

399
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,020
we don't have to protect his pride.

400
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,780
Gongyi Cheng has been in the capital for a long time.

401
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,270
It was already strange that he lost a lot of people

402
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,220
but barely got anything done.

403
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,090
Now that Gongyi Cheng has betrayed us,

404
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,040
this General Feng continues to question you

405
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,280
instead of doubting him.

406
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,600
Who knows if they have colluded with each other?

407
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,790
I think

408
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,680
they are trying to

409
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,110
to delay our retreat

410
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,450
to lure the court to arrest us.

411
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,530
Nonsense!

412
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,800
Who are you?

413
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,850
Am I wrong?

414
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,350
Why should my brother tell you guys

415
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,410
about his plan with Lord Pingnan?

416
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,300
We would have left the capital long ago

417
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,660
if not for the mess you guys made last night.

418
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,630
And now,

419
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,990
a mysterious General Feng appeared.

420
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,560
Instead of holding Gongyi Cheng accountable,

421
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,470
you're only interested in Lord Pingnan's matter.

422
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,870
You must have ulterior motives!

423
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:42,890
All right.

424
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,730
In the midst of chaos,

425
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,930
don't sway others' minds.

426
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,620
As for my identity,

427
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,150
we'll know when we get back to Jinling.

428
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,010
General Feng.

429
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,650
After the big mess in the capital last night,

430
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,400
I'm afraid something will happen if we delay any longer.

431
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,410
That's right. Let's go first.

432
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,150
No.

433
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,680
Tongzhou's matter is of grave importance.

434
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,190
I can't let an unidentified person

435
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,680
travel with us.

436
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,180
I'd rather kill the wrong person

437
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,060
than accidentally let the right person go.

438
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,850
Mr. Zhang,

439
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,640
let me ask you one last time.

440
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,640
If you still can't

441
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,940
prove your identity,

442
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,730
don't blame me for being rude to you.

443
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,120
When we return to Jinling,

444
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,110
I'll take full responsibility

445
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,620
and accept Lord Pingnan's punishments.

446
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,990
Who's there?

447
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,340
Good morning, everyone.

448
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,510
If you don't mind,

449
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,010
I'm willing to serve you.

450
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,010
I promise the Xue family will be... very lively.

451
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,260
It’s him.

452
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,100
So he works for Lord Pingnan too.

453
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,160
Last time,

454
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,620
he returned to the capital as a playboy

455
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,030
and kept making trouble in the Xue family.

456
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,990
Was that also Lord Pingnan's arrangement?

457
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,900
Xue Dingfei.

458
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,950
Since you're here, why were you hiding?

459
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,040
Were you too ashamed to see us?

460
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,800
If I didn't hide,

461
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,240
how would I watch this show?

462
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,350
Besides,

463
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,870
if I didn't hide,

464
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,050
how would I know that the legendary Dujun

465
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,380
looks like this?

466
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,080
That's right.

467
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,180
Mr. Dingfei spent the longest time with Lord Pingnan.

468
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,920
He must have seen Dujun, the Hermit, before.

469
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,350
I told you he’s a fake.

470
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,210
Arrest him!

471
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,400
You looked so sanctimonious all the time,

472
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,610
I didn't expect you to keep

473
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,780
such a beautiful young lady by your side.

474
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,460
We are like brothers.

475
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,410
Why didn't you introduce her to me?

476
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,450
Tell me the truth, is he the real deal or not?

477
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,500
Are you crazy?

478
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,780
I didn't say he's a fake.

479
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,440
It’s none of my fault that you're so suspicious of everything.

480
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,190
Mr. Xue, please behave yourself.

481
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,700
Sir.

482
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,460
When we went to the brothel together,

483
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,600
you always called me Dingfei.

484
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,930
How could you be so cold to me

485
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,230
in front of the lady?

486
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,560
Xue Dingfei.

487
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,240
General.

488
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,750
Since we've identified him,

489
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,570
let's hurry

490
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,650
and get going.

491
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,510
Let's go.

492
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,340
Little sister, what's your name?

493
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,370
You know Xue Dingfei?

494
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,880
No.

495
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,980
Then why did he help us?

496
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,860
I'm afraid there's more to this man

497
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,150
than meets the eye.

498
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,680
Duke...

499
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,440
This concerns the rebels.

500
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,370
Maybe His Majesty was just being careful.

501
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,030
He didn't mean to hide it from you.

502
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,410
Yan Mu might be gone,

503
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,970
but Xie Wei takes his place.

504
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,170
Shen Lang has grown up

505
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,170
and harbors deeper thoughts now.

506
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,520
But he forgot

507
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,990
who saved his life back then

508
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,800
and helped him ascend the throne.

509
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,450
Duke, please watch your words.

510
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,960
Duke.

511
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,610
Someone from the palace has sent a decree.

512
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,740
His Majesty wants you to send troops

513
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,710
to Tongzhou immediately

514
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,960
to help Junior Preceptor Xie pacify the rebellion.

515
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,350
Xie Wei is just a civil official.

516
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,460
He can't do much after all.

517
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,240
Go get Ye.

518
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,810
The Xingwu Guards

519
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,190
must make a great contribution this time.

520
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,610
Yes.

521
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,560
Duke, please wait.

522
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,760
I think we should be careful about this.

523
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,460
Junior Preceptor Xie's standing is unclear.

524
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,620
If you go to Tongzhou, you'll have to listen to him.

525
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,380
The resources we used to raise our private soldiers

526
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,890
over the years can mostly be traced to that.

527
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,670
If Junior Preceptor Xie finds out,

528
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,910
we’ll be in trouble.

529
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,820
You're right.

530
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,260
He

531
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,720
has been against me

532
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,090
since the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

533
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,550
We have to be careful.

534
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,300
Sir.

535
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,580
The coal dust is cold.

536
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,190
They must have been gone for a while.

537
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,420
Sir,

538
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,650
Xiao Bao is really smart.

539
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,080
He hid a letter under the Buddha statue.

540
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,130
I almost didn't find it.

541
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Looks like Ning'er

542
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,780
is really with them.

543
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,450
What does it say?

544
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,890
[Baiyun Temple]

545
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,860
Xiao Bao said,

546
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,020
Feng Mingyu has started to suspect Zhang Zhe.

547
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,750
But Xue Dingfei has testified for him.

548
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,230
They're on their way to Tongzhou.

549
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,100
But knowing Zhang Zhe,

550
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,940
he must have started to suspect

551
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,110
how I arranged Xue Dingfei

552
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,530
into the plan.

553
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,530
Sir, we can't let him live.

554
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,560
When we go to Tongzhou,

555
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,410
we must get rid of him.

556
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,660
What should we do next?

557
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,030
Let's go to Tongzhou first.

558
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,010
They have a carriage with them.

559
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:49,900
They couldn't have traveled too fast.

560
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,290
We can arrive before them

561
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,550
if we hurry.

562
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,610
Search Tongzhou as soon as we arrive

563
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,550
and find out where Feng Mingyu planted the gunpowder.

564
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,960
This way, we'll have the upper hand.

565
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,860
Yes.

566
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,240
Little sister.

567
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,290
Isn't this carriage nice?

568
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,650
We're in the wilderness.

569
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,800
If you rode a horse, you'd hurt your back for sure.

570
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,080
Who is your sister?

571
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,590
Mr. Zhang and I are sworn brothers.

572
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,470
Shouldn't you call me brother too?

573
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,440
Mr. Zhang,

574
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,840
I think something is wrong.

575
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,160
Although we're in the mountains,

576
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,100
we went past this place

577
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,770
an hour ago.

578
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,640
They seem to be taking us in circles.

579
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,500
What are they waiting for

580
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,180
if they're not in a rush to go to Tongzhou?

581
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,630
Earlier on, General Feng said

582
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,210
Tongzhou is an important matter.

583
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,220
Are they going to take action in Tongzhou?

584
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,260
If this action is unfavorable to the court,

585
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,570
I must find out the truth.

586
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,930
General Feng.

587
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,530
Are we taking this path

588
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,300
because you still have your doubts?

589
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,110
We don't know who those two are.

590
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,870
It's better to be careful.

591
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,780
But we're moving so slowly.

592
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,440
If we delay blowing up the barracks...

593
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,200
Don't worry.

594
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,250
I have a plan.

595
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Just listen to my arrangement

596
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,650
and act accordingly.

597
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,880
The court recently exiled Yan Mu.

598
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,530
He'll only send the Xingwu Guards after us.

599
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,040
The Xue family's fortune

600
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,880
has been drained by years of indulging in wine and women.

601
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,350
Against them,

602
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,520
there is no guarantee who will win.

603
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,320
My back hurts from riding this horse.

604
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,090
I'm exhausted.

605
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,250
The view looks nice.

606
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,610
Why don't we stop for a meal?

607
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,870
Mr. Dingfei.

608
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,680
We are running for our lives,

609
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,790
not on a field trip.

610
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,300
Cut the crap.

611
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
If my back is injured,

612
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,720
will you endure the pain for me?

613
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,730
Anyway, I'm not moving anymore.

614
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,190
You can go on your own if you want.

615
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,240
This place is nice.

616
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,290
Lady San, let me help you.

617
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,850
Boil some water for me.

618
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,490
Mr. Dingfei.

619
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,380
Come and help me if you're free.

620
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,720
I can't carry it alone.

621
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,110
Tell me the truth.

622
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,400
You asked me to help Zhang Zhe get away with it.

623
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,720
What is Xie Wei up to?

624
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,440
And that girl.

625
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,570
What's with her?

626
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,000
According to Mr. Xie's plan,

627
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,460
that lady shouldn't be here.

628
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,610
It must be due to the mess yesterday.

629
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,210
I've left a message to ask for Mr. Xie's instructions.

630
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,460
As for the rest, play it by ear.

631
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,490
I only promised Xie Wei

632
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,850
to persuade them to break into the prison.

633
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,730
By now, I should have long escaped.

634
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,790
Now that I'm stuck with all of you,

635
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,900
what should I tell Lord Pingnan when I return to Jinling?

636
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,500
Save these words for Mr. Xie.

637
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,080
A double-faced man like you

638
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,050
won't end well.

639
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,510
If Mr. Xie could take Feng Mingyu's life in Tongzhou,

640
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,070
he can also take yours.

641
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:35,930
Wait...

642
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,410
Let's talk over here.

643
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,310
Nitre?

644
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,000
Mr. Zhang, you're slacking off here?

645
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,240
Why didn't you invite me?

646
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,670
Don't you want to know

647
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,780
who I am

648
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,540
and why I helped you?

649
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,960
I have heard of your name before,

650
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,150
Mr. Dingfei.

651
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,199
I do have doubts about you too.

652
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,020
But even if I ask you,

653
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,630
will you answer me honestly?

654
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,860
Whatever the reason is,

655
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,699
you've already made a false testimony.

656
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:24,980
As the saying goes,

657
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,920
there is no turning back.

658
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:28,969
You can only continue to help me

659
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,469
conceal my identity on this journey.

660
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,260
Are you threatening me?

661
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,900
I'm not threatening you. I'm cooperating.

662
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,480
Why don't you tell me what you want?

663
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,469
Maybe I can help you.

664
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,429
Otherwise,

665
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,980
if I accidentally expose

666
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,110
your betrayal,

667
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,360
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

668
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,750
Are you serious?

669
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,010
You're weak and I'm strong here.

670
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,440
I do cherish my life.

671
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,500
But you won't abandon your mission

672
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,090
just to

673
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,200
go against me, right?

674
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,010
Are you Xie Wei's man?

675
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Xie Wei? Who?

676
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,310
I've never heard of him. How ridiculous.

677
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,240
It's useless to deny it.

678
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,120
Since you know my mission,

679
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,520
you must know someone

680
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,770
in the imperial court.

681
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,390
The same person likely asked you to help.

682
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,320
I can’t think of anyone else

683
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,790
except for Junior Preceptor Xie.

684
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,480
Whatever you say.

685
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,070
Anyway, for the rest of the journey,

686
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,450
you'd better be careful.

687
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,970
Feng Mingyu is not as good-tempered as me.

688
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,880
He can kill you anytime.

689
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,730
Thank you for reminding me.

690
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,990
Why are you all

691
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,090
more cunning than a fox?

692
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,730
Sorry, I'm too clumsy.

693
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,390
I'll have to trouble you with the fire again.

694
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,790
It's okay as long as you're fine.

695
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,940
What's the point of thinking about that?

696
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,250
Let's go.

697
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,760
I'll take you to the stream to wash your wound.

698
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,110
Where are you going?

699
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,680
Don't ruin it for them.

700
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,940
He said she was his sister.

701
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:48,930
But they're obviously

702
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,010
a couple.

703
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,370
There is no medicine here.

704
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,830
We can only use this herb to relieve the pain and swelling temporarily.

705
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,980
We'll find a physician in the city.

706
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,010
Is something bothering you, Mr. Zhang?

707
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,190
There are many ways to avoid them.

708
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,160
Who taught you to hurt yourself?

709
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,970
This is the fastest way.

710
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,020
And you need to put up a real act

711
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,210
to make people believe in it.

712
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,040
They were leading the carriage just now.

713
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,560
It was inconvenient to talk in the carriage.

714
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,880
Huang Qian constantly kept an eye on us too.

715
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,680
Now it's convenient for us to talk.

716
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,560
My hand is fine.

717
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,610
You can ask whatever you want.

718
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,100
At dawn outside the temple,

719
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,400
how did you know about Gongyi Cheng's matters?

720
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,500
Did Junior Preceptor Xie tell you about it?

721
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,100
I tested Xue Dingfei just now

722
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,250
and found that he should know Junior Preceptor Xie too.

723
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,540
But strangely,

724
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,820
Junior Preceptor Xie never mentioned this to me before.

725
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,540
Don’t you think

726
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,870
Junior Preceptor Xie has a deep relationship with the rebels?

727
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,700
Perhaps Junior Preceptor Xie

728
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,630
has a lot of matters he finds hard to explain,

729
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,440
but he must be a good person.

730
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,300
Miss Jiang,

731
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,120
you can't judge a person's goodness

732
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,790
solely based on his heart.

733
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,690
Most wrongdoings in this world

734
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,840
have a reason.

735
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,480
Some did it as revenge, some did it to repay kindness.

736
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,170
But no matter what the purpose is,

737
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,500
wrong is wrong.

738
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,050
When I begged you to let Zhou Yinzhi go,

739
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,830
I didn’t expect it'd implicate you like this.

740
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,130
You are upright and well-known for your virtue.

741
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,600
Even the judge dared not easily convict you.

742
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,370
But why did you sentence yourself to this?

743
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,870
I'm the one who should be convicted.

744
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,080
Am I wrong?

745
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,650
I asked you to speak!

746
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,000
So in your heart,

747
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,780
once you make a mistake,

748
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,910
it's useless to make up for it.

749
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,240
Right?

750
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,050
It's still too early to say

751
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,700
if Junior Preceptor Xie has done something wrong.

752
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,190
The matter at hand is more important.

753
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,390
I've thought about it along the way.

754
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,820
Before entering Tongzhou,

755
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,640
the entire route is within the mountains.

756
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,330
Even if we manage to escape,

757
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,950
we will be caught soon.

758
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,250
You're right.

759
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,290
Then let's enter Tongzhou first

760
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
and then try to escape.

761
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,560
We need to figure out Feng Mingyu's plan first.

762
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,080
I already feel bad for

763
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,170
involving you in this mess.

764
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,670
I can't put you in danger anymore.

765
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,220
After entering the city,

766
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,520
please pretend to be sick

767
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,960
and make your way to Yongding Pharmacy.

768
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,610
There will be people from the court there.

769
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,930
What about you?

770
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,500
I'll follow Feng Mingyu

771
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,080
to find out all the rebels' hideouts

772
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,600
and send the information to the court.

773
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,080
That won't do.

774
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,560
You don't even have anyone to look out for you.

775
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,340
It's too dangerous.

776
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,570
I promised my mentor

777
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,320
to take this opportunity to pacify the rebellion.

778
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,700
Mr. Zhang...

779
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,140
Mr. Zhang. Miss Zhang.

780
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:11,910
Time to eat.

781
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:14,710
Let's go.

782
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,360
Sir,

783
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,390
why do I feel that

784
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,560
they don't trust us?

785
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,360
We're here on His Majesty's order.

786
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,830
In their eyes,

787
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,590
the court is the one who kicked the Yan family out.

788
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,460
Naturally, they think we have ill intentions.

789
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,140
What are you doing?

790
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,130
Sorry, I slipped.

791
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,230
What's a pale-faced scholar doing,

792
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,780
trying to manage the military camp?

793
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,500
What a joke.

794
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,810
Come here.

795
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,330
Jian Shu.

796
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,710
General.

797
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,520
General Yan Liu.

798
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,260
I've received the letter from His Lordship.

799
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,780
Mr. Xie helped the Yan Troop

800
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,140
during the rebellion.

801
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,090
We're indebted to you.

802
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,170
But I hope you can understand that

803
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,750
Yan's troops will always belong to the Yan family.

804
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,760
I understand.

805
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,890
I’ve never thought of changing it.

806
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,340
You are not here for His Majesty?

807
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,410
I am.

808
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,490
But not completely.

809
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,090
Marquis Yan may be exiled now,

810
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,530
but he will come back sooner or later.

811
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,160
Before his return,

812
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,360
what I need to do

813
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,290
is to prevent Yan's troops from falling into Duke Xue's hands.

814
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,380
Will His Lordship really come back?

815
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,370
Of course.

816
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,350
But the opportunity isn't here yet.

817
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,300
What opportunity?

818
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,760
A war.

819
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,390
When there is no commander in the court,

820
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:01,840
he can recover.

821
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,740
As for now,

822
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,010
please help me, General Yan.

823
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,370
According to reliable sources,

824
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,370
Lord Pingnan will rebel in Tongzhou.

825
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,630
Please arrange for men

826
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,280
to search around the barracks

827
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,950
to see if there's gunpowder hidden anywhere.

828
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,170
Gunpowder?

829
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,460
They want to blow up the barracks?

830
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,760
We're not sure yet.

831
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,610
But

832
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,000
it's better to be careful.

833
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:26,870
Okay.

834
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,490
I'll order them right away.

835
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,460
Please take a rest here.

836
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,930
I'll ask someone to arrange a tent for you.

837
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,610
No need.

838
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
I have something important to do.

839
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,110
I need to go to the city.

840
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,240
Okay.

841
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,780
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhang.

842
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,330
I didn't mean it.

843
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:58,870
It's fine.

844
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,220
Feng Mingyu,

845
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,220
if you're too old to ride a horse,

846
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,570
let us go there first.

847
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,410
Tongzhou is right ahead.

848
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,960
If we continue at this slow pace,

849
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,140
when will we ever arrive?

850
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,870
We broke into the prison and killed someone.

851
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,880
We don't know whether Tongzhou is safe or not.

852
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,560
Why are you in such a hurry to enter the city?

853
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,870
Is there something urgent?

854
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,160
If it's not urgent, why would I rush you?

855
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,290
-You…
-Guys.

856
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,690
Don't hurt our friendship.

857
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,470
Mr. Dingfei, if you do have urgent matters,

858
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,480
why don't you tell us?

859
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,850
Maybe we can get the people scouting around the city

860
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
to do it for you.

861
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,580
I'm in a hurry to go to the city's brothels.

862
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,140
You want to check them out for me?

863
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,770
Such words are too vulgar for the ears.

864
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,670
Brother, don't listen.

865
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,880
What happened? Why did we stop?

866
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,330
Tongzhou is ahead.

867
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,100
It's too visible and not safe

868
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:00,710
for us to enter town together.

869
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,470
How about we split up?

870
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,750
Sir, you'll go with me.

871
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,760
Miss Zhang,

872
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,740
you'll follow Huang Qian.
