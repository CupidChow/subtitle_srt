Why are you still in the palace?

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,700
The palace gate won't be closed for a while.

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,820
This is your first time entering the imperial palace.

41
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm really worried.

42
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,250
I heard that Matron Su is very strict.

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,930
She even flogs people.

44
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,750

I'm grateful.

But the more you did for me,

55

By the way,

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,640
Mr. Xie told me something

66
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,400
about you today.

67
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,829
What did he say?

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,670
He asked me

69
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,310
if I taught you the method

70
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,690
of using a fake ledger

71
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,690
to discipline the disobedient servants in the mansion.

72
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,800
I thought

73
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,780
he wouldn't have asked me about that for no reason.

74
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,770
And since it's not bad,

75
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,560
I admitted it.

76
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,340
I only passed the buck to you

77
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,490
because I knew you would cover for me.

78
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,690
But I didn't expect

79
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,770
Mr. Xie would come to my house that day.

80
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,220
Then tell me,

81
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,460
who taught you that?

82
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,140
I figured it out myself.

people grow up.

87
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,070
I will change too.

88
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,540
I don't care.

89
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,910
No matter what you become,

90
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,780
I will be good to you.

91
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,900
Promise me.

92
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,440
No matter what secret you have,

93
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,030
as long as you want to talk about it,

94
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,510
I'll be the first person in the world to know.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,420
OK?

96
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:18,690
OK.

97
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,020
Sister Yao.

98
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,090
I just mentioned the Ministry of Justice casually.

99
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,380
Why did you start crying?

100
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,860
All right.

101
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,930
We are in the imperial palace.

102
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,240
If people hear it and spread the word,

103
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,370
it will be bad.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,610
Sister Yao.

105
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,020
We are sisters.

106
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,330
If you have any difficulties, just tell us.

107
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,770
We can figure out a solution together.

108
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,210
It's just I heard Baoying talk about the Ministry of Justice,

109
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,050
and I couldn't help thinking about Zhang Zhe.

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,980
That's why I cried.

111
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,480
He's only a seventh-ranked Supervising Secretary for the Division of Criminal Justice.

112
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,250
He doesn't deserve me.

113
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,510
Is Zhang Zhe the one

114
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,510
who offended the Xingwu Guards?

115
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,840
You two were talking about getting married?

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
He wasn't selected by a proper imperial examination.

117
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,420
He passed the exam as a civil servant

118
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,040
and became an official in the imperial court.

119
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,580
He only has a vulgar widow mother.

120
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,890
It's my father who thought highly of him.

121
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,840
He said that although his rank is not high,

122
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,380
he is capable

123
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,320
and has a bright future.

124
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,010
That's why I agreed when Father went to discuss our marriage with the Zhang family.

125
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,310
But now?

126
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,310
He offended the Xingwu Guards.

127
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,700
Even His Majesty got angry.

128
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,040
I wanted to break off the engagement,

129
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,800
but Father didn't agree.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,820
Sister Xue.

131
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,920
What should I do?

132
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,830
But the marriage has already been discussed,

133
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,540
and your age cards have been exchanged.

134
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,470
That's why I'm sad.

135
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,090
If I want to break off the engagement,

136
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,440
people will say that the Yao family is snobbish.

137
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,100
It's so awkward now.

138
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,070
It's not good either to get married

139
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,159
or not.

140
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,180
Besides,

141
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,110
Zhang Zhe had had two engagements before.

142
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,730
One was engaged to someone else and broke off the engagement.

143
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,840
The other one died

144
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,560
before they could get married.

145
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,660
Now, he finally got the chance

146
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,110
to seek connections with the Yao family.

147
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,540
Of course he won't take the initiative to break off the engagement.

148
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,860
My father is a first-ranked official in the imperial court.

149
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,640
As the legitimate daughter of a noble family,

150
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,260
how can I marry such a person?

151
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,770
If you ask me,

152
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,140
Sister Yao,

153
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
you are a little bit too stubborn.

154
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,610
There are so many roads in the world.

155
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,640
There are so many ways.

156
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,510
Why must Zhang take the initiative to break off the engagement?

157
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,570
It's alright if your family take the initiative.

158
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,040
As long as you have the right reason,

159
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,160
no one can say anything about it.

160
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,500
Do you have any suggestions?

161
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,110
If what you said is true,

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
that Zhang Zhe really failed his two engagements,

163
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,250
it means that he's meant to have no wife in his life.

164
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,909
Also, his second wife-to-be died

165
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,750
before they could get married.

166
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,610
What is this called?

167
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,390
Isn't it his fate to bring bad luck to his wife?

168
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,480
But it was

169
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,110
his fiancee who had been weak and sick since childhood.

170
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,020
She died of a cold.

171
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,090
No matter what,

172
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,180
you just need to spread the word that

173
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,610
Zhang Zhe has the fate of a Monstrous Lone Star, who will bring bad luck to his wife.

174
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,370
Whoever marries him

175
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,000
will die a horrible death.

176
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,130
Let's see who dares to say that it's the Yao family's fault to break off the engagement.

177
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,860
Even though your father cherishes his talent,

178
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,560
if he hears about this a lot,

179
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,600
how can he not think for his daughter?

180
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,030
Also,

181
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,870
Zhang Zhe is already having a hard time

182
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,860
in the imperial court.

183
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,020
If he offended the Yao family,

184
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,150
what's in it for him?

185
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,380
If he really doesn't know what's good for him,

186
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,480

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,360
What should we do, Mr. Wang?

372
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,790
-It's just… -Xu.

373
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,680
I've made myself clear.

374
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,930
The price of raw silk keeps getting lower and lower this year.

375
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,420
I don't know when it will hit the bottom.

376
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,650
Our boss has decided not to buy any silk.

377
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,100
Don't make it difficult for me.

378
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,630
Mr. Wang.

379
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,880
Are you Mr. Xu?

380
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,200
I want to buy silk.

381
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,030
[Seller, Xu Wenyi]

382
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,030
[Buyer, You Fangyin]

383
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,600
Here's 400 taels.

384
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,490
Please keep it.

385
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,080
As for the raw silk,

386
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,200
keep it in your warehouse for now,

387
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,690
OK?

388
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,700
Your 400 taels

389
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,470
will really help me and the silkworm raisers out.

390
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,170
But Miss,

391
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,760
the price of raw silk is so low right now.

392
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,350
And according to the market situation,

393
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,950
the price may continue to fall.

394
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,050
You've stored so much of it.

395
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,670
Aren't you afraid of losing money?

396
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,460
If you can't sell it this year,

397
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,740
it may go mouldy and get bitten by worms

398
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,270
by next year.

399
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,780
No.

400
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,840
Boss said the silk price would rise.

401
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,060
I trust her.

402
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,270
Since I couldn't make use of Matron Su,

403
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,400
if I keep pretending,

404
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,420
I'll only be asking for trouble.

405
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,170
Forget it.

406
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,540
I'd better save my energy.

407
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,770
You are so thoughtful

408
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,520
as to notice such a detail as the direction of the flower.

409
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,680
You are indeed a pure and elegant person.

410
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,030
Miss Jiang

411
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,170
should be the first place of incense making today.

412
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,690
Of course I'm thoughtful.

413
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,400
I was maltreated by you a lot

414
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,180
because of such details back then.

415
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,330
Mr. Wang.

416
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,270
I have copied the exam paper six times.

417
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,640
Please have a look.

418
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,380
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

419
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,590
I think there's no need.

420
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
A bunch of young girls doing the studies.

421
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,000
[Teacher of Hanlin Academy, Wang Jiu]

422
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,920
The exam

423
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,660
is a mere formality.

424
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,920
There's no need to

425
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,440
take it too seriously.

426
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,380
I remember you said

427
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,500
the exam questions are all quite simple

428
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,079
[Teacher of Hanlin Academy, Zhao Yanhong]

429
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,790
this time.

430
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,630
If His Majesty gets to know about this,

431
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,780
won't he think it's a little perfunctory

432
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,280
since it can't show the knowledge of the study partners?

433
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,180
Her Highness insisted on studying,

434
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,320
so His Majesty had no choice.

435
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,190
Logically speaking,

436
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,930
a girl should

437
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,090
listen to her parents at home,

438
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,010
obey her husband after getting married and then her son if the husband passes away.

439
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,560
It's fine to read The Classic of Filial Piety and Lessons for Women.

440
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,070
Why did she have to make such a scene?

441
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,140
Exactly.

442
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,410
The etiquette training is over for now.

443
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,060
Please prepare for the literature exam this afternoon, ladies.

444
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,310
If you can't pass the exam,

445
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,540
you will also be expelled from the palace.

446
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,800
[Fanyu Pavilion]

447
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,570
Yes.

448
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,770
Oh no.

449
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,080
I wanted to review a bit more last night,

450
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,010
but I fell asleep

451
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,890
as soon as I started reading.

452
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,180
What should I do this afternoon?

453
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,190
Miss Jiang.

454
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,240
I could tell you had connections.

455
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:33,750
I heard that

456
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,020
your father is familiar with Mr. Xie.

457
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,460
I wonder if he ever gave you instructions on your studies?

458
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,600
Look.

459
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,810
Can you tell me a little bit about

460
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,620
the books Mr. Xie likes?

461
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,160
Does he have any preference

462
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,820
grading the exam papers?

463
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,090
Not many of them are really knowledgeable.

464
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,530
If they can answer the questions better than me,

465
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,590
wouldn't it make me seem more uneducated

466
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,710
and incapable of being a study partner?

467
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,460
Since you asked,

468
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,180
I have to tell you something.

469
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,320
Mr. Xie is knowledgeable,

470
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,510
but he won't make the exam too difficult for us.

471
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,410
The 20 Classics of Confucianism is a must read,

472
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,630
especially Article Three and Article Six.

473
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,840
Father once told me that

474
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,220
Mr. Xie is fond of neat handwriting.

475
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,380
No matter how good the answers are,

476
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,020
if the handwriting is not neat and clear,

477
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,930
he won't let you pass the exam.

478
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,850
Who has The 20 Classics of Confucianism?

479
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,820
I want to borrow it.

480
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,020
Baoying,

481
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,670
did you bring it?

482
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,870
No.

483
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,200
Sister Xue.

484
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,780
Really?

485
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,170
If my handwriting is bad, will I really be eliminated?

486
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,300
Baoying.

487
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,560
Don't listen to her nonsense.

488
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,130
I'm afraid Jiang Xuening can't even read.

489
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,910
How can she understand

490
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,920
someone so knowledgable as Mr. Xie?

491
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,920
Let's just wait to laugh at her this afternoon.

492
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,880
Miss Jiang.

493
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,700
Wait.

494
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,990
What's up?

495
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,970
About last night...

496
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,320
Don't worry, Miss Yao.

497
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,440
I may not be a good person,

498
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,350
but I'll say it to your face

499
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,440
if there's any hard feeling between us.

500
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,840
I won't do anything like

501
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,450
talking behind people's back and slandering them.

502
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,100
So you don't need to worry

503
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,240
if I'll spread any rumor.

504
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,420
I don't think I have any grudge against you.

505
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,640
But your reaction last night

506
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,050
seemed to be a little too over.

507
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,610
Miss Jiang.

508
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,600
May I ask

509
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,950
what your relationship with Zhang Zhe is?

510
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,490
I was just taking up the cudgel

511
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,620
for Mr. Zhang.

512
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,280
And you already thought there's something between us?

513
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,780
If there is really something,

514
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,140
you will use it

515
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,270
as a reason to break off the engagement, right?

516
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,060
If there's really nothing between you and him,

517
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,930
why do you care so much about my marriage?

518
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,260
Mr. Zhang Zhe is upright

519
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,440
and virtuous.

520
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,620
He is a gentleman.

521
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,200
I'm just a nobody.

522
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,780
I dare not get involved with him.

523
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,480
However, a gentleman should be treated

524
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,090
in a gentleman's way.

525
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,550
People all tend to seek benefits and avoid harm.

526
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,020
Miss Yao, if you think this marriage is not good for you,

527
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,700
it's understandable that you want to break it off.

528
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,410
But if you go too far,

529
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,310
it will be no good.

530
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,310
You want to break off the engagement,

531
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,260
and you don't want to take on any harm,

532
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,360
there is no such good thing in the world.

533
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,420
You're just talking like this because it's not about you.

534
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,480
If something like this happens to you,

535
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,740
if you are appointed to marry someone like him,

536
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm afraid you might not be any better than me.

537
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,040
If I were you, Miss Yao,

538
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,910
I would be so happy

539
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,160
to marry such a good man like him.

540
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,120
Why would I break it off?

541
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,120
Even if I have to,

542
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,880
I won't sling mud

543
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,210
at innocent people.

544
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,560
I would tell the Zhang family frankly and openly.

545
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,760
If I'm determined not

546
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,270
to be called a snob,

547
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,740
and I still want to break off the engagement,

548
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,720
I'll simply do nothing

549
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,350
and just wait at home.

550
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,370
What do you mean?

551
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,750
Do you know something?

552
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,990
The exam is starting soon.

553
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,370
Instead of pestering me here,

554
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,540
you may want to use the time to study more.

555
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,440
Thank you for your help.

556
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,140
I'm very grateful.

557
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,300
Don't mention it.

558
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,970
You're very knowledgeable, Miss Xue.

559
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,480
There was no need to do this.

560
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,310
But His Lordship

561
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,640
considers it very important that you become a study partner.

562
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,520
That's why he asked me to do this just for sure.

563
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,660
But the questions of this exam

564
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,820
were set by Mr. Xie himself.

565
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,360
The questions are mainly

566
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,850
about politics.

567
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,560
If you have The 20 Classics of Confucianism,

568
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,580
you may want to take it out and read it more.

569
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,040
It's really The 20 Classics of Confucianism?

570
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,280
Miss Xue, you...

571
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,430
It's nothing.

572
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,880
Thank you, Sir.

573
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,840
You're welcome.

574
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,420
Please sit down.

575
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,490
The literature exam

576
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,400
begins now.

577
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,220
The duration

578
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,320
is two hours.

579
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,170
Within the time limit,

580
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,390
please answer the questions carefully.

581
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,220
[An army can conquer a general, but no man can rob one of his ambition.]

582
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,220
[Please explain why it is important for a man to have ambition.]

583
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,550
It's indeed almost the same as the last exam.

584
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,530
Article Three of The 20 Classics of Confucianism.

585
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,190
Isn't this...

586
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,030
Silence!

587
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,740
Start writing already.

588
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,620
Wait.

589
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,370
Mr. Xie.

590
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,400
What's wrong?

591
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,530
From now on, if there's no strong wind, rain, or sunshine,

592
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,070
please keep the windows at the east corner open.

593
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,020
Yes.

594
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,920
Start writing.

595
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,190
Opening the window.

596
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,400
He's obviously suspecting me of cheating in the dark.

597
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,520
Rebels are rebels.

598
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,590
With his own mean measure.

599
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,650
Wait and see how I'll surprise you

600
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,430
with my great score this time.

601
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,460
♫We made a promise♫

602
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,220
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

604

♫Without you♫

605
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,130
♫Watching the cloud, waiting for winter to come♫

606
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,790
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

607

♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

613

Time is up.

614
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,660
Everyone, stop writing.

615
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,930
Gentlemen,

616
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,260
do you want to grade the papers together?

617
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,690
No need.

618
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,930
It's up to you, Mr. Xie.

619
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,840
It's my turn.

620
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,110
Oh no.

621
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,390
Could it be

622
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,400
I put too much effort into it?

623
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,800
Why is he staring at me?

624
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,920
Is he going to pick on me

625
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,330
besides chasing me out of the palace?

626
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,410
Miss Jiang.

627
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,130
Why do I feel like

628
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,570
Mr. Xie has been reading this paper

629
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,920
for a much longer time than others?

630
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:34,900
Besides,

631
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,710
he seems to be glaring at you.

632
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,590
Don't you know?

633
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,790
He has an eye sickness.

634
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,120
Just now,

635
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,940
I've graded the exam papers,

636
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,920
and the result is out.

637
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,460
Xue Shu from Mansion of Duke of Xue,

638
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,470
top level.

639
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,120
Yao Xi from Mansion of Minister Yao,

640
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,300
above average.

641
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,410
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

642
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,130
Fang Miao from Mansion of Supervisor Fang,

643
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,710
your answers

644
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,160
are average.

645
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,420
However,

646
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,100
since your handwriting is neat

647
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,820
and clear,

648
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,800
I can see that you are sincere about studying.

649
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,850
You can stay too.

650
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,570
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

651
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,380
You Yue and Zhou Baoying,

652
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,220
you need to study harder

653
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,880
from now on.

654
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,680
But you can also stay this time.

655
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,060
Yes.

656
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,610
As for

657
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,390
Jiang Xuening from Mansion of Vice Minister Jiang,

658
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,420
you are top level in regard of exam grade.

659
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,300
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

660
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,300
After I go back home, I'll definitely…

661
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,910
You can stay.

662
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,300
How is that possible?

663
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,250
Look.

664
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,520
Miss Jiang is so happy

665
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,990
that she even started talking nonsense.

666
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:45,960
No.

667
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,250
I can't stay in the palace no matter what.

668
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,180
Not to mention becoming Xie Wei's student.

669
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,050
That'll be asking for death.

670
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,150
Mr. Xie.

671
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,600
I have something I don't understand

672
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,460
that I want to ask.

673
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,650
I know I'm not knowledgeable,

674
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,250
but I was graded top level.

675
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,850
I'm afraid those who are graded average low will be confused.

676
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,350
Why don't you hand out the students' exam papers

677
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,120
so that we can be more convinced?

678
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,000
Are you

679
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,360
questioning my justice?

680
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,870
I dare not.

681
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,210
Fine.

682
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,410
In that case,

683
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,350
I'll take out your exam papers

684
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,160
and comment on them one by one,

685
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,200
so that you can know

686
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,580
what your shortcomings are.

687
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,220
I don't need it.

688
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:29,890
Sir.

689
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,550
I'm indeed unknowledgeable.

690
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,870
I admit that.

691
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,070
Yes.

692
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,470
If he comments on them in detail,

693
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,070
it equals whipping our dead bodies in public.

694
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,270
Jiang Xuening.

695
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,840
You're always competitive.

696
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,500
It's fine for you to get top level.

697
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,740
Why do you have to pick on us?

698
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,580
Sister Xue

699
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,330
also got top level.

700
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,480
But she didn't say anything.

701
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,900
In this case,

702
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,170
it seems that Miss Jiang is the only one who doesn't understand.

703
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,030
We are convinced.

704
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,410
We've got your instructions,

705
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,860
and we don't want to trouble you anymore.

706
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,940
That's good.

707
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,240
Miss Jiang, do you mind staying behind after this?

708
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,650
I can explain it to you alone.

709
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,230
No need.

710
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,200
I must be strict in teaching.

711
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,240
As a teacher,

712
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,760
I should resolve your doubts.

713
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,550
But since Miss Jiang has made it into the palace,

714
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,520
you'll have plenty of time

715
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,870
to learn it slowly.

716
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,440
Am I right?

717
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,050
All right.

718
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,550
Go back to your mansions and get ready.

719
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,870
After that, you will officially enter the palace and be study partners.

720
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,610
We shall

721
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,360
call each other teacher and student from now on.

722
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,330
And I'll teach you

723
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,150
for six months.

724
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,130
Please study hard

725
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,580
and don't let us down.

726
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,570
You can leave now.

727
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,230
I have something

728
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,340
to discuss with the two teachers.

729
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,610
Yes.

730
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,060
My goodness.

731
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,360
I passed it.

732
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,910
And Mr. Xie is not

733
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,240
that cold and strict as Father said.

734
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,460
His voice is gentle and nice.

735
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,930
It's all Father's fault for scaring me.

736
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,500
That's because you've never seen him being scary.

737
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,030
He can easily scare people to death.

738
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,460
My father said

739
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,260
Mr. Xie behaves and conducts himself perfectly.

740
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,490
He's never careless in teaching.

741
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,290
He also said

742
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,760
if I could learn at least something,

743
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,880
I wouldn't have come to the palace in vain.

744
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,150
It's all thanks to

745
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,540
the kind lady here, Miss Jiang.

746
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,780
Without your instructions,

747
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,190
I would have failed.

748
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,460
Miss Jiang is indeed somebody.

749
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,710
She seemed to know what the exam would be about.

750
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,700
From the questions

751
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,960
to Mr. Xie's preferences,

752
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,280
she knew it all.

753
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,950
Who knows what you did behind our back?

754
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,760
I don't care about others,

755
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,820
but Mr. Xie is upright

756
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,830
and virtuous.

757
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,670
Everyone in the court knows that.

758
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,110
How would a saint like that care about you?

759
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,500
Dream on.

760
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,820
You also think Xie Wei is a good man?

761
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,280
Everyone knows Mr. Xie is a good man.

762
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,690
He's an official but he never formed any clique.

763
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,600
He has always been devoted to teaching, and he's honest and upright.

764
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,390
He's loyal to His Majesty.

765
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,130
How is a man like this not good?

766
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,320
At this moment,

767
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,020
Xie Wei has nothing to do

768
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,280
with the rebels yet.

769
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,840
Everyone thinks he's a good person,

770
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,800
respecting and thinking highly of him.

771
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,920
If I act differently,

772
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,560
wouldn't it be revealed that

773
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,320
I know more than everyone else?

774
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,740
What's wrong?

775
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,880
I need to go back to see Mr. Xie.

776
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,970
Miss Fang.

777
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,720
If I'm not back in two quarters,

778
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,020
please come to Fengchen Hall to save me.

779
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,720
Why are you going there?

780
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,960
[Four years ago]

781
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,060
There are traps set by the hunters in the mountain.

782
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,380
There must be a village nearby.

783
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,880
We can get out soon.

784
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,830
Wake up. You can't die.

785
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,760
What are you doing?

786
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,360
The doctor told me

787
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,040
you were suffering from evil coldness.

788
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,370
Only by feeding you blood can I save you.

789
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,000
However,

790
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,370
you have no idea what's good for you.

791
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,710
Xie Wei, are you crazy?

792
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,620
Don't come over.

793
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,520
It's not me.

794
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,530
I'm not him.

795
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,770
His eyes are red,

796
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,330
and there are red spots on his body.

797
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,020
He's distracted, addicted to blood,

798
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,050
and out of control.

799
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,190
This is

800
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,640
dementia.

801
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,500
Ordinary people are human,

802
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,080
and His Majesty is also human.

803
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,350
How could they?

804
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,600
How could they?

805
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,230
Kill!

806
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,030
Kill them all!

807
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,540
Kill!

808
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,110
Mother.

809
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm so cold.

810
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,240
I want peach kernel slice cakes.

811
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,580
Xie Wei tested and warned me several times.

812
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,449
He did it partly for Yan Lin,

813
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,030
but also for what happened back then.

814
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,750
He has dementia.

815
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,540
He becomes bloodthirsty on a snowy day.

816
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,909
His so-called

817
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,130
treacherous words

818
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,360
are also related to His Majesty.

819
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,060
No matter what other secret Xie Wei is hiding,

820
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,670
in the imperial palace,

821
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,100
it's too easy for him

822
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,090
to get rid of me.

823
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,820
At this point,

824
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,650
I have to take a risky move

825
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,409
to survive.

826
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,170
You know I don't want to enter the palace, Mr. Xie.

827
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,600
Why did you make me stay?

828
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,510
Miss Ning, so you're done pretending?

829
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,740
I know I'm unknowledgeable.

830
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,530
My answers were just a bunch of nonsense.

831
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,200
But I got good grades from you and got to stay in the palace.

832
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
After thinking about it repeatedly,

833
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,990
there is only one explanation.

834
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,490
Are you suspecting that

835
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,310
I haven't forgotten about what happened on our way to the capital,

836
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,870
and you are afraid that I would leak it out,

837
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,740
so you wanted to keep me by your side

838
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,730
and keep an eye on me?

839
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,940
If I make any move,

840
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,830
you'll kill me immediately.

841
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,130
Am I right?

842
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,540
Since you came to me,

843
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,220
the answer is obvious.

844
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,610
I don't want others

845
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,570
to know what happened back then.

846
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,410
You were not wrong about that.

847
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,130
However,

848
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,080
you are not

849
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,720
a threat yourself.

850
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,300
But

851
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,510
I do have something

852
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,480
to ask you, Miss Ning.

853
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,240
What's your relationship

854
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,160
with Yan Lin?

855
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,740
He is my best friend.

856
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,820
He's the one who treats me the best in the capital.

857
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,250
That's all?

858
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,390
What do you mean?

859
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,110
Rumor has it that

860
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,120
you and Yan Lin are deeply in love.

861
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,520
It is said that after the coming-of-age ceremony,

862
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,950
Viscount Yan will marry you.

863
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,060
I've said

864
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,200
Yan Lin is my best friend.

865
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,650
Our relationship is truly deep.

866
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,780
But it's not that kind of love between men and women.

867
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,270
Miss Ning, your paper

868
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,040
was different from others'.

869
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,740
I'm unknowledgeable,

870
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,340
but I found that you have

871
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,970
indeed read a lot of books.

872
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,050
This sentence

873
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,020
is from Story of Marquis of Liu.

874
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,930
And this sentence

875
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,450
is from Stratagems of the Warring States.

876
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,730
They are not from

877
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,420
the books that ordinary girls read.

878
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,630
All these years,

879
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,110
I've never heard that you're devoted to studying.

880
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,650
Then why do you

881
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,370
have such an accumulation of knowledge now?

882
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,760
If it's not that

883
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,380
I don't believe in supernatural things,

884
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,380
I'm afraid

885
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,310
I'd think you're reincarnated,

886
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,460
Miss Ning.

887
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,650
I did hide my talent.

888
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,340
But that was for staying away from the palace

889
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,150
and court disputes.

890
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,090
Please let me

891
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,410
leave the palace, Sir.

892
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,410
Don't waste your time.

893
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,590
First,

894
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,050
your father asked me to take good care of you

895
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,820
in the palace several days ago.

896
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,420
Second,

897
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,450
Yan Lin also asked me

898
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,990
to help you.

899
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,140
Third, as the saying goes,

900
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,540
a drop of water in need

901
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,660
shall be returned with a spring in deed.

902
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,370
Haven't you heard that

903
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,810
although the list of study partners entering the palace

904
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,610
was selected by the Ministry of Rites,

905
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,210
in the end,

906
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,460
they had to run it by me

907
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,720
before it was released.

908
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,650
I've already marked your name

909
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,780
a while ago

910
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,070
so that you could enter the palace.

911
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,540
How could I

912
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,570
let you leave so easily?

913
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,070
So you were behind it, letting me in the palace?

914
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,660
Turns out it's not someone who's messing with me,

915
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,150
but everyone wants to mess with me.

916
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,670
Instead of leaving you outside the palace,

917
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,220
I'd rather keep you under my nose

918
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,070
and watch you.

919
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,580
You don't want to enter the palace.

920
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,520
Is it because you're afraid

921
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,320
I'll kill you?

922
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,200
Mr. Xie.

923
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,780
I'm just a girl.

924
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,500
I have no power

925
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,680
nor ambition in the imperial court.

926
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,940
To you,

927
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,900
I'm just a little ant

928
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,700
that can be killed by some simple tricks.

929
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,450
If I tell you

930
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,060
I have no intention to tell on you

931
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,320
or harm you from beginning to end,

932
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,980
will you believe me?

933
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,000
If you were me,

934
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,250
would you believe it?

935
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,010
I dare not.

936
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,400
So,

937
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,860
if you were me,

938
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,220
this person...

939
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,650
Would you get rid of her

940
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,770
or not?

941
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,190
But Sir,

942
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,360
I don't want to die.

943
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,100
You're not a threat to me.

944
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,230
The real threat is that

945
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,370
I dare not believe you,

946
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,390
but I want to.

947
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,780
I'm not an ungrateful person.

948
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,470
I don't want to hurt my savior.

949
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,890
But what matters is

950
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,620
whether you'll obey me or not.

951
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,510
Ning.

952
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,230
Have you ever experienced

953
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,400
keeping a secret in your heart

954
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,220
and not being able to tell anyone?

955
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,720
Walking at night in finery,

956
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,930
and feeling especially lonely

957
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,430
with all the money and status?

958
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,400
You are a smart person.

959
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,690
With you as a study partner in the palace,

960
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,200
the life in palace

961
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,850
will become more interesting.

962
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,100
But I don't want to.

963
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,060
What you're hiding

964
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,290
is what I want to see.

965
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:00,930
So, Jiang Xuening,

966
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,690
in the next six months of being a study partner in the palace,

967
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,320
please behave yourself under my nose

968
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,070
like an ordinary lady.

969
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,190
Don't get involved with Yan Lin

970
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,200
or

971
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,980
do anything that may harm Mansion of Marquis of Yan.

972
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,390
Don't push me

973
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,040
or make me angry.

974
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,330
Otherwise...

975
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,070
There's no need for a wolf to deceive an ant.

976
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,900
I managed to escape from death

977
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,660
and survive for now.

978
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,380
Half a year.

979
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,280
I can't avoid it.

980
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,940
I have to deal with whatever comes my way.

981
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,320
I didn't expect

982
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,730
you to be good at archery too.

983
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,770
I'll send someone to ask for a leave for you.

984
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,320
Let's have a drink tonight.

985
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,810
Your Highness.

986
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,110
I don't think it's a good idea.

987
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,050
Listen.

988
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,330
Tomorrow,

989
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,510
I'm inviting a girl over

990
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,020
who's very important to me.

991
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,140
Speaking of which,

992
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,370
you two are old acquaintances.

993
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,360
I'll take you to see her.

994
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,290
You are not talking about the Second Young Lady from Mansion of Vice Minister Jiang, are you?

995
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,570
Yes.

996
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,310
It's her.

997
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,420
Let me tell you.

998
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,370
This girl

999
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,050
is the most important person

1000
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,740
to me in this world.

1001
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:23,220
Let's go.

1002
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,860
Why is Yan Lin with a Xingwu Guard?

1003
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,640
I was negligent.

1004
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,730
I'll investigate it immediately.

1005
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,210
My Lord. My Lady.

1006
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,330
Miss Ning is back.

1007
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,180
Ning is back.

1008
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,570
Ning.

1009
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,090
You're back.

1010
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,480
How have you been in the palace these days?

1011
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,030
We've heard the news.

1012
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,030
Our Ning is so capable.

1013
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,190
You passed the exam successfully.

1014
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,610
Congratulations, Ning.

1015
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,350
I thought

1016
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,980
you could't pass it given your ability.

1017
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,710
I didn't expect you to get to stay.

1018
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,800
I was thinking

1019
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,820
whether

1020
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,190
it's because of luck,

1021
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,330
or was there someone there to help you?

1022
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,600
Right.

1023
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,200
In your eyes,

1024
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,920
I'm just ignorant and incompetent.

1025
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,680
Since I passed,

1026
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,510
there must be something behind it.

1027
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,820
Am I wrong?

1028
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,850
You appeared on that list for no reason

1029
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,900
instead of your sister that day.

1030
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,340
I couldn't figure it out.

1031
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,150
Then I thought

1032
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,460
it must be Viscount Yan who helped you.

1033
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,680
I'm afraid it's the same

1034
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,670
this time.

1035
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,650
If you think so, I have nothing to say.

1036
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,150
So you admit it?

1037
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,480
You are admitting that

1038
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,560
you took away your sister's chance to enter the palace?

1039
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,640
If your sister got to enter the palace,

1040
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,780
those who go to study in the palace

1041
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,260
will all be young talents from noble families.

1042
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,830
Your sister will surely find a good match.

1043
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,220
It's not impossible for her

1044
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,370
to become a consort.

1045
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,410
On the contrary,

1046
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,630
you are stubborn and disobedient.

1047
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,000
You always cause trouble.

1048
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,890
Not to mention being a consort,

1049
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,800
even if you become the empress one day,

1050
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,060
you won't be able to enjoy it.
