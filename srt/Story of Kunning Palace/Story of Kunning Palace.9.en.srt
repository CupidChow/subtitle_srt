00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,350
I warned you

After meddling in Zhou Yinzhi's affairs,

85

you think you can interfere in the power struggle at court.

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,750
You think you care about the Yan family

87
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,190

Did you play a role

97

in the Ruyi jade incident?

98
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,860
Am I causing trouble

100
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,659

106

107
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,740
It turns out that a perfect person has worries too

108
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,780
and a saint has fears as well.

109
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,640
A perfect person can have worries and a saint can have fears.

110
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,330
But I'm not perfect,

111
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,770
nor am I a saint.

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,800
Jiang Xuening.

113
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,190
You think you're clever

114
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,270
and never bother to keep a low profile.

115
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,500
But you should know this.

116
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,550
When someone

117
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,860
doesn't want to touch something,

118
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,960
it's not necessarily because of fear.

119
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,470
It can be because of hate

120
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,909
and aversion.

121
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,120
A military camp?

122
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,890
Yes.

123
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,330
I watched it all night.

124
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,610
There were horses, provisions, and weapons.

125
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,160
They were all military supplies.

126
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,440
I've done the math.

127
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,990
They're enough to support at least 3,000 people.

128
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,600

129
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,210

Four.

134
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,890
One.

Xingwu Guards

136
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,390

137
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,650
Although Xue Yuan is the commander,

138
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,030
all their supplies are allocated by the court.

139
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,730
He's stored so many supplies.

140
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:48,760
It seems

141
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,560
he's building a private army.

142
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,200
Building a private army is a felony.

143
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,680
His Majesty won't allow it.

144
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,090
Is Xue Yuan so bold that he's keeping it from His Majesty?

145
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,670
Xue Yuan is ambitious

146
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,440
and hungry for power.

147
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,390
When His Majesty ascended the throne,

148
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,970
the empress dowager intended

149
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,350
to let him command the armies.

150
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,370
Later, all the other officials in the court

151
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,760
submitted a petition

152
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,900
and stopped that from happening.

153
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,570
These years, he's been resenting the Yan family

154
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,240
for the armies at our command.

155
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,630
It makes sense that he's built a private army

156
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,980
to stand against us.

157
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,690
If we report this to His Majesty,

158
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,480
we'll be able to suppress the Xue family, won't we?

159
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,910
His Majesty is in poor health.

160
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,260
The empress dowager carries a great deal of clout.

161
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

162
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,370
Father, you're right.

163
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,900
If the Yan family reports this matter,

164
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,790
the empress dowager is very likely to get in the way.

165
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,850
But they want to make Lord Linzi the crown prince

166
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,409
and have a private army now.

167
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,270
If something happens to His Majesty,

168
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,180
there will be chaos.

169
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,320
Such a large amount of military supplies

170
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,900
couldn't have been quietly transported

171
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,050
from a place too far away.

172
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,300
It's very likely that they were from Tongzhou.

173
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,060
I'll go to the Tongzhou military camp in secret

174
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,840
to find out what's going on.

175
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,370
Then we'll find a way to report it to His Majesty.

176
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,810
A while ago,

177
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,830
a military official was arrested by Xue Yuan without a good reason.

178
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,250
We need to send someone to the prison again to make inquiries.

179
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,160
Despite our constant efforts,

180
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,070
we still haven't managed

181
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,530
to meet that guy in person

182
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,460
and find out what happened.

183
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,070
If this goes on,

184
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,120
the Yan family will be even more disadvantaged.

185
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,200
Father, don't worry.

186
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,110
I'll take care of things here.

187
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,870
If you find anything,

188

send a message back by carrier pigeon.

189
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,850
I'll make preparations in advance.

190
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,289
I just got word

191
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,130
that early this morning,

192
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,340
Marquis of Yan left town

193
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,210
and went to Tongzhou.

194
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,410
He left town?

195
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,100
For what?

196
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,350
Maybe

197
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,810
he's going to inspect the troops?

198
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,620
Yan Lin went hunting in the suburbs

199
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,580
with Lord Linzi yesterday

200
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,870
and didn't come back until this morning.

201
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,130
I see.

202
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,520
You must have known about the Ruyi jade incident

203
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,590
and what Deputy Gong Yi did.

204
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,190
We'd better be cautious these days.

205
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,170
Wait.

206
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,790
You insisted on giving lessons in the court yesterday

207
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,070
because you had to send a message.

208
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,550
The message has been sent,

209
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,420
yet you're still hurrying to the court.

210
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,290
Are you doing this

211
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,550
because of Miss Jiang?

212
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,570
In my opinion,

213
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,480
Miss Jiang is so mysterious.

214
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,620
She knows everything

215
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,730
and had the guts to talk to Mr. Xie like that.

216
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,840
We must get rid of her!

217
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,780
No.

218
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,680
Why?

219
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,980
She's got something on us.

220
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,070
She could be the death of us.

221
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,960
She's an enigma

222
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,220
but not a bad person.

223
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,510
In time,

224
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,160
she may open up to us.

225
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,330
But you told us

226
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,340
that we should nip it in the bud.

227
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,260
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

228
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,070
I've told you she's not our enemy.

229
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,590
Why do you have to get rid of her?

230
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,650
Besides,

231
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,280
I'll be watching over her.

232
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,170
What could possibly go wrong?

233
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,450
But you also said that…

234
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,050
Enough.

235
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,990
You can leave now.

236
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,260
We'll take care of things out here.

237
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,660
Rest assured.

238
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,200
What are you doing?

239
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:07,840
Silly boy.

240
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,020
I just saved you.

241
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,460
Another poor guy who's implicated in the Ruyi jade incident.

242
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,620
Before I went to bed last night,

243
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,380
I heard Eunuch Huang and the other eunuchs

244
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,380
torturing servants outside.

245
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,260
I was so scared that I was up all night.

246
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,130
I need to go to the temple and say my prayers.

247
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,750
If the Ruyi jade incident is really intended to undermine the Yan family,

248
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,010
I must find a way to prevent that from happening.

249
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,690
But the court is heavily guarded now

250
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,330
and Xie Wei won't help me again.

251
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,620
What should I do?

[Work hard to make the country better]

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,210
Are you really going to give lessons in the Fengcheng Hall?

254
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,050
Junior Preceptor Xie

255
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,030
assigned us to give lessons

256
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,450
but compiled such a textbook.

257
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,270
[Political Classics]

258
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,250
It's all about politics.

259
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,360
I'm at a loss

260
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,350
for how to teach.

261
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,560
Junior Preceptor Xie is accomplished at a young age

262
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,820
and always has some unusual ideas.

263
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,050
But the Hanlin Academy

264
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,050
has its own long-established traditions.

265
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,710
Moreover,

266
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,270
Miss Xue is a study partner too.

267
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,330
If we say something improper in class

268
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,530
and she tells it to the duke,

269
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,180
we'll be in trouble.

270
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,200
That's exactly what I'm saying.

271
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,820
Not long ago, the duke asked us

272
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,620
to draft a memorial about making Lord Linzi the crown prince.

273
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,150
It went unanswered for some reason.

274
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,680
The duke is still sulking about it.

275
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,700
If we cause more trouble for him at this time,

276
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,110
we'll…

277
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,100
How about

278
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,150
we use this book as the textbook?

279
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:08,930
It can't go wrong.

280
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,000
[Book of Etiquettes]

281
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,050
Why are we learning this?

282
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,030
Mr. Wang,

283
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,700
I wonder when we can learn

284
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,280
the textbook Junior Preceptor Xie compiled.

285
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,420
Your Highness.

286
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,340
His Majesty ordered me and the other scholars to give you lessons

287
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,470
with the aim of enlightening you

288
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,620
instead of spoiling you

289
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,510
and letting you do whatever you want.

290
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,450
I heard

291
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
someone in the Fengcheng Hall

292
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,010
was disrespectful to the elders

293
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,730
and didn't show the virtues of forbearance and civility

294
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,780
that were expected of a woman.

295
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,750
I found it ridiculous

296
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,060
and realized the heavy burden on my shoulders.

297
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,720
So I changed the textbook today

298
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,080
to tell you

299
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,160
what a woman should be like.

300
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,300
Please open the textbook.

301
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,800
Since ancient times,

302
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,030
women have been expected to be obedient,

303
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,130
modest,

304
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,770
and tolerant.

305
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,150
Those good-for-nothing dipsticks.

306
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,550
They call me an unscrupulous vixen

307
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,680
and are hellbent on talking Shen Jie into deposing me.

308
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,670
What?

309
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,680
It's my fault that Shen Jie dotes on me.

310
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,710
It's also my fault that he allows me to talk politics.

311
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,880
It's my fault again that he's sick now.

312
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm the empress. So what?

313
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,700
In their eyes,

314
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,780
I'm just a woman

315
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,190
whom they can sling mud at

316
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,110
just because I violated some stupid social conventions.

317
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:00,430
Your Majesty.

318
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,020
Don't care about those bigots.

319
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,450
Bigots?

320
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,770

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,500
how many people

322
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,000
are not bigoted?

323
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,980
Throughout history, the fall of every empire

324
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,720
and the degeneration of every noble man

325
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,020
could more or less be blamed on women.

326
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,350
So as women,

327
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,680
you must conform to

328
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,900
social conventions…

330
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,830
What do you want?

331
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,650
Sir.

332
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,780
I feel sick.

333
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,390
How dare you!

334
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,670
How dare you

335
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,850
insult your teacher?

336
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,350
That's strange.

337
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,040
I said I feel sick.

338
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,760
Why do you feel insulted?

339
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,680
Maybe I ate something spoiled yesterday

340
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,800
or smelled something repulsive

341
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,070
and stinky today.

342
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,530
If I stay here any longer,

343
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,880
I'm afraid I'll throw up

344
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,780
and ruin your mood for teaching.

345
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
So please forgive me.

346
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:03,860
I'll take my leave.

347
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,610

348
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,300
You…

349
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,810
You…

350
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,300
You…

351
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,890
What a rebellious girl!

352
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,560
An ill-mannered and willful person like you

353
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,880
doesn't deserve to stay in the Fengcheng Hall.

354
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,750
Go find someone else to teach you!

355
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,420
That's your Ning.

356
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:31,900
Ning?

357
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,770
So that's the Miss Jiang

358
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,680
who I've heard so much about.

359
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,490
I finally meet her in the flesh today.

360
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,560
Please don't make fun of us.

361
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,910
Miss Jiang is just my friend.

362
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,590
You can make fun of me when we're alone.

363
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,510
But if what you just said reaches my father,

364
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,500
I'll just be beaten up

365
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,990
but Miss Jiang's reputation will be stained.

366
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,970
Please be careful with what you say.

367
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,710
King Yanping is young and frank.

368
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,140
Please…

369
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,680
Don't take offense, Miss Jiang.

370
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,010
See?

371
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,540
This is who Viscount Yan is.

372
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,660
When he was all over her,

373
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,710
he treated her so nicely.

374
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,610
But now,

375
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,000
he's so cold to her.

376
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,840
You're good-looking.

377
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,790
Viscount Yan doesn't want you,

378
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,010
but I'm interested in you.

379
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,510
Xue Ye.

380
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,750
Shut up.

381
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,450
Mr. Xue, you look

382
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,020
well-educated

383
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,740
but talk like a lout.

384
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,600
There are many things that Viscount Yan doesn't want.

385
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,010
But I'm afraid you don't deserve

386
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,990
to have any of them.

387
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,280
You…

388
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:33,900
Enough.

389
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,960
Miss Jiang is Zhiyi's study partner.

390
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,030
Don't be rude to her.

391
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,030
All right. Let's go.

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,290
Aren't you going to meet Mr. Xie?

393
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,400
Let's go.

394
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:47,920
Yan Lin.

395
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,270
Watch your mouth.

396
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,020
Wait. I…

397
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,910
What did I say?

398
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,820
I didn't say anything.

399
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,470
What does it have to do with me?

400
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:55,890
Silly.

401
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,000
Why did you come?

402
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,190
Mr. Xie.

403
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,640
My father said I've been studying for half a year

404
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,619
and insisted on testing me on politics.

405
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,480
If I fail his test,

406
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,650
I'm afraid I'll be punished.

407
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,170
I stayed up all night

408
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,819
and wrote this essay.

409
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,540
Please take a look at it.

410
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:21,950
Why are you laughing?

411
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,420
You're laughing at me today

412
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,880
but it'll be your turn tomorrow.

413
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,370
These days,

414
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,160
you've improved a lot

415
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,160
and outshined most of your peers.

416
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,560
Even if there are imperfections in your essay,

417
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,760
your father won't mind them.

418
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,580
-Thank you. 
-But since you've brought it here,

419
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,830
I'll review it carefully later

420
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,040
and give you feedback in class tomorrow.

421
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,150
Okay.

422
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,000
We'll take our leave then.

423
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,780
Viscount Yan.

424
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,220
I selected several pieces of wood to make a qin a few days ago.

425
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,420
Some of them need to be disposed of.

426
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,500
Can you help me move them out?

427
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,820
My pleasure, Mr. Xie.

428
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,820
You two go on.

429
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,800
Knock it off.

430
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,100
Miss Xuening came to me for qin lessons a few days ago

431
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,120
and left her qin here.

432
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,950
Although she's ill-mannered, naughty,

433
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,500
and bad at school,

434
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,100
she's smart.

435
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,630
Viscount Yan,

436
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,540
you don't have to worry too much about her.

437
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,740
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

438
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,740
If only I could stop worrying

439
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,970
so easily.

440
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,230
By the way,

441
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,460
I didn't see your father in the council meeting this morning.

442
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,410
I heard he's sick and resting at home.

443
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,520
Is he all right?

444
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,700
My father

445
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,060
drank a little too much.

446
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,980
His old injuries from the battlefield are acting up.

447
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,630
But he'll be fine soon.

448
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,760
Thank you for your concern.

449
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,670
Is something troubling you, Viscount Yan?

450
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,500
I'm your teacher.

451
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,870
It's my duty to share my knowledge of life with you.

452
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,350
Even saints have concerns sometimes.

453
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,840
You must have your concerns too.

454
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,920
If you trust me,

455
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,980
you can come to me

456
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,530
whenever you need help.

457
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,720
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

458
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,830
I can handle

459
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,030
most of the things myself,

460
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,430
but

461
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,530
it worries me that she's all alone in the court.

462
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,140
She's

463
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,350
straightforward by nature.

464
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,410
She may say something wrong and offend someone.

465
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,180
If it's not an imposition,

466
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,980
please take care of her for me,

467
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,110
will you?

468
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,090
Okay.

469
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,120
Try it.

470
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,920
Ning.

471
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,060
You're finally back.

472
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,980
You must've been scared by that old man.

473
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,390
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

474
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,710
I just didn't want to listen to him

475
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,080
and hung out for a little while.

476
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:24,800
I enjoyed myself.

477
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,880
Not only you,

478
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,730
I was also sickened by what he said.

479
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,060
You don't like him either?

480
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,130
I'm always aware that unmarried women outside

481
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,230
have to learn the Book of Etiquettes,

482
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,410
but I never took it to heart.

483
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,280
After I learned it myself, I found it disgusting.

484
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,940
It has no respect for women at all.

485
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,290
It's unbelievable

486
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,970
that such abominable stuff

487
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,920
was brought into the court

488
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,350
and taught to us in class.

489
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,810
Luckily, besides qin lessons,

490
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,600
Mr. Xie will give us other lessons too.

491
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,490
We'll be able to learn the textbook he compiled later.

492
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,150
He's even harder to deal with

493
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,210
than that pedantic old man Wang Jiu.

494
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,870
Greetings, Mr. Xie.

495
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,150
Skip the formalities.

496
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,170
[Book of Etiquettes]

497
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,610
This book shouldn't have appeared in the Fengcheng Hall.

498
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,830
Who brought it here?

499
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,890
Mr. Xie.

500
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,630
Mr. Wang said

501
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,320
we were disrespectful to the elders

502
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,480
so he decided to teach us etiquette.

503
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,570
He also told us

504
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,820
that women should be obedient.

505
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,560
Throw them away.

506
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,050
How should we explain it to Mr. Wang?

507
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,060
There are already enough restraints on women in this society.

508
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,540
You're not here

509
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,040
to learn something like that.

510
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,890
If anyone still wants to learn the Book of Etiquettes,

511
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,450
go ahead and pick it up.

512
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,200
I won’t stop you.

513
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,780
Class begins.

514
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,790
That's all for today.

515
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,350
You may leave.

516
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,420
Miss Xuening.

517
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,700
Please wait.

518
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,940
Did you understand

519
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,010
today's lesson?

520
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,800
I'm afraid he's here to get even with me.

521
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,020
Thank you for your concern.

522
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,050
I understood everything.

523
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,170
Later, I will...

524
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,150
If you have no other plans later,

525
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,680
come with me to Wenzhao Pavilion.

526
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,250
No need.

527
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,750
I'm unbearably obstinate.

528
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,120
It's a waste of time for me to attend lessons.

529
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,840
You misunderstood.

530
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,570
You left your qin at my place.

531
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,190
It's occupying my space.

532
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,670
I just want you to get your qin.

533
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,300
Thank you, sir.

534
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,020
Goodbye.

535
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,360
Did you really think

536
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,420
I brought you here just for your qin?

537
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,420
Of course.

538
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:00,820
Apply some medicine.

539
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,310
It's fine to be reckless.

540
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,580
But you're badly injured.

541
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,820
You need to apply some medicine.

542
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:15,810
Wait.

543
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,950
Clean your hands first.

544
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,400
Wipe your hands.

545
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,700
Your hand.

546
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,670
Are you still angry?

547
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,950
I dare not.

548
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,560
Yesterday,

549
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,070
I was affected by the white cat.

550
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,120
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you

551
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,670
or scolded you.

552
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,230
And about last night,

553
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,510
I know you said those things

554
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,930
because you were worried about Yan Lin.

555
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,860
I shouldn't have said what I said.

556
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,920
It's only fair that you're angry.

557
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,060
Are you

558
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,130
admitting that you're wrong?

559
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,330
I knew that the jade ruyi scepter matter

560
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,030
was targeting the Yan family.

561
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,710
So I was in a bad mood

562
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,460
and vented my anger at you.

563
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,150
I called you here today

564
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,400
to tell you that

565
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,670
I will handle the jade ruyi scepter matter.

566
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:46,940
Besides,

567
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,350
Yan Lin tried every means to get you into the palace

568
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,050
because he wanted you to learn some real skills.

569
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,550
You are like an unrefined jade.

570
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,920
It would be a pity

571
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,220
not to refine and polish you.

572
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:58,680
Unrefined jade?

573
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,230
What makes you think that I'm an unrefined jade?

574
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,180
Back then, on the way to the capital,

575
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,570
a young girl

576
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,660
was neither afraid of robbers

577
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,590
[Four years ago]

578
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,400
nor afraid of escaping into the wilderness.

579
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,750
Even when she was trapped

580
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,660
and in danger, she was not afraid.

581
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,410
She smashed the qin and drew her blood.

582
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,680
With her stubbornness,

583
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,490
she did everything

584
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,650
to save me, a weak scholar.

585
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,980
Jiang Xuening.

586
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,380
I've seen what you were like.

587
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,660
I had expectations.

588
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,810
So I was disappointed.

589
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,500
Disappointed?

590
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,400
After I came to the capital,

591
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,210
I once visited the Jiang Mansion

592
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,260
and saw you in brocade clothes.

593
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,370
[Four years ago]

594
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,210
Just because you were unhappy,

595
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,500
you scolded and punished

596
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,340
a young servant who was about your age.

597
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,990
Miss Xuening, I'm sorry.

598
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,720
I was wrong.

599
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,170
You failed at such a small task.

600
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,120
Stop crying.

601
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,060
All you do is cry.

602
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,780
If you keep crying,

603
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,580
I'll sell you off.

604
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,750
Your gaze became unfamiliar.

605
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,500
You even made me suspect

606
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,700
that what happened on our way to the capital

607
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,840
didn't actually happen.

608
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,280
After that,

609
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,530
I heard that you became even more unruly

610
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,280
and rampant.

611
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:16,990
At that time, I thought,

612
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,920
the prosperity in the capital

613
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,570
truly did change people for the worse.

614
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,090
Gradually,

615
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,850
it erased

616
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,790
your past self and spirit from you.

617
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,750
So,

618
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,650
you hated me back then.

619
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,450
It wasn't exactly hate.

620
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,720
It was more like pity.

621
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,100
Sometimes people may go astray.

622
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,070
But if someone could step in

623
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,560
and teach you to tell the good from the bad,

624
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,270
you could still return to the right path

625
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,330
and regain your true self.

626
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,830
I found it a pity that you had changed.

627
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,230
But it was also a pity that no one was there to guide you.

628
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,160
But now it seems

629
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,700
your nature hasn't changed.

630
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,050
Your kindness is still there.

631
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,880
Although

632
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,870
you're still short-tempered,

633
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,800
but you're doing better than in previous years.

634
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,860
I guess...

635
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,960
You're still considered an unrefined jade.

636
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,810
So, are you willing to

637
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,450
learn qin here tomorrow?

638
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,290
Ning Er!

639
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,070
I'm not angry anymore.

640
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,870
With your naughty temper,

641
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,950
who can handle you in the future?

642
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,590
You don't have to worry about that.

643
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,500
We'll leave future matters

644
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,500
for the future.

645
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,190
Don't do it again.

646
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,460
[Wenzhao Pavilion]

647
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,600
This traitor actually makes

648
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,950
a pretty decent teacher.

649
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,130
Miss Jiang.

650
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,440
Your Highness.

651
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,210
Are you looking for Her Highness?

652
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,260
-She...
-No.

653
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,460
I'm here for you.

654
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,670
Miss Jiang,

655
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,910
I don't know what happened

656
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,650
between you and Yan Lin,

657
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,040
but he's been acting strangely lately.

658
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,100
He used to be the most free-spirited person I know.

659
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,310
But now,

660
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
he's depressed.

661
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,890
He wouldn't tell me anything when I asked him about it.

662
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,270
So I can only ask you.

663
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,890
There are many things in this world

664
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,530
that are difficult to tell others.

665
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,410
If it's convenient for you,

666
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,440
I would like to ask you to pass a message to Yan Lin.

667
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,660
Just tell him that

668
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,270
strong wind shows the strength of grass,

669
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,960
and clouds will part to reveal the moon's glow.

670
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,610
For some matters,

671
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,930
as long as he can keep calm,

672
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,570
things will change for the better.

673
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,700
How ridiculous...

674
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,550
Mr. Wang.

675
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,770
Miss Xue.

676
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,490
Greetings, Miss Xue.

677
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,380
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Wang.

678
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,580
The study partners each have

679
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,220
different levels of knowledge mastery.

680
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,780
But you have to teach them together.

681
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,250
It's not an easy task.

682
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,980
When I go home and meet my father,

683
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,210
I'll surely tell him about your difficulties and hard work.

684
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,080
Thank you, Miss Xue.

685
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,910
I deeply appreciate that.

686
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,910
But there is one thing you may not know.

687
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,470
During class today,

688
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,090
Junior Preceptor Xie tossed the

689
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,990
Book of Etiquettes out of the hall.

690
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:28,500
This...

691
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,410
Why did he...

692
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,340
That's right.

693
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,590
Junior Preceptor Xie is highly valued by His Majesty.

694
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,400
He has always been gentle towards others.

695
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,420
Why did he act so strangely today?

696
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,270
After thinking about it,

697
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,830
there's only one possibility.

698
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,870
Someone hates you

699
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,440
and made a false complaint about you

700
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,080
to sow discord between the two of you.

701
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,810
You mean...

702
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,700
Jiang Xuening?

703
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,860
That is just my guess.

704
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,210
But speaking of which,

705
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,640
some disobedient individuals

706
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,870
may not be suitable study partners in the palace.

707
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,480
If they insist on staying,

708
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,730
not only will you get angry and damage your health,

709
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,240
but we won't be able to find peace either.

710
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,530
Don't you think so?

711
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,710
It's all gone.

712
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,560
How could this happen?

713
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,500
The camp equipment and supplies

714
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,730
were managed by Zhao Guang.

715
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,690
Where is he?

716
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,440
He is nowhere to be seen.

717
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,670
I've sent someone to look for him.

718
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,000
General,

719
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,670
we have searched the entire camp.

720
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,800
No trace of Zhao Guang was found.

721
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,820
Did he flee to escape punishment?

722
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,000
Send someone to search for him immediately.

723
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,310
Bring him back no matter what.

724
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,230
Yes.

725
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,570
Jiang Xuening.

726
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,300
Do you feel

727
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,990
better today?

728
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,360
You are like an unrefined jade.

729
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,830
It would be a pity

730
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,940
not to refine and polish you.

731
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,940
I offended you yesterday.

732
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,490
Please forgive and enlighten me.

733
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,090
At least you know your mistakes.

734
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,870
In that case,

735
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,490
recite for everyone

736
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,070
the Book of Etiquettes chapter

737
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,960
that I talked about yesterday.

738
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,870
Why is he still talking about the Book of Etiquettes?

739
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,210
The book is already gone.

740
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,010
He didn't mention anything about reciting it yesterday.

741
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,180
It's understandable

742
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,730
if others cannot recite it.

743
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,020
But Miss Jiang claims to be talented

744
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,290
and knowledgeable beyond means.

745
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,280
You wouldn't even

746
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,940
listen to my lesson.

747
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,280
I guess you must have memorized it.

748
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,560
Mr. Wang,

749
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,310
I can't recite it.

750
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,450
First, in Mr. Zhao's class,

751
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,110
you said you couldn't understand the books.

752
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,530
Then, in my class,

753
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,140
you refused to listen to my lesson.

754
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,340
You always talked back to the scholars.

755
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,080
I thought you were inevitably arrogant

756
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,980
because you were talented.

757
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,540
However,

758
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,930
you couldn't even recite

759
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,500
such a short chapter of text.

760
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,180
Turns out, you're actually an empty-headed fool.

761
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,330
Mr. Wang, you've gone too far.

762
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,090
-Ning is not…
-Your Highness.

763
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,540
The job of a study partner

764
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,530
is to study knowledge and learn

765
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,690
etiquettes with you.

766
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,150
Back then,

767
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,930
when I taught the former emperor,

768
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,260
he respected his teacher

769
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,430
and never disobeyed me.

770
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,000
Are you going to stray from the behavior

771
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,310
exemplified by the former emperor?

772
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,320
You...

773
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,150
Your Highness.

774
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,630
No need to argue for me.

775
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,410
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

776
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,380
Fine.

777
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,040
Today,

778
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,620
on behalf of the scholars of the Hanlin Academy,

779
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,930
I will punish you for your insolence.

780
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,680
If you do it again,

781
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,180
you will be severely punished.

782
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,830
That stupid old man Wang Ji

783
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,030
was obviously picking a fight.

784
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,690
He even mentioned the former emperor to shut me up.

785
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,070
How outrageous!

786
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,680
I must get back at him for this.

787
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,590
Your Highness, please be gentler.

788
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,970
I was beaten a lot at home.

789
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,460
This is nothing.

790
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,310
Your home is a different matter.

791
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,760
But here, you're under my protection.

792
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,320
This won't do.

793
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll find Mother right now

794
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,200
and ask her to kick Wang Jiu out of the palace.

795
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,560
Ning,

796
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,040
can Her Highness really kick Mr. Wang out?

797
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,850
Wang Jiu once taught the former emperor.

798
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:51,970
Although he's a bit old-fashioned,

799
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,150
he is the most senior scholar of Hanlin Academy.

800
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,090
It's not that easy.

801
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,810
But my father told me

802
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,620
he never taught any proper lessons.

803
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,510
It's all because Lord Pingnan killed many

804
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,600
Hanlin scholars during his rebellion

805
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,250
that he became the most senior one.

806
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,330
It's useless to know this now.

807
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,010
Mr. Wang told me to write a poem.

808
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,050
He said he wanted to check it this afternoon.

809
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,230
I can't write proper poems.

810
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,710
Let's think about how to deal with it first.

811
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,460
If you're troubled by something,

812
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,969
you should consult divination.

813
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,340
Gosh.

814
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:30,489
What's wrong?

815
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,150
Tell me.

816
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,540
This is a villain's fortune.

817
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,260
According to the divination,

818
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,320
Mr. Wang picked on you

819
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,969
because you offended someone.

820
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,340
Ning!

821
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,120
It can't be

822
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,080
him, right?

823
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,110
What a coincidence.

824
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,750
Jie, the color of your clothes

825
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,560
is Shu's favorite color.

826
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,200
Looking at how youthful you both are,

827
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,910
I really feel old now.

828
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,460
Your Highness,

829
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,560
this is dendrobium ginseng tea.

830
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,870
It's good for your health.

831
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,370
It's most suitable

832
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,560
for autumn and winter.

833
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:38,990
Thank you.

834
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,500
Jie.

835
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,140
You're not usually

836
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,840
this quiet.

837
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,520
Mother,

838
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,080
I think

839
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,940
we don't need to talk

840
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,700
if we have nothing to talk about.

841
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,560
No need to force it.

842
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:01,980
I have an appointment with Yan Lin.

843
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,010
I shall take my leave.

844
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:03,810
Sit down.

845
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,580
Mother! Mother.

846
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,850
Why are you in such a hurry?

847
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,870
How inappropriate.

848
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,010
What is it?

849
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,760
I...

850
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,190
I'm here for my brother.

851
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,470
Shu is here too?

852
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,770
Brother.

853
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,350
You can't do this.

854
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,940
Shu is not married yet.

855
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,260
It's inappropriate for you two

856
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,010
to be here together.

857
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,770
They grew up together

858
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,790
and we're family.

859
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,360
What's inappropriate about it?

860
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,770
Mother.

861
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,690
Mr. Wang said,

862
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,110
there is order in Yin and Yang. Men are superior to women.

863
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,750
This has been the etiquette since ancient times.

864
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,530
Mr. Wang also said

865
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,160
men and women above age seven can't sit together.

866
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,850
Women in the harem are not allowed to interfere in politics.

867
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,500
That old fool Wang Jiu..

868
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,710
He's teaching such ridiculous things.

869
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,340
Guards.

870
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,730
Aunt.

871
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,560
Mr. Wang is the chief of Hanlin Academy.

872
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,060
A few days ago, he even mentioned the matter of

873
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,490
appointing the Crown Prince to His Majesty.

874
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,050
What Crown Prince?

875
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:02,920
Mother.

876
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,690
Zhiyi and I will take our leave first.

877
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,050
We shan't disturb your teatime.

878
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:06,910
Let's go.

879
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,060
[Yingchun Pavilion]

880
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,460
[Wenzhao Pavilion]

881
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,010
What's wrong?

882
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,080
Greetings, sir.

883
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,150
What are you doing?

884
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,950
Even if you don't want to learn, you don't have to do this.

885
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,030
I know I'm mischievous and unruly,

886
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,550
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

887
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,620
Please be generous and forgive me.

888
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,560
Don't let the teachers pick on me anymore.

889
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,510
What do you mean?

890
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:19,890
So,

891
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,230
it really wasn't you.

892
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,730
What happened?

893
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,670
Tell me the details.

894
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,180
Brother,

895
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,940
you have to thank me this time.

896
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,160
If it weren't for my brilliance,

897
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,590
you would have lost your reputation.

898
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,420
What nonsense are you saying?

899
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,990
I think you're learning all the wrong things.

900
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,110
Oh no.

901
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,390
It's all your fault.

902
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,740
I promised Ning to kick Wang Jiu out.

903
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,720
She must think I broke my promise.

904
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,640
So, not only did Wang Jiu

905
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,340
lie to everyone by switching the

906
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,550
study partners' textbooks without permission,

907
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,470
he even exacted revenge in private.

908
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,260
And that Zhao Yanhong

909
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,690
panders to authority and takes advantage of others.

910
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,100
Both of them have no dignity or morality to speak of.

911
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,420
Hanlin Academy

912
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,730
cannot keep these sorts of people around.

913
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,980
But I noticed recently that

914
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,590
Wang Jiu and the others

915
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,650
seem particularly respectful towards Xue Shu.

916
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,820
Do you think

917
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,570
this is the Xue family’s idea?

918
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,620
Even you found out about their relationship?

919
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,050
What do you mean even me?

920
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,720
Half a month ago,

921
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,820
Wang Jiu and Zhao Yanhong

922
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,020
helped the Duke of Xue draft a memorial.

923
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,870
It was about appointing the Crown Prince.

924
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,320
Fortunately, the Xue family

925
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,470
offended His Majesty because of the Raw Silk Case.

926
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,850
So, this matter was put on the back burner.

927
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,270
The Xue family befriended

928
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,010
the ministers of the six ministries outside the court

929
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,600
and planted spies in the palace.

930
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,380
They have already secured a firm footing.

931
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,100
Now in the court,

932
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,100
only the Marquis of Yan is loyal to the country

933
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,400
and can stand against them.

934
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,080
So the Yan family is a thorn in the flesh

935
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,380
that the Xue family wants to get rid of?

936
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,400
That's right.

937
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,130
However, the Yan family has a high reputation among soldiers.

938
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,860
Currently, the State of Qian

939
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,090
is being targeted by the State of Yue's armies in the north.

940
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,060
Lord Pingnan has been wreaking havoc in the south for years.

941
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,930
If the Xue family wants to harm the Yan family,

942
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,660
they will need more than some petty charges.

943
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,120
That's why they decided

944
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,800
to collude with the rebels.

945
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,880
I see.

946
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,020
No wonder they let Zhou Yinzhi into the Yan Mansion

947
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,990
to steal Marquis of Yan's handwritten letter

948
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,140
and forge a letter addressed to the rebels.

949
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,820
But His Majesty has handed the Rebels Case

950
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,810
to the Ministry of Justice,

951
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,790
and you used the Raw Silk Case to trap Xue Yuan.

952
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,110
The situation is not that bad.

953
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,520
But I don't understand.

954
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,550
I'm just a study partner.

955
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,950
I'm not outstanding either.

956
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,700
Why did the Xue family use the Hanlin Academy

957
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,530
to target me?

958
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,960
I was just rambling

959
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,070
and making wild guesses.

960
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,070
Please forgive me.

961
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,730
This mouth of mine will be the death of me one day.

962
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,190
Although your intelligence is mediocre

963
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,290
and you're not outstanding,

964
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,730
but...

965
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,610
Didn't you say Wang Jiu wanted you to write a poem?

966
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,220
I happen to have one.

967
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,860
When it's time, give this to him

968
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,180
and tell him you wrote it.

969
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,630
Let's see what he will say then.

970
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,990
The moon is as bright as jade.

971
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,840
The empty mountains cannot tell flowers apart.

972
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,580
The clouds cast a shadow over them.

973
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,350
The wind blows and sways a hundred stalks with it.

974
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,280
It's so well written.

975
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,580
Will Mr. Wang believe that I wrote it?

976
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,890
It doesn't matter if he believes it or not.

977
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,490
Just say

978
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,060
you wrote it yourself.

979
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,690
Sir, are you...

980
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,520
trying to help me?

981
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,870
In your dreams.

982
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,360
I'm the Crown Prince's Junior Preceptor.

983
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,290
My job is to remove the Xue family's

984
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,760
eyes and ears from Hanlin Academy.

985
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,830
It just so happens

986
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,510
that your matter helps my cause too.

987
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,870
As for you,

988
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,750
you always wanted to leave the palace.

989
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,930
Why don't you take this opportunity

990
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,520
to leave the palace?

991
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,290
It's true that I don't like the palace.

992
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,300
But this is the highest peak.

993
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,450
Only by studying hard

994
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,010
and becoming better,

995
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,950
can I help the Yan family

996
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,250
and Yan Lin.

997
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,230
I will leave sooner or later.

998
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,360
But I hope I can leave without regret.

999
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,220
If I want to reverse my fate,

1000
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,100
I can't possibly give up halfway.

1001
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,660
Reverse fate...

1002
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,180
I'll copy the poem now.

1003
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,100
Wait.

1004
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,460
It's not serious.

1005
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,000
It's just that...

1006
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,140
Baoying didn't want it to hurt,

1007
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,040
so she wrapped it thicker than necessary.

1008
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,330
The palace has rules for paper types.

1009
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,670
The papers from the Imperial Household Department

1010
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,430
are Bingyi paper and Bailu paper.

1011
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,750
The papers I use here

1012
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,790
are from the palace's Chengxin Hall.

1013
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,100
Memorize this poem

1014
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,410
and write it down when you go back.

1015
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,060
This way, you won't get caught

1016
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:01,740
and cause trouble.

1017
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,060
You are indeed a rebel.

1018
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,870
You didn't miss such a detail.

1019
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,240
Do you hear me?

1020
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,040
You're right.

1021
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,920
I'll memorize it now.
