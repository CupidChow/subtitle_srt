8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,610
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,920
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,680
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,400
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

only you, Sir, can help me.

Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

But I'm the only one who can't.

19

Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,060
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,870
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,590
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,530
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,540
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,870
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,440

Can't you at least play one note right?

37
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,150
I've been playing for hours.

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,590
I can't even feel my fingers,

39

let alone feel the strings.

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,420
You only practice when you're in the mood.

41
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,990
I'm afraid even if you keep learning until you're eighty,

42
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,090
you won't be able to play half as well as I do.

43
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,340
Alright.

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,580
That's all for today.

45
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,360
Come and sit beside me.

46
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,540
Does it still hurt?

47
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,310
It didn't hurt,

48
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,100
but after I heard you play,

49
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,880
it hurt so much that I doubted it would ever recover.

50
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,780
Now,

51
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:22,000
you know me inside and out.

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,510
You've seen me for who I am

What do you think?

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,310
Are you still afraid of me?

56
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,829
All I know

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,780
is that the man in front of me is Xie Ju'an.

I heard what Lord Pingnan said before he died.

67

I'm afraid the capital is no longer safe.

68
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,750
I've reported to the court that Lord Pingnan has been killed.

71
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,370
But we need a long-term solution.

72
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,940
We'll return to the capital sooner or later.

73
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,620
Actually, there's a question I've wanted to ask you.

74
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,570
Will you stage a coup?

75
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,140
Why do you care so much about that?

76
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm just worried that you'll land Yan Lin in hot water

77
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,750
and I don't want Her Highness to be upset.

To be honest,

102
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,909
I never thought that one day, I could really…

103
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,470
I could really be free of Lord Pingnan's control.

188
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,280
to help us.

189
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,530
First Young Lady can see what's at stake.

190
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,480
She needs someone to back her up in the court.

191
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,320
Working with us is a win-win.

192
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,700
She has no reason not to agree.

193
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,680
Zhang Zhe

194
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,010
will arrive in Yuzhou very soon.

195
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,700
If he can bring Xie Wei back…

196
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,670
Where is Zhou Yinzhi now?

197
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,850
I've sent for him.

198
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,810
He'll be here soon.

199
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,090
I'm Zhou Yinzhi.

200
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,160
Greetings, My Lord.

201
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,330
How is the investigation going?

202
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,120
My Lord,

203
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,480
I've conducted a thorough search in secret,

204
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,050
but Mr. Dingfei is nowhere to be found.

205
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,820
After making inquiries, I learned

206
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,220
that the last time he was seen,

207
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,450
he was in Cengxiao Restaurant.

208
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,330
That day,

209
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,820
some mysterious people from the south

210
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,840
went to Cengxiao Restaurant too.

211
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,950
No one knows why they were there.

212
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,210
So I suspect

213
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,700
that those people abducted Mr. Dingfei.

214
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,960
My Lord, don't worry.

215
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,150
I'll do my best

216
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,300
and bring him back for you.

217
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,160
No need.

218
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Don't mention

219
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,510
this matter to anyone.

220
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,980
As for Xue Dingfei,

221
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,460
I've got other plans.

222
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,150
Yes.

223
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,780
There's one other thing I want to ask you about.

224
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,760
How much do you know

225
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,630
about Xie Wei?

226
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,230
My Lord, there must be some misunderstanding.

227
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,550
Xie Wei is just a casual acquaintance.

228
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,040
I don't work for him.

229
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,840
I've pledged my loyalty

230
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,110
to you.

231
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,770
So under no circumstances will I betray you.

232
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,780
My Lord, please don't doubt me.

233
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Enough.

234
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,820
I didn't say you work for him.

235
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,380
You had dealings with Xie Wei in the past.

236
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,340
So more or less, you should

237
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,860
know something about him.

238
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,490
You know I need to deal with Xie Wei.

239
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,040
I don't keep useless men.

240
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,790
You know that too.

241
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,950
If you can't be of any help…

242
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,070
I remember now.

243
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,930
All the people Xie Wei cares about have left the capital,

244
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,080
except one person.

245
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,860
[Lyu Mansion]

246
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,330
Yes. There's one person left.

247
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,130
Although she seems ordinary,

248
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,380
she's on good terms with Jiang Xuening.

249
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,590
And Jiang Xuening is very close to Xie Wei.

250
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,270
My Lord,

251
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,470
I promise to get evidence against Xie Wei

252
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,820
out of that person.

253
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,130
Mr. Zhou.

254
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,570
What are you doing?

255
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,480
Madam Lyu.

256
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,990
I apologize for my rudeness.

257
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,080
Mr. Zhou.

258
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,660
You need a proper reason to arrest me.

259
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,150
What have I done wrong?

260
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,160
This is the way Xingwu Guards do things.

261
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,800
No matter what you want to say,

262
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,230
you can say it in the prison.

263
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,940
Take her away.

264
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,400
Wait.

265
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,290
-You have no reason to arrest me!
-Madam!

266
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,760
-Let go of me!
-Madam.

267
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,050
What do you want?

268
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,130
Are you leaving tomorrow?

269
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,540
If I hadn't got injured,

270
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,480
I'd have long left for Yuzhou.

271
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,250
By the way,

272
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,140
thank you for your help.

273
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,230
You seldom say thank you.

274
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,330
I'll just accept your gratitude.

275
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,790
After all, I'm not likely to hear you thank me again.

276
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,230
Have you made up your mind

277
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,880
to part ways with us?

278
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,600
The journey ahead of you is dangerous.

279
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,270
Why should I join you?

280
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,630
Let's say goodbye here.

281
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,080
It's good this way.

282
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,110
I once said

283
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,740
after everything is settled,

284
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,990
you can keep using

285
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,230
the name Xue Dingfei.

286
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,030
But I wonder

287
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,620
if you still want that name now.

288
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,010
Actually, I'm always aware

289
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,920
that the name Xue Dingfei

290
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,470
is a thorn in your side.

291
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,890
You must feel very bad

292
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,050
every time someone calls me that.

293
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,190
Is that the reason

294
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,450
why you don't like me?

295
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,460
When we were young,

296
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,510
it did annoy me.

297
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,940
No wonder you were mean to me those years.

298
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,150
I knew it.

299
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,880
There's no way I was that annoying.

300
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,120
But you were not very likable either.

301
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,070
Don't say it out loud.

302
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,620
It's hurtful.

303
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,990
Xie Wei.

304
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,140
We've been tied to each other for 20 years.

305
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,600
After all those ups and downs,

306
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,720
are we brothers now?

307
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,460
Being my brother

308
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,330
means being in danger.

309
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,820
Aren't you afraid?

310
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,370
I am.

311
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,360
When I was with you,

312
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
nothing good happened.

313
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,620
Maybe

314
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,670
I should stay away from you.

315
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,620
After being controlled for 20 years,

316
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,660
you're finally free now.

317
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,400
Let's have a toast with tea.

318
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,370
Here is to

319
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,170
your freedom

320
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,520
and carefree life.

321
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,210
To my freedom.

322
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,570
Father.

323
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,680
I'm glad you got back safely.

324
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,360
Let me see.

325
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,230
How's Ju'an's injury?

326
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,190
Has it almost healed?

327
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,080
Marquis Yan, don't worry.

328
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,550
I'm fine.

329
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,410
Xie Ju'an.

330
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,920
How could you?

331
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,260
How could you put your life at risk like that?

332
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,030
Weren't you afraid…

333
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,110
Of death?

334
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,250
I am now.

335
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,950
Xuening.

336
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,380
You've gone through a lot too.

337
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,790
I failed to protect you that day.

338
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,380
Marquis Yan, please don't say that.

339
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,580
I should thank you.

340
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,260
It was Yan's troops that saved me.

341
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,320
Lord Pingnan and his minions have been eliminated.

342
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,670
I've reported it to the court

343
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,700
and explained everything.

344
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,560
I believe His Majesty

345
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,260
will forgive us

346
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,540
for deploying the troops.

347
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,500
Report!

348
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,650
General.

349
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,500
His Majesty's special envoy, Mr. Zhang Zhe, is here.

350
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,340
What will be will be.

351
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,830
Let's find out

352
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,280
what the imperial edict says.

353
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,390
Mr. Zhang, you came all the way from the capital.

354
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,720
Sorry that I couldn't make time to receive you properly.

355
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,860
Please forgive me.

356
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,310
I'm just here

357
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,310
to convey His Majesty's message.

358
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,890
There's nothing to forgive, Junior Preceptor Xie.

359
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,250
Here is the imperial edict.

360
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,480
By the will of Heaven, His Majesty speaks,

361
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,080
"I'm pleased to know about the great victory at the border.

362
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,260
Marquis Yan and his son led Yan's troops to successfully suppress the rebellion.

363
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,700
On my behalf, Zhang Zhe shall give them commendation

364
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,450
and reward the soldiers.

365
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,940
Junior Preceptor Xie Wei devised brilliant strategies

366
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,090
and made great contributions too.

367
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,610
I'll reward him myself after he returns to the capital."

368
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,300
All hail His Majesty.

369
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,430
General Yan.

370
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,950
The imperial edict is just half the message His Majesty wants to convey.

371
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,530
I'll tell you the other half now.

372
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,590
His Majesty hopes that Junior Preceptor Xie

373
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,600
and Viscount Yan can escort the princess back to the capital

374
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,020
and present yourselves to him.

375
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,610
No matter what grievances you have,

376
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,600
you can tell His Majesty then.

377
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,120
Yan's troops

378
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,910
shall retreat to the border

379
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,400
and continue to defend the State of Qian.

380
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,380
His Majesty cares for every one of you.

381
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,700
Please don't let him down.

382
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,020
I don't mean

383
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,410
to defy His Majesty,

384
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,950
but my wound hasn't healed yet.

385
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,780
I can't set off for the capital immediately.

386
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,050
So, Mr. Zhang,

387
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,700
please stay in Yuzhou for a few days.

388
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,530
Mr. Zhang, you came all the way here

389
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,490
and must be tired.

390
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,740
Stay here for a few days and have a good rest.

391
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,460
It's inconvenient to stay at the camp.

392
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,850
So I've prepared a place in town

393
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,640
where you can stay.

394
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,010
Her Highness is already there.

395
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,860
Why don't you all go to town and have some rest first?

396
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,990
We can

397
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,420
discuss everything else later.

398
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,460
Okay.

399
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,220
Thank you, General Yan.

400
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,600
-Ning.
-Your Highness.

401
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,500
Ning.

402
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,870
Your Highness.

403
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,960
You scared me.

404
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,930
I'm fine, Your Highness.

405
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,620
I came back unscathed.

406
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,670
When you go out in the future, you must bring enough guards with you.

407
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,180
Don't go out alone.

408
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,980
Got it.

409
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,360
I'm Zhang Zhe from the Ministry of Justice. Greetings, Your Highness.

410
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,580
Mr. Zhang?

411
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,500
I'm here on His Majesty's order.

412
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,670
Besides rewarding the troops,

413
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,700
His Majesty also wants you

414
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,090
to return to the capital as soon as possible.

415
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,810
We've all traveled a long way.

416
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,060
Let's get some rest first.

417
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,340
We can get down to business later.

418
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,520
Yes.

419
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,490
There's no rush.

420
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,630
There are enough servants in the mansion.

421
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,430
Let them know if you need anything.

422
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,780
I'll have more soldiers guard this place.

423
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,500
You'll be safe here.

424
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,530
Come.

425
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,030
Let's go.

426
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,760
Ning, tell me everything

427
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,420
you've been through along the way.

428
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,880
It's gonna be a long story.

429
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,470
Then let's talk all night.

430
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,830
I have a lot to tell you after all that's happened.

431
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,660
You almost lost the battle at Guiyi Heights?

432
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,890
We rolled the dice like we did so many times before.

433
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,060
Fortunately,

434
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,590
fate was on our side this time.

435
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,410
Ning, promise me

436
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,140
to stay safe.

437
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,010
Okay. I promise you.

438
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,210
The imperial edict has arrived.

439
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,430
We may go back to the capital very soon.

440
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,460
Are you happy, Your Highness?

441
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,570
When Princess Leyang left the capital,

442
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,120
she had lost all faith in her family.

443
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,310
Now that the State of Yue is no longer a threat

444
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,570
and the northern territories are in the clear,

445
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,120
she's fulfilled her duty.

446
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,950
Now, I'm just Shen Zhiyi.

447
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,100
I've had enough of the royal family's hypocrisy.

448
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,690
If I could,

449
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,280
I'd rather never go back to that cage.

450
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,710
How about you, Ning?

451
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,640
What are you and Mr. Xie gonna do?

452
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,330
I won't comment on his feelings for you.

453
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,630
I'm just a little worried.

454
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,840
You're spontaneous by nature.

455
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,110
But Mr. Xie is the opposite.

456
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,420
He's scheming and manipulative.

457
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,220
Loving such a dangerous man

458
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,420
will be exhausting.

459
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,880
Have you thought it through?

460
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,750
If there had been an easy way,

461
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,360
he wouldn't have chosen a path

462
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,090
that was full of dangers and traps.

463
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,840
You don't know him, Your Highness.

464
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,070
All these years,

465
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,070
life has not been easy for him.

466
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,910
People respect and fear him,

467
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,170
but I feel sorry for him.

468
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,410
I don't know what the future will be like.

469
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,620
All I know is that I don't want him to be alone anymore.

470
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,570
You're in love.

471
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,030
Yes, I am.

472
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,210
Is there anything you can do about it, Your Highness?

473
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,650
If you ask me,

474
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,660
I wish

475
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,100
there were a magic potion that can make you fall out of love.

476
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,310
Once you drink it,

477
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,610
you'll forget everything about him.

478
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,360
When love is gone, so are your worries.

479
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,780
But how can I forget

480
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,580
someone like him?

481
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,020
Your Highness.

482
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,310
Sometimes I wonder

483
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,490
whether I'm wrong.

484
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,230
What do you mean?

485
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,650
A long time ago,

486
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,180
I chose the wrong path,

487
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,470
made many mistakes,

488
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,310
and got what I deserved.

489
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,960
Later, I got a chance to start all over,

490
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,420
so I tried my best to change things

491
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,260
and make up for my mistakes.

492
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,080
I've done a lot by now

493
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,380
and it seems I've corrected some mistakes,

494
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,770
but I'm a bit scared.

495
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,570
Scared of what?

496
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,720
All this time,

497
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,320
I've been trying to change things

498
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,000
in a way that I think is good.

499
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,800
But what I think is good

500
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,050
may be bad

501
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,270
for other people, right?

502
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,420
What if their lives

503
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,780
could've been better?

504
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,490
You think too much.

505
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,530
You're always thinking

506
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,890
and end up confused.

507
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,450
Ning, believe in yourself.

508
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,690
You need to believe that everything happens for a reason.

509
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,770
Believe in yourself

510
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,440
and always live in the moment.

511
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,430
Your Highness, you have great wisdom.

512
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,340
What do you think

513
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,890
the imperial edict means?

514
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,250
Are we really going back to the capital?

515
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,280
A war has been fought.

516
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,560
Even if His Majesty is willing to let it slide,

517
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,060
Xue Yuan won't agree.

518
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,330
Whether we go back to the capital or not,

519
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,920
the Xue family won't just stand aside.

520
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,400
Why don't we just lead the army back to the capital

521
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,790
and eliminate the Xue family

522
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,710
in the name of cleansing the court of sycophants?

523
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,050
The court has doubted our intentions.

524
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,300
If we lead the army back,

525
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,260
we're very likely to be accused of mutiny.

526
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,960
If that happens,

527
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,320
things will only be worse.

528
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,470
Unless we have no other choices,

529
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,980
we can't do that.

530
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,810
Mr. Xie.

531
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,180
Here is the new qin you asked for.

532
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,590
Why hasn't Ning'er come to learn the qin today?

533
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,050
Miss Jiang and the princess talked the whole night.

534
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,240
Maybe she's too tired today.

535
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,500
I'll ask her about it later.

536
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,870
Since you're going to meet Miss Jiang,

537
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,130
I'll take my leave.

538
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,930
Has it ever occurred to you

539
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,890
that Miss Jiang can't play the qin well

540
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,050
not because the previous qin is bad?

541
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,030
A new qin won't be of much help.

542
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,350
If I teach her patiently,

543
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,900
she'll be good at it one day.

544
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,290
If she isn't,

545
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,590
the problem must be with me.

546
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,610
Look.

547
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,220
He's so defensive of her.

548
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,100
What?

549
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,020
Do you have a problem?

550
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,900
No. Of course not.

551
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,950
I'll take my leave.

552
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,320
The store-bought qin

553
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,310
is not comparable to the ones I made myself.

554
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,970
But I'll make do with it.

555
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,980
When I have free time,

556
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,790
I'll make a qin for Ning'er myself.

557
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,510
Yes.

558
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,330
He came all alone.

559
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,110
It seemed that he anticipated everything and got a perfect plan,

560
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,830
but in fact, he was putting himself in danger and taking a chance.

561
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,390
He was only so crazy and daring

562
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,590
because of you.

563
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,330
Now,

564
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,450
you know me inside and out.

565
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,040
You've seen me for who I am

566
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,750
without any disguise.

567
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,670
What do you think?

568
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,670
Are you still afraid of me?

569
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,910
Ning, believe in yourself

570
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,960
and always live in the moment.

571
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,410
-After we parted that day…
-After we parted that day…

572
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,510
Since we parted at Lord Linzi's mansion,

573
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,650
a long time has passed.

574
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,720
How have you been?

575
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,880
I've been good.

576
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,880
Don't worry about me.

577
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,700
♫The snow is very light♫

578
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,050
What I said that day…

579
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,310
I didn't understand it at first,

580
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,010
♫It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eaves♫

581
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,450
but later, I got what you meant.

582
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,580
Those words sounded harsh,

583
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,180
♫You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snow♫

584
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,410
but you said them for my good.

585
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,430
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

586
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,080
♫They're about to be erased now♫

587
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,190
At that time, I was bothered by vicious rumors.

588
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,610
♫Disrupting my expectations♫

589
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,580
Thank you for finding out the truth for me

590
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,400
despite our differences.

591
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,650
♫We made a promise♫

592
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,210
You stood up for me in the court.

593
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,430
I haven't thanked you for it.

594
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,420
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

595
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,670
Now that we've met,

596
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,800
thank you, Mr. Zhang.

597
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,130
♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

598
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,270
♫Without you♫

599
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:19,940
Mr. Zhang, you once said

600
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,750
♫Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winter♫

601
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,710
you love watching the rain.

602
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,070
You must be in a good mood today.

603
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,790
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

604
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,910
There are different kinds of rain too.

605
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,050
♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

606
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,540
When the rain pours down,

607
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
it carries too much impact

608
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,140
and makes people uncomfortable.

609
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:39,070
♫We made a promise, yet we are only left with our memory♫

610
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,840
This kind of rain is the best.

611
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,910
♫Snow covers the street once more♫

612
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,380
♫My heart freezes into a cocoon♫

613
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,600
It causes ripples on water surfaces

614
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,490
and makes every place it falls on glisten.

615
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,390
♫The seasons repeat ruthlessly♫

616
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,130
It's like a small twist in life.

617
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,830
You'll see its worth after you've been through it.

618
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,500
♫Stealing my heart slowly♫

619
00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:00,220
♫I forgot I've never been sure when♫

620
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,180
♫I'll break the cocoon and become a butterfly♫

621
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,090
Have you asked her?

622
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,960
When will she come?

623
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,720
She went to see him.

624
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,930
I heard from Mr. Jiang that you moved back to the countryside.

625
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,990
I didn’t expect you

626
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,910
to be with Junior Preceptor Xie and Yan's troops.

627
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,150
No one in the capital knows that now.

628
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
But if you keep staying with the troops,

629
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,160
it won't be long before word gets back.

630
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,670
No one knows

631
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,100
what will happen to the Jiang family then.

632
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,350
You mean

633
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,740
the court may control the Jiang family

634
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,680
as a bargaining chip?

635
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,120
Now Marquis Yan and Xie Wei control the northwest of the State of Qian

636
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,720
and an army of tens of thousands is stationed in Yuzhou

637
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,750
which is only miles away from the capital.

638
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,540
Without any doubt,

639
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,120
the court feels threatened.

640
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,660
If this goes on,

641
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,560
when the court runs out of options,

642
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,580
I'm afraid the Jiang family will be their last resort.

643
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,760
Thank you for caring for the Jiang family, Mr. Zhang.

644
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,870
But I need clarification about one thing.

645
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,750
What's His Majesty's plan?

646
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,460
He claims that he wants to reward the soldiers,

647
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,030
but it sounds like an excuse to me.

648
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,160
Is he planning to trick them back to the capital

649
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,190
and then settle the score with them?

650
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,520
No one knows what His Majesty is thinking.

651
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,590
The Xue family is also a source of pressure.

652
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,810
But without Yan's troops,

653
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,170
peace wouldn't have been restored at the border.

654
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,100
If Xie Wei hadn't put his life at risk,

655
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,410
Lord Pingnan wouldn't have been killed.

656
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,990
Now that both invaders and rebels have been defeated,

657
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,810
if His Majesty turns his back on these heroes,

658
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,650
everyone who has pledged loyalty to him will be disappointed.

659
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,780
Xie Wei and the others did everything they did

660
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,230
for the State of Qian and His Majesty,

661
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,430
not for their own interests.

662
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,340
I know what you mean.

663
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,730
Xie Wei is determined to wipe out the Xue family.

664
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,580
I know that too.

665
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,310
But no matter what crime the Xue family has committed,

666
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,630
they should be judged by the Ministry of Justice according to the law.

667
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,180
What Xie Wei has done

668
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,030
is nothing short of raising an army of his own and standing against the court.

669
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,220
It's understandable that His Majesty is on guard.

670
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,290
You're not him.

671
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,150
If you'd been through what he's been through,

672
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,020
you wouldn't have said that.

673
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,550
Sorry.

674
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,930
You're just looking out for me.

675
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,890
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

676
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,050
It's fine.

677
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,440
I just hope

678
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,770
Junior Preceptor Xie and the Yan family

679
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,430
can return to the capital to meet His Majesty

680
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,460
as soon as possible.

681
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,570
As long as they return to the capital,

682
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,920
the court will see

683
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,260
their loyalty and sincerity.

684
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,230
His Majesty won't make things hard for them.

685
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,110
It's getting late.

686
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,400
The rain is beautiful,

687
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,590
but it's cold out here.

688
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,290
Don't stay here for too long.

689
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Go back and get some rest.

690
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,030
Miss Jiang.

691
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,830
I have one question for you.

692
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,130
If that day,

693
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,660
my mother hadn't had that accident,

694
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,700
would you still have let go?

695
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,840
Things have changed. So have we.

696
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,560
Since we've moved on,

697
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,840
there's no need to dwell on the past.

698
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,180
♫Wind blows gently♫

699
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,130
I once made lots of mistakes

700
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,810
because of my obsession.

701
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,260
♫The fallen flowers bloom in my heart♫

702
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,860
I'm indebted to you, Mr. Zhang.

703

I will

704
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,810
do my best to make it up to you.

705
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:28,910
But I can't help who I love.

706
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,340
♫Your whisper under the moonlight sounds beautiful♫

707
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,380

♫The season stays in dreamland♫

712
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,770
Yes.

713
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,620
I love him.

714
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,140

Miss Jiang.

720
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,550
Mr. Xie wants to see you.

721
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,600
What happened?

722
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,970
Why didn't you come to learn the qin today?

723
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,950
Where did you go?

724
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,210
Why are you all wet?

725
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,730
I stayed up late last night

726
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,200
and didn't get up until the afternoon.

727
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,720
I wanted some fresh air

728
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,940
so I went to the garden.

729
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,740
Then it rained,

730
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,160
so I watched it for a while.

731
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,100
You watched the rain alone.

732
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,100
Didn't you feel bored?

733
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,670
Not really.

734
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,470
I have something to discuss with you.

735
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,810
His Majesty urges you and Yan Lin to return to the capital.

736
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,370
His intention is unclear.

737
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,730
You should think about it carefully.

738
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,960
As for me,

739
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,470
if I keep staying here,

740
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,020
the court will find it out sooner or later.

741
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,420
The Jiang family is still in the capital, so I think…

742
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,240
You want to leave?

743
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,140
I'm not very close to them,

744
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,180
but I don't want to cause them trouble.

745
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,510
Where do you want to go?

746
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,770
I can go back to the countryside,

747
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,460
just like I planned.

748
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,830
Do you want to leave because of the Jiang family

749
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,070
or because of him?

750
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,190
Why didn't you tell me honestly

751
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,500
that you went to see Zhang Zhe?

752
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,000
What are you keeping from me?

753
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,090
I just ran into him.

754
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,670
I didn't tell you

755
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,470
because I knew you'd overreact.

756
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,650
You just ran into him?

757
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,190
You ran into him

758
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,640
and then watched the rain with him for so long?

759
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,780
I don't know what's so great about the rain.

760
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,940
It's wet and cold.

761
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,600
You can't flick it off when it falls on you.

762
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,550
The coldness seeps into your body bit by bit.

763
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,390
You may catch a cold if you're not careful enough.

764
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,760
It's not fatal,

765
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,230
but it's a constant nuisance

766
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,890
that keeps making you uncomfortable.

767
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,680
Jiang Xuening.

768
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,020
What's so interesting about watching the rain?

769
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,850
Or were you actually trying

770
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,980
to rekindle a romance with him?

771
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,870
Xie Ju'an.

772
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,880
I'm not your pet.

773
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,950
Even if I made a plan to meet him,

774
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,450
I don't have to explain it to you.

775
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,050
But you've promised to build a future with me!

776
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:01,990
Jiang Xuening.

777
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,030
♫Close your eyes before dark♫

778
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,380

♫I finally realize that I can't go back♫

783

What are you here for?

822
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,890
I got news from the camp.

823
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,300
I came to talk with Xie Ju'an.

824
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,460
Leave.

825
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:16,820
What's wrong?

826
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,140
Miss Jiang is inside.

827
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,220
So what?

828
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,540
-She can join the conversation.
-Yeah.

829
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,150
Aren't you usually the smart one?

830
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,220
Why are you

831
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,930
so dense today?

832
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,600
Are they…

833
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,520
I can't miss it.

834
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,630
Let me…

835
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,690
Move aside. Let me take a peek.

836
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,670
-Go away!
-Just a peek.

837
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,600
-Move aside.
-Go away or I'll beat you up.

838
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,310
Let me take a peek.

839
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,400
Leave now!

840
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,220
Jiang Xuening.

841
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,120
You are mine.

842
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,070
I'm not.

843
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,150
Then I'm yours.

844
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,300
Let's get married.

845
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,650
[Quheng Residence]

846
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,210
Are you up, Miss?

847
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,380
Mr. Xie sent us to serve you.

848
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,380
Miss Jiang.

849
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,700
What's this?

850
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,100
Before Mr. Xie left, he said

851
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,650
you got caught in the rain yesterday

852
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,930
and was worried that you might catch a cold.

853
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,920
So he asked Physician Zhou

854
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,930
to prepare cold medicine for you.

855
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,840
Where is he?

856
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,330
He got news from the front line

857
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,160
and went to the camp before dawn.

858
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,390
He left before dawn?

859
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,830
How quick and quiet.

860
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,650
Tell me

861
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,780
when he comes back.

862
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,840
I have something to tell him.

863
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,350
The medicine.

864
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,610
Tell him to take it himself.

865
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,440
When Yan's troops went south,

866
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,910
enough soldiers were left to guard the border.

867
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,640
So the border is quite safe.

868
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,790
But the situation we're in

869
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,190
is full of uncertainty.

870
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,180
The Xue family hasn't been eliminated yet.

871
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,940
Letting Xie Ju'an and Viscount Yan go to the capital

872
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,770
and the troops retreat to the border in the meantime

873
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,560
is not appropriate.

874
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,440
His Majesty

875
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,870
must be aware of that.

876
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,110
However,

877
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,800
the troops are stationed in Yuzhou now.

878
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,360
For those in the capital,

879
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,590
we're posing a big threat.

880
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,150
We have no intention to rise up,

881
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:34,810
but His Majesty

882
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,930
has good reason to suspect us.

883
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,480
If Ju'an and Yan Lin

884
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,010
return to the capital,

885
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,630
I'm afraid they'll be detained.

886
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,230
Even if His Majesty

887
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,430
doesn't mean to harm them,

888
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,120
the Xue family

889
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,080
may take the chance to kill them.

890
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,740
It's too dangerous.

891
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,410
Why don't we split the troops into three groups?

892
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,270
The first group

893
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,150
will retreat to the border to reassure His Majesty.

894
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,170
The second group will stay with Father

895
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,880
in Yuzhou as our backup.

896
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,210
The third group

897
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,200
are soldiers borrowed from Tongzhou.

898
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,600
They should be transferred back to Tongzhou.

899
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,550
This way,

900
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,240
they can go back to the capital with us

901
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,250
in case something happens.

902
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,370
That may work.

903
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:12,920
Ju'an.

904
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,160
What do you think?

905
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,040
Brother.

906
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,520
Xie Ju'an.

907
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,150
I'm listening.

908
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,230
Go on.

909
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,540
Are you sure you're listening?

910
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,130
Did you not sleep well last night?

911
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,940
You didn't have to get up early this morning

912
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,710
to attend this meeting.

913
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,740
I could send Yan Lin to town

914
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,440
to discuss it with you.

915
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:35,510
It's fine.

916
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,990
I don't mind coming here.

917
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,050
Go on.

918
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,360
Miss Jiang.

919
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,110
It's so late.

920
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,190
Why don't you go to bed?

921
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,560
I don't know when Mr. Xie will be back either.

922
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,080
Usually, when he left for a meeting,

923
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,780
he'd come back before noon.

924
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,320
Is he avoiding me?

925
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,760
No, he isn't.

926
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,920
If I can't see him today,

927
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,550
I won't see him ever again.

928
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,500
But…

929
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,220
It's late.

930
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,870
The front line is not safe.

931
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,320
I'll have soldiers escort you back.

932
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,940
Be careful.

933
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,000
Ju'an has something on his mind today.

934
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,830
I don't think he's here for the meeting.

935
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,140
It's more like he's here to avoid someone.

936
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,250
I was young once.

937
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,720
Some things

938
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,410
are quite obvious to me.

939
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,960
Are Ju'an and Xuening

940
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,370
in that kind of relationship?

941
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,570
These years, I've watched you

942
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,250
grow close to Xuening.

943
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,020
I know your feelings for her.

944
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,440
Unfortunately,

945
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,720
so many things have happened.

946
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,650
Do you feel bad

947
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,680
about them being together?

948
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,470
They've been through things

949
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,530
that brought them together.

950
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,660
Brother didn't steal her from me.

951
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,250
It's just that she didn't choose me.

952
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,890
She has the freedom to do that.

953
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,920
She doesn't need a reason

954
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,000
or to explain it to anyone.

955
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,930
I just want her to be happy.

956
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,370
I wish the same for Brother.

957
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,530
All these years,

958
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,650
he's suffered a lot.

959
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,600
Now he's finally met someone

960
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,760
who understands him.

961
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,900
I feel happy for him.

962
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,370
So I have no bad feelings.

963
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,320
Mr. Xie.

964
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,480
Mr. Xie, you're finally back.

965
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,030
Miss Jiang has been waiting for you all day.

966
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:16,590
She said

967
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,960
if she can't see you today,

968
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,460
she won't see you ever again.

969
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,910
Hurry.

970
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,190
I see.

971
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:29,950
I've been worried

972
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,440
for them the whole day

973
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,780
and careful with everything I said.

974
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:33,980
Do you know

975
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,550
what's wrong with Mr. Xie today?

976
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,150
Maybe

977
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,180
he's scared?

978
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:40,950
Scared?

979
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,940
He

980
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,610
once had everything.

981
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,470
But something horrible happened

982
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,360
when he was a kid

983
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,400
and deprived him of everything.

984
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,100
He's been living

985
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,490
in the shadow of it ever since.

986
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,060
Although he looks

987
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,660
tough and strong,

988
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,090
deep down,

989
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,620
he's extremely insecure.

990
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,010
So,

991
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,760
he'd rather never have anything again.

992
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,360
But when he does,

993
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,020
he'll be terrified of losing it.
