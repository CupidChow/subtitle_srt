00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,690
Let's eat.

190
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,050
Please, Sir.

191
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,190
What's wrong?

192
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,170
N-nothing.

193
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,040
Miss Jiang was quite worried about you today.

194
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,980
Eat up.

195
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,150
Here, eat.

196
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,060
Is something wrong with that girl?

197
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,430
No.

198
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,770
They are both normal.

199
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,700
Stop asking.

200
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,100
Let's eat.

201
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,250
What happened?

202
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,169
Nothing much.

203
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,320
I don't think you should know.

204
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,570
On the way,

205
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,070
Feng Mingyu kept asking me questions.

206
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,770
It must be the same with Huang Qian.

207
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,020
Miss Jiang, please tell me the truth.

208
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,340
So that I can be prepared.

209
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,070
Do you really want to hear it?

210
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,690
It's nothing much.

211
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,760
He asked me

212
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,100
about our relationship.

213
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,650
And why did you take me on

214
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,840
such a dangerous mission?

215
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,290
Didn't we discuss this question

216
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,340
on the way here?

217
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,930
Yes, we did.

218
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,150
But I came up with a better answer.

219
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,090
I said

220
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
we love each other.

221
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,910
This is an elopement.

222
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,730
What did you say?

223
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,190
I said this is an elopement.

224
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,840
Nonsense!

225
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,860
Eat, eat.

226
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,930
Eat up.

227
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,270
I said–

228
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,230
Don't talk nonsense.

229
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,080
I was afraid that by saying more things I'd make a mistake,

230
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,040
so I made an excuse to shut them up.

231
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,350
Did I say something wrong?

232
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,610
I can't think of a good excuse at that moment.

233
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
What if I ruin your plan?

234
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,000
Didn't you say

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,530
it's good for them to mistake

236
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,440
our relationship?

237
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,250
Them misunderstanding

238
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,360
is different from you

239
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,350
telling them that yourself.

240
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,040
It's all my fault.

241
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,250
I won't ruin your reputation anymore.

242
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,680
I'll say whatever you want me to say.

243
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,300
Don't be angry.

244
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,780
My reputation is nothing.

245
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,880
You have to get married in the future.

246
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,330
Such nonsense is inappropriate.

247
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,740
What's inappropriate?

248
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,550
I don't want to marry anyone else anyway.

249
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:36,990
All right.

250
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,150
Let's stop

251
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,550
talking about this.

252
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,690
I heard Feng Mingyu talking on the way here.

253
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,270
I'm afraid they'll take action tomorrow.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,560
Miss Jiang.

255
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,460
There's no time to lose.

256
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,020
Just pretend to be sick tonight.

257
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,610
I know you're worried.

258
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,960
But it's dangerous here.

259
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
If you stay here,

260
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,980
I will only be more worried.

261
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,000
I promised you

262
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,810
that I'll make sure you return safely to the capital.

263
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,330
Since I made this promise,

264
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,940
I can't go back on my word.

265
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,590
What's wrong?

266
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,160
It hurts.

267
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,610
Where are you hurting?

268
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,220
Miss San.

269
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,800
How is my sister?

270
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,920
Please tell me the truth.

271
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,500
Miss Jiang looks like

272
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,290
she was poisoned.

273
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,640
Why are you looking at me?

274
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,890
As a man,

275
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,910
how can I poison a little girl?

276
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,060
This is your base.

277
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,730
Your men are everywhere.

278
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,560
You kept trying to probe me on the way here.

279
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,410
How can I believe that?

280
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,730
Don't be anxious, Sir.

281
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,930
It's true that

282
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,440
we want to probe you.

283
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,720
But if we really wanted to kill you,

284
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,560
everyone here is our man.

285
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,570
Why do we have to do this?

286
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,690
Our priority

287
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,190
is to treat

288
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,680
your sister first.

289
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,160
It's not dawn yet.

290
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,190
Where can we find a doctor?

291
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,360
There's one.

292
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,370
Physician Xie from Yongding Pharmacy lives in the shop.

293
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,280
We can send her there.

294
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,170
Look.

295
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,470
As expected of Xiao Bao.

296
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,440
Xiao Bao,

297
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,520
I'll send two men to you later.

298
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,110
If you meet an official, you can work your way through.

299
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,600
Don't worry, Mr. Zhang.

300
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,390
I will take good care of your sister.

301
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,060
Stop.

302
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,040
What's wrong?

303
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,940
Stop.

304
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,000
What's wrong?

305
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,480
Miss Ning'er.

306
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,270
This is the antidote.

307
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,380
Ning'er?

308
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,720
Are you Xie Wei's man?

309
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,830
You poisoned me?

310
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,170
It's just a temporary plan.

311
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Fortunately,

312
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,050
I managed to get you out.

313
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,100
I have some money here.

314
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,760
Go stay a night

315
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,370
at that inn across the street tonight.

316
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,410
No matter what happens on the street tomorrow,

317
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,110
don't come out.

318
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,060
Someone will come to pick you up.

319
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,000
Where is Mr. Zhang?

320
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,960
What about him?

321
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,830
Don't worry.

322
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,540
Viscount Dingfei is with Mr. Zhang.

323
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,450
He will be fine.

324
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,010
He's also Xie Wei's man?

325
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,630
Things have been set up in Yongding Pharmacy.

326
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,090
There are always plans in the court.

327
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,280
All we need to do now is to save Mr. Zhang.

328
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,260
That's good.

329
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:26,920
Thank you for saving me.

330
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,990
You're welcome.

331
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,140
You went out for so long.

332
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,000
You managed to send her there?

333
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,740
She fell asleep after taking the medicine.

334
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,440
So I left those two at the pharmacy.

335
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,080
If anything happens, she can be protected.

336
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,140
That's good.

337
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,170
At least there's someone keeping an eye on her.

338
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,560
Come in. Get ready to go.

339
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,920
Father.

340
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,420
The forest is so big.

341
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,500
Where are the rebesl?

342
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,120
If Xie Wei takes the first credit,

343
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,690
our trip will be wasted.

344
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,000
Check around

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,230
and see if there are any clues.

346
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,340
Yes!

347
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,570
Sir,

348
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,470
Xiao Bao has brought Miss Jiang out.

349
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,990
Xue Dingfei also sent a message.

350
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,350
Saying that before dawn,

351
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,230
Feng Mingyu instigated them to go to Shangqing Temple.

352
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,400
Looks like that's

353
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,640
where Feng Mingyu set the gunpowder.

354
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,140
It's strange.

355
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,760
Why aren't they targeting Yan's troop

356
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,280
but instead, set up this gunpowder

357
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,790
in the temple?

358
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,120
In that case I should inform Duke Xue

359
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,090
to go to Shangqing Temple.

360
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,530
No need.

361
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,440
For military merits,

362
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,330
Xue Yuan only trusts himself

363
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,440
He won't listen to us easily.

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,550
Dao Qin.

365
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,920
Pretend to be the rebel.

366
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,410
Let them go there themselves while investigating.

367
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,580
Yes.

368
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,820
Sir.

369
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,890
Zhang Zhe has noticed your connection with the rebels.

370
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,390
Today,

371
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,380
we must get rid of him in the chaos.

372
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,970
Xiao Bao is Xie Wei's man.

373
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,040
It should be the same for Xue Dingfei.

374
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,350
In that case,

375
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,070
why didn't Xie Wei tell Zhang Zhe about this earlier?

376
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,280
Could it be because he's afraid that

377
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,880
Zhang Zhe suspects that he's related to the rebels?

378
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,830
If that's the case,

379
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,790
by asking Xie Bao to get me out,

380
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,330
isn't he exposing himself in front of Zhang Zhe?

381
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,780
With his meticulousness,

382
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,510
he would never make such a mistake.

383
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,820
Unless...

384
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:52,960
Guest.

385
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,550
I brought you some snacks.

386
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,200
Come in.

387
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,500
Did anything happen in the city today?

388
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,760
Like,

389
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,660
the barracks sent troops or the government is out to suppress bandits?

390
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,450
Not that I've heard of.

391
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,000
In the past, if the government takes any action,

392
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,760
they would issue an official notice

393
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,190
and inform us businessmen in advance.

394
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,109
Enjoy.

395
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,130
Xiao Bao brought me out last night.

396
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,060
It means the court is ready to take action.

397
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,560
But it's been hours.

398
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,839
Why is there no movement?

399
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,420
No.

400
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,569
I have to check it out.

401
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,540
[Yongding Pharmacy]

402
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
Is this Yongding Pharmacy?

403
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,080
Yes.

404
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,820
Miss,

405
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,000
are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

406
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,600
It's not me.

407
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,210
It's Mr. Zhang.

408
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,570
He's in danger.

409
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,850
Please inform the reinforcements immediately.

410
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,240
What Mr. Zhang?

411
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,820
What reinforcements?

412
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,250
This is a pharmacy,

413
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,110
not the barracks.

414
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,740
You don't know?

415
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,720
How is that possible?

416
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,930
Sir,

417
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,580
how many Yongding Pharmacies are there in Tongzhou?

418
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,920
There's only us.

419
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,640
Miss, what are you trying to do?

420
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,670
If you don't need to see a doctor,

421
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,530
don't disturb our business here.

422
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,510
Xie Wei lied to him.

423
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,530
Xie Wei didn't set any plan

424
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,460
for Yongding Pharmacy to be a point to get help.

425
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,230
He wants to kill.

426
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,860
He never wanted Zhang Zhe to leave Tongzhou alive.

427
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,540
Where is Yan’s troops' barracks?

428
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,510
I'm asking you where Yan's troops' barracks is.

429
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,210
Xiao Bao.

430
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,070
You don't have to follow us up the mountain.

431
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,440
Guard at the foot of the mountain.

432
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,530
If anything happens,

433
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,230
come up to report to us anytime.

434
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,040
[Shangqing Temple]

435
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,000
This used to be an abandoned temple.

436
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,360
I came here a year ago

437
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,230
and have occupied this place.

438
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,200
I sent people to train here to practice

439
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,730
while gathering information about the court and the barracks.

440
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,120
Now,

441
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,830
it's at quite a large skill.

442
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,560
You're quite something, Feng.

443
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,800
You've hidden well.

444
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,010
You did such a big thing in Tongzhou,

445
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,140
yet I didn't hear anything about it before.

446
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,940
All these years, Lord Pingnan has been stopped in the north.

447
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,030
He's been suspicious.

448
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,840
At first, I thought

449
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,620
Mr. Dujun betrayed the court.

450
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,370
So I've been very cautious on our way here.

451
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,670
Please forgive me.

452
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,760
You've done a lot of work to help Lord Pingnan.

453
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,250
It's good to be cautious.

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,730
However,

455
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,870
where is the good show that you want to show me?

456
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,560
I have to keep the good show to the end.

457
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,390
Why are you in such a hurry?

458
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,580
Please.

459
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,300
[Celebrate with Light]

460
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,460
I heard you've always been good at drinking.

461
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,170
You loved Gusu Yellow Wine the most when you were in Jinling.

462
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,730
Unfortunately,

463
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,200
we don't have any here.

464
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,340
Where did you hear that?

465
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,340
Mr. Dujun likes reading scriptures.

466
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,720
He can be considered half an innocent outsider.

467
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,010
He doesn't

468
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,980
drink.

469
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,510
General Feng.

470
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,540
I'm happy today.

471
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,970
I can drink with you.

472
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,570
I didn't expect Mr. Dujun

473
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,680
to be such an outgoing personality.

474
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,020
It suits our temperament.

475
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,240
Coincidentally,

476
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,400
I have something I can't make a decision on.

477
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,410
Let me tell everyone

478
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,170
so you can help me make a decision.

479
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,100
After we left the capital,

480
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,290
I secretly sent people

481
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,140
to keep an eye on the court.

482
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,780
Soon after,

483
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,400
news came.

484
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,570
The court sent Duke Xue

485
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,750
to bring a large number of Xingwu Guards to suppress the rebels.

486
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,770
They came straight to Tongzhou.

487
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,850
General Feng,

488
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,280
since you already knew about this,

489
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,520
why didn't you tell us earlier?

490
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,710
So that we can prepare for it.

491
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,280
What are you afraid of?

492
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,390
There are many soldiers in Shangqing Temple.

493
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,270
We also have a lot of gunpowder.

494
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,960
Who knows who will win?

495
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,180
I was just thinking

496
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,390
we should be cautions

497
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,230
on the way here

498
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,630
and be careful.

499
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,190
Unless Duke Xue is able to have the power of god,

500
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,040
how would he know we are in Tongzhou?

501
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,070
You mean...

502
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,200
there's a mole?

503
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,120
General.

504
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,380
There's a girl outside

505
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,460
claiming to be Mr. Yan's friend

506
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,780
asking to see you.

507
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,200
Mr. Yan?

508
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,810
A girl on top of that?

509
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,530
Yes.

510
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Mr. Dujun is resourceful.

511
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,970
Don't you want to say anything?

512
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,990
General Feng said the news.

513
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,570
You're not explaining it yourself

514
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,380
but are asking me about it.

515
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,740
It's putting me in the spot.

516
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,130
Before I came to the capital,

517
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,540
Lord Pingnan suspected you

518
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,410
of defected to the court.

519
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,400
Now it seems that

520
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,090
it can only be you

521
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,600
who colluded with Duke Xue.

522
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,740
I'm innocent.

523
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,270
I have a clear conscience and carry out Lord Pingnan's orders.

524
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,840
Except me,

525
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,240
is General Feng not suspcious?

526
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,660
Me?

527
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,740
What do you mean?

528
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,420
I wasn't sure at first.

529
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,550
But now General Feng has gotten anxious.

530
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,720
If you had suspected me on the way,

531
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,080
why didn't you send a letter to Jinling

532
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,140
and get Lord Pingnan's confirmation?

533
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,290
Yet you're trying to stir up trouble here.

534
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,990
Jinling is far and high up.

535
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,320
When the letter reaches,

536
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,690
you would have succeeded.

537
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,470
Let me ask you.

538
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,050
When you left Jinling,

539
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,720
did Lord Pingnan say I have defected

540
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,240
and told you to only listen Feng Mingyu?

541
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,100
No.

542
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,320
Lord Pingnan just told me

543
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,260
to pass most of the forces in the capital to Mr. Gongyi's

544
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,560
and Mr. Dujun.

545
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,860
As for General Feng's visit to the capital, there is another mission on him.

546
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,730
Yes.

547
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,960
I'm a strategist.

548
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,280
And you are a soldier.

549
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,780
Most of the secret services in the capital are in my hands.

550
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,570
Gongyi Cheng's has been abandoned.

551
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,240
But General Feng

552
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,920
left the capital and entered Tongzhou

553
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,290
just like entering a deserted place.

554
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,740
I would like to ask

555
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,930
if you haven't joined forces with the court, what other explanation can there be?

556
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,600
That's because–

557
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,400
Viscount Dingfei,

558
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,980
are you still going to stand by?

559
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,150
General Feng and I will fight till death.

560
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,320
Aren't you afraid that the higher-ups will blame you?

561
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,900
You're slandering me.

562
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,640
My loyalty for Lord Pingnan is witnessed by heaven and earth.

563
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,520
There's no way I will rebel.

564
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,490
I'm already a fifth-rank official in the court.

565
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,480
If I weren't loyal to Lord Pingnan,

566
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I wouldn't have been not afraid to be in danger

567
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,160
and got involved in this mess.

568
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,900
But you.

569
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,930
You have gunpowder.

570
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,280
Why didn't you ambush Xingwu Guards on the way

571
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,600
but lured us here?

572
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,440
Are you trying to kill us?

573
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,430
Nonsense!

574
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,050
Don't listen to him!

575
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,040
This mountain

576
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,060
is Yan's troops.

577
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,080
We chose this place

578
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,690
to bury the barracks

579
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,430
with the mountain's slope as an advantage.

580
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:57,940
I...

581
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,650
I'm doing this for the great cause of Jinling.

582
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,020
There are thousands of soldiers in Tongzhou's barracks.

583
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,260
Their tents are pitched wide and apart.

584
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,050
They won't be easily buried under a landslide.

585
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,880
Your excuses are full of flaws.

586
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,690
Viscount Dingfei,

587
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,450
are you still not making a move?

588
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:09,890
Xue Dingfei.

589
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,150
Are you crazy?

590
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,240
Huang Qian.

591
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,450
What are you waiting for?

592
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,400
When he detonates the explosives,

593
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,440
we will all die here.

594
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,910
Hurry up!

595
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,830
General Feng.

596
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,490
I didn't want to be your enemy.

597
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,910
But the situation is complicated now.

598
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,240
Could you two please surrender

599
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,430
and go back to Jinling with me to see Lord Pingnan?

600
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,430
Let Lord Pingnan

601
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,610
make the decision.

602
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,790
I'd love to

603
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,170
have my name cleared.

604
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:30,690
No.

605
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,480
If we let such eloquent rebel go back,

606
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,880
who knows how he will taint my name in front of Lord Pingnan?

607
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,030
You can leave.

608
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,730
But he must stay.

609
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,690
General Feng is afraid that after I leave,

610
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,460
you won't be able to give Duke Xue a good answer, right?

611
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,490
You...

612
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,130
What are you doing?

613
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,400
He's the one who is suspicious,

614
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,210
not me.

615
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,640
Explain your identity first.

616
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,140
Have you ever betrayed Lord Pingnan?

617
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,870
Two idiots.

618
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,700
What are you waiting for?

619
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,200
Waiting for them to start a gamble game?

620
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,020
Let's go.

621
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,390
Sir.

622
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,910
Xue Yuan fell for the trap.

623
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,390
He's on his way to Shangqing Temple.

624
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,920
Why are there so few people in the barracks today?

625
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,830
Sir,

626
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,350
a girl came this morning

627
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,440
saying that she has clues about the rebels.

628
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,260
The general led an army and went into the mountain with her.

629
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,250
They have been gone for a while now.

630
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,740
A girl?

631
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,520
Is she a girl about 18 or 19 years old?

632
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,230
Yes.

633
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,420
She also said she was an old friend of Viscount Yan.

634
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,680
She talked about many things about the Viscount Yan.

635
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,750
They are really close.

636
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,470
No way.

637
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,080
Didn't Xiao Bao do the things according to the plan

638
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,080
-and brought Miss Jiang to–
-Since she's here,

639
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,910
it means she has found something wrong.

640
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,140
Immediately deploy the troops and move with little things packed.

641
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,200
Attack from the back mountain.

642
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,960
You must bring her out

643
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,880
before Feng Mingyu ignites the gunpowder.

644
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,860
Yes.

645
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,240
Are you going too?

646
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,190
You haven't recovered yet.

647
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,840
It's too dangerous.

648
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,390
Medicine.

649
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,920
Give it to me.

650
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,820
Stop fighting!

651
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,270
Open your eyes!

652
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,490
Is Zhang Zhe still here?

653
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,720
This...

654
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,570
Viscount Dingfei is gone too.

655
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,860
Idiots.

656
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,420
Why didn't you trust me?

657
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,370
They are clearly in cahoots.

658
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,930
Xue Dingfei has already defected to the court.

659
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,660
What?

660
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,190
General, bad news!

661
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,240
Xingwu Guards are sneaking an attack.

662
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,350
They're already at the gate.

663
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,270
Stop!

664
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,730
Go!

665
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,570
Stop!

666
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,140
Stop!

667
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,380
Hurry up.

668
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,500
Didn't you ask Xiao Bao to guard down the mountain?

669
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,540
Where is he?

670
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,620
Now you know to panic?

671
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,580
Don't panic.

672
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,700
I have a plan.

673
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,540
So what if they're Xingwu Guards?

674
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,590
Today,

675
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,870
they will all die here.

676
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,250
I'll go kill them!

677
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,640
Stop!

678
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:39,730
You...

679
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,540
come with me.

680
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,120
Let's go.

681
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,100
Hurry up.

682
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,090
Xue Dingfei!

683
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,470
Are you working for Lord Pingnan

684
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,330
or for the court?

685
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,440
We need to escape now.

686
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,930
Can we talk about it after we go down the mountain?

687
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,100
Otherwise, when they come to their senses,

688
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,260
none of us can escape.

689
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:57,690
Let's go.

690
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,080
If we leave like this,

691
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
what would happen to the lives of the Xingwu Guards

692
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,630
and the innocent people in the barracks?

693
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,580
What ideas do you have?

694
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,410
Just you?

695
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,570
You're just a weak scholar.

696
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,200
If you go back, Feng will kill you first.

697
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,560
What are you doing?

698
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,710
See?

699
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,110
He's looking for death. I won't accompany you for that.

700
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,660
I won't.

701
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,570
I'll go.

702
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,370
Kill them!

703
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,770
Don't let anyone escape!

704
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,210
Kill!

705
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,890
Mr. Xue.

706
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,610
Mr. Zhang?

707
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,720
Where is the Duke?

708
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,160
I have something important to tell him.

709
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,800
It's just a den of rebels.

710
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,680
My father and I chased them

711
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,330
and beat them up.

712
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,200
We then led troops to hunt them down separately.

713
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,610
But it's none of your business.

714
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,890
The Xingwu Guards

715
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,060
will help His Majesty to stop the rebellion.

716
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,510
Chase!

717
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,230
No!

718
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,800
Watch out for traps, Mr. Xue!

719
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,010
If you are afraid,

720
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,150
just stay here.

721
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,400
Don't chase the poor.

722
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,710
This place is surrounded by mountains.

723
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,240
It's obviously a hidden plan to lure the enemy in.

724
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,760
Feng Mingyu has gunpowder.

725
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,050
What a coward.

726
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,780
You're a civil official. What do you know about war strategies?

727
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,650
Move aside!

728
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,810
Mr. Xue, no!

729
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,750
Mr. Xue!

730
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,720
There’s a trap ahead, Mr. Xue!

731
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,820
Mr. Xue!

732
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,620
Retreat!

733
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,270
Hello, Mr. Dujun.

734
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,400
It’s now obvious

735
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,030
who's the court's lackey.

736
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,660
What else do you want to say?

737
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,520
How dare you rebels

738
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,290
be so brazen?

739
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,880
Surrender now

740
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,100
and I will spare your life.

741
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,800
How dare you!

742
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,680
Shoot!

743
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,740
Protect Sir!

744
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:00,780
Sir.

745
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,880
We are outnumbered.

746
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,010
And they're on a vantage point.

747
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,890
We are disadvantaged.

748
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,420
What are you afraid of?

749
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,940
I'll send the signal now.

750
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,970
When my father comes,

751
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,050
-I’ll teach them a lesson!
-No!

752
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,490
No.

753
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,740
They have gunpowder

754
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,090
and deliberately lured us here.

755
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,390
They must've set a trap here waiting for us.

756
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,100
If you inform the Duke,

757
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,440
Xingwu Guards will be destroyed here too.

758
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,000
Don't shoot!

759
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,430
Mr. Xue!

760
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,230
It's a message from Xingwu Guards.

761
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,490
They're here too?

762
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,850
It's time.

763
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,300
To send them off!

764
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,310
Miss,

765
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,160
this is our first time in this mountain too.

766
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,820
It's too slow to keep looking.

767
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:49,690
How about

768
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,530
I lead a team to save Mr. Zhang first?

769
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,160
No.

770
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,160
The rebels brought him here.

771
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,250
There must be a base in the mountain.

772
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,410
If you split up,

773
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,950
it will be dangerous for you to go alone.

774
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,910
The rebels must be plotting something.

775
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,450
We must not only save Mr. Zhang,

776
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,810
but also stop this.

777
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,070
General.

778
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,160
I'm really Mr. Zhang.

779
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,890
I'm really...

780
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,080
It hurts. Don't.

781
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,050
It's you.

782
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,430
Miss.

783
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,240
You know him?

784
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,250
When I was patrolling,

785
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,350
I found this man suspicious

786
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,410
and interrogated him.

787
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,640
But he said he's Mr. Zhang.

788
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,710
I don't think so.

789
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,670
So I brought him here.

790
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,040
All right, it's a misunderstanding.

791
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,870
I mean

792
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,480
I'm looking for someone to save Mr. Zhang.

793
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,470
Where is he?

794
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:26,870
Over there.

795
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,170
Father!

796
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,170
I'm here!

797
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:08,850
Ye'er!

798
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,239
Duke, be careful! Don't come over!

799
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,139
They have gunpowder!

800
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,170
Ye'er!

801
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:40,820
Father!

802
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,760
Save me!

803
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:48,889
Ye'er!

804
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,510
Ye'er, are you okay?

805
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,570
Duke, retreat!

806
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,100
I destroyed the way down the mountain.

807
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,640
You have nowhere to go.

808
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,380
Today,

809
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,350
everyone will die here.

810
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:49,900
Why are there so many people?

811
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:50,720
Father.

812
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,770
We've been tricked.

813
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,290
It's not that easy

814
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,510
to kill me.

815
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,920
I'm not afraid of you rats.

816
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,070
Attention, Xingwu Guards!

817
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,280
If you don't want to die here,

818
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,640
then slaughter a path out for me!

819
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,750
Yes!

820
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,870
Kill them!

821
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,730
Kill all of them!

822
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,550
Yes!

823
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,970
Sir, I went down to have a look.

824
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,580
The road down the mountain was blown up.

825
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,060
There might be gunpowder ambushed on the mountain.

826
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,080
Sir.

827
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
They should be up there.

828
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,020
Sir.

829
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,770
You're not feeling well. Please wait here.

830
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,600
Right, Dao Qin?

831
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,850
We will definitely bring Miss Jiang back.

832
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,610
Stop talking.

833
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,800
Hurry up.

834
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:38,670
Sir!

835
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,540
Mr. Zhang!

836
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,990
Don't come over!

837
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,790
The Yan's troops are here too?

838
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,780
God is on my side.

839
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,250
Protect Mr. Zhang!

840
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:32,720
Yes!

841
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,840
Why did you come back?

842
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,850
We agreed to leave together.

843
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,770
I can't leave you here alone.

844
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,790
I planned to

845
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,820
trap and kill the Xingwu Guards first

846
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,950
then get some capacity to deal with Yan's troops.

847
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,900
I didn't expect that they would come here themselves.

848
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,200
That's great.

849
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,640
So what

850
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,090
if we die together today?

851
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,030
General.

852
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,100
What do you mean?

853
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,580
Do you want us to die together?

854
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,010
If you're afraid of death,

855
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,070
how can you achieve great things?

856
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,550
The whole mountain is filled with gunpowder.

857
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,170
Once my flute rings again,

858
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,930
the whole mountain will turn into ashes.

859
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,840
All the people on the mountain

860
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,040
can't escape.

861
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,360
General.

862
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,830
So many people have died.

863
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,250
How will you explain this to Lord Pingnan?

864
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,210
Lord Pingnan will succeed soon.

865
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,650
The whole Jinling will remember my name.

866
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,140
He's crazy!

867
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,290
Stop!

868
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,030
Are you two going to betray Lord Pingnan too?

869
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:07,830
Father.

870
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,080
Save me!

871
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,530
Ye'er!

872
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,370
Ye'er!

873
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:17,570
Let's go!

874
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,540
You foolish woman who's afraid of death.

875
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,160
Give me back my flute!

876
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,430
Huang Qian died in your hands.

877
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,590
I'll kill you!

878
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,160
Mr. Zhang, Miss Jiang,

879
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,890
Let me take you out first.

880
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,620
Don't worry about us.

881
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,850
As long as we can stop Feng Mingyu from sending the signal,

882
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,640
we still have a chance to survive.

883
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,100
You guys come with me.

884
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,750
Yes.

885
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,060
Duke!

886
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,690
It's not the time to escape.

887
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,800
Please order Xingwu Guards

888
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,960
to go up the mountain to help the Yan's troops.

889
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,360
Otherwise, we will all die.

890
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,210
Ignore him!

891
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,190
While the rebels are busy,

892
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,620
inform all Xingwu Guards

893
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,230
to evacuate the valley!

894
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,310
Duke Xue!

895
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,670
Duke!

896
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,640
The war is coming.

897
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,780
Yet they just want to retreat.

898
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,110
Retreat! Retreat!

899
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,250
Come on.

900
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,240
Let's go.

901
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,360
Xie Wei! Don't kill him!

902
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,970
Junior Preceptor Xie.

903
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,420
All the rebels

904
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,610
should be killed without mercy!

905
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:46,610
Yes!

906
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,410
Are you okay?

907
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,530
This is ridiculous!
