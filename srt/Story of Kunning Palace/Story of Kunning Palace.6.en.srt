Ning,

43
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,750
your mother has always been so straightforward.

44
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,180
She's like this only because she cares about you.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,440
You should know

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,380
what kind of a place the imperial palace is.

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,570

So, no matter what you do,

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,190
be careful with your words and actions.

Maybe Mother was right.

72
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:38,950
It's my personality

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,920
and my inappropriate greed

74
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,060
that led to the ending.

There are so many people in Xingwu Guards.

Zhou's background is not prominent.

98
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,110
He used to be a stableman.

You don't know Zhou?

112
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,140
He comes from a humble family and is good at fawning upon the rich and the powerful.

113
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,780
This kind of people are usually skilled.

114
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,070
I'm going to the Yan Mansion tomorrow

115
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,350
to meet him in person.

116
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,340
By the way,

117
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,370
didn't you ask Dao Qin

118
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,210
to check the situation in Jinling?

119
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,130
Guess what happened?

120
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,760
Cut the crap.

121
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,159
It's Deputy Gong Yi.

122
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,490
That old man.

123
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,220
Ever since you left,

124
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,060
he's been badmouthing you to His Highness a lot.

125
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,140
But somehow,

126
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,430
he got His Highness's order

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,480
and was coming to the capital.

128
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,880
It was him

129
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,150
who sent someone to assassinate you.

130
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,940
He was giving you a warning

131
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,540
to not forget who you are.

132
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,260
Who is he to tell me who I am?

133
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,820
Bring it on.

134
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,460
I want to see

135
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,320
if he can make it back alive.

136
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,150
There are no decent plants in my garden.

137
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,540
Sorry to bore you, Ning.

138
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,170
Why don't you plant some Nerium oleander?

139
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,650
It looks gorgeous, but it's actually very poisonous.

140
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,060
It fits the scene well.

141
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,840
Yes.

142
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,620
Ning.

143
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,320
Zhou is good at martial arts after all.

144
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,790
He's a rare matching opponent to me.

145
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,110
He could fight with you

146
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,340
because others dared not fight with you.

147
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,790
What did I tell you?

148
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,040
Qing Feng.

149
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,720
I asked him to get some wine.

150
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,000
Why is it taking him so long?

151
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,170
Right.

152
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,480
I'll go take a look.

153
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,400
Enjoy yourselves.

154
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,410
Enjoy.

155
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,850
If I remember it correctly,

156
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,870
I have reminded you last time

157
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,220
not to mess with Yan Lin, Mr. Zhou.

158
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,320
Are you determined to get involved in this mess?

159
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,690
Miss, you must have heard of this saying.

160
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,799
The tree may long for calmness, but the wind will not subside.

161
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,470
Even if I don't do it,

162
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,669
there must be Wang Yinzhi,

163
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,680
Zhao Yinzhi, or Li Yinzhi who would do it.

164
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,610
Miss.

165
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,290
I knew you were coming today,

166
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,950
so I stayed here last night.

167
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,950
I just wanted to see you.

168
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,420
Please enlighten me.

169
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,460
How should I solve

170
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,710
this doomed situation?

171
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,090
The Xue family

172
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,340
wants to forge the evidence

173
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,690
of the Yan family colluding with Lord Pingnan,

174
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,360
right?

175
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,840
His Majesty is quite intimidated by Lord Pingnan.

176
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,670
If the Xue family wants to overthrow the Yan family,

177
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,920
it must be some serious crime that can take the whole family down.

178
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,720
The Yan family has been loyal for generations.

179
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,770
They couldn't get what they want.

180
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,220
That's why I thought

181
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,840
they'd want to forge evidence.

182
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,660
You're so smart. I'm ashamed of my inferiority.

183
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,770
I've obeyed you

184
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,770
and stopped stealing

185
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,750
or looking for His Lordship's seal and handwriting anymore.

186
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,290
But Duke of Xue just wouldn't let me go.

187
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,570
I thought

188
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,450
I could fool him with some casual handwriting.

189
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,590
But who would expect that

190
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,650
I would find something huge?

191
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,310
What is it?

192
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,050
Are you sure you were not mistaken?

193
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,780
I work for the Xingwu Guards.

194
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,650
That…

195
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,580
I've seen Lord Pingnan's emblem too many times.

196
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,770
How could I be mistaken?

197
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,270
Miss,

198
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,680
this is a serious matter.

199
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,630
I should have reported it.

200
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,650
But if Duke of Xue knows about this,

201
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,720
the Yan family will be punished for sure.

202
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,080
I am also destined

203
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,030
to be killed since I've outlived my usefulness.

204
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,040
So, Miss,

205
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
please tell me

206
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,540
what I should do next.

207
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,580
I can't take your salute.

208
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,430
As you can see,

209
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,590
I want to help the Yan family.

210
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,590
But like you,

211
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,470
I'm also a nobody.

212
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,810
It's okay for nobodies to work together for profit.

213
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,310
Although I have nothing now,

214
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,870
it's easy for me

215
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,980
to kill you.

216
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:23,990
Do you believe it?

217
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,600
Yes.

218
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,730
If you tell the Yan family about this,

219
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,660
they can take my life thousands of times.

220
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,920
That's right.

221
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,810
You may not be able to enjoy

222
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,300
what the Xue family promised you.

223
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,910
Besides, what you saw was just fragments of the emblem.

224
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,930
You don't know what's written in the letter.

225
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,120
I believe

226
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,640
the Yan family has no intention to rebel.

227
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,090
There must be some other explanation.

228
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,360
Anyway,

229
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,080
don't let anyone know

230
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,930
about the burnt letter.

231
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,790
Yes.

232
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,260
It's mainly about Duke of Xue.

233
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,320
If they want to forge it,

234
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,760
they'll need Marquis of Yan's handwriting and seal.

235
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,480
The handwriting is easier to get.

236
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,390
It's easy to find on the memorials.

237
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,070
You can fool them with some copybook

238
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,390
and buy some time.

239
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,140
But it's not a long-term solution.

240
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,840
The one who started the trouble is the one who should solve it.

241
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,520
You are right about one thing.

242
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,180
Even if it's not you,

243
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,040
there will be someone else

244
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,140
who will tell Yan Lin

245
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,130
everything you found out.

246
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,560
It's time for him

247
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,610
to grow up.

248
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:24,940
Your Highness.

249
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,220
-Where is the wine? -Your Highness.

250
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,400
-Where's the wine? -We have a guest.

251
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,530
Sir.

252
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,160
I didn't know you'd come suddenly.

253
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,350
It doesn't matter.

255
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,970
There's no need to stand on ceremony in your residence.

256
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,700
It's already past mid autumn.

257
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,030
Why haven't the flowers of this tree bloomed yet?

258
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,190
This tree was planted by my aunt

259
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:04,990
before she got married.

260
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,870
Twenty years ago, my aunt passed away.

261
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,120
The leaves started withering.

262
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,450
Since then, its flowers have never bloomed again,

263
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,450
as if it were dead.

264
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,880
Are you here for my father, Sir?

265
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,220
Father went to the military camp.

266
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,820
He might be back late. How about taking a rain check?

267
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,360
Why do you

268
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,770
smell like charcoal?

269
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,560
Are you having a barbecue in the garden?

270
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,890
Excuse me.

271
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,470
It seems I came at the right time.

272
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,620
Speaking of which,

273
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,170
I haven't had game meat for years.

274
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,300
May I join you?

275
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,210
What's wrong with Xie Wei?

276
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,040
Why did he come to the Yan Mansion for no reason?

277
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,920
Now that he saw me with Zhou Yinzhi,

278
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,850
I don't know what trouble he'll cause.

279
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,680
My goodness, you're still eating?

280
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,190
Get him out of here.

281
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,080
We're not friends.

282
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
Why do we have to eat together?

283
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,190
Your Highness,

284
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,730
there's not much meat left.

285
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,700
How about I go to the kitchen and get some more for you?

286
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,650
I'll be back soon.

287
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,700
Why are you so irritable?

288
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,980
Our fearless Ning

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,130
is afraid of Mr. Xie?

290
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,170
I wonder what will happen in class in the future.

291
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,210
Eat your meat.

292
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,740
Ning,

293
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,960
is this how you treat Viscount Yan?

294
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,670
-It's okay. -Mr. Xie, don't get me wrong.

295
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,310
Yan Lin and I are best friends.

296
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,630
He likes hot food.

297
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,620
Right?

298
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:57,990
Come on.

299
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,730
Drink some wine.

300
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,670
Don't burn your tongue.

301
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,150
Ning.

302
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,360
Don't you know drinking is bad for health?

303
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,940
Since you're friends,

304
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,240
you should be beneficial to each other.

305
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,210
You don't even know that?

306
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,530
Yes.

307
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,980
You're right, Sir.

308
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,900
I'll drink.

309
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,330
It will only hurt my body, okay?

310
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,330
Ning.

311
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,780
I don't know what's wrong with her today.

312
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,040
She's so drunk.

313
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,530
Ning.

314
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,440
Why don't you stay here for one night?

315
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,440
I want to go home.

316
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,140
Don't worry, Your Highness.

317
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,130
I have something

318
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,710
to ask Mr. Jiang about.

319
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,430
I can send Miss Ning

320
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,900
back to the Jiang Mansion.

321
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,290
In that case,

322
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,670
I'll leave her to you, Sir. Thanks.

323
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,920
Let's go.

324
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,760
Are you done pretending?

325
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,170
Get up if you're done.

326
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,510
You are so insightful.

327
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,840
I feel ashamed.

328
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,660
You know Zhou Yinzhi well?

329
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,760
You're mistaken, Sir.

330
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,480
We don't know each other well.

331
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,910
Think carefully before you answer.

332
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,700
Have you forgotten, Sir?

333
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,150
He was with us

334
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,750
when we came to the capital.

335
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,140
We were separated when we got robbed halfway.

336
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,290
Later, we finally got out of the wilderness.

337
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,320
[Four years ago]

338
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,970
It was Zhou Yinzhi and the Jiang family

339
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,930
who found us.

340
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,320
So,

341
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,250
of course there's some friendship between us.

342
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,960
Just a little bit.

343
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,380
What he wants to do now

344
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,300
has nothing to do with me.

345
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,220
You know what he wants to do?

346
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,030
To help the Xue family take down the Yan family.

347
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,130
I have persuaded him today.

348
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,560
He won't do anything to the Yan family anymore.

349
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,920
I can let myself believe that

350
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,960
you have no intention to harm Yan Lin.

351
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,530
But the court disputes are not as simple as you think.

352
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,330
I don't care what your relationship with Zhou Yinzhi

353
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,390
or who the person behind him is,

354
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,070
but I hope you'll stay out of this.

355
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:04,690
Otherwise,

356
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,880
your survival is threatened

357
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,470
even without me trying to kill you.

358
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,349
I have to ask you as well, Sir.

359
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,560
What is your relationship with Yan Lin?

360
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,150
What do you mean?

361
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,440
You come from the Xie family in Jinling.

362
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,040
You have nothing to do with the Yan family.

363
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,470
In the capital,

364
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,640
you seem to have no connections with the Yan family,

365
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,740
but you took care of Yan Lin repeatedly.

366
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,579
And now that Zhou Yinzhi showed up,

367
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,270
you even investigated it yourself.

368
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,720
I dare to guess

369
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,300
the secret you want to hide is related to the Yan family.

370
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,840
What does it have to do with you?

371
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,900
Yan Lin is also my friend.

372
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,540
Just like you,

373
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,290
I don't want to see him in danger.

374
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,500
Jian Shu.

375
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,350
Sir.

376
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,130
Follow them.

377
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:49,570
Yes.

378
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,770
I'll ask someone to send you back.

379
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,800
You didn't see anything

380
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,040
that happened today.

381
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,980
Zhou.

382
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,470
Why are you still here?

383
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,110
Your Highness,

384
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,890
I have something to tell you.

385
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,110
What happened?

386
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,500
I, Zhou Yinzhi, am a despicable person

387
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,570
who's greedy for power and profit.

388
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,690
I approached Your Highness

389
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,520
because I was ordered by Xingwu Guards

390
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,100
to investigate the evidence

391
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,590
of Lord Pingnan's collusion with the Yan family.

392
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,800
I failed your trust.

393
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,320
Please punish me severely.

394
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,090
Zhou Yinzhi.

395
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,890
Why did you

396
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,470
choose to tell me at this time?

397
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,330
It's Miss Jiang.

398
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,600
Miss Jiang and I go way back.

399
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,320
She saw through me

400
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,710
when we met today.

401
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,170
She was worried about your safety,

402
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,110
so she asked me to tell you everything.

403
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,270
Ning.

404
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,340
It's Ning.

405
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,240
You've treated me so well, Your Highness.

406
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,470
I am really grateful to you.

407
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,640
So if the Yan family

408
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,880
is not involved with Lord Pingnan at all,

409
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,680
I won't make up a false testimony.

410
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,620
But recently,

411
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,750
when I investigated the Yan family in secret,

412
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,390
I found that His Lordship did have contact via letters

413
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,340
with the remnants of Lord Pingnan's rebels.

414
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,100
I wonder if you know that, Your Highness.

415
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,290
What did you say?

416
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,240
You came at the right time.

417
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,750
Try this wine.

418
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,960
It was just delivered from the north.

419
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,260
You had a fight with Xuening?

420
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,440
Father,

421
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,150
do you know

422
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,270
the Xingwu Guards are investigating

423
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,690
the remnants of Lord Pingnan's rebels in secret?

424
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,460
People are saying that

425
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,730
this case is related to the Yan family.

426
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,100
What should come

427
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,450
will come.

428
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,450
After 20 years,

429
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,350
I still can't forget it.

430
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,310
Those who did bad things

431
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,680
won't be able to forget either.

432
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,680
Do you remember your cousin Xue Dingfei?

433
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,010
You've told me stories about him since I was young, Father.

434
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,180
You said that Lord Pingnan

435
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,200
rebelled 20 years ago.

436
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,020
In order to protect His Majesty,

437
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,360
Cousin was killed by Lord Pingnan.

438
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,800
Father.

439
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,840
Is there some other reason for my cousin's death?

440
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,290
I don't know.

441
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,260
It's just I received a letter from Lord Pingnan.

442
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,820
It said that

443
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,880
Dingfei's not dead.

444
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,420
He's in his hands.

445
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,730
How is that possible?

446
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,890
Lord Pingnan is a rebel.

447
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,940
They have wild ambitions.

448
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,910
They said that to perturb you.

449
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,820
They were obviously trying to sow discord between the Yan Family and the Xue family

450
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
to perturb His Majesty, Father.

451
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,370
If His Majesty is discerning,

452
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,880
no one can perturb him.

453
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,510
Rumors are just rumors.

454
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,900
But

455
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,220
those who did bad things 20 years ago

456
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,340
were not the Yan family,

457
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,640
but the Xue family.

458
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,500
I've burned the letter from Lord Pingnan.

459
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,530
But

460
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,640
the letter in which I asked for his whereabouts

461
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,390
got in their hands.

462
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,530
The rumors in the capital

463
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,130
didn't come out of nowhere.

464
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,670
Why were you tricked into this, Father?

465
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,910
This is your cousin.

466
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,070
How could I not ask about him?

467
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,880
Back then,

468
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,130
before your aunt passed away,

469
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,970
she held my hand.

470
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,510
She was so sick that she couldn't speak.

471
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,110
She could only look at me with those eyes

472
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,760
[Xue Dingfei's mother, Yan Min]

473
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,170
and she kept crying.

474
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,900
Even when she swallowed her last breath,

475
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,540
she couldn't close her eyes.

476
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,910
In the great State of Qian,

477
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,620
how could they push a seven-year-old child out

478
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,350
to face the cruelest sword?

479
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:55,980
Is this

480
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,390
fair?

481
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,310
Some things

482
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,840
should be known by you now.

483
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,600
[Baiyun Hall]

484
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,580
Sir, it's all clear now.

485
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,710
He's inside.

486
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,970
Do we need more people?

487
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,130
No.

488
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,620
[Baiyun Hall]

489
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,870
You're here.

490
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,520
Should I call you Mr. Xie,

491
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,930
[Lord Pingnan's counsellor, Deputy Gong Yi]

492
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,960
or Dujun, the Hermit?

493
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,090
Mr. Gong Yi.

494
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,280
I haven't seen you in a while.

495
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,340
How is His Highness?

496
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,940
You still remember him?

497
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,350
I thought that

498
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,830
you've long forgotten about your identity

499
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,440
since you've been in the land of wealth and tenderness at the capital.

500
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,950
And you've forgotten what His Highness told you

501
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,520
when you insisted on coming to the capital four years ago.

502
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,950
Those are some heavy words.

503
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,050
What I've done in the capital these years

504
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,380
is all under His Highness' order.

505
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,790
I dare not forget my origin.

506
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,590
How could I be anything

507
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,420
that you said?

508
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,810
The general trend of the court

509
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,960
is in the hands of the Yan and Xue families.

510
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,900
To achieve great things,

511
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,570
His Highness must make them fight.

512
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,820
We arranged spies in the capital

513
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,270
so that we could use their investigation on the rebels

514
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,400
to punish the Yan family for rebelling.

515
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,980
Once the Yan family falls, there will be no leader in the troops.

516
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,720
It'll be the best time for us to take action.

517
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,360
There's no way you don't understand this.

518
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,860
Of course I understand.

519
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,940
I've been planning for years

520
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,020
and making friends with the officials

521
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,680
in the capital just for this.

522
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,530
Nonsense!

523
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,750
If that's the case,

524
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,570
why did you stop the Xingwu Guards from investigating the case?

525
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,960
Instead, you instigated His Majesty to hand this case over to the Ministry of Justice.

526
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,380
You are obviously disloyal.

527
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,160
If you hadn't taken action in the capital

528
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,990
and made the court suspicious,

529
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,030
I wouldn't have to do all this.

530
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,080
But

531
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,260
I'm here today

532
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,360
to ask you a question.

533
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,840
I want to ask you

534
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,670
about the truth of

535
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,690
the assassin of Cengxiao Restaurant.

536
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,800
I said

537
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,640
I would overthrow the rule of Shen Lang.

538
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,690
But if you insist on interfering,

539
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,000
I have no right to stop you, Mr. Gong Yi.

540
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,950
But

541
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,260
I have to tell you.

542
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,030
If you kill our comrades

543
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,510
in the name of His Highness,

544
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,460
I won't sit back and do nothing.

545
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,440
Sir,

546
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,410
the capital

547
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,350
is my territory.

548
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,110
You must be careful

549
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,690
doing things here.

550
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,540
Xie Wei.

551
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,000
Don't forget

552
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,190
your life was saved by His Highness.

553
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,500
If you want to please both sides,

554
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,820
you will only be doomed eternally.

555
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,290
Miss.

556
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,650
Qing Feng from the Yan Mansion is here.

557
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,730
He said

558
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,150
Viscount Yan is not doing well.

559
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,450
They said

560
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,110
you locked yourself in your room.

561
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,650
How much did you drink?

562
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,480
Sorry.

563
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,380
Did I scare you?

564
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,170
Why is it so hot?

565
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,140
I'll go get a doctor.

566
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,610
Ning.

567
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,950
Don't go.

568
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,610
♫Time flies and everything's like a dream♫

569
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,010
♫I traveled so far but still can't forget you♫

570
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:35,860
I'm sorry.

571
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,850
♫I spent half my life loving you but ended up being a joke♫

572
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,840
Why are you saying this?

573
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,200
I should be the one

574
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,460
to say sorry.

575
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,270
♫My heart is broken♫

576
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,420
You've treated me so well,

577
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,920
but I failed to do the same for you.

578
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,010
♫But I never regret loving you♫

579
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,430
No.

580
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,880
I was too stupid.

581
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,630
I thought

582
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,970
there was no hardship in this world

583
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,210
that I couldn't overcome.

584
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,850
I also thought

585
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,030
I should let the whole world know that I like you.

586
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,100
But I forgot that

587
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,670
things change.

588
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,610
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.

589
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,790
You didn't have to go to the palace to be a study partner,

590
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,000
but I sent you in.

591
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,230
Now everyone knows

592
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,290
we grew up together.

593
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,260
♫We were too young to know about pain♫

594
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,010
If the Yan family gets in trouble,

595
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,170
what should you,

596
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,210
♫We drank under the moon amidst flowers♫

597
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,400
such a delicate girl, do?

598
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,100
How should you face those rumors?

599
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,730
♫We saw flowers blooming yesterday♫

600
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,390
You didn't ask me

601
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,370
♫And thought they'd still be blooming tomorrow♫

602
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,310
when I knew the Yan family was in trouble,

603
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,680
or how I convinced Zhou Yinzhi.

604
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,550
♫When we were young♫

605
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,290
You didn't suspect that I deceived you and hid it from you,

606
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,400
♫We believed that as long as we could♫

607
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,710
or worry that I'd tell others and hurt you.

608
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,280
♫Hold those warm hands♫

609
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,570
All you thought about is saying sorry to me

610
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,800
♫We could be with our beloved one forever♫

611
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,160
and worrying about my future.

612
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,540
I trust you.

613
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,140
♫Time flies and everything's like a dream♫

614
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,160
From beginning to end,

615
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,610
always.

616
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,170
You're so stupid.

617
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:07,050
♫I traveled so far but still can't forget you♫

618
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,910
You're the dumbest person in the world.

619
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,820
Because you're Ning.

620
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:14,870
♫I spent half my life loving you but ended up being a joke♫

621
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,080
You are the person who treats me the best

622
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,820
besides my father.

623
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,720
But it was me who let you know all this.

624
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,710
♫My heart is broken♫

625
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,080
You should have been a carefree viscount.

626

♫But I never regret loving you♫

627
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,850
No one can live carefreely forever.

628
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,980
I should have grown up.

629
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,480
But it's too late.

630
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,030
No.

631
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,550
You still have me.

632
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,850
Yan Lin.

633
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,350
Let's get through this together.

634
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,230
You will still be the carefree viscount.

635
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,050
OK?

636
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,980
Don't cry.

637
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,870
We won't cry anymore.

638
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:48,800
OK?

639
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,260
My Lord.

640
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,800
You didn't sleep all night.

641
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,290
Why are you standing here in the wind now?

642
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,550
You may catch a cold.

643
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,830
My Lady.

644
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,700
Look at these fallen leaves.

645
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,350
They seem to rely on the trees,

646
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,010
but as soon as the wind and rain comes,

647
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,090
they'd fall and turn to dust.

648
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,090
Who cares about the life and death of a leaf?

649
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,280
Is something troubling you, My Lord?

650
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,430
No.

651
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,790
I'm just thinking about a bet.

652
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,450
So, have you decided which side to bet on?

653
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,170
No one in this world can be relied on forever.

654
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,790
I came from nothing to now.

655
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,040
What I learned is to bet on both sides.

656
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,430
It's okay if I'm betting on the disadvantaged side or

657
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,470
being used as a tool.

658
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,860
As long as I can win in the end.

659
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:55,550
Father!

660
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,720
[Long History]

661
00:32:59,440 --> 00:32:59,860
Father!

662
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,130
Father!

663
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,390
Bad news!

664
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,480
Something happened on the Cao River.

665
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,640
Our silk ship flipped over.

666
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,690
Look at you, panicking like this.

667
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,770
How inappropriate.

668
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,680
Why did the ship

669
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,250
flip over all of a sudden?

670
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,920
On the surface, it was because it rained for days on Cao River,

671
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,940
and our people overloaded it with goods.

672
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,100
So it was an accident.

673
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,170
But in fact,

674
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,720
someone dug a hole under the ship.

675
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,570
So someone wanted the ship to flip over on purpose.

676
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,340
The position and route of our ships have always been a secret.

677
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,600
It's hard for outsiders to figure out.

678
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,120
I'm afraid it was done by an insider.

679
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,220
Find out

680
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,810
who's behind this.

681
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:36,760
Find him

682
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,210
and get rid of him.

683
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,060
I've sent people to investigate.

684
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,550
Water transport

685
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,970
was a business appointed by the government.

686
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,160
Over the past years, our family

687
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,350
has made acquaintance with a lot of court officials

688
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,400
with the money from water transport.

689
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,740
We also asked some of the

690
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,740
Xingwu Guards to work for us.

691
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,460
If this matter

692
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,750
is found to be related to the Xue family,

693
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,620
His Majesty will be furious.

694
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,350
Now is the crucial moment for the Xue family

695
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,030
to take down the Yan family.

696
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,469
So this matter

697
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,090
must be suppressed.

698
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,469
Father, don't worry.

699
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,050
Leave it to me.

700
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,719
Wait.

701
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,489
Tell Zhou Yinzhi to hurry up.

702
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,500
To take down the Yan family,

703
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,550
it has to be quick.

704
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:27,560
Yes.

705
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,080
Xie Ju'an.

706
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,520
How can you still have the mood to feed fish?

707
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,739
Deputy Gong Yi has come to our door.

708
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,730
What does it mean?

709
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,100
It means Jinling

710
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,710
has started to be dissatisfied with you.

711
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,270
If they really get irritated

712
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,070
and report…

713
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,280
And report your identity as a traitor,

714
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,330
your life

715
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,150
and my life

716
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,060
will both be over.

717
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,380
What's the use of being afraid?

718
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,050
Yes.

719
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,290
It's useless to be afraid.

720
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,020
But you don't have to irritate

721
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,250
that old man, Deputy Gong Yi, right?

722
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,350
What?

723
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,240
Are you afraid he won't do something to you?

724
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,340
We've been in the capital for four years.

725
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,400
All the spies and secret agents in the city are under our control.

726
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,790
Even if Deputy Gong Yi has the intention to do something,

727
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,130
there's no one he can use.

728
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,280
Besides,

729
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,860
Lord Pingnan still considers me useful.

730
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,170
He won't kill me.

731
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,990
Then what did he

732
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,270
come here for?

733
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,660
The Yan family.

734
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,750
He's anxious to make the court chaotic,

735
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,860
but he was intimidated by the strength of Yan's troops.

736
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,230
So,

737
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,130
he wants to use Duke of Xue to take down the Yan family.

738
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,910
Then why are you so calm?

739
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,680
You would always get anxious

740
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,530
once the Yan family was brought up.

741
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,690
If we can make Duke of Xue only concentrate on his own affairs,

742
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,140
even if Deputy Gong Yi wants to turn the world upside down,

743
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,470
he can't do anything to the Yan family.

744
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
[Knowledge and Courtesy]

745
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,380
-Sir. -Sir.

746
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,020
You were right.

747
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,230
What the Xue family wants to hide

748
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,030
is really about water transport.

749
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,460
A few days ago,

750
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,860
the Xue family was joined by the big silk merchants in the capital

751
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,120
to lower the price of raw silk.

752
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,530
When the silk price fell, they secretly bought the silk

753
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,840
then shipped it to Jiangnan to weave.

754
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,190
And then it was transported back to the capital to sell at a high price.

755
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,260
Unexpectedly,

756
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,770
the ship flipped over on the way back.

757
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,170
The business of the Xue family

758
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,380
has always been done anonymously.

759
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,500
That's why we've been investigating them for so long

760
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,560
but we couldn't find evidence of their crimes.

761
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,500
But this time, they worked with the silk merchants to lower the price

762
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,850
and the ship flipped over. It's quite big news.

763
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,770
Since there were more people involved,

764
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,380
there's more evidence.

765
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,480
You two,

766
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,540
go investigate the water transport and silk merchants separately.

767
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,090
As for

768
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,080
you...

769
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,240
As for me,

770
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,300
of course I'll go buy raw silk at a low price

771
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,780
since word hasn't been spread yet.

772
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,980
As the news spreads, the silk price will rise tremendously.

773
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,410
Then we can make a big profit out of it.

774
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,030
Miss.

775
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,750
How long haven't you slept?

776
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,870
I don't know about business.

777
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,100
Thanks to your kindness,

778
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,550
I could learn math and accounting.

779
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,290
I should study harder.

780
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,480
This is the new ledger I prepared for you.

781
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,520
I've marked it so that

782
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,270
it will be easier

783
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,320
and clearer for you.

784
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,390
However,

785
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,710
staying up late to read the ledger

786
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,640
is bad for your health.

787
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,800
You should know when to rest.

788
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,610
It's said that the ledger should be private,

789
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,570
but you showed it all to me.

790
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,810
Are you really not afraid that I might leak it out?

791
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,840
I do business

792
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,370
honestly and conscientiously.

793
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,650
Every penny

794
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,870
is earned legitimately.

795
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,110
I'm not afraid of showing it to people.

796
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,140
Besides,

797
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,420
I judge people

798
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,520
by their hearts.

799
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,530
I know

800
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,540
what kind of person you are.

801
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,570
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

802
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,480
But Miss,

803
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,540
the silk price still hasn't risen.

804
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,620
Aren't you afraid of losing money?

805
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,930
If I lose,

806
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,970
I'll save enough money

807
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,170
and return it to Boss in the future.

808
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,050
You are really loyal

809
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,660
to your boss.

810
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,760
Logically,

811
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,100
the money belongs to Boss.

812
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,310
And it's Boss who asked you to do it.

813
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,740
It should be Boss who's responsible

814
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,810
for the gain and the loss.

815
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,790
Why did you say you'd pay her back if you lose money?

816
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,240
Mr. Xu, you don't know.

817
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,110
She's my savior.

818
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,090
Although

819
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,720
I don't know why she helped me so much,

820
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,560
or why she always

821
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,210
looks at me with such sad eyes,

822
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,860
"receiving drips of water when in need, and I shall return the kindness with a spring".

823
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,450
Since she asked me to do business,

824
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,380
maybe

825
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,370
if I do business well

826
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,670
and make a lot of money for her in the future,

827
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,650
she will be happy.

828
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,200
Mr. Xu.

829
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,170
I didn't tell my family I'd come here today.

830
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:15,950
I can't stay for long.

831
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,020
I'll leave now.

832
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,150
I'll come another day.

833
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,600
Thank you.

834
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,510
As for my silk,

835
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,210
before the price rises,

836
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:25,870
don't sell it to anyone.

837
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,400
Thank you.

[Honesty Comes First in Business]

00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:52,090
Are you Mr. Xu, Xu Wenyi?

840
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,410
You are?

841
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,320
My surname is Lyu.

Get out of my way.

845
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,650
Ouch!

846
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,890
Ouch.

847
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,050
Ouch.

848
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,350
It hurts.

849
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:21,800
What's going on?

850
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,460
Seems like

851
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,870
you failed.

852
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,020
It's half successful.

853
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,930
I'm so unlucky today.

854
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,370
Tell me honestly.

855
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,020
When did the silk ship

856
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,300
flip over on Cao River?

857
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,910
And when did the news first reach the capital?

858
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,590
And who knows about it?

859
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:39,950
It happened yesterday.

860
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,270
The news has only been in the capital for four hours.

861
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,340
Other than the messenger,

862
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,270
only His Lordship,

863
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,570
you, me, Dao Qin,

864
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,080
and the Xue family at most, know about this.

865
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,050
Impossible.

866
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,590
Someone bought raw silk from Xu Wenyi the day before yesterday

867
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,140
and predicted that the raw silk price would rise.

868
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,620
I tried many times

869
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,630
but Xu Wenyi didn't say much.

870
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,460
But I heard from the guild that

871
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,230
it was a girl who traded with him.

872
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,030
Guess who she is.

873
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,270
She's the illegitimate daughter

874
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,080
from Mansion of Earl of You that no one knows about.

875
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,320
Her name is You Fangyin.

876
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,680
There's a boss

877
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,880
behind this girl.

878
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,020
Unfortunately,

879
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,490
I haven't found out who the boss is.

880
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:14,790
Jian Shu.

881
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,560
Ask Dao Qin to investigate

882
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,160
the illegitimate daughter from  You Mansion

883
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,690
and the person behind her.

884
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,560
Yes.

885
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,010
You said it was half successful.

886
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:26,870
What do you mean?

887
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,260
Xu Wenyi

888
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,710
only sold 400 taels of silk.

889
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,440
He kept the rest to himself.

890
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,040
He is smart.

891
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,090
He thought I must be sent by some important official,

892
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,000
so he wanted to get on good terms with me.

893
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,020
He sold the rest of the raw silk to me

894
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,810
at the market price last year.

895
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,800
Good.

896
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,540
The silk price is turbulent this year.

897
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,290
The silkworm raisers suffered a lot.

898
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,260
We are not here for money.

899
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,880
It's okay to make less.

900
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,130
You are generous.

901
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,410
I remember the Yan family's accident

902
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,950
happened at Yan Lin's coming-of-age ceremony.

903
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,210
Now I've ruined Zhou Yinzhi's move in advance

904
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,470
and warned the Yan family to take precautions.

905
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,030
I think things can be changed.

906
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,940
But the Xue family's grudge against the Yan Family wasn't formed in one day.

907
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,850
I need to make more plans

908
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,680
if I want to help the Yan family.

909
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,850
Sister Jiang.

910
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,440
Come on in.

911
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,280
A chef from Yuhang came to our mansion.

912
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,630
He's best at making pastry.

913
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,620
I heard that you grew up in Jiangnan,

914
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,890
so I'm here to share it with you.

915
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,180
Baoying is an expert at eating.

916
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,790
So,

917
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,130
I followed her here to have some.

918
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,780
Its reputation is well deserved.

919
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,520
Compared with those time-honored brands in the capital,

920
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,450
it's as good if not better.

921
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,380
You don't like it, Sister Jiang?

922
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,360
It's delicious.

923
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,810
It's just that

924
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,400
I don't like the sweet taste very much.

925
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,310
No offense.

926
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,650
I knew it.

927
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:54,780
Even the Empress Dowager likes

928
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,340
the pastry from Baoying's mansion.

929
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,180
Well.

930
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,500
Since you don't like it,

931
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:59,830
