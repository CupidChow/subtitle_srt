00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,180
You're so talented.

189
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,070
I must thank you on behalf of Zhiyi.

190
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,570
I'm flattered.

191
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,300
[Study Partner Enrollment]

192
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,020
[Jiang Xuening, the legitimate daughter of the Vice Minister for Revenue]

193
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,200
How could this happen?

194
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,850
How could it be Ning?

195
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:34,890
My Lady.

196
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,930
You are not mistaken.

197
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,120
The study partner-to-be from the Jiang family

198
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,570
is indeed Ning.

199
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,880
But you clearly told me

200
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,870
when you submitted the report,

201
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,620
Hui's name was written on it.

202
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,150
How did it become

203
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,790
Ning's?

204
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,630
Now I know it.

205
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,140
My Lady.

206
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,840
You've been lying to me all along.

207
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,880
-My lady.
-You did it on purpose. You lied to me.

208
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,220
Nonsense!

209
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,490
-What nonsense?
-How could I mess around with this?

210
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,450
The list was going to be reported to His Majesty.

211
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,800
This concerns the safety of the Jiang family.

212
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,320
How could this happen?

213
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,550
How could it be?

214
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,760
Was it you?

215
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,690
Did you

216
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,230
plan some schemes

217
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,300
or play some dirty tricks

218
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,980
to replace it with your name?

219
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,580
If I'm really so capable that I could hide it from you,

220
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,160
you should be proud of me.

221
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,540
Then the Jiang family will have no worries in the future.

222
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,120
You...

223
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,120
Stop there!

224
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:34,840
You...

225
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,950
Alright, My Lady.

226
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,870
Alright.

227
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,910
I'm so angry.

228
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,380
Hui's still here.

229
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,710
Hui.

230
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,530
His Majesty made the list himself.

231
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,020
No one can change it.

232
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,420
But I can promise you,

233
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,740
in the future,

234
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,850
if there's any chance,

235
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,540
I will try to ensure you are enrolled.

236
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,810
It's okay.

237
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,370
Don't worry about me.

238
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,450
It's a great honour to us

239
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,860
for Ning to be selected.

240
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,050
It's the same.

241
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,280
Good girl.

242
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,700
Who is trying to harm me?

243
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:24,940
Miss.

244
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,750
Isn't this a good thing?

245
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,490
How could it be a harm?

246
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,210
A good thing?

247
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,540
Forget it. You don't understand.

248
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,310
Miss.

249
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,460
First Young Lady is here.

250
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,690
Mother was too harsh just now.

251
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,000
Please don't take it to heart.

252
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,870
Father asked me to tell you that

253
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,040
after entering the palace,

254
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,350
there's no need to argue with others.

255
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,130
Observe more and talk less.

256
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,390
Ensure you are safe and sound.

257
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,490
If I were you,

258
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,930
who had submitted your name

259
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,090
but failed to get enrolled,

260
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,540
instead,

261
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,280
the ignorant sister was chosen,

262
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,550
I would have given it a thought

263
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,530
about whether I was framed and fooled.

264
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,070
Yet you are a hypocrite.

265
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,390
You even came to give me a gift.

266
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,570
Do you think I am unaware that

267
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,960
you want to enter the palace too?

268
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,370
Yes.

269
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,030
I want to enter the palace.

270
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,800
Every woman in the world has loved prosperity.

271
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,570
For me,

272
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,000
there's no shame in admitting it.

273
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,200
It's just that I failed this time.

274
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,880
I have nothing to complain about.

275
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,910
Everything has its own law of cause and effect.

276
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,580
Now I'm not capable enough

277
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,360
and not destined either.

278
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,600
I remember when I went to the capital four years ago,

279
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,070
you weren't like this.

280
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,360
At least not like now.

281
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,120
Under the cloudy mist,

282
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,060
you are like a living Bodhisattva

283
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,970
and a dummy without joy and sorrow.

284
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,970
Do you know why I don't like you?

285
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,760
It's not just because you're better

286
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,270
and more excellent than me.

287
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,830
You even enjoyed everything I should have.

288
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,850
More importantly,

289
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,620
it's been four years.

290
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,050
You knew your origin,

291
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,280
and you knew everything Wan Niang did

292
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,200
was for you,

293
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,950
but you never

294
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,570
asked me about Wan Niang, not even once.

295
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,600
It's getting late.

296
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:26,920
I'll go back first.

297
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,840
Before Wan Niang passed away,

298
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,890
she had put her heirloom bracelet in my hand

299
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,840
and asked me to give it to you when I came back.

300
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,750
But I never gave it to you.

301
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,970
Because I think

302
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,710
you don't deserve it.

303
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,520
Although Wan Niang is my birth mother,

304
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,620
she caused all of this.

305
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,900
She made the Jiang family,

306
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,070
Mother,

307
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,780
you and I become a joke.

308
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,490
You're not the only one suffering.

309
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,780
If I don't care about Wan Niang,

310
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,500
I am being ungrateful to her for giving birth to me.

311
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,560
But if I care about her,

312
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,240
I'll let Mother down for raising me.

313
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
Since I can't fulfil both sides,

314
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,940
why can't I

315
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,280
be worldly-wise and make myself safe

316
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,920
like what my mother taught me since I was young?

317
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,260
What a wise word.

318
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,130
Jiang Xuehui.

319
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,160
In this world,

320
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,450
not everyone is like you,

321
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,600
who weighs the pros and cons,

322
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,970
being indifferent like a cold-blooded animal.

323
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,880
So it's right that you hate me.

324
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,940
I never thought of taking revenge on you.

325
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,600
Why didn't I realise

326
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,940
you are the one who can be the Empress?

327
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,540
Last time,

328
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,710
I took the chance from Jiang Xuehui on purpose.

329
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,540
But this time,

330
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,860
I have already avoided the palace as much as possible.

331
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,530
Why couldn't I change the direction of development?

332
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,020
No way.

333
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,810
I can't just resign myself to my fate.

334
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,610
The walls in the mansion are like nothing.

335
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,360
If Father finds out

336
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
someone keeps playing the same trick without reflecting on it,

337
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,140
he'll start to nag again.

338
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,110
He didn't find out this time, did he?

339
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,250
Now you've accepted my gift.

340
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,850
You can't tell Mr. Jiang about it.

341
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,630
It's only been a few days.

342
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,620
How did you hurt your hand?

343
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,690
I went to the military camp

344
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,680
to train using swords and sticks.

345
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,100
It's inevitable to get hurt.

346
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:50,860
It's no big deal.

347
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,690
Who in Tongzhou Camps

348
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,050
dared to hurt you?

349
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,440
One of the Xingwu Guards.

350
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,890
Although he was led astray,

351
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,690
he is a good man.

352
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,230
Recently, he often came to the camp

353
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,900
to duel with me.

354
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,220
Speaking of him,

355
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,160
I heard something new about him recently.

356
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:09,930
It is said that

357
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,090
he has a good horse

358
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,930
and he loves it very much.

359
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,110
Everyone in Xingwu Guards knows that.

360
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,540
But one day,

361
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,710
when he heard that the horse was sick,

362
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,450
he hurried back to his residence

363
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,200
and found that it was hard to recover,

364
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,030
he killed the horse

365
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,270
with his own hands.

366
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,090
Others asked him why he did so.

367
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,190
Guess what he said.

368
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,900
"The horse was like my close kin.

369
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,900
However, it was seriously ill.

370
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,950
To save it from torture,

371
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,550
I killed it on my own.

372
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,390
First,

373
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,110
to give it a quick death.

374
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,060
Second,

375
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,160
to give a good end to my love for it over the years."

376
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,050
Ning.

377
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,500
Do you think he is somehow

378
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,520
a little unusual?

379
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,500
Ask someone to tell Zhou Yinzhi

380
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,070
that his beloved horse is sick and dying.

381
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,480
He should come back and have a look.

382
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,030
Are you talking about Zhou Yinzhi?

383
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,020
How do you know?

384
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,530
Do you know him?

385
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,360
I heard about him.

386
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,250
But Zhou Yinzhi

387
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,210
was originally an orphan found on our farm.

388
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,310
He grew up raising horses on the farm.

389
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,319
Then he used me to enter the capital

390
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,020
and joined the Ministry of Revenue with my father,

391
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,400
then joined Xingwu Guards after the Ministry of Revenue.

392
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,599
Anyway,

393
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,050
he's a social climber.

394
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,500
I don't think he's simple.

395
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,150
Regarding the rumour saying he killed the horse,

396
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:23,950
what do you think?

397
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,210
I don't know whether it's true or false,

398
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,190
but since he could kill his horse,

399
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,850
his decisiveness

400
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,670
is clear to be seen.

401
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,970
I think the other way.

402
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,340
He liked the horse so much,

403
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,830
but he killed it without hesitation.

404
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,220
He's really ruthless.

405
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,130
You must be careful

406
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,120
with this kind of person by your side.

407
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,110
You worry too much.

408
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,790
Even if he's really here for something,

409
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,200
I'm not afraid

410
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,230
because I did nothing wrong.

411
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,680
That's not true.

412
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,920
Alright, let's not talk about him.

413
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,350
Open it.

414
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,140
I know you are too lazy to shell pine nuts.

415
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,240
Didn't you hurt your hand?

416
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,190
It's not a big deal.

417
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,580
I still can do it even if my finger is broken.

418
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:09,850
What's wrong?

419
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,330
You don't like it?

420
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,340
I knew it.

421
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,640
I should have bought chestnuts for you.

422
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:14,960
No.

423
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,580
I like it.

424
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,220
Why aren't you eating?

425
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,330
Forget it.

426
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,490
Let it be.

427
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,310
Next time,

428
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,210
I'll bring you something else.

429
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,180
Tell me.

430
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,820
Aren't you going to the palace

431
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,950
to be the study partner of the princess these days?

432
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,700
Your teacher is even going to be Mr. Xie.

433
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,420
How do you feel?

434
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,380
Wait.

435
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,890
You just came back.

436
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,550
Yet you knew that I was going to be a study partner?

437
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,170
The princess told me earlier that

438
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,990
she would want to choose a study partner.

439
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,440
I told her

440
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,600
to add you in.

441
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,820
Weren't you curious about

442
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,370
things you'd never seen before?

443
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,110
You were also keen to know about the palace.

444
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,490
This is a great opportunity.

445
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,360
How could I forget my Ning?

446
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,070
How is it?

447
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:53,980
Did I

448
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,380
do well on this?

449
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,900
At the end of the day,

450
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,390
you're the one who messed up with me?

451
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,570
You really did a good job.

452
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,950
What a surprise.

453
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,190
It's worth it knowing you are glad.

454
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,130
Speaking of Mr. Xie...

455
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,570
Today is a good time to do so.

456
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,520
Let's go.

457
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,570
I'll take you to a place.

458
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,270
Let's go.

459
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:15,870
Let's go.

460
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,260
The sound of the qin is treble and delicate.

461
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,130
It feels like a phoenix living on a Chinese parasol tree.

462
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,020
It's indeed a great qin, which is rare to be found.

463
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,470
Although it's top-quality,

464
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,730
unfortunately,

465
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,740
this is the shop owned by Forever the Second Best.

466
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,180
I wondered who it was.

467
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,430
Isn't this the Scholar Jia,

468
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,410
who failed the exam three times?

469
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,270
You can't even write a good article.

470
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,930
How dare you call me a bad omen?

471
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,750
Instead of that, I'm afraid

472
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,100
[Master of Youhuang Store, Lyu Xian]

473
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,580
you'd lower the temperament of my place.

474
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,190
Lyu Xian,

475
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,700
you started a business.

476
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,880
You should welcome all kinds of guests.

477
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,160
Besides,

478
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,360
you and Mr. Xie took the exams together all the way.

479
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,900
When he ranked first in the Entry-Level Exam, you ranked second.

480
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,450
When he ranked first in the Provincial Exam, you ranked second.

481
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,900
When he ranked first in the National Exam,

482
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,100
you still ranked second.

483
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,220
Was I wrong

484
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,440
to say you are Forever the Second Best?

485
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,650
Are you buying or not?

486
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,860
Pay up if you are.

487
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,060
It costs 880 taels of silver.

488
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,280
So expensive?

489
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,000
The original price of the qin was 88 taels.

490
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,770
I'll use the rest

491
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,310
to burn incense and wash my hands

492
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,330
to get rid of

493
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,180
his pedantic stupidity revealing his poverty.

494
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,860
Lyu Xian, you've gone too far!

495
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,470
What?

496
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,890
Do you want to fight?

497
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,860
I'm not talented,

498
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,400
but a scholar from Hanlin Academy.

499
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,740
My left eye

500
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,650
has read all the classics.

501
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,440
So it costs 500 taels of gold.

502
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,890
My right hand

503
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,270
has written notes on all thousand-year articles.

504
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,190
Its price is 1,000 taels of silver.

505
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,400
Just with you?

506
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,830
Can you afford to hurt them?

507
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,290
This...

508
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,700
You're a disgrace to the educated class.

509
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,050
I don't want to argue with you.

510
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,540
Let's go.

511
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,690
-Let's go.
-Is he Lyu Xian?

512
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,520
I often heard people say that

513
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,410
you must buy the qin sold by a scholar.

514
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,260
He's indeed trying to rip us off.

515
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:50,930
It doesn't matter if it's expensive.

516
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,760
What matters is the stuff is of top quality.

517
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,400
Mr. Xie loves playing the qin.

518
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,810
Now you are going to the palace to learn to play the qin,

519
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,900
you should bring a good one with you.

520
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,540
Even if Mr. Xie is strict when teaching,

521
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,440
he will be more tolerant of you

522
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,540
for the sake of the qin.

523
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,900
Your Highness,

524
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,260
you are finally here.

525
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,830
Originally,

526
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
I found five qins.

527
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,790
One of them was newly made by Gu Benyuan in Jiangning.

528
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,990
But I arrived too late.

529
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,990
When I went there,

530
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,420
Gu Benyuan had already given that qin

531
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,540
to Xie Ju'an.

532
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,590
He's a famous qin master.

533
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,040
Now he's over 70 years old.

534
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,340
It'll take at least three years to get one qin from him.

535
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,740
Yet he gave it to others as a free gift.

536
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,650
Exactly.

537
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,860
It was such a good qin.

538
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,480
If I bought it with thousands of taels of gold,

539
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,440
I'd even dare to sell it to you after doubling the price.

540
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,390
Xie Ju'an

541
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,900
cut off my way of making money.

542
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,460
Is he tired of

543
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,170
living a long life?

544
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,780
Ning, which one do you like?

545
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,110
At my level,

546
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,100
all is the same to me.

547
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:45,830
How about that one?

548
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,710
You indeed have good taste.

549
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,410
This qin is an ancient qin from 300 years ago.

550
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,960
It's called Jiao'an.

551
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,750
Its sound is deep and resonant on open strings,

552
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,950
while its overtones sound clear and smooth.

553
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,970
And it's not expensive,

554
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,900
only costing 3,000 taels.

555
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,330
Let's just take it.

556
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,460
No way.

557
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,240

558

This is too pricey.

Besides, you've given me so many gifts.

560
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,180
If you buy me this qin on top of that,

561

I won't be able to repay your kindness all my life.

562
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,430
Why bother to repay?

563

567
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,240
I'll go and get a carriage.

568

Wait for me here.

569

Why are you here?

572
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,490
Did You Yue bully you again?

573
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,620
She didn't bully me.

574
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,770
I wanted to visit you at Jiang Mansion.

575
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,070
I didn't expect to come across you here.

576
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,560
This is the money you gave me last time.

577
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,260
After arranging my mother's funeral,

578
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,890
I still have much left.

please take it.

585

Is this what you meant by saying that

she didn't bully you?

587
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,210

588
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,180
do you still want to live like this?

589
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,960
You used to be careful in every detail of life

590
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,970
because of your mother.

591
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,630
But now that she's gone.

592
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,460
Are you still going to be mistreated in the You family?

593
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,600
But do I...

594
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,890
have a choice?

595
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,440
If you trust me,

596
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,010

597
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,920
Although you can't leave the You family for now,

598
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,350
you can surely change your fate

599
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,260

Thank you.

607
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,820
I've finally found out.

608
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,960
Miss Jiang

609
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,430
is indeed going to the palace.

610
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,200
But she seemed

611
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,030
reluctant to do so.

612
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,290
I see.

613
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,800
That's it?

614
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:28,950
What else?

615
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,450
Jiang Boyou is just a Vice Minister.

616
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,700
There's nothing you can ask from him.

617
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,010
Why did you help the First Princess

618
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,480
to send Miss Jiang to the palace?

619
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,120
I think

620
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,020
Miss Jiang is quite good-looking.

621
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,610
He tried so hard

622
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,980
to be her teacher.

623
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,810
Does he have a crush on her?

624
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,070
Mr. Lyu indeed has literary talent.

625
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,690
In spite of that,

626
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,790
what did you mean

627
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,820
by tired of living?

628
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:55,950
It was needed in that situation.

629
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,530
I was just simply saying.

630
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,280
Did you also simply record the 3,000 taels of income

631
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,940
in the account book?

632
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:02,560
You...

633
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,450
You even know about business matters?

634
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
I worked hard to make money for you.

635

637
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:13,510
Fine.

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,120
I just got the money.

639
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,700
It hasn't been a while.

640

Besides, the late payment interest

641

will be paid with a few good qins outside.

642

You are such a scourge.

643
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,190
You will surely be cursed for a thousand years.

You've been lighting it for four years.

649

But you didn't engrave any names on it.

to take a look at you all

748
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,690

Did I arrive late?

The etiquette in the palace is just a formality.

It doesn't matter if you can't master it.

asked me to nominate you,

891
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,620
and I did want you to enter the palace.

892
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,530
But there are rules for the selection of a study partner.

893
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,070
If the name was not presented at the beginning,

894
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,140
she couldn't manage to be my study partner.

895
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,860
It took me a long time

896
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,800
to get permission from His Majesty.

897
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,310
What do you think?

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,150
Am I nice to you?

899
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,010
Are you glad for that?

900
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,470
It turns out that the princess is also involved in sending me to the palace.

901

I'm glad.

902
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,450
I'm so glad.

00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,780
I like you anyway.

904
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,940
If anything happens in the palace these days,

905
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,910
just ask someone to report to me.

906

It's my fault for sneaking into your place to steal the test paper.

Viscount Yan is a candid man.

920

I have no reason to punish you.

921
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,870
But I have a question

922
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,740
to ask you.

923
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,600
Are you sure

924
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,790
the person you love also loves you?

925
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,140
I think

926
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:19,940
it doesn't matter.

927
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,490
You said

928
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,200
a gentleman should do what he should and not what he shouldn't.

929
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,380
I only do what I want to do

930
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,930
without forcing others.

931
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,040
Okay.

932
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,000
You may leave now.

933
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,680
Thank you, sir.

934
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,740
Let's go.

935
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:37,900
Sir,

936
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,440
can you help Ning

937
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:40,740
for the sake of us?

938
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,750
Don't push your luck.

939
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,430
Let's go.

940
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,410
Let's go.

941
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,130
Why didn't my mother tell me

942
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,920
entering the palace could be so torturing?

943
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,270
Exactly.

944
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,860
The divination tells us that after rain comes the sunshine.

945
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,900
But who would have thought that

946
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,210
we would be so exhausted by studying etiquette?

947
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,230
Yet we don't know how hard it will be in the future.

948
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,370
The beginning is always hard.

949
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,390
Her Highness is friendly

950
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,780
and easy-going.

951
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,730
Everything will be fine when the class starts.

952
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,600
Shu,

953
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,580
I don't see Her Highness much,

954
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,360
but I rarely see her being so nice to someone.

955
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,330
The second daughter of the Jiang family

956
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,270
only put on makeup for her.

957
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,470
Why was she worth being treated like this?

958
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,490
If it was just makeup,

959
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,400
it wouldn't be like this.

960
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,590
What matters is what she said back then.

961
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,740
Those words...

962
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,230
Xi,

963
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,020
you and I will never be able to say them.

964
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,360
If I hadn't acted rashly in the You family that day,

965
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,630
I wouldn't have gained acknowledgement from Her Highness.

966
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,210
Although I've avoided the calamity I went through before,

967
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,520
I'm involved in another trouble.

968
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,150
It'll not work anymore to provoke Matron Su.

969
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,560
I have to change to another plan.

970
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,720
There will be a written test later.

971
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,470
There's no way First Princess can handle Xie Wei.

972
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,930
The other teachers in the palace are very conservative too.

973
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,600
If I scribble on the paper,

974
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,180
I will surely be expelled from the palace.

975
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,050
Is Miss Jiang here?
