This happened right after we entered the palace.

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,750
I was almost scared to death.

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,000
It is just a jade ruyi scepter.

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,360
You don't have to exaggerate.

41
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,200
I just saw a few words on the jade ruyi scepter.

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,500
"Loyal Souls". What does it mean?

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,100
"Loyal Souls"?

44
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,690
You saw these two words?

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
didn't you recall anything?

47
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,720
Are you talking about

48
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,840

49
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,800

-What if I break the taboo? -What is it?

53
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,830
It is a rumor which started 20 years ago.

54
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,560
Lord Pingnan is the younger brother of the former emperor.

55
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,910
He lost in the competition for the throne

56
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,230
and was sent to the fief.

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,710
But he didn't give up.

58
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,010
He trained troops in secret.

59
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,010
20 years ago, he led his troops to the north

60
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,950
and occupied the capital.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,000
The troops of Lord Pingnan surrounded the palace.

62
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,280
The former emperor escaped because he had left the palace for his recuperate.

63
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,390
Empress Dowager was an empress at that time.

64
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,190
His Majesty was a crown prince at that time.

65
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,350
They were still in the palace.

69
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,630
Lord Pingnan broke in the palace,

70
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,240
but he found no trace of Empress Dowager and His Majesty.

[Lord Pingnan]

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
So he suspected there was a secret passage

73
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,000
which helped them escape from the palace.

74
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,850
Hurry up.

75
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,550
But the rebels had surrounded the city.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,240
If Empress Dowager and His Majesty

77
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,200
escaped from the palace,

78
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,180
they must pass the gates of the city before leaving the city.

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,460
The rebels sent soldiers to guard the gates of the city immediately.

80
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,180
No one were allowed to leave.

81
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,150
Stop!

82
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,940
Lord Pingnan hated the former emperor so much.

83
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,120
He refused to give up unless he found His Majesty.

84
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,600
So,

85
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,459
he sent soldiers to search the city.

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,060
When the soldiers met children,

87
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,080
they arrested them without explanation.

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,680
It was a winter.

89
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,850
Lord Pingnan asked a servant to identify the crown prince.

90
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,440
It was bitterly cold.

91
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,190
The children wore thin clothes

92
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,110
and knelt in the snow.

93
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,890
But none of them was the crown prince.

94
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,040
Not him.

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,300
Not him.

96
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,430
Not him.

97
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,020
Lord Pingnan was so furious

98
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,120
that he ordered people

99
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,130
to hand over the crown prince in three days.

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,450
Otherwise, the people who were arrested

101
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,460
would be killed.

102
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,910
Spread my order.

103
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,600
Hand the crown prince over in three days.

104
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,030
Otherwise,

105
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,360
I'll kill all the people

106
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,940

107
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,180
I'll kill them all.

108
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,510
Yes.

109
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,400
At the critical moment,

110
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,470
seven-year-old Viscount Dingfei, who was from the Mansion of Duke of Xue,

111
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,430
stepped forward.

112
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,950
He posed as the crown prince

113
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,230
in order to save

114
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,400
the lives of innocent people.

116
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,800
However...

117
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,220
Kill them!

118
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,670
He killed them all?

119
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,890
Viscount Dingfei was also killed.

120
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,330
What happened next?

121
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,880
What happened?

122
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,170
Later,

123
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,040
Duke of Xue and Marquis of Yan

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
sent reinforcements to defeat the rebels

125
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,640
and recaptured the capital.

126
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,370
Before Lord Pingnan escaped,

127
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,260
he set fire

128
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,860
to destroy the corpses and his trace

129
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,050
and cover up his crime.

130
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:53,680
After that,

131
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,409
the former emperor ordered a great funeral for the 300 loyal souls

132
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,750
and placed gravestones at a mountain behind the Baiguo Temple.

133
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,890
Viscount Dingfei was also buried there.

134
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,790
They were heroes who died for the crown prince.

135
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,510
So the Gravestone Forest of the Baiguo Temple

138
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,870
Every time

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,310
Empress Dowager thinks of this,

140
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,410
she feels sorry for those innocent people.

141
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,280
So she never allows anyone to mention it.

142
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,790
If she felt sorry for those innocent people,

143
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,280
she should feel guilty.

144
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,580
But Empress Dowager

145
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,240
didn't seem to feel guilty today.

146
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,580
But

147
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,060
Lord Pingnan captured innocent people

148
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,990
to smoke His Majesty out.

149
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,490
Viscount Dingfei already posed as His Majesty.

150
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,300
Why did he still kill them all?

151
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,870
Lord Pingnan was a tyrannical rebel.

152
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,520
Maybe he just wanted to vent his anger.

153
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,250
Miss Yao,

154
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,980
what do you think?

155
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,730
I'm not sure.

156
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,370
But I think even if he was a rebel,

157
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,990
he wouldn't kill people for no reason.

158
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,340
The 300 innocent lives

159
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,670
were in the hands of Lord Pingnan.

160
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,090
Viscount Xue stepped forward

161
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,700
not only for the righteousness of the world,

162
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,210
but also for the loyalty of the officials.

163
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,830
At such a young age,

164
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,030
he made such a decision.

165
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,650
I really admire him.

166
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,230
So Viscount Xue

167
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,270
was Sister Xue's older brother?

168
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,320
That's right.

169
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,860
Viscount Dingfei was not only the son of Duke of Xue,

170
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,210
his birth mother was the older sister of Marquis of Yan, Yan Mu.

171
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,150
He was the only person

172
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,690
whose parents were both from noble families.

173
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,580
I know that.

174
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,630
Madam Yan was prostrate with grief after her son's death.

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,960
She divorced Duke of Xue that year.

[Mansion of Duke of Xue]

177
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,080
Shortly after returning to Mansion of Marquis of Yan,

178
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,549
she died of illness.

179
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,590
The Yan family and the Xue family

180
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,500
seemed to be estranged

181
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,429
after this matter.

182
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,169
I also heard

183
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,420
the former Duke of Xue had three sons.

184
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,940
Today's Duke of Xue was not supposed to inherit the title.

185
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,990
But later, Duke of Xue married Madam Yan.

186
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,710
With the support of the Yan family,

187
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,200
Duke of Xue turned the tables

188
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,210
and won the title.

189
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,210
[Respect and Peace]

190
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,080
But three months after Madam Yan passed away,

191
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,510
Duke of Xue married another woman.

192
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,450
Indeed,

193
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,500
the huge Mansion of Duke of Xue

194
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,620
needed to be run by a woman.

195
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,490
It was not wrong of him to marry again

196
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,190
a few months after his first wife's death.

197
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,520
But his new wife gave birth to their first daughter

198
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,510
less than seven months

199
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,360
after their marriage.

200
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,380
This is

201
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,370
quite interesting.

202
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,640
Sister Yao.

203
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,710
Is it true

204
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,640
that Sister Xue was born prematurely?

205
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,710
That's true.

206
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,240
What are you talking about?

207
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:38,920
Shu.

208
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,540
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,180
I didn't mean to...

210
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,900
Although my mother is my father's second wife,

211
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,450
she's still his lawful wife.

212
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,940
There's nothing you can't say.

213
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,940
But we're in the palace.

214
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,060
How dare you

215
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,740
talk about things

216
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,810
you don't know well?

217
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,540
Are you tired of

218
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,130
being alive?

219
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,970
Do you want to die?

220
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,220
Sister Xue.

221
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,190
It's all my fault.

222
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,350
I insisted on asking them about the past.

223
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,730
This is why many things were mentioned.

224
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:06,920
All right.

225
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,570
You must know if others heard

226
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,130
what you said today,

227
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,580
you would be in trouble.

228
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,700
We have class tomorrow.

229
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,480
You may leave now.

230
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,100
Yes.

231
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Why do I think so much?

232
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,800
No matter how tragic the case of the 300 Loyal Souls is,

233
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,080
it happened in the past.

234
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,870
It has nothing to do with me

235
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,070
and the Yan family.

236
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,700
Why bother?

237
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,220
Huang Renli.

238
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,330
You've been in the palace for 40 years.

239
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,320
You should know that there is no good-for-nothing in the palace.

240
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,970
If you find nothing in the Imperial Household Department, investigate in the whole palace.

241
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,620
I don't believe

242
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,110
that jade ruyi scepter

243
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,550
appeared out of thin air.

244
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,890
Get out and investigate!

245
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes.

246
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,050
Mother.

247
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,060
Mother.

248
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,970
In my opinion,

249
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,020
we can let it go.

250
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,490
Didn't Brother say

251
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,730
we can't shake people?

252
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,180
It's just a jade ruyi scepter.

253
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,030
Just destroy it.

254
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,720
Why should we

255
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,020
stir things up?

256
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,720
Those bastards are as bold as brass.

257
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,680
If we don't punish them severely,

258
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,970
they'll make trouble again.

259
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,690
If you only act on impulse,

260
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,270
how will you rule the world in the future?

261
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,990
I don't care about the world.

262
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,620
Why do you twist my arm?

263
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,760
Your brother is sick.

264
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,160
Zheng failed to give birth to a prince.

265
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,270
If you don't inherit the throne,

266
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,970
are you going to

267
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,530
give the throne to the rebel, Lord Pingnan?

268
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,620
Why don't you

269
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,550
kill me and your younger sister now?

270
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,060
You're always like this.

271
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,110
Sometimes I can't even tell

272
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,920
whether you're Empress Dowager

273
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,180
or the mother of us.

274
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:37,750
You...

275
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,590
Brother.

276
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,560
Stop it.

277
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,390
Show some respect!

278
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,380
Mother, don't be angry.

279
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,370
I'm not going to class today.

280
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,610
I'll stay here with you.

281
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,530
[Xie Mansion]

282
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,000
The situation is tense.

283
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,450
Are you still going to teach lessons in the palace?

284
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,350
You've allayed His Majesty's suspicion yesterday.

285
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,610
You don't have to worry.

286
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,050
That's a temporary solution.

287
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,610
Only by going on as usual

288
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,410
and keeping calm,

289
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,010
won't we let the cat out of the bag.

290
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,710
What's more,

291
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,090
the Imperial Household Department investigated the whole night.

292
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,060
I'm afraid

293
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,490
our men have already been in trouble.

294
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,110
So no matter what,

295
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,870
I have to send them a message.

296
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,850
You're going to the palace alone.

297
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,600
You must be careful.

298
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,460
Don't worry.

299
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,450
I'll ask Dao Qin to find out the whereabouts of Deputy Gong Yi

300
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,330
and ask Lyu Xian to keep an eye on the Xue family and the Yan family.

301
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,700
If you have any news,

302
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,420
tell me immediately.

303
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:39,830
Yes.

304
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,560
First Princess asked for leave today.

305
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,530
You

306
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,590
can learn some simple poems first.

307
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,480
Turn to page one

308
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,860
and read the poem together.

309
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,350
The valley is full of pines.

310
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,680
There is no end in sight.

311
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,880
Read louder.

312
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,700
I can hear voices.

313
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,620
I can hear the sounds of streams.

314
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,040
It is a long road in the wilds.

315
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,910
Jiang Xuening.

316
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,540
Why don't you read it?

317
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,840
Sir.

318
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,970
I'm slow-witted.

319
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,130
This poem is quite obscure.

320
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,940
It is hard to understand it just by reading it.

321
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,940
Could you paraphrase it first

322
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,160
so that we can learn it well?

323
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,410
You...

324
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,680
I only asked you why you didn't read it.

325
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,070
Did I ask you to talk so much?

326
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,970
I...

327
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,530
Just do as I say.

328
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,740
How could you ask questions casually

329
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,600
in the class?

330
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,040
Why are you still studying if you know nothing?

331
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,710
Go.

332
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,020
Stand outside.

333
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,320
A teacher is someone who can propagate the doctrine, impart professional knowledge, and resolve doubts.

334
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,400
If I knew everything,

335
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,140
I would chop off your head first.

336
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,240
I wouldn't need you.

337
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,640
For the next part,

338
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,350
you read after Miss Xue.

339
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,260
Miss Xue.

340
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,040
The word "Wang" in this line

341
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,870
is uncommon.

342
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,300
If you want to know what it means,

343
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,350
you just need to...

344
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,900
Sir.

345
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,820
I know.

346
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,600
Good.

347
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,470
You're indeed a noble lady of the Xue family.

348
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,760
You're really talented.

349
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,000
First Princess can have you as her study partner.

350
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,590
I'm really relieved.

351
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,130
I'm really relieved.

352
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,500
Miss Xue.

353
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,510
Please read.

354
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,790
I have walked a long way in the dark.

355
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,220
I feel hopeless.

356
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,670
I cannot understand.

357
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,760
I do not know the reasons.

358
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,670
I have walked a long way in the dark.

359
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,290
I feel hopeless.

360
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,240
I cannot understand.

361
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,490
I do not know the reasons.

362
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,890
Hanlin Academy seems to have no power,

363
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,360
but the officials here are close to His Majesty.

364
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,840
Imperial examinations, compilation of books, records of history,

365
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,950
and drafts of imperial edicts.

366
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,360
These jobs are done by the officials in Hanlin Academy.

367
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,770
Taking charge of Xingwu Guards doesn't satisfy the Xue family.

368
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,520
They even have designs on this place.

369
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,420
No wonder the Yan family couldn't defeat the Xue family.

370
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,250
But I am grateful.

371
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,260
Because you are with me the whole way.

372
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,080
OK.

373
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,290
That's all for today.

374
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,220
Get some rest.

375
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,320
Mr. Xie.

376
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,700
Your class starts at half past eight.

377
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,150
Why are you here so early?

378
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,750
This is my first qin lesson.

379
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,700
I dare not slack off.

380
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,040
So I came early.

381
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,540
I want to prepare for it just in case.

382
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,220
You really deserve to be the Junior Preceptor.

383
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,750
You're really meticulous.

384
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,890
In that case,

385
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,730
I won't

386
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,370
waste your time.

387
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,770
Come in and sit down.

388
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,069
Place your qins on the table.

389
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,230
The class will start soon.

390
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,420
Emei.

391
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,710
Stop.

392
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,750
Wenzhao Pavilion.

393
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,850
Is it Xie Wei?

394
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,060
Xie Wei loves the qin.

395
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,430
I heard

396
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,850
he made his qin himself.

397
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,110
It is called Emei.

398
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,160
Yes.

399
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,800
Which poem was the name quoted from?

400
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,770
Was it quoted from "There is snow as far as the eye can see on the north of Mount Emei.

401
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,520
The sea was covered with ice which can be carved into a pot"?

402
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,880
Well...

403
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,880
I don't know.

404
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:22,970
Your Majesty!

405
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,500
Your Majesty!

406
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,710
Your Majesty!

407
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,340
Bad news!

408
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,620
Xie Wei burnt his qin and rebelled.

409
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,800
He and Yan Lin's troops

410
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,740
have stormed into the capital.

411
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,670
He burnt his qin and rebelled?

412
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,310
So "Emei" was quoted from "When you have a good reputation,

413
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,480
admire the moon with me in Emei again."

414
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,300
Xie Wei!

415
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,140
So did Xie Wei become the emperor

416
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,260
or admire the moon in Emei eventually?

417
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,160
He did so many things

418
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,150
that everyone thought were wrong

419
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,400
and killed so many people.

420
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,920
If he hadn't become the emperor in the end,

421
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm afraid he would have come to a bad end.

422
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,860
I know

423
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,260
all of you,

424
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,280
including First Princess,

425
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,300
know about the qin.

426
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,850
But I hope

427
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,020
you can forget everything you've learned

428
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,570
and start over.

429
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,790
It is not easy to play the qin.

430
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,270
Sometimes, it is even harder than study.

431
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,140
After learning three years, you can be at an elementary level.

432
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,340
After learning five years, you can be at an intermediate level.

433
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,810
After learning seven years, you can be at an advanced level.

434
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,280
This is true in the academic field.

435
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,750
However,

436
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,470
learning to play the qin is learning the skills.

437
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,950
When you learn the skills,

438
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,650
you'll know how to play the qin.

439
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,050
You're still young.

440
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,610
I can't teach you much

441
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,310
in six months.

442
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,350
But if you can learn some knowledge

443
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,610
and skills,

444
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:47,910
that is not bad.

445
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,790
Sir, you said learning to play the qin is difficult.

446
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,470
How many years have you been learning to play the qin?

447
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,030
What level are you at now?

448
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,870
I've been learning to play the qin since I was four.

449
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,670
Now, I’m still at an elementary level.

450
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,640
You've been learning to play it for more than 20 years.

451
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,280
You're still at an elementary level.

452
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,650
I'm slow-witted.

453
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,590
If you are gifted and intelligent,

454
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,160
it won't take so long.

455
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,090
Sit up straight while learning to play the qin.

456
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,370
Miss Xuening's posture is quite standard.

457
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,180
I'm flattered.

458
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,240
It's a good qin.

459
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,770
Play a part of the Sound of High Mountains.

460
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,370
Let me see your fingering.

461
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,490
The Sound of High Mountains?

462
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,660
Playing Plum Blossom is also okay.

463
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,980
Please forgive me.

464
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm not good at playing the qin.

465
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,520
Do what I do.

466
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:22,850
Enough is enough.

467
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,890
You sat up straight,

468
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,650
but your performance was terrible.

469
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,510
Ning.

470
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,490
You haven't learned to play it at all, have you?

471
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,520
Didn't you ask us

472
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,950
to forget what we've learned

473
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,720
and start over again?

474
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,130
It is a pity that this good qin

475
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,030
is in your hands.

476
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,470
How about I change it to a bad qin?

477
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,330
Jiang Xuening.

478
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,840
I only knew you were naughty.

479
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,420
I didn't expect you to be a good-for-nothing.

480
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:57,740
Get out.

481
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,000
I...

482
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,120
Stand outside until the class is over.

483
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,420
Don't slack off.

484
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,500
I've told him I'm not good at playing the qin.

485
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,790
Nobody is perfect. How can he punish me?

486
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,070
I've been punished all day.

487
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,730
I'm so unlucky.

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,550
Even the wind is bullying me.

489
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,610
Good.

490
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,480
Miss Xue, just practice according to this method.

491
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,810
Stand up straight.

492
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,820
What are you doing?

493
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,170
Sir, let me explain.

494
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,420
I'm standing here. I'm not slacking off.

495
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,830
There's no need for you to cry.

496
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,750
I didn't...

497
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,510
Don't pretend to be strong.

498
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,830
I know.

499
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,990
You must be scared in the Tai'an Hall

500
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,880
yesterday.

501
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,350
No way!

502
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,990
It turns out that it works on Xie Wei.

503
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,970
I didn't mean to punish you.

504
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,320
When you played, the sound was too harsh.

505
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,670
I was afraid you would disturb others.

506
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,760
I know

507
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,300
you've been worried about Yan Lin.

508
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,700
It is understandable that you can't play well for the moment.

509
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,670
All right.

510
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,160
Go in.

511
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,670
I...

512
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,870
I don't know how to play it.

513
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,580
If I could play it well,

514
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,770
I wouldn't have come to learn.

515
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,360
As a teacher, how could you be so strict?

516
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,380
What else do you want?

517
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,290
Although I'm devoted to learning,

518
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm not talented.

519
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,950
I can only give up.

520
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,260
Why don't you

521
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,070
stop my qin lessons?

522
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,420
You stopped pretending?

523
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,830
It's okay if you don't stop them.

524
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,660
But you promised

525
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,500
to let me go back.

526
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,480
You can't go back on your word.

527
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,700
After school today,

528
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,550
stay here alone.

529
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,250
Even a silk purse can be made out of a sow's ear.

530
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,190
You're bad at playing the qin.

531
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,660
As a teacher,

532
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,070
I should go to the trouble of teaching you.

533
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,090
I don't understand.

534
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,240
The rebels finally infiltrated the palace.

535
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,600
They didn't assassinate or poison others.

536
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,900
They just made a jade ruyi scepter

537
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,380
and curved some words on it.

538
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,490
What's the point of it?

539
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,650
It is nothing in your eyes.

540
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,270
But you don't know

541
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,550
it is a thorn

542
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,270
in other people's eyes.

543
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,650
I don't understand my mother.

544
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,270
My brother is always ill.

545
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,640
All the officials haven't talked about inheriting the throne yet.

546
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,090
But she kept forcing me.

547
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,090
Do I have to live for her?

548
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,430
What about you?

549
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,330
Do you really not want to be the crown prince?

550
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,720
It is fine if others don't know me.

551
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,320
Don't you know me?

552
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,560
Crown Prince?

553
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,320
Lord Linzi?

554
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,140
I just want to be an ordinary person.

555
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,230
I want to escape from those hypocritical things

556
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,250
and be myself.

557
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,060
Everyone wants it.

558
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,090
But it is hard.

559
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,390
We can't get what we want.

560
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,700
Some people compete for power,

561
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,640
while others don't want it.

562
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,430
It's destiny.

563
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,610
I feel

564
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,330
you've changed a bit lately.

565
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,300
The date of the coming-of-age ceremony is drawing near.

566
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,610
Isn't it good to be mature?

567
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,440
You're right.

568
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,680
Forget it.

569
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,750
Stop talking about this.

570
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,490
I'm here today

571
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,810
because I want to go for a walk with you.

572
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,980
I know there's a deserted forest in the south.

573
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,280
We can hunt some wild rabbits.

574
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,990
How about

575
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,400
having a match?

576
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,490
Let's go.

577
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,250
The loser should buy alcohol.

578
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,370
OK.

579
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:24,960
Let's go.

580
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:43,930
[Wenzhao Pavilion]

581
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,040
I heard

582
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,330
that you saved a eunuch named Zheng Bao

583
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,600
at the door of Ning'an Palace yesterday.

584
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,540
Her Highness saved him.

585
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,510
Really?

586
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,730
I did help him.

587
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,120
I met a weak person

588
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:22,880
and saved him.

589
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,840
It is nothing.

590
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,060
There's no need to mention it.

591
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,320
I thought after a few things happened,

592
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,950
you and I

593
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,830
could trust each other.

594
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,280
Although Zheng Bao

595
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,740
is inconspicuous in the palace,

596
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,720
But he is in the good graces

597
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,360
of Wang Xinyi in the Imperial Study.

598
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,170
Wang Xinyi has been thinking about promoting Zheng Bao.

599
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,050
You helped him out of kindness.

600
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,860
What a coincidence!

601
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,460
I didn't expect you to know so much

602
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,410
about the palace.

603
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,090
You also know what happens

604
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,410
in the Imperial Study.

605
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,090
I always come to the palace.

606
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,920
Of course I know more than you do.

607
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,640
What about you?

608
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,750
Did you know the relationship between Zheng Bao and Wang Xinyi

609
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,520
and save him purposefully?

610
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,720
Who is Wang Xinyi?

611
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,390
I've only been in the palace for a few days.

612
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,120
I don't know.

613
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,160
Really?

614
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,630
You even know about raw silk

615
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,710
What else do you not know?

616
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,240
I've explained it.

617
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,160
It was a coincidence.

618
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,240
I just came to the palace.

619
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,080
I have no one to rely on.

620
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,560
You wanted me to enter the palace.

621
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,110
Her Highness has been taking good care of me.

622
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
I'm in the limelight.

623
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,930
Some people will be envious.

624
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,150
If no one helped me,

625
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,340
I might die one day.

626
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,610
That's why I thought

627
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,460
if I could save a eunuch,

628
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,800
he might be useful in the future.

629
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,820
My motive was not pure.

630
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,880
But it had nothing to do with the safety of the Yan family.

631
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,660
I didn't break my promise either.

632
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,530
You suspected me.

633
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,840
Does it count as trust?

634
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,270
You feel wronged?

635
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,820
You said

636
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,140
I don't have to pretend

637
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,850
in front of you.

638
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,420
I've told you the truth.

639
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,790
Are you angry again?

640
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,240
Forget it.

641
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,810
Things in the palace are always changing.

642
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,500
It is not bad for you to be careful.

643
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,290
But I have to remind you.

644
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,000
If you got involved in the dispute,

645
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,960
you might be in danger.

646
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,960
I was entrusted by Yan Lin.

647
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,280
I also agreed to your father's request.

648
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,420
That's why I'm reminding you.

649
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,800
You're still young.

650
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,800
Be careful.

651
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,360
Don't make mistakes.

652
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,470
You're also young.

653
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,750
What did you say?

654
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,220
I'm asking

655
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,990
if Zheng Bao will really

656
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,700
be promoted by Wang Xinyi in the future.

657
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,360
He's not as good as you.

658
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:21,980
All right.

659
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,000
Play the tune

660
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,450
that you learned in class.

661
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,360
Are you really going to teach a lesson?

662
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,180
What?

663
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,120
You don't want to learn?

664
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,340
Fine.

665
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,070
Just stay here.

666
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,810
Go back when the door closes.

667
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,640
Sir.

668
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,650
Let's call it a day.

669
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,270
Why do you torture me

670
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,640
and yourself?

671
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,500
Shut up.

672
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,990
Keep playing.

673
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,140
What's wrong with him?

674
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,730
Why did he pick on me?

675
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,580
Does he have nothing to do?

676
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,490
Isn't it good to go home early?

677
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,140
Every line in this tune corresponds.

678
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,680
When it comes to the end of every line,

679
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,570
you have to press a finger against the string.

680
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,810
You're pressing your finger against the string too hard.

681
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,640
You need to relax.

682
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,310
Are there any problems?

683
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,350
Why don't you get up?

684
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,690
I was reckless.

685
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,770
Luckily, the qin is fine.

686
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,160
I'm glad you know that.

687
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,250
Where did the cat come from?

688
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,090
It's so cute.

689
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,770
Sir, look.

690
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,300
Sir, look.

691
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,179
How dare you do that?

692
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:10,540
I...

693
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,980
I asked you here to learn to play the qin,

694
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,469
not to have fun.

695
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,900
If you can't play well tomorrow,

696
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,219
don't come to class again.

697
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,810
Go back!

698
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,940
He said we should trust each other,

699
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,350
but he went off all of a sudden.

700
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,440
He's moody.

701
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,080
I wanted to ask him about the jade ruyi scepter.

702
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,300
Now...

703
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:54,830
Miss Jiang.

704
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,610
Greetings, Miss Jiang.

705
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,510
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

706
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,480
How do you know I saved you?

707
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,230
Yesterday, it was Her Highness who saved you.

708
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,830
I've been in the palace since childhood.

709
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,100
I know what I should know.

710
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,980
The palace is full of people who safeguard themselves.

711
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,970
Even if we were old friends,

712
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,740
no one dared to save me.

713
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,560
Only you

714
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,270
dared to speak up for me at that moment

715
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,220
even if we didn't know each other before.

716
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,060
I want

717
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,630
to thank you for what you did.

718
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,640
But do you know

719
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,340
my motive

720
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,720
was not pure?

721
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,560
Are you disappointed?

722
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,540
Not really.

723
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,860
I'm just confused.

724
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,730
So you came to me today

725
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,590
to repay me?

726
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,440
That was my plan.

727
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,080
What about now?

728
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,360
You saved me.

729
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,770
If you hadn't told me,

730
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,240
your motive was indeed not pure.

731
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,010
Since you told me just now,

732
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,420
your motive was very pure.

733
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,360
That's true.

734
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,650
After all, I helped you

735
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,890
in the hope that you can be used by me.

736
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,910
You're very honest.

737
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,060
You've never seen me being hypocritical.

738
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,690
What did you say?

739
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,650
I know you are an honest and kind person.

740
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,270
If you have loyalty,

741
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,220
swear it to someone who is worthy of it.

742
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:18,710
I

743
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,140
will stay in the palace for only six months.

744
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,440
I'll be honest.

745
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,060
And I won't hurt others.

746
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,890
I'm just afraid

747
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,550
no one will help me when I'm in trouble one day.

748
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,400
So I want to find someone who can help me in advance.

749
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,970
If something happens,

750
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,420
I won't be caught off guard.

751
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,730
You're my saviour.

752
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,390
If you don't want to hurt others,

753
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,470
why can't I help you?

754
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,690
I can be counted as your saviour?

755
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,640
Some things should be judged by people's deeds instead of motives.

756
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,200
There's no good person

757
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,980
who do things out of kindness.

758
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,140
Yes, there is.

759
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,130
Who is it?

760
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,050
I'll let you meet him in the future

761
00:36:59,110 --> 00:36:59,740
if there is a chance.

762
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,250
Thank you for your ledgers.

763
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,770
I learned a lot after reading them.

764
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,260
Please have a seat.

765
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,970
But

766
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,680
there seem to be two errors.

767
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,430
Some accounts are lacking.

768
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,620
I made a calculation again

769
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,560
and wrote them down.

770
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,610
Have a look.

771
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,110
Yes. This page.

772
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,910
Have a look.

773
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,640
Was I wrong?

774
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,190
You might not be wrong.

775
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,560
Maybe I didn't learn well.

776
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,650
I might be wrong.

777
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,390
I was wrong.

778
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,780
You've been learning to do accounts

779
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,040
for a short time.

780
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,530
You've already learned a lot.

781
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,070
No.

782
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,260
I'm slow-witted.

783
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,290
You taught me well.

784
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,900
By the way, Mr. Xu,

785
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,890
the price of silk has multiplied.

786
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,670
Please sell all the silk for me.

787
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,100
Of course I will give you commission.

788
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,540
Miss,

789
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,680
you helped me and the silkworm farmers before.

790
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,630
You don't have to give me

791
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,510
commission.

792
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,600
But

793
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,280
the price of silk keeps rising.

794
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,050
Are you going to selling it now?

795
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,760
I've read your accounts which have been recorded in recent years.

796
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,110
The price of silk will stop rising or falling sooner or later.

797
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,170
The price is almost the highest price.

798
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,490
I don't want to be greedy.

799
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,040
Why do you look at me like that?

800
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,130
Nothing.

801
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,440
I just think

802
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,840
you're suitable

803
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,360
to do business.

804
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,650
Let me have a look.

805
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,300
Sister Yao.

806
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,140
Let me have a look.

807
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,520
Let us have a look.

808
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,650
Sister Yao, tell us.

809
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,370
What does the letter say?

810
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,990
Why are you blushing?

811
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,160
You're annoying.

812
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,660
You're making fun of me.

813
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,210
Isn't this Miss Jiang?

814
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,470
What a coincidence!

815
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,440
There's a piece of good news about Sister Yao.

816
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,600
What happened?

817
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,620
Nothing.

818
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,370
My mother sent me a letter.

819
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,820
It says that my father proposed to the Zhang family for me.

820
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,250
I'll stop talking.

821
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,140
Your father is so strange.

822
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,120
How can a girl take the initiative?

823
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:15,670
No.

824
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,610
Why did you choose Zhang Zhe again?

825
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,190
If I broke off the engagement.

826
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,310
people would criticize me.

827
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,660
But I've thought about it.

828
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,550
It doesn't matter that his family background is poor.

829
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,890
It doesn't matter that his mother is a widow.

830
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,400
I have everything anyway.

831
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,790
I don't need him to worry.

832
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,810
Miss Jiang also said

833
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,820
Mr. Zhang is outstanding.

834
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,920
It's not bad.

835
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,540
I think

836
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,260
you should thank Miss Jiang

837
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,270
for this good marriage.

838
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,670
Xuening.

839
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,660
I misunderstood you before.

840
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,010
If you hadn't said it,

841
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,730
I would have been lost.

842
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:48,720
Thank you.

843
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,040
You're really a good person.

844
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,450
Miss Yao, you don't have to do this.

845
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,850
This marriage

846
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,110
has nothing to do with me.

847
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,300
Miss Jiang is so kind.

848
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,570
You haven't married yet,

849
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,080
but you still have time to care about others.

850
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,480
Why hasn't Viscount Yan come to see you lately?

851
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,090
Did your dream fail through?

852
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,310
You Yue.

853
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,230
[Wenzhao Pavilion]

854
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,690
Sir.

855
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,140
How is it?

856
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,890
Half of our people in the palace died.

857
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,100
The rest dare not act rashly.

858
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,880
What happened?

859
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,500
Mr. Gong Yi

860
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,020
marshalled many people in the palace

861
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,050
in the name of you

862
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,720
and sent that jade ruyi scepter to the Imperial Household Department

863
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,020
after it evaded inspection.

864
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,100
Because all the people in the palace

865
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,470
contact with only one person at a time.

866
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,340
It was too late

867
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,270
when I knew it.

868
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,370
It was really him.

869
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,070
Yesterday Eunuch Huang

870
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,500
checked the records of the Imperial Household Department.

871
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,720
Although he didn't find any evidence,

872
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,190
he found

873
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,210
the time you came to the palace to teach was inappropriate.

874
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,190
I was afraid that you might be framed,

875
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,190
so I took a risk to remind you

876
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,210
outside the Imperial Study.

877
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,070
It's okay.

878
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,520
You did a good job.

879
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,100
But

880
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,760
the situation in the palace is tense.

881
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,390
I'm afraid you can't stay in the Imperial Study anymore.

882
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,840
Find a chance

883
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:25,930
to transfer to another place.

884
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:26,790
Yes.

885
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,610
She's willing to marry into a poor family even if she's from a noble family.

886
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,370
She provides timely help and never adds insult to injury.

887
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,470
She's not snobbish.

888
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,690
She never breaks promises.

889
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,480
Zhang Zhe.

890
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,280
Yao Xi must be a good girl

891
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,300
in your eyes.

892
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,530
Will you agree to this marriage?

893
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,070
I met you again.

894
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,840
Why did you come out again?

895
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,700
How dare you mess around at the door of Wenzhao Pavilion?

896
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,560
Do you want to die?

897
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,640
You're just like me.

898
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,890
We know what we can't do.

899
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,140
But we can't control ourselves.

900
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,730
You don't have to interfere in the matter of the jade ruyi scepter.

901
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,460
You don't have to take a risk to come to me anymore.

902
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,320
The jade ruyi scepter?

903
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,860
It has something to do with him?

904
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,950
But

905
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,200
Duke of Xue has perceived something.

906
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,110
Without our help,

907
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,430
you...

908
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,130
It's fine.

909
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,560
I can handle it.

910
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,890
I saved you from Jinling.

911
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,570
I don't want you to die.

912
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:48,870
From now on,

913
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,020
you don't have to serve others anymore.

914
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,070
You're just a eunuch

915
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,500
in the palace.

916
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,030
Yes.

917
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,200
There's one more thing.

918
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,270
The people sent by Deputy Gong Yi told me

919
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,390
that jade ruyi scepter

920
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,570
was used to frame the Yan family for being disloyal.

921
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,450
I see.

922
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:09,800
Go back.

923
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,480
Be careful not to be seen.

924
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:12,890
Yes.
