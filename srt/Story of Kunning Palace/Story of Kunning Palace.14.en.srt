I just want to explain things to you.

Those rumors

96
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,390
were spread by people with ulterior motives.

I never wanted to marry you.

108
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,040

your loving father

110
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,380

Since it has come to this,

112
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,490
please don't get any more wrong ideas

113
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,520
or involve innocent people

114
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,330

I only rented a house here

It's not because of that.

and simply shares the same interest as you,

153
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,960

what can a contract do to stop him?

183
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,100
I've sent someone to keep an eye on him in Shudi.

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,260
invest her money in the salt well business?

190
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,220
Did she get hold of some secret intel?

191
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,880
I don't know.

192
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,050
Are you trying to fool me?

193
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,310
Fine.

194
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,930
I understand.

195
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,010
How about this?

196
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,210
Give me a price.

197
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,480
From now on, tell me

198
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,900
whatever she tells you.

199
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,970
We are all in the same circle.

200
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,710
I know this much.

201
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,190
No way.

202
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,760
Miss Jiang trusts me so much.

203
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,790
I can’t betray her.

204
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,350
Isn't this enough?

205
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,730
Don't be too demanding.

206
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,900
I can give you another...

207
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,530
100 taels at most!

208
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,070
Why are you suddenly angry at me?

209
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,290
Hey, calm down...

210
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,930
Calm down and talk to me!

211
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,390
Red with green?

212
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,480
What a terrible idea!

213
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,430
Isn't there anyone useful in my palace?

214
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,680
I just came back from my break,

215
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,250
and you're already so angry, Your Highness.

216
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,820
I was so scared that I was about to run back home.

217
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,830
You're finally back.

218
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,100
I thought you had

219
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,470
forgotten about me after your break.

220
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,620
How could you say such harrowing things?

221
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,540
I brought you delicious food

222
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,520
and fun toys from outside the palace.

223
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,510
Even if I forget everyone else, I cannot forget about Your Highness.

224
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,710
A shadow puppet.

225
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,550
My favorite!

226
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,860
I knew it, you treat me the best.

227
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,260
Let's go.

228
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,270
You may leave.

229
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,890
Yes.

230
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,080
Your Highness,

231
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,320
I didn't give you this gift for free.

232
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,320
I have a favor to ask of Your Highness.

233
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,230
You don't need favors for me to help you.

234
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,150
Tell me, did someone

235
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,160
upset you again?

236
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,200
I'll punish them for you.

237
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,240
That's not the case.

238
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,720
But

239
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,640
I still have a lingering fear

240
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,230
about the jade ruyi scepter case.

241
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,730
My family said

242
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,740
I've been ignorant since I was young.

243
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,910
I'm not suitable for the palace.

244
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,920
I just hope Your Highness can make the order

245
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,700
and expel me from the palace.

246
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,820
You want to leave?

247
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,360
Ning.

248
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,920
I treat you so well.

249
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,030
Why do you want to leave?

250
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,020
If you leave, what should I do?

251
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,960
Your Highness, you're royalty.

252
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,810
You don't lack someone like me...

253
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,250
No.

254
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,730
Don't even think about it. Next request.

255
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,960
Fine.

256
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,230
Then...

257
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,070
You know

258
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,520
I really don't like playing the qin.

259
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,300
Can you help me and spare me

260
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,720
from practicing qin at Wenzhao Pavilion?

261
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,100
Mr. Xie gave the order himself.

262
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,330
Your Highness, are you afraid?

263
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,230
How is that possible?

264
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,060
I’m a princess. I’m not afraid of Mr. Xie.

265
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,260
But I spoke for the Yan family a few days ago

266
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,020
and offended Mother.

267
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,350
If Brother Jie also...

268
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:00,840
Anyway,

269
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,750
I can't grant this one either.

270
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,810
Next request.

271
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,940
That's all.

272
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,710
Think of one.

273
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,290
Make a different request.

274
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,470
I'll definitely grant your next request.

275
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,480
Then, Your Highness,

276
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,030
please summon my elder sister to the palace.

277
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,590
With her here,

278
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,150
I'm sure my family can rest assured.

279
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,510
No problem. I'll grant your request.

280
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,170
It's just another study partner.

281
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:19,830
It's not hard.

282
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,990
Thank you, Your Highness.

283
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,810
These are all rewards from Her Highness?

284
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,690
They are so beautiful.

285
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,050
Ning, Her Highness treats you so well.

286
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm so jealous.

287
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,610
Her Highness treats all of us the same.

288
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,810
I received more rewards today.

289
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,170
It will be your turn in the future.

290
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,880
Don't forget me then.

291
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,040
It's too expensive.

292
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,850
Take it.

293
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,060
This looks nice too.

294
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,290
It's just an ordinary reward,

295
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,140
nothing rare or special.

296
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,920
Why are you so angry?

297
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,080
I used to think You Yue was dumb

298
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,700
for always going against Jiang Xuening.

299
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,060
Now I see her getting her way at everything

300
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,480
and I don't get it either.

301
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,880
Why does it seem that everyone dotes on her?

302
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,650
We are from different backgrounds.

303
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,240
We can't learn to be obsequious like her.

304
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,980
You just need to know that

305
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,280
a person who fools others with her beauty

306
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,380
will never last long.

307
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,010
They will see her true colors sooner or later.

308
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,140
Now, my marriage is canceled.

309
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,970
Shu, you're a few months older than me.

310
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,880
Did your family say anything about marriage?

311
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,000
I...

312
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,410
I'll do as my elders say.

313
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,390
This is a new batch of tea. Have a taste, Aunt.

314
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,210
Why is Mother suddenly interested in a game of pitch-pot?

315
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,500
Was it you who wanted to play?

316
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,650
Don't you know

317
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,830
why we're playing pitch-pot?

318
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,920
I was forced to come here because of you.

319
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,670
All right.

320
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,290
No need to keep me company and chat with me.

321
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,580
Go and play.

322
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,100
I'm not good at pitch-pot.

323
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,690
It doesn't matter if you're not good at it.

324
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,110
We have an expert with us here.

325
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,360
Jie,

326
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,430
go play with Shu.

327
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,090
Don't bully her.

328
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,410
You stay.

329
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,970
[Yingchun Pavilion]

330
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,730
How about

331
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,110
I try again?

332
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,790
Thank you, Your Highness.

333
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,710
I've been weak since childhood,

334
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,240
so I didn't like playing these games.

335
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,990
I missed the target.

336
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,800
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

337
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,320
It doesn't matter.

338
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,460
Actually, I didn't like to play it before.

339
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,990
It was Yan Lin who influenced me.

340
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,310
Unfortunately,

341
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,930
he can't enter the palace anymore.

342
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,950
Don't worry, Your Highness.

343
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,650
The innocent will always be innocent.

344
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,470
Viscount Yan will eventually be fine.

345
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,610
Do you really think so?

346
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,430
Your Highness, do you also think that

347
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,780
the Xue family has a grudge against the Yan family,

348
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,770
and will never stop fighting against each other?

349
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,820
That's not what I meant.

350
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,270
I can't interfere in

351
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,900
the family's decisions.

352
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,150
But I can at least control my heart.

353
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,450
I have no hostility towards Viscount Yan.

354
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,630
In fact, I envy him for being so free-willed.

355
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,740
It's rare for you

356
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,950
to think that way.

357
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,240
Aunt wants to set us up.

358
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,540
I know you don't like it,

359
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,890
but I have no choice.

360
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,760
I dare not ask you to let go of your grudges.

361
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,340
But at least,

362
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,730
I don’t want to be a burden to you.

363
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,830
Actually, it's not like that.

364
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,600
We've known each other since childhood.

365
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,940
It's not a burden

366
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,590
for me to play with you.

367
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,660
But when one

368
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,810
forces certain things to happen,

369
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,270
it becomes very uncomfortable instead.

370
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,380
I should have handled myself better too.

371
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,010
Please don't take it to heart.

372
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,440
Matron Su.

373
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,300
It's you.

374
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,710
Matron Su.

375
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,140
Jiang...

376
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,490
Why is she in the palace?

377
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,090
Your Highness,

378
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,560
Miss You from the Mansion of Earl of You suddenly got sick.

379
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,460
She couldn't be a study partner anymore.

380
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,100
Her Highness is missing one study partner.

381
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,810
This is also the daughter of Minister Jiang.

382
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,430
She's here to fill the vacancy.

383
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,470
That's great.

384
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,150
I mean,

385
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,340
Zhiyi likes liveliness.

386
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,540
She will be very happy.

387
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,500
You met her so soon?

388
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,300
I'm afraid Miss Xue is

389
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,610
in a bad mood right now.

390
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,960
Ning,

391
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,570
why did you summon me

392
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,810
into the palace?

393
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,140
The Xue family wants to marry their daughter to Lord Linzi.

394
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,690
You must have heard about it.

395
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,020
Because of this handkerchief,

396
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,470
Xue Shu mistook me for you

397
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,990
and used the means meant for you

398
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,040
on me instead.

399
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,910
I don't want to take the blame for you anymore.

400
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,110
So I brought you here.

401
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,480
You're not angry?

402
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,430
I implicated you in the first place.

403
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,860
If anything,

404
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,450
I should apologize to you.

405
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,720
Besides, after you found out the truth about the handkerchief,

406
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,880
you didn't have to tell me how His Highness felt.

407
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,250
You could have told Miss Xue instead.

408
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,750
But you didn't.

409
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,670
You took care of my feelings

410
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,230
and arranged for me to meet His Highness.

411
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,020
Why should I be angry?

412
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,580
Don't flatter yourself.

413
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,030
I was just afraid that you'd resent me

414
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,080
after you entered the palace.

415
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,960
It's fine if you're not on my side,

416
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,800
but you might even stab me in the back.

417
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,390
Anyway,

418
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,050
you chose your own path.

419
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,050
If you want to marry Lord Linzi and be a princess,

420
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,890
you have to rely on yourself.

421
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,090
Alright, I'm tired.

422
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,650
I've said what I should.

423
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,600
Please leave.

424
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,050
I stole your marriage last time.

425
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,520
I don't owe you anything this time.

426
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,040
[Mansion of Marquis of Yan]

427
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,160
The physician said

428
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,010
you can stop taking medicine

429
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,870
after you finish these two portions.

430
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,000
But you still need to take good care of yourself.

431
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,240
Don't worry too much.

432
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,770
Last night, your room was lit until midnight.

433
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,790
How could you stay up so late?

434
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,830
Now it's your turn to nag at me?

435
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,240
Did Xingwu Guards cause any more trouble lately?

436
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,610
They tried twice to stir trouble.

437
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,660
Later on, Zhou Yinzhi did something,

438
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,770
and now they're more well-behaved.

439
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,240
But Mr. Xie sent someone

440
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,510
to ask about your health several times at night.

441
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,140
I must repay Mr. Xie

442
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,510
for his kindness someday.

443
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,740
Report!

444
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,580
My Lordship.

445
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,200
Young Lord.

446
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,370
The invitation letters we ordered for the young lord's

447
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,940
Coming-of-Age Ceremony have been delivered.

448
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,210
The butler is at the mansion entrance,

449
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,420
checking them with the Xingwu Guards.

450
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,780
So he sent me to ask about it.

451
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,110
Should we still distribute

452
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,050
these invitations?

453
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,420
Why not?

454
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,780
Given the current situation of the Yan Mansion,

455
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,080
even if we send out the invitations,

456
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,990
few would dare to turn up.

457
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,580
Why bother?

458
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,110
Junior Preceptor Xie once taught me that

459
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,720
people's true nature can

460
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,220
only be revealed amid a crisis.

461
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,130
Now Heaven has given us a chance to see clearly.

462
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,290
Why should we

463
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,400
let this chance go to waste?

464
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,250
Go back to the butler.

465
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,740
If the Xingwu Guards refuse to let the invitation senders go,

466
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,480
tell them that

467
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,950
His Majesty only asked the Yan family to cooperate with the investigation.

468
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,410
The Coming-of-Age Ceremony is a duty of courtesy.

469
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,240
Ask them who dares to stop it.

470
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,820
Yes.

471
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,300
An exception was made for Mr. Zhang to attend the court.

472
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,950
It must be Mr. Xie who advised His Majesty to do so.

473
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,140
I wonder what he's planning.

474
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,820
Do you have anything else to report?

475
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,130
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

476
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,930
Ministry of Rites, what is it?

477
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,100
Your Majesty.

478
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,410
The Yan Mansion has been surrounded by Xingwu Guards for days.

479
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,320
Now that Viscount Yan's Coming-of-Age Ceremony is approaching,

480
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,160
by right, the Ministry of Rites should hold the ceremony.

481
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,250
Your Majesty, please give the order

482
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,140
to lift the Yan Mansion's house arrest

483
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,340
so that we can hold the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

484
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,620
Your Majesty,

485
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,190
until the Rebels Case is thoroughly solved,

486
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,620
the Yan family will remain suspects.

487
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,540
At a time like this,

488
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,090
how can they hold a Coming-of-Age Ceremony?

489
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,830
It's not reasonable.

490
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,030
Your Majesty.

491
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,440
His Grace the Duke is right.

492
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,950
But the Rebels Case

493
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,240
is now collaborated by the Ministry of Justice and Xingwu Guards.

494
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,660
But the Yan Mansion

495
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,640
is only guarded by Xingwu Guards.

496
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,280
Even if we want to investigate,

497
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,330
it's hard for us to do so.

498
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,380
Are you implying that

499
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,030
I'm interfering with the Ministry of Justice's investigation?

500
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,590
I wouldn't dare to.

501
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,500
I just think that

502
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,170
the Coming-of-Age Ceremony is an important matter.

503
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,670
It's not something we can delay.

504
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,160
If we miss the date due to delay,

505
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,320
the Ministry of Justice can't afford to be responsible.

506
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,440
All right.

507
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,120
It's just a Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

508
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
Just hold it for him.

509
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,160
The Xingwu Guards will guard the door

510
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,020
and search through any supplies needed for the ceremony.

511
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,760
Nothing will go wrong.

512
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,740
As for the Rebels Case,

513
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,920
I see you pushing responsibilities around

514
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,390
and making little actual progress.

515
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,510
Zhang Zhe.

516
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

517
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,230
Before Gu Chunfang returns to the capital,

518
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,510
you'll be in charge of this case.

519
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,700
I'll grant you the authority.

520
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,590
You have the right to investigate any of the

521
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,740
six ministries in the capital.

522
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,300
You must give me an explanation as soon as possible.

523
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

524
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,810
Miss Xue, you're still young,

525
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,650
yet you are so talented.

526
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,690
It seems that you've worked hard in music.

527
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,040
Thank you, sir.

528
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,970
Elder Miss Jiang is new here.

529
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,250
She's not familiar with the class.

530
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,060
The teachers don't know your skill level either.

531
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,250
When teaching and learning are concerned,

532
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,490
it may be inconvenient for both parties.

533
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,370
Why don't you play us a song?

534
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,210
Well then, Elder Miss Jiang, please play us a song.

535
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,420
Although I'm not good at music,

536
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,660
I'd like to give it a try.

537
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,260
Please excuse my

538
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,560
mediocre skills.

539
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,920
This is considered not good?

540
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,940
Then what are we?

541
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,190
Ning.

542
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,790
Is she really your elder sister?

543
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,470
You two aren't alike at all.

544
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,810
Sister has been smart since she was young.

545
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,890
I can never compare myself to her.

546
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,820
One has to be blind to

547
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,650
think we're the same.

548
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,030
Elder Miss Jiang, you're too modest.

549
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,460
Your skills

550
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,490
are too good

551
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,860
for you to say that you're not good.

552
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,700
You played a very nice tune.

553
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,390
The rest of you should study hard.

554
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,360
Especially you,

555
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,500
Miss Ning'er.

556
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,990
Since you know you're not good at playing qin,

557
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,260

Father and Mother will surely address it.

00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:38,139
She even forced a smile to congratulate her.

744
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,850
It was so funny.

745
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,580
Ning'er.

746
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,929
Have I been too indulgent with you lately?

747
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,150
Do you think you should be

748
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,630
saying these things in front of me?

749
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,540
I can't be too casual with you,

750
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,010
but I can't be too scared of you either.

751
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,240
It's so hard to be me.

752
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,620
Have you had lunch?

753
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,110
What time is it?

754
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,940
Of course I have.

755
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,120
What about snacks?

756
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,280
I've had them too.

757
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,750
I thought you didn't like the snacks in the palace.

758
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,570
The snacks were savory today.

759
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,390
So I took a few bites.

760
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,550
What?

761
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,710
I can't eat snacks before qin lessons?

762
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,330
Layered walnut cake again?

763
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,390
It's made with honey.

764
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,490
It's not very sweet.

765
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,200
I don't like it.

766
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,040
It's delicious.

767
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,270
It's fragrant but not too sweet.

768
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,540
It has the same taste as the one I ate back then.

769
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,580
Sir, where did you buy it?

770
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,250
It was prepared in the palace.

771
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,430
The cook made it.

772
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,880
If you like it,

773
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,880
you can take them all.

774
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,510
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

775
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,120
Actually,

776
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,300
I have to thank you

777
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,740
for one more thing.

778
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,670
What is it?

779
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,500
When I came to the capital,

780
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,270
you called me Miss Jiang

781
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,510
just like everyone else.

782
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,120
But after I was in danger,

783
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,710
you stopped calling me Miss Jiang

784
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,710
and started calling me Ning'er instead.

785
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,150
I didn't notice it before.

786
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,390
Now that I think about it,

787
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,600
I finally understand your intention.

788
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,200
It's just a simple name.

789
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,760
What intention is there to speak of?

790
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:30,990
Jiang Xuening.

791
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,180
Jiang Xuehui.

792
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,510
Jiang is the surname of a family.

793
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,750
Xue is used to indicate rank.

794
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,630
Only the word Ning

795
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,070
belongs to me.

796
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,160
It distinguishes me from the others.

797
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,740
You saw my complications with my family

798
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,930
and decided to call me that

799
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,630
so that I can feel better,

800
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,360
right?

801
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,740
No one is better than you

802
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,200
at reading people.

803
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,660
It seems you have

804
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,000
long seen through me.

805
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,910
People change.

806
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,440
It's not easy to really see through someone.

807
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,230
Between my past self

808
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,300
and my present self,

809
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,640
who do you think is better?

810
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,600
Be it the past or the present,

811
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,020
it is all you.

812
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,260
You're the one and only Miss Ning'er.

813
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,490
Besides, the present exists because of the past.

814
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,000
Just face it as it is.

815
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,960
But if we have to make it clear,

816
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,830
I think

817
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,700
if the present Miss Ning'er

818
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,130
knows what she wants,

819
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,650
she will be well.

820
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,650
And she'll be even better in the future.

821
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,810
Can I take it that

822
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,110
you're not malicious

823
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,670
towards the present Ning'er,

824
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,540
nor so wary of her?

825
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,950
You're willing to get to know me

826
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,450
on an even and genuine ground?

827
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,440
What else?

828
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,230
Hasn't it always been like this

829
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,600
between the two of us?

830
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,640
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

831
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:56,690
Don't worry.

832
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,160
As long as you don't want to kill me,

833
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,130
I'll listen to everything you say.

834
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,500
You were gone for so long for a mere qin lesson.

835
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,230
Did Mr. Xie punish you again?

836
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,170
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.

837
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,270
Mr. Xie complimented me just now.

838
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,230
I will continue to work hard.

839
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,280
I won't disappoint him.

840
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,440
Worry all you want, I'm not giving it back.

841
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,010
You struck without knowing who the handkerchief

842
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,060
actually belonged to.

843
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,100
You made enemies with Jiang Xuening for no reason,

844
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,550
and now Jiang Xuehui is involved.

845
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,820
So she's the one Jie loves.

846
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,660
I don't even know how to reprimand you.

847
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,250
You're right to reprimand me, Aunt.

848
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,650
I've let you down.

849
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,490
A few days ago,

850
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,220
His Majesty rejected your father because of the Yan family's matter.

851
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,550
Now,

852
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,750
we need to confirm Jie's title

853
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,310
as the Crown Prince as soon as possible

854
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,630
in case something bad happens.

855
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,360
Who is there?

856
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,680
I'll go take a look.

857
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,760
[Yangzhi House]

858
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,460
Hello, Sister Xue.

00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,680
Baoying.

860
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,880
Didn't Sister Yao take this with her?

861
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,700
Why is it in your hands now?

862
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,470
Doesn't this sachet belong to Jiang Xuening?

863
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,790
Miss Xue.

864
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,270
I found this sachet in the Imperial Garden.

865
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,850
It looks familiar.

866
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,460
It belongs to you, right?

867
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,140
It is mine.

868
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,700
But I've never been to the Imperial Garden.

869
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,270
I know.

870
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,620
Not only that,

871
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,720
I also know

872
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,530
Yao Xi left this in the Imperial Garden on purpose

873
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,970
to make the Empress Dowager and I think it was you.

874
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,150
Miss Xue, didn't you and Yao Xi

875
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,760
grow up together?

876
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,080
Aren't you and Elder Miss Jiang siblings?

877
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,710
But I asked around.

878
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,670
Not only are you not close,

879
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,000
but you are more like enemies.

880
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,430
Even when she was first chosen as a study partner,

881
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,370
you were the one who took her place.

882
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,560
Miss Jiang, you're a smart person.

883
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,580
It's not fun to beat around the bush

884
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,940
when talking to a smart person.

885
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,770
I was behind the search and seizure of Yangzhi House.

886
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,760
But it was not meant to target you.

887
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,100
I misunderstood you because of a small mistake.

888
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,890
I feel guilty about it.

889
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,100
You must be joking.

890
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,790
Although it was a misunderstanding,

891
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,690
I almost lost my life.

892
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,510
I can't afford

893
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,100
to be labeled a rebel.

894
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,810
I know you won't forgive me easily.

895
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,950
But you will leave the palace sooner or later.

896
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,480
Although I have the advantage over you,

897
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,800
it comes at a heavy cost.

898
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,780
Besides, I still have to deal with your sister.

899
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,800
If I'm willing to show my sincerity,

900
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,810
can we let bygones be bygones?

901
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,710
Xi comes from a rich family.

902
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,270
If you go against her,

903
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,280
it'll likely not end well.

904
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,190
I don't like having such a petty clown by my side either.

905
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,790
It annoys me.

906
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,570
Why don't I

Thank you, Miss Xue.

910
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,120
But I don't like

911
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,910
getting others to do the deed for me.

912

Neither do I have the habit of involving innocent people.

I hope you can keep thinking that way.

But my sincerity

915
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,500
will always be there.
