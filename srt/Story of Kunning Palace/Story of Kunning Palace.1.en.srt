The palace that the empress lives in

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,830
is called the Ning'an Palace.

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,110
I asked Wan Niang,

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
what does the Ning'an Palace look like?

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,330
I don't know either.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,370
I sat under a leaking roof in the countryside,

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,270
and thought to myself,

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,720
if I could become a swan goose flying in the sky

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,000
and fly to the bustling capital

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,510

to see what the Ning'an Palace looks like,

19
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,140
how nice would that be?

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,140
Later,

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,250
I came to the capital.

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,650
But everything that happened

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,300
was different from what I had imagined.

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,750
The bustling world

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,039
was also a battlefield.

26
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,120
I led an absurd life

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,100

How dare you take advantage of His Majesty's illness

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,260
and rebel against the country?

46
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,470

for your actions this time.

75
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,110
I'm willing to admit to the crime of killing the emperor.

What is it?

81
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,760
I have made use of

too many people in this life.

83
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,880
But come to think of it,

84
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,040
I've let Yan Lin down,

85
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,520
and he took revenge on me.

86
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,550
His Majesty is still alive.

How dare you barge in?

89

Yan Lin, are you crazy?

90
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,940
Since the day my family was killed at the coming-of-age ceremony,

91
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,640
yet you told me you wanted to be the empress,

92
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,070
I was already crazy.

93
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,650

97
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,580

Zhou Yinzhi, and the likes of them.

99
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,260
They also took advantage of me to gain power.

100
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,700
I set Shen Jie up

101

and became the empress.

102
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,420

I don't owe them anything.

He once upheld justice through strict laws.

109

But I threatened him, forced him,

110
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,330

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,560
I ruined his reputation.

113

He is a good official.

114
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,650
I hope you could consider

the kindness you received

Please spare him.

120
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,310
You would trade your life

your novel, "Story of Kunning Palace",

The direction of this story

is not what I wanted at all.

153
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,560
Look at the current heroine.

154
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,570
Look at what she has become.

155
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,560
These are not the values

You've been forcing me with the market.

You insisted on adding those angsty tropes for the sake of it.

160

But Jiang Xuening is my hard work.

161

so she can make up for them.

177
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,690
It'll also let her figure out

what she really wants.

179
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,860
So, she won't repeat the same mistake.

If I knew this would happen,

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,500
How dare you!

190
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,670
[Lord Linzi, Shen Jie]

191
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,710
[Second daughter of the Jiang Mansion, Jiang Xuening]

192
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,960
[Viscount of Yan Mansion, Yan Lin]

193
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,410
What did you do to her?

194
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,850
What can I do?

195
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,090
We're both men.

196
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,140
What's going on?

197
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,150
I was in Ning'an Palace just now.

198
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,020
Why did I suddenly appear here?

199
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,350
It seems

200
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,590
Shen Jie hasn't ascended the throne yet,

201
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,390
and the Yan family hasn’t been killed yet.

202
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,350
What's wrong?

203
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,340
No.

204
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,010
This happened when I was 18.

205
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,600
What year is it this year?

206
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,670
Who am I?

207
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,830
This year is the 20th year of Wanzhen.

208
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,260
What's wrong, Ning?

209
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,870
Why are you talking nonsense?

210
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:24,920
Yan Lin.

211
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,160
I have something to do. I have to go.

212
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,000
Shen, my friend.

213
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,290
That was rude of me.

214
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,620
I'll make a toast to you next time as an apology.

215
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,350
Ning!

216
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,920
-Ning! -Jiang, my friend!

217
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,990
You drank so much. I'll take you home.

218
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,870
You're only going to make a toast?

219
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,300
See?

220
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,360
It's just a misunderstanding.

221
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,400
Jiang is still drunk.

222
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,460
Besides,

223
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,110
we grew up together.

224
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,150
If I had any ideas,

225
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,280
I would have targeted you first.

226
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,660
Your Highness, mind your words.

227
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,500
Even if I did offend him,

228
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,840
what can you do? Chop my hands off?

229
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,860
I will.

230
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,640
You...

231
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,710
Oh no.

232
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,670
Mr. Xie is holding a lecture in Wenhua Hall today.

233
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,970
We'll be punished if we're late.

234
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,400
Do you want to die?

235
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,500
Watch where you're going!

236
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,030
How many lives do you have to lose?

237
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,090
Yes.

238
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,670
I'm just as confused.

239
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,980
How could something so ridiculous happen in this world?

240
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:03,770
Hurry.

241
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm late.

242
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,370
Please punish me, teacher.

243
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,510
Where is your qin?

244
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,300
[Crown Prince Grand Preceptor, Xie Wei]

245
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:17,580
Qin...

246
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,630
We apologize, Junior Preceptor Xie.

247
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,830
Junior Preceptor Xie.

248
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,290
I...

249
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,600
Forget it.

250
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,400
Maybe I didn’t make it clear yesterday.

251
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,730
Don’t blame yourselves.

252
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,480
We are having a qin lesson today.

253
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,100
Have a seat.

254
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,550
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

255
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,720
Go.

256
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,520
Viscount Yan.

257
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,020
You were in such a rush.

258
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,590
Did you come from some tavern?

259
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,700
It's fine that you lack discipline.

260
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,660
But you even implicated His Highness, Lord Linzi.

261
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,920
Xue Ye, what nonsense are you spouting this time?

262
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,610
We all know if it's nonsense or not.

263
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,420
The Yongyi Mansion is made up of a bunch of barbarians.

264
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,290
How dare you challenge us Ding Mansion?

265
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,970
A bunch of barbarians?

266
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,820
I think Ding Mansion is made up of a bunch of barbarians!

267
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,310
Yan Lin, don't fight.

268
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:10,840
Yan Lin!

269
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,660
A gentleman does not argue nor fight.

270
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,730
He shouldn't disturb his mind before the music either.

271
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,370
You two.

272
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,420
Stand at the corridor for the duration of a joss stick

273
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,700
and calm yourselves down.

274
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,580
Any objections?

275
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,890
I'm also at fault today.

276
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,530
Thank you for your teaching, Junior Preceptor Xie.

277
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,600
I shall stand with them

278
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,880
and reflect on my mistakes too.

279
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,250
Let's resume the lesson.

280
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,600
[Jiang’s Mansion]

281
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,880
Looks like I'm really back.

282
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,520
[Four years ago]

283
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,790
-Second Young Lady. -Where are you taking Wan Niang?

284
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,270
Wan Niang has disrupted

285
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,060
the legitimate bloodline of the Jiang family.

286
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,350
She made a huge mistake, you know?

287
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,150
That's why she can't be buried in the Jiang family's graveyard.

288
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,380
We can only find a spot somewhere

289
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,740
in the mountains nearby

290
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,790
to bury her.

291
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,990
Let go of me!

292
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,310
-Second Young Lady. -Second Young Lady!

293
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,460
Second Young Lady, listen to me.

294
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,910
Let go of me!

295
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,650
-Miss.
-Wan Niang!

296
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,480
My lady!

297
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,670
Wan Niang...

298
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,220
Unfortunately,

299
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,730
some things can no longer be changed.

300
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,940
You still know to come back?

301
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,630
[Four years ago]

302
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:01,940
Here.

303
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,790
Congratulations, Madam.

304
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,850
I brought the Second Young Lady back safely.

305
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,940
[Madam Jiang, Lady Meng]

306
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,030
My Ning is back!

307
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,290
You're finally back.

308
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,020
[Jiang’s eldest daughter, Jiang Xuehui]

309
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,990
I'm your mother.

310
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,020
Your biological mother.

311
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,220
It doesn't matter.

312
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,330
You just came back.

313
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,490
You need time to get used to it.

314
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:42,870
Hui.

315
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:43,820
Come here.

316
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,610
Come here.

317
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,360
This is your older sister, Xuehui.

318
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,680
This is your younger sister.

319
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,700
Sister.

320
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,930
Are you okay?

321
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,090
If you want to make it up to me,

322
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,550
tell everyone that

323
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,380
I'm the only legitimate daughter of the Jiang family.

324
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,470
And she...

325
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,040
she's the illegitimate daughter of Wan Niang.

326
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,550
You can't blame her

327
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,670
for this.

328
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,440
Wan Niang thought highly of herself back then

329
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,180
and disrespected the legal wife.

330
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,830
She was sent to the village as punishment.

331
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,800
She was resentful and switched the both of you.

332
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,160
Besides, our Jiang family

333
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,660
is a prestigious

334
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,520
and esteemed household.

335
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,880
How can we let such a disgrace

336
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,880
be known to the public?

337
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,820
In the future, tell the public that

338
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,030
you had your fortune told by a master.

339
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,580
He said a disaster would befall you before you turned 14,

340
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,300
so you had to stay away from the bustling scene

341
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,300
to get through it safely.

342
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,360
You only managed to return to the mansion now.

343
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,290
From now on, I'll tell everyone that

344
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,760
you are the second daughter of the Jiang family.

345
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,500
Why?

346
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,480
All I want is for her to return

347
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,060
what's mine.

348
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,540
Wan Niang, that despicable woman.

349
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,050
How did she teach you all these years?

350
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,450
How could you be so intolerant of others?

351
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,750
Wan Niang is not despicable.

352
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,180
If she's not, who is?

353
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,820
Back then, we gave birth on the same night.

354
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,100
If she hadn't played tricks

355
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,380
and switched the two of you when you were babies,

356
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,380
how could we have been

357
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,500
separated for so many years?

358
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,300
Yes.

359
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,520
I was raised by Wan Niang.

360
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,950
I'm barbaric, vulgar,

361
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,900
and unforgiving.

362
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,390
So what?

363
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,090
At least I'm not fake and

364
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,150
pretentious like you.

365
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,670
How could you be so treacherous?

366
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,510
Listen up.

367
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,930
From now on,

368
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,750
no one is allowed to mention Wan Niang.

369
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,930
Aren't you Wan Niang's flesh and blood?

370
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,760
Why aren't you speaking for her?

371
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,960
Say something!

372
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,170
What are you doing?

373
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,760
Stop messing around!

374
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,300
Madam!

375
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,260
Madam! Madam!

376
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,420
-Mother. 
 -Are you alright?

377
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,610
It's an ill fate.

378
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,110
It really is.

379
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,170
Look at you now.

380
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,520
You're the daughter of a noble family.

381
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,480
How can you

382
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,360
dress like this?

383
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,050
You regularly disregard your seniors and ignore family rules.

384
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,230
Fine, I can put up with that.

385
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,580
But this time,

386
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,030
you stayed out all night.

387
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,780
Isn't that too much?

388
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,160
Looks like you need to learn a lesson.

389
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:30,730
Nanny Yang.

390
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,090
Teach the Second Young Lady a good lesson,

391
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,820
so that she may remember it.

392
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,790
Madam.

393
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,790
Second Young Lady was flogged a few days ago.

394
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,270
Please forgive her this time.

395
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes, Madam.

396
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,520
My lady!

397
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,620
Stop!

398
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,080
Second Young Lady.

399
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,710
Madam is doing this for your own good.

400
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,820
This is the way of filial piety.

401
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,200
Please accept the punishment.

402
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,790
I've been away for too long.

403
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,220
So long, that I forgot.

404
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,620
Last time,

405
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,470
it was full of conflicts and quarrels too.

406
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,100
What are you talking about?

407
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,070
I once thought that

408
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,110
since we are related by blood,

409
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,630
I may earn your genuine love

410
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,450
if I obeyed you.

411
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,890
But later I figured it out.

412
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,810
We're always

413
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,590
separated by Wan Niang.

414
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,970
Although you have given birth to me,

415
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,380
the grudge between us is inevitable.

416
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,050
If you are not destined to receive something,

417
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,470
don't force it.

418
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,660
Jiang Xuening.

419
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,790
Father has given me permission

420
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,710
to venture outside, disguised as a man.

421
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,020
I'm afraid your showcase of authority

422
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,390
is misplaced today.

423
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,350
How insolent!

424
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,950
Is this how you talk to your mother?

425
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,220
How dare you disrespect me?

426
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,870
Mother, calm down.

427
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,380
Your health is the most important.

428
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,620
I didn't expect

429
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,000
you to be so naughty

430
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,900
and hard to discipline.

431
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,630
Aren't you capable?

432
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,640
Fine.

433
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,950
You can stay right here

434
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,340
without going anywhere else.

435
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,410
Reflect on yourself.

436
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,070
Mother, take care.

437
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,710
Jiang is actually

438
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,040
the second daughter of the Vice Minister of Revenue?

439
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,460
Keep your voice down.

440
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,460
Let me tell you.

441
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,790
I'll make one thing clear.

442
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,300
Ning is mine.

443
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,480
Don't even think about wooing her.

444
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,980
Since you treasure her so much,

445
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,020
why did you introduce her

446
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,880
to me yesterday?

447
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,250
Just hide her.

448
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,010
That's becauseI I treat you as my brother.

449
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Who wants to hear it?

450
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,740
But...

451
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,140
Miss Jiang has a bad reputation

452
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,600
in the capital.

453
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,480
Everyone knows that she is arrogant and domineering.

454
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,980
Not everyone

455
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,390
has a unique taste like you.

456
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,820
Those are all false.

457
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,690
Stuff like her being born in the countryside,

458
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,720
or being mischievous and unsightly. It's all false.

459
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,470
Why do you listen to such rumors?

460
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,900
I know very well

461
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,430
what kind of person Ning is.

462
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,890
You can ignore it.

463
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,080
But Jiang...

464
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,560
I mean, Miss Jiang.

465
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,130
She's a lady after all.

466
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,670
If you keep bringing her around with you like that,

467
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,210
I'm afraid it won't be good for her reputation.

468
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,620
She's the result of my doting.

469
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,880
Naturally, I'll be the one to marry her.

470
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,530
My coming-of-age ceremony is in two months.

471
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,410
When the time comes,

472
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,380
I'll officially propose to the Jiang family.

473
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,210
Ning Er...

474
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,080
Is Ning inside?

475
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,650
I brought her some medicine.

476
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,410
Mother was harsh on her today.

477
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,290
Make sure she's not hurt.

478
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,290
Thank you, First Lady.

479
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,520
[Jiang Xuehui's maid, Mei'er]

480
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,710
What a coincidence.

481
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,650
The things from First Young Lady's place

482
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,820
are always good.

483
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,690
I'll take the medicine.

484
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,670
You old woman,

485
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,650
know your manners in front of the First Young Lady.

486
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,230
This medicine is not for you.

487
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,610
Back then,

488
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,390
I took the Second Young Lady back to the capital.

489
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,120
Second Young Lady trusts me.

490
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,250
I'm in charge of

491
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,590
everything in her place.

492
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,450
You...

493
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,770
It's all the same.

494
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,530
When did you start

495
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,700
calling the shots here, Nanny Wang?

496
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,840
You misunderstood, my lady.

497
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,600
Your health is precious.

498
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,840
I just want to

499
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,410
try the medicine for you first.

500
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,080
Not everything

501
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,710
can be used on you.

502
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,690
Am I right?

503
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,240
Nanny Wang, you sure are concerned about me.

504
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,550
In the past, whenever the Second Young Lady was unhappy,

505
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,470
she'd surely make things difficult for us.

506
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,150
Why is she so peaceful today?

507
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,010
In this house, apart from Lian'er and Tang'er

508
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,520
who are loyal to me,

509
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,390
the rest treat me as a fool.

510
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,280
I didn't care about them before.

511
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,590
But they were so rampant behind their back.

512
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,130
I see.

513
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,000
They stole pretty much everything.

514
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,880
Come here.

515
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,660
My lady.

516
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,320
Stand closer.

517
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,940
Why are you so afraid of me?

518
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,920
I won't eat you.

519
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,160
My lady.

520
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,240
I didn't steal it.

521
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,010
I've always behaved myself and remained loyal.

522
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,800
Please don't sell me off.

523
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,140
I used to be arrogant and domineering.

524
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,840
I scolded and hit the servants a lot too.

525
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,170
I have to put up an act

526
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,280
so no one will be the wiser.

527
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,710
Please spare me.

528
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,410
-I will never...
-Shut up!

529
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,910
If you keep talking,

530
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,540
I won't let you eat for three days.

531
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,500
And you have to

532
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,910
wash all the clothes in the yard yourself.

533
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,550
Then, I'll sell you to be a laborer.

534
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,810
That's right.

535
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,410
She's back to normal.

536
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,990
So you just like

537
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,230
an unreasonable lady?

538
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,160
I was worried that you're sick.

539
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,350
Alright.

540
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,030
Stop it.

541
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,980
As you can see today,

542
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,600
Nanny Wang has no respect even for me.

543
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,280
Even the other servants are stealing from me.

544
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,090
So they really think

545
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,840
I don't know what I have.

546
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,870
They're stealing from me on a regular basis.

547
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,170
I have to discipline them.

548
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,210
But, my lady.

549
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,150
We don't have any evidence.

550
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,760
How will you

551
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,530
identify them and make them confess?

552
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,710
I was studying the chess manual today,

553
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,030
and chanced upon some puzzling parts.

554
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,980
I suddenly remembered that I received your guidance

555
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,000
when I first came to the capital.

556
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,870
So I came uninvited today,

557
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,580
hoping I may receive your advice.

558
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,090
I hope I'm not bothering you.

559
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,240
Junior Preceptor Xie, your shouldn't say that.

560
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,750
You are the emperor's half-teacher.

561
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,900
I dare not give you any advice.

562
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,310
[Vice Minister for Revenue, Jiang Boyou]

563
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,590
It is at most

564
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,660
a discussion between us.

565
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,920
It's no bother at all.

566
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,160
If you don't mind,

567
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,460
you can just call me Ju'an.

568
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,110
Is that okay?

569
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,900
What's going on?

570
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,270
What does the Second Young Lady want?

571
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,120
That's right.

572
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,520
Second Young Lady.

573
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,980
Well...

574
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,100
There are many chores in the mansion that needs tending to.

575
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,150
You know that.

576
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,290
Many chores

577
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,060
are waiting to be done.

578
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,610
You suddenly called everyone here.

579
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,610
Is there something you wish to announce?

580
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,390
It's nothing important.

581
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,200
My boxes are empty, that's all.

582
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,450
Return everything

583
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,910
you took in the past.

584
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,840
No one took anything?

585
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,930
Second Young Lady.

586
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,590
You have really

587
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,180
wronged us.

588
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,310
Everyone

589
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,780
serves you in this yard.

590
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,930
We have prioritized you

591
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,710
in everything we do.

592
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,670
You are the master.

593
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,510
Who dares to take your things?

594
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,260
It doesn't matter.

595
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,410
I knew this was going to happen.

596
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,340
Please wait.

597
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,170
If I can't handle you,

598
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,930
someone else can.

599
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,990
Master! Master!

600
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,610
My Lord!

601
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,150
What's wrong?

602
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,720
Something happened to the Second Young Lady.

603
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,180
What happened to Ning this time?

604
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,250
Tell me, what happened?

605
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,250
Second Young Lady said

606
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,170
she wants to discipline the servants who stole her things.

607
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,390
Did she really say that?

608
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,350
This girl.

609
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,700
Why has she suddenly changed her mind and approach?

610
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,350
Did the anger get to her head?

611
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,960
Let's go. I need to see this.

612
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,340
Master, the...

613
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,730
Ju'an.

614
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,300
I'm afraid I'll have to keep you waiting for a while.

615
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,550
Some unlawful acts have occurred in my residence.

616
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,130
I need to deal with it.

617
00:30:59,560 --> 00:30:59,900
You...

618
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,740
No worries.

619
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,130
Mr. Jiang, please go ahead.

620
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,820
Okay.

621
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,450
Okay.

622
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,360
Come on, let's go.

623
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,520
Second Young Lady.

624
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,010
We've been here for a while now.

625
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,680
If the chores are delayed,

626
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
Madam is sure to blame us.

627
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,350
It won't bore well for any of us.

628
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,660
Yes.

629
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,340
Nanny Wang,

630
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,580
when did you become so timid?

631
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,320
Look.

632
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,720
Isn’t he here?

633
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,370
What's wrong, Ning?

634
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,250
Greetings, Father.

635
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,110
I'm incompetent,

636
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,250
and I'm unable to discipline my servants.

637
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,710
So I could only trouble you.

638
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,800
What are you talking about?

639
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,930
With me here to uphold justice for you,

640
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,440
everything can be solved.

641
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,590
That's good.

642
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,020
Please take a seat, Father.

643
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:07,900
Okay.

644
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,760
I've said it just now.

645
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,430
Anyone who took my stuff

646
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,860
ought to find it and put it back.

647
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,510
I can let bygones be bygones.

648
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,060
What?

649
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,160
Have all of you

650
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,050
gone mute?

651
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,220
If anyone dares to lie to me,

652
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,880
I'll break your limbs

653
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,590
and sell you off!

654
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,510
Master, please spare my life!

655
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,630
Please spare my life!

656
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,140
My lady.

657
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,070
If you could bring out a ledger

658
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,190
and confront us one by one,

659
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,780
we may be convinced.

660
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,480
But you don't even know what you have.

661
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,450
Today, you said the things in the boxes

662
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,630
are missing.

663
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,850
But you can also say there are too many things inside.

664
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,790
Everything is only according to your words.

665
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,870
Yes.

666
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,990
So you mean

667
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm framing you?

668
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,960
I dare not say that.

669
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,640
It's just that we are all from poor families.

670
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,620
We really don't have money to contribute to your lackings.

671
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,570
Yes.

672
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,670
Please uphold justice for us, Master.

673
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,780
Please help us!

674
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,050
We are innocent!

675
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,440
Master! Master!

676
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,100
Ning.

677
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,840
What is going on?

678
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:21,610
Father.

679
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,960
They're certain

680
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,850
that I couldn't provide any evidence.

681
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,610
That's why they dare to distort the truth.

682
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,880
Do you really think

683
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,380
I have no idea?

684
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,200
Tang'er.

685
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,350
Get the ledger.

686
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,100
There's really a ledger?

687
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,510
It's the sixth book from the left

688
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,190
on the third rack of my bookshelf.

689
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:40,780
Go.

690
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,150
What ledger?

691
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,060
I don't know.

692
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,620
Do you know?

693
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,690
What ledger?

694
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,670
I don't know.

695
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,170
Yes.

696
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,810
[Book of Poems, volume 5]

697
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,730
Is there really a ledger?

698
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,810
Let me take a look.

699
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,110
On my eighteenth birthday,

700
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,190
Father gave me a red jade Ruyi pendant,

701
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,740
and a kingfisher plume headpiece.

702
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,010
Father, look.

703
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,030
Did I remember it correctly?

704
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:11,489
Let me see.

705
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,380
That's right.

706
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,100
Also.

707
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,719
Prince Yan gave me a pair of white porcelain flowers,

708
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,590
a luminous pearl from the State of Yi,

709
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,520
and a nine-chain puzzle carved from

710
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,780
a whole piece of fine white tallow jade.

711
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,860
This item is official-made.

712
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,250
If any of you

713
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,250
foolishly pawned it,

714
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,850
I'm afraid you'll be sent to jail.

715
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,130
Nanny Wang.

716
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,230
Am I right?

717
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,429
I see how it is.

718
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,190
Now we have solid evidence.

719
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,260
If you don't admit it now...

720
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,260
Guards!

721
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,840
My Lord.

722
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,560
Search every room.

723
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,090
When they find the stolen goods,

724
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,510
I will punish you severely.

725
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,070
Yes.

726
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,330
Please spare my life.

727
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,240
What should we do?

728
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,880
Master, please spare my life!

729
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,800
Please forgive me, Master.

730
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,100
I'll tell you everything.

731
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,900
I was wrong.

732
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,760
I was blinded by greed.

733
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,010
My Lord.

734
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,200
I'm confessing too.

735
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,500
My lady, please show mercy!

736
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,310
Master, I confess.

737
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,570
I was wrong.

738
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,970
You finally confessed.

739
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,030
Don't worry.

740
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,830
Today, while Father is here,

741
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,310
you can take your time confessing every single one

742
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,570
of your crimes.

743
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,020
We confess. We confess.

744
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,610
All of us.

745
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,200
My girl Ning has grown up.

746
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,280
Now I can rest assured.

747
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,230
But how did you come up with

748
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,470
the idea for the ledger

749
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,600
just now?

750
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,290
And you remembered it so clearly.

751
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,840
Father, you're exaggerating.

752
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,310
I'm not that capable.

753
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,630
Yan Lin taught me all that.

754
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,330
It's that brat again.

755
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,310
Even if you get along,

756
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,480
you're both grown up now.

757
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,180
You can't stay together all the time.

758
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:07,940
By the way, Father.

759
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,330
What are you going to do

760
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,590
with those servants?

761
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,160
In your opinion,

762
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,840
what should we do?

763
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,280
As the saying goes,

764
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,720
no one is a saint, everyone makes mistakes.

765
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,740
They were originally just servants.

766
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,870
After all, it is

767
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,930
my indulgence towards them

768
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,620
that led to this outcome.

769
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,240
Since both sides are at fault,

770
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,900
I don't want to go too far.

771
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,920
Excluding those who talked back,

772
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,060
the rest will be flogged five times

773
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,180
and have their two months' salary deducted.

774
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,810
In the future, as long as they serve me wholeheartedly

775
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,910
and never steal again, they will all be forgiven.

776
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,180
If they do it again,

777
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,130
I'll single them out,

778
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,450
and settle the old and new scores together.

779
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,280
I'll sell them straight away.

780
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,780
What do you think, Father?

781
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,900
Why are you looking at me like that?

782
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,350
I thought,

783
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,220
with your personality,

784
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,400
you'd definitely make a fuss out of it.

785
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,390
By the way,

786
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,820
did Viscount Yan

787
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,000
teach you to say these as well?

788
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,740
It seems that Yan Mansion

789
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,170
has a worthy successor.

790
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,900
Since Father said so,

791
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,760
about Mother grounding me...

792
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,370
-About this…
-Mr. Jiang.

793
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,750
Ju'an.

794
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,840
Pardon me.

795
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,480
I couldn't sit still,

796
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,550
so I came out to enjoy the scenery.

797
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,420
I didn't expect the Miss Xuening to be here too.

798
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:35,900
Excuse me.

799
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,580
It's my fault, Ju'an.

800
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,470
Sorry to keep you waiting.

801
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,590
Ning,

802
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,810
go back to your room and rest.

803
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,730
Remember.

804
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,500
you must greet your mother tonight.

805
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,940
It's been years

806
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,450
since we went our separate ways.

807
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,550
My impression of Miss Xuening

808
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,640
was still that of the past.

809
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,770
Having met you today,

810
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,950
you seem more mature and mellow now.

811
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,590
Oh, that's right.

812
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,320
Ning,

813
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,330
when you came to the capital alone,

814
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,180
I heard Ju'an was on the same way.

815
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,830
So I asked him to accompany you

816
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,760
and take care of you.

817
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,050
Do you remember me?

818
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,470
I am Xie Wei.

819
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,830
[Four years ago]

820
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,980
I'm here on Mr. Jiang's behalf.

821
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,040
Sorry to bother you.

822
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,370
Ning.

823
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,030
Why are you just standing there?

824
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,160
Don't be rude

825
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:26,940
in front of the guest.

826
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:28,530
It doesn't matter.

827
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,230
Miss Xuening was busy strategizing just now.

828
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,030
She must be tired.

829
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,650
It's better for her to return to her room

830
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,640
and get some rest.

831
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,700
You're right. Here.

832
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,320
Bring her lady back to rest.

833
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,100
-Yes.
-Come, Ju'an.

834
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:40,870
This way.

835
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,640
To the study.

836
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,730
Come on.
