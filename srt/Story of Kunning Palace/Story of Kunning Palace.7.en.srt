I feel very grateful

42
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,490
for your generous kindness.

43
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,980
You acknowledge my work

44
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,030

Unfortunately, things have changed.

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,440

that if I don't want to marry him,

73
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,600
I just need to wait patiently at home.

and now you regret it.

80
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,210
Instead of venting your anger on me,

81
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,060
you should ask yourself

82
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,980

to break off the engagement.

86
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,590
He knows that his career prospects are uncertain

87
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,840

88
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,930
He's a noble and considerate man.

You didn't make that unforgivable mistake

100

I had objections

106
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,580
not because I have a special relationship with him.

107
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,590

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,880
please treat him well.

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:03,910

113
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,140
I misunderstood you.

114
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,740
I'll write a letter to my father now.

115
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,800

121
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,410
How did you know I like this, Shu?

122
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,170
We grew up together.

123
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,140
Of course I know.

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,740
After I went home,

125
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,720
I especially sent someone to look for it.

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm glad you like it.

127
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,590

129
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,130
Have a look, Your Highness.

Look at what I brought.

134
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,909
You all prepared a gift for me.

135
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,350
Sorry that I didn't bring anything.

136
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,260
But I'll keep my eyes out

137
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,480

138
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,300

Miss Jiang has been quiet.

140
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,990

141
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,340
I didn't prepare anything.

145
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,260
I'm terribly sorry.

146
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,410
Your Highness, please…

147
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,060
Say no more.

What do you mean?

152
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,730
It doesn't matter that you didn't prepare a gift.

153
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,030
Yan Lin has told me

You look restless.

156
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,270
You must have had a hard time after going back.

157
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:36,750
You misunderstood.

158
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,760
I just...

159
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,350
I feel for you.

160
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,350
Anyway, you being my study partner

161
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,010
is the best gift I've ever received.

162
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,930
If you like any of these things,

163
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,659
just take it.

164
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,010
Don't worry.

165
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,850
With me here,

166
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,210
I won't let anyone mess with you.

167
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,940
So this is how it feels

168
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,430
to be the princess's favorite.

169
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,740
What's taking them so long?

170
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,690
It's so late.

171
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,180
I'll turn in if they don't come back.

172
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,850
I'm sleepy.

173
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,910
Sir,

174
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,340
we've got news about the water transport.

175
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,380
The shipwreck was not an accident.

176
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,100
It was intentional.

177
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,160
Who do you think benefited the most

178
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,530
from this incident?

179
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,310
Once the silk ship capsized, the silk price rose.

180
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,650
Those who have stores of silk benefited the most.

181
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,240
Xue Yuan has stores of silk too.

182
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,880
In your opinion,

183
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,010
is he happy that the ship capsized?

184
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,520
No.

185
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,720
It's a felony to interfere in water transport.

186
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,550
Besides, water transport is lucrative in the long term.

187
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,590
If he wants to benefit from it, he gets to lay low.

188
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,270
He knows better than

189
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,090
to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.

190
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,380
The Xue family's ships have always been elusive.

191
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,310
How come…

192
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,080
The most possible explanation

193
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,120
is that it was an internal issue.

194
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,220
One of Xue Yuan's men was desperate to make money

195
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,780
and secretly made the ship capsize

196
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,480
to raise the silk price.

197
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,230
Xue Yuan should have known about it by now.

198
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,190
Tell Dao Qin

199
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,450
to find this person before Xue Yuan.

200
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,880
We need him to be our witness.

201
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,250
Don't kill me.

202
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,340
I won't do it again.

203
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,420
Please spare my life, Duke.

204
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,580
Please spare me!

205
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,770
They're back.

206
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:32,630
Sir.

207
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,320
How's it?

208
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,120
We caught him.

209
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,730
You guessed right.

210
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,710
It's one of Xue Yuan's silk merchants

211
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,650
who sabotaged the ship.

212
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,480
His business went wrong recently

213
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,830
and he desperately needed money to make ends meet.

214
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
That's why he went out on a limb.

215
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,140
Sure enough, Xue Yuan sent someone to kill him.

216
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,740
We caught the killers too.

217
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,830
After almost being killed

218
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,180
by Xue Yuan's henchmen,

219
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,120
that silk merchant switched sides

220
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,090
to seek our protection.

221
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,170
He told us everything

222
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,140
about the Xue family.

223
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,950
No wonder you told them to wait

224
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,670
until Xue Yuan took action.

225
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,540
In that way,

226
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,780
you could catch Xue Yuan's henchmen

227
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,970
and easily make the silk merchant cave in.

228
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,780
Xia Ju'an,

229
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,950
you're so calculating.

230
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,090
How about You Fangyin?

231
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,350
Have you found anything?

232
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,470
We looked into her,

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,790
but…

234
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,350
Don't pussyfoot around.

235
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,210
Just tell him.

236
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,120
Miss Fangyin is a poor girl

237
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,010
and doesn't go out often.

238
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,230
She doesn't know many people

239
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,020
and has no friends.

240
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,420
She has never dabbled in business before.

241
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,120
The only abnormal thing recently

242
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,510
is that at the banquet on the Double Ninth Festival,

243
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,040
she was bullied by a mean servant

244
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,150
and saved by someone.

245
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,230
Saved?

246
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,470
Who saved her?

247
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,130
A few days ago,

248
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,620
when I was secretly protecting you out of Youhuang Store,

249
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,550
I saw her talking to Miss Jiang.

250
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,020
And the person who saved her

251
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,240
was also Miss Jiang.

252
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,510
That was the day Jiang Xuening bought the qin

253
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,690
and before You Fangyin bought silk.

254
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,350
Xie Ju'an,

255
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,240
this Miss Jiang

256
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,750
is not simple.

257
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,700
What does Jiang Xuening have to do with the silk merchant?

258
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,830
As far as we know, nothing.

259
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,490
Secretly give the witness and evidence

260
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,300
to the Ministry of Justice.

261
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,230
The Ministry of Justice hasn't made any progress

262
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,360
on the Rebels Case.

263
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,850
It's time for them to make some achievements,

264
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,720
or they won't be able to keep the Xingwu Guards in check.

265
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,730
But this matter concerns the Xue family.

266
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,160
Will Chen Ying dare to investigate it?

267
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,730
He's a smart man, or he wouldn't have got to

268
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,220
where he is today.

269
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,290
He knows what to do.

270
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,690
Yes.

271
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,700
What about Jiang Xuening?

272
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,420
Greetings,

273
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,080
Your Highness.

274
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,390
You're my study partners now.

275
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,730
We'll meet a lot,

276
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,100
so save the courtesies.

277
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,460
Don't you think they're tiring?

278
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,370
Take your seats.

279
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,960
Ning.

280
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,470
Why are you sitting in the back?

281
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,790
I'm thick-headed

282
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,610
and have been struggling with my studies.

283
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,840
I'm afraid the teachers wouldn't want to see me in the front.

284
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,470
I don't want to annoy them

285
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,290
and get kicked out.

286
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,620
With me here,

287
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,560
no one dares to kick you out.

288
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:17,680
Come.

289
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,440
Shu.

290
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,580
Can you do me a favor?

291
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,700
Miss Jiang can take my seat,

292
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,180
so she can spend more time

293
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,850
with Your Highness.

294
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,830
Miss Xue, take my seat.

295
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,980
It's closer to Her Highness.

296
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,800
You can talk with her more conveniently.

297
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,370
You just want to sit in the back and eat snacks, right?

298
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,630
If your father finds out,

299
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,430
you'll be punished.

300
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,370
You Yue,

301
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,190
why don't you give your seat to Baoying?

302
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,080
Me?

303
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:08,830
Come.

304
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,670
Sit.

305
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:11,900
Alright.

306
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,200
We'll sit this way in the future.

307
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,800
Good morning, Mr. Xie.

308
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,980
Good morning.

309
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,990
You may sit.

310
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,170
This is the first lesson.

311
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,380
I suppose Your Highness and the study partners

312
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,850
are not familiar with the teachers

313
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,930
and didn't do the reading in advance.

314
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,540
So I talked with other teachers

315
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,070
and decided that we won't have classes today.

316
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,260
I'll tell you

317
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,590
what you're going to learn in the next half year.

318
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,710
Xie Wei hasn't changed a bit.

319
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:05,960
Mr. Xie.

320
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,620
I'm confused about something.

321
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,560
Go ahead.

322
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:09,880
My father told me

323
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,940
that men and women

324
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,850
play different roles in the world.

325
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,280
Men should contribute to society,

326
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,350
while women should take care of family.

327
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,510
This clear distinction should never be compromised.

328
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,100
Politics are what men should learn.

329
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,180
I mean no offense,

330
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,980
but I think an erudite man like you

331
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,520
shouldn't compile such a textbook

332
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,680
for us girls.

333
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,970
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

334
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,030
I'm confused about something too.

335
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,800
Empress Dowager is from the Xue family.

336
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,800
During the rebellion of Lord Pingnan,

337
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,310
she took charge of the court

338
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,550
in a composed manner

339
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,430
and kept the situation under control.

340
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,300
Thanks to her, order was restored.

341
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,810
Tell me, Miss Xue.

342
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,830
If Empress Dowager had adhered to social conventions,

343
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,260
would she have made such achievements?

344
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,320
-But my father also said… -Miss Xue.

345
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,940
I know

346
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,470
the scholars in Hanlin Academy are close to your family.

347
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,690
But remember,

348
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,110
we're not at your house.

349
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,310
If you don't want to learn,

350
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,210
you can leave.

351
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,520
What's wrong with Xie Wei?

352
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,680
Why is he so harsh on Xue Shu?

353
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,640
Is it because of the Yan family again?

354
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,470
Miss Xuening,

355
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,710
do you have objections too?

356
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,780
No. Not at all.

357
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,210
Then do you have anything to say?

358
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,550
He's forcing me to take sides

359
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,470
and stand against the Xue family.

360
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,670
In my opinion,

361
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,680
the articles Mr. Xie selected

362
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,280
are all political classics

363
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,360
on how to rule a country with wisdom.

364
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,740
This is a great textbook

365
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,920
and you must have put great efforts into compiling it.

366
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,460
Her Highness was born in the royal family

367
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,170
and we're her study partners.

368
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,480
That makes us different from normal girls.

369
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,110
It's narrow-minded

370
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,840
and ridiculous

371
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,080
to say this textbook is inappropriate.

372
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,300
Miss Jiang,

373
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,510
you don't have to be so harsh.

374
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,840
I have no choice.

375
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,310
Xie Wei wants me to his hound,

376
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,800
so I have to bark.

377
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,250
I'm glad you said that,

378
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,760
Miss Xuening.

379
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,110
You behave very well today.

380
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,970
Shu,

381
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,370
Miss Jiang is not a bad person.

382
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,920
She's just a bit straightforward.

383
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,330
Don't take it to heart.

384
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,530
Straightforward?

385
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,870
I don't think so.

386
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,710
What do you mean?

387
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,330
I shouldn't say this,

388
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,960
but do you remember

389
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,770
that Miss Jiang guessed

390
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,110
the test questions right?

391
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,770
She's explained.

392
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,180
It's because she's familiar with Mr. Xie.

393
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,830
Mr. Xie is a lone wolf in the court.

394
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,070
Even if they're close,

395
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,710
he wouldn't have told her about the test questions.

396
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,220
Xi,

397
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,690
you've seen a lot in the palace.

398
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,420
Jiang Xuening is powerless,

399
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,040
but both Viscount Yan and Her Highness are so nice to her.

400
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,810
Don't you think

401
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,150
everything has been too easy for her?

402
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,600
Not only that,

403
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,460
Jiang Xuening knew a lot about your engagement with Zhang Zhe

404
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,540
and became your close friend within days.

405
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,220
Jiang Xuening

406
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,660
is not as simple as we thought.

407
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,510
One needs to be a master of calculation

408
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,570
to get what she has.

409
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,690
You must be careful around her.

410
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,400
Shu.

411
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:26,720
Your Highness.

412
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,080
I thought about it

413
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,460
and decided to have a word with you.

414
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,430
So I caught up with you.

415
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,860
Is it about what happened just now?

416
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,690
It must have been a hard day for you.

417
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,560
I should've been more thoughtful.

418
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,680
I just thought that we are cousins

419
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,580
and have lots of chances to see each other,

420
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,760
but Ning may never come back

421
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,800
to the palace after the classes are over.

422
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,000
That's why I...

423
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,420
You don't need to feel sorry.

424
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,190
I'm glad to do something that made you happy.

425
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,830
You're so kind, Shu.

426
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,260
I hope you could not be angry with Ning.

427
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,590
This way, Your Highness.

428
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,370
-Jie. -Your Highness.

429
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,530
Why are you here?

430
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,420
I just paid Mother a visit.

431
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,369
You just finished school?

432
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,280
Yes. Come with me.

433
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,710
Let me introduce you to my study partners.

434
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,690
No. We're in the court.

435
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,930
It's okay.

436
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,089
We can wait for a better occasion.

437
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,310
Come with me.

438
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,420
Jie.

439
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,530
This doesn't look like something men use.

440
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,870
Which girl gave it to you?

441
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,610
Stop kidding me.

442
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,850
Tell me.

443
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,020
If you like her

444
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,080
but are too shy to propose,

445
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,320
I can ask His Majesty to help you.

446
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,100
Stop guessing.

447
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,970
I need to go.

448
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,760
Jie.

449
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,560
Miss Xuening.

450
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,260
Wait a moment.

451
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,840
Anything I can do for you?

452
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,400
Yan Lin didn't come to class this morning.

453
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,790
I heard that he's ill.

454
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,010
How come he fell ill

455
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,850
all of a sudden?

456
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:08,710
Mr. Xie,

457
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,800
I'm not a physician.

458
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,630
How would I know?

459
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,610
You went to the Yan Mansion

460
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,230
and soon after you left,

461
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,310
the Yan family sent for a physician.

462
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,160
Have you been spying on me and the Yan family?

463
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,960
I wish I didn't have to.

464
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,500
Zhou Yinzhi

465
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,410
was sent by the Xue family to approach Yan Lin.

466
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,150
You visited his house

467
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,800
and talked with him alone for a long time the other day.

468
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,080
Given that the Xue family hasn't taken any moves yet,

469
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,910
it's very clear

470
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,540
that you stopped Zhou Yinzhi from taking action against the Yan family.

471
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,840
You finally believe me now.

472
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,390
That depends on

473
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,160
whether you can be honest with me.

474
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,610
Don't you have anything to say to me?

475
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,330
What do you mean?

476
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,470
You told You Fangyin to buy silk from Xu Wenyi.

477
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,240
Was it for the Yan family too?

478
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,830
You've found out about that too?

479
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,530
I just

480
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,320
wanted to help Fangyin make some money.

481
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,730
Her life is too hard.

482
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,750
What I want to know

483
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,630
is why you were so sure that the silk price

484
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,390
would rise.

485
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,380
The silk price in the capital plummeted

486
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,760
and then soared after the shipwreck.

487
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,170
Everyone knows about it.

488
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,440
How should I explain it to him?

489
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,580
If you're trying to make up a story,

490
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,340
make it convincing.

491
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,490
Is that so unusual?

492
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,230
My father is the Vice Minister for Revenue.

493
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,070
He deals with money every day.

494
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,650
I picked up a thing or two

495
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,050
and learned how business works.

496
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,910
I knew that the silk price wouldn't keep plummeting.

497
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,700
It already hit the bottom,

498
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,830
so once demand exceeded supply,

499
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,650
it would rise again.

500
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,460
Besides, Yan Lin mentioned

501
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,010
that the water conditions in the Cao River have been bad.

502
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,310
So I thought

503
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,890
if something happened that impeded the transportation of silk,

504
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,530
its price would definitely rise.

505
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,920
I just took a chance.

506
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,680
You took a chance?

507
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,680
Should I believe you?

508
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,790
Why is everything by design in your eyes?

509
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,660
Can't they just be coincidences?

510
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,970
Why are you

511
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,790
always so guarded？

512
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,320
What made you so mistrustful?

513
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,010
Is it related to the secret you mentioned?

514
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,160
Steering the conversation toward me

515
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,670
is not gonna work.

516
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,760
Let me give you a piece of advice.

517
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,620
Don't meddle in things

518
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,410
that you should stay out of.

519
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,970
He even knew about my attempt to make money.

520
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:27,920
I have a feeling

521
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,660
that the clairvoyant one is not me

522
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,500
but him.

523
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,260
[Xie Mansion]

524
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,060
Why do you only believe that everything was planned

525
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,120
but not believe it was a coincidence?

526
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,740
Is it because

527
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,310
you are used to being on your guard?

528
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,110
What on earth made you hold such a shield?

529
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,570
Is it related to the secret you mentioned?

530
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,240
Did she confess?

531
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,000
She said it was a coincidence.

532
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,680
And you believe it?

533
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,150
Of course.

534
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,530
What a coincidence.

535
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,870
Do you know

536
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,610
the silk price went up this morning?

537
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,910
So what?

538
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,580
You didn't ask her

539
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,630
to give me all the silk she has？

540
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,990
So that I can sell it

541
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,190
and make a lot of money.

542
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,980
Lyu Zhaoyin.

543
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,110
Is there nothing else you can do?

544
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,610
Have you found out Deputy Gong Yi's whereabouts

545
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,870
and what he is up to?

546
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,290
If you are that unoccupied,

547
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,850
why don't you do something serious?

548
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,870
No wonder you ranked second

549
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,040
in the entry-level, provincial, and national exams.

550
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,230
You ranked first, so what?

551
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,530
Why did you suddenly write my name?

552
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,940
Have you paid for it?

553
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,920
You, the Duke of Xue, are in charge of the Xingwu Guards

554
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,310
and befriended half of the officials.

555
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,340
Yet you are not satisfied.

556
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,670
How dare you interfere in the water transport

557
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,960
and collude with the merchants to affect the market price?

558
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,370
You even tried to do away with a witness.

559
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,190
You do whatever you want under my nose.

560
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,330
Uncle,

561
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,150
what exactly do you want?

562
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,830
Your Majesty.

563
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,280
Your Majesty.

564
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,050
I'm truly loyal to Your Majesty,

565
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,880
having no disloyalty at all.

566
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,590
I know nothing about this.

567
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,570
Please spare me some time.

568
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,140
I will get to the bottom of it.

569
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,770
When did I ever doubt your loyalty?

570
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,830
But, over the years,

571
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,680
the Yan family has maintained its military presence

572
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,710
and repeatedly refutes me in court.

573
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,090
I don't really have any trustworthy aides by my side.

574
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,030
If even you are found guilty by others,

575
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,360
who else can I trust?

576
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,910
Your Majesty.

577
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,130
I was wrong.

578
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,750
My subordinates made the decision on their own.

579
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,810
It wasn't my idea.

580
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,270
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

581
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,830
I will find out the truth

582
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,730
and give you an explanation.

583
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,840
Forget it.

584
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,310
This time, I'll suspend you for half a month

585
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,110
to show the other officials.

586
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,670
But if it happens again,

587
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,850
I won't let you off easily.

588
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,620
I understand.

589
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,200
I'll take my leave first.

590
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,690
A few days ago,

591
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,420
I heard the Duke of Xue try to draw the Ministry of Rites over

592
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,590
to appoint my brother as the Crown Prince.

593
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,280
In this way,

594
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,630
he may hold his tongue for that.

595
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,510
[Wang Xinyi, Emperor's Eunuch Attendant]

596
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,260
Your Majesty is wise.

597
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,230
To suppress this matter,

598
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,830
we must give the Ministry of Justice some benefits

599
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,240
to shut their mouths.

600
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,420
Pass my order.

601
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,940
The Ministry of Justice has done a great job in the Raw Silk Case.

602
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,220
The whole department will be rewarded.

603
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,520
Also, I will not go through with the Rebels Case anymore.

604
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,430
Those involved will be reinstated.

605
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

606
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,560
That is the Ning'an Palace, where the Empress lives.

607
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,160
It's so magnificent.

608
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,920
Today, the Empress Dowager wants to see all the study partners.

609
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,140
Where we are is still far from Empress Dowager's Tai'an Hall.

610
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,530
We can't be too playful,

611
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,640
or we'll be late.

612
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,780
Shu is right.

613
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,500
Let's go, ladies.

614
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,400
Boy,

615
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,620
Her Majesty punished you with 24 hours of kneeling.

616
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,720
That means not even a moment less.

617
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,510
Not to mention fainting.

618
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,810
Even if you die,

619
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,630
[Zheng Bao, Eunuch]

620
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,260
you have to get through it.

621
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:42,930
Zheng Bao?

622
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,650
The imperial edicts, memorials, secret letters, and verbal edicts,

623
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,680
Your Majesty handed over everything to Zheng Bao.

624
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:51,940
How trustworthy is he?

625
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,500
I once saved his life in front of my sister-in-law's residence.

626
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,410
Since then,

627
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,270
Zheng Bao has been the most loyal person to me

628
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,530
in the palace.

629
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,260
It will never change whether he's alive or dead.

630
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,940
It will never change whether he's alive or dead?

631
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:02,990
I don't believe it.

632
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,280
He's really a faithful man who has never changed, whether alive or dead.

633
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,540
This must be the day Shen Jie recruited Zheng Bao.

634
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,000
If I can save him this time,

635
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,350
will he devote himself to me in the future?

636
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,270
Stop pretending.

637
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,650
You may slap yourself

638
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,980
to keep sober-minded with the pain.

639
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,580
Do you want me to slap you instead?

640
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,370
But Shen Jie was Lord Linzi back then.

641
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,630
He had the right to save him from punishment.

642
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,230
How am I going to do that?

643
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,270
Your Highness.

644
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,360
It's getting late.

645
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,150
Let's go quickly.

646
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,090
Ning.

647
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,020
Are you okay?

648
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,040
Why do you look so pale?

649
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:02,990
Your Highness.

650
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,150
Is this common

651
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,390
in the palace?

652
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,290
I want to go home.

653
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,670
Don't be afraid.

654
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,600
This little eunuch made a mistake.

655
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,720
He'll be fine after he's punished.

656
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,450
Let's go.

657
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:13,830
No.

658
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,280
Your Highness.

659
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,690
I'm wondering

660
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,560
whether I will be punished like this

661
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,470
if I make a mistake in the future.

662
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,930
He had to slap himself while being splashed with water and was asked to kneel for so long.

663
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,260
He'll die if he can't bear it anymore.

664
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,970
I don't think so.

665
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,420
Your Highness, you are unaware of it.

666
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,560
The monk in the temple said I have a weak Bazi.

667
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,900
If he dies,

668
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,180
he will definitely pester me as a ghost.

669
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,970
I'm so scared.

670
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

671
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,870
What did he do wrong

672
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,170
to be punished like this?

673
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,680
You treat him like this.

674
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,320
Is my sister-in-law trying to kill him?

675
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,960
Your Highness, you have no idea.

676
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,520
When this brat was cleaning the hall,

677
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,130
he broke...

678
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,850
I don't want to hear it.

679
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,230
He's already been punished

680
00:27:59,250 --> 00:27:59,970
and also kneeling for so long.

681
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,600
What else do you want?

682
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,550
Listen to my words and let him off.

683
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,890
If the Empress asks later,

684
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,760
just say it's my idea.

685
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:05,700
Understand?

686
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,480
Yes, Your Highness.

687
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,990
Help him up quickly.

688
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,300
Ning.

689
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,230
Did you see that?

690
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,450
Since I said I would protect you,

691
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,500
I will keep my promise.

692
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,920
You won't be afraid then, right?

693
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,610
Thank you, Your Highness.

694
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,850
It's great to have you here.

695
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,320
Cool.

696
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:25,970
Let's go.

697
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,380
Mother, Sister-in-law.

698
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,700
I've brought the study partners here.

699
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,850
Greetings to the Empress Dowager

700
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,140
and the Empress.

701
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,000
Shu is here.

702
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,410
Get up quickly.

703
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,570
And come to me.

704
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,150
You, an ungrateful girl.

705
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,630
Only now did you want to visit me?

706
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,710
I told your father long ago

707
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,740
to let you stay in the palace.

708
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,170
But he said it was against the rules.

709
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,800
That's why Zhiyi

710
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,320
had no friends of the same age.

711
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,570
And she had to find a few study partners outside the palace.

712
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,240
It was so troublesome.

713
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,240
Look.

714
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,690
After all that had happened,

715
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,630
you still came to live in the palace.

716
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,740
This old witch

717
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,170
is still so annoying.

718
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,280
Why would she try to prove her dominance

719
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,370
to us, a few young ladies?

720
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:26,960
Mother.

721
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,920
They are still kneeling.

722
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,050
What?

723
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,070
Are they reluctant

724
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,710
to greet me?

725
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,850
We dare not.

726
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,340
I...

727
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,060
The Empress is indeed a people-pleaser.

728
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,090
Mother,

729
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,770
I have no such intention.

730
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,580
I know

731
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,640
what your intention is.

732
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,970
Forget it.

733
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,980
His Majesty is sick at the moment.

734
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,010
He needs someone by his side.

735
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,890
You can go back now.

736
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,630
I'll take my leave first.

737
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,630
Aunt, I'll get you some hot tea.

738
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,870
Good girl.

739
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,160
Zhiyi, come.

740
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:11,900
Mother.

741
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,920
You all may get up now.

742
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

743
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,060
Madam Xu.

744
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,740
What's wrong with Aunt today?

745
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,560
The Duke was punished by His Majesty.

746
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,620
Her Majesty is in a fit of anger.

747
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,280
You grew up raised by the Empress Dowager.

748
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,260
She can listen to you the most.

749
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,980
Why don't you persuade Her Majesty not to be angry?

750
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,200
I see.

751
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,010
Mother, you always scare people like this.

752
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,150
They are going to play with me

753
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,060
and study together in the future.

754
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,380
All of them are not bold enough.

755
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,400
If they get sick being scared of you,

756
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,720
who else will play with me?

757
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,550
I was just too glad

758
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,100
that I forgot to get them up.

759
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,830
How was that scary?

760
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,920
Are you Baoying?

761
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,400
I haven't seen you in a while.

762
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,100
You've grown a lot.

763
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,830
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

764
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,830
I heard that

765
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,160
there's a study partner

766
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,410
named Jiang Xuening

767
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,710
that you like a lot.

768
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,330
Which one is her?

769
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,470
Step forward so I can see you.

770
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,820
I'm Jiang Xuening.

771
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

772
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,090
Too beautiful.

773
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,230
A bit frivolous.

774
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,970
Not elegant enough.

775
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,590
I was born like this.

776
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,290
Why do you care?

777
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,230
Your Majesty,

778
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,980
I had inexorable doom when I was little.

779
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,930
Therefore, my parents sent me to a farm

780
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:50,750
and I was raised in frugality.

781
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,280
That's why I'm unknowledgeable,

782
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,300
frivolous, and a bit rough around the edges.

783
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,420
Getting to see Your Majesty today,

784
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,350
I feel very nervous, with profound respect and humility.

785
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,080
I will strictly restrain myself

786
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,090
and be a good study partner for Her Highness in the future.

787
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,650
I won't dare to slack off.

788
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,460
Quite well-spoken, though.

789
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,550
All right.

790
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,960
I also heard that you are the apple of

791
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,140
Viscount Yan's eye.

792
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:19,170
No one in the Yan family likes me.

793
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,980
If I give you a hard time,

794
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,430
I wonder what they'll say behind my back.

795
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,660
You may leave.

796
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,030
Yes.

797
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,200
Aunt.

798
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:33,920
Have some tea.

799
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,220
Your Majesty,

800
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,900
Eunuch Liu from the Imperial Household Department is here.

801
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,820
Do you want to see him?

802
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,960
Let him in.

803
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:41,950
Yes.

804
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,040
Greetings, Your Majesty.

805
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,230
What brings you here, Eunuch Liu?

806
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,510
Your Majesty, you said a Ruyi jade was broken

807
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,400
the day before yesterday.

808
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,400
His Majesty learned about it today,

809
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,230
and he's concerned about Your Majesty.

810
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,520
He specially asked me

811
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,460
to find the Ruyi jade, Qinghai's tribute from last year,

812
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,490
and give it to you.

813
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,680
Guards!

814
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,410
Arrest this rebel

815
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,970
and send him to the Office of Punishment for interrogation!

816
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,380
-Yes. -Your Highness, please calm down.

817
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,630
I'm just here to deliver the jade by order of His Majesty.

818
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,100
-How does that make me a rebel? -Mother.

819
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,050
-Please calm down. -Your Majesty.

820
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,500
I'm innocent!

821
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,250
Your Majesty!

822
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,250
I'm innocent!

823
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,990
[300 Loyal Souls]

824
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,180
All of you, leave.

825
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,450
Yes.

826
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,210
[Imperial Household Department]

827
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,310
Listen up.

828
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,550
Search thoroughly.

829
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,300
Don't miss any spot.

830
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,650
Yes.

831
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:20,860
From the Imperial Household Department?

832
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,010
How can that be?

833
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,080
Exactly.

834
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,550
I also find it weird.

835
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,080
We do have our people in the Imperial Household Department,

836
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,300
but we never gave an order like this.

837
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,630
The case of 300 Loyal Souls

838
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,770
is a taboo of the imperial court.

839
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,489
Who could be so audacious

840
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,370
as to irritate the Empress Dowager?

841
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,000
And for what reason?

842
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,860
Deputy Gong Yi is still in the capital.

843
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,270
Because of the case of raw silk,

844
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,120
Xue Yuan was suspended by Shen Lang.

845
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,850
Now the capital is in peace,

846
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,270
of course he couldn't sit still.

847
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,310
Oh no.

848
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,060
He must have been using our people

849
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,429
to take actions in the palace.

850
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,500
If they keep on investigating,

851
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,720
they'll trace it to us, right?

852
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,260
Sir.

853
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,160
Bad news.

854
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,200
His Majesty wants to see you in the palace now.

855
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,910
[Imperial Study]

856
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,470
Mr. Xie, you are here.

857
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,610
Please go in.

858
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,120
His Majesty is waiting for you.

859
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,740
Your Majesty, you wanted to see me so late at night.

860
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,610
Is it something urgent?

861
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:52,160
Someone in the Imperial Household Department

862
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,970
gave this to the Empress Dowager in my name today.

863
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,590
Her Majesty had a sudden heart attack.

864
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,460
Now all the people in the Imperial Hospital are taking care of her.

865
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:03,210
There are Lord Pingnan's people in the Imperial Household Department.

866
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,380
How do you know it was Lord Pingnan, Official Xie?

867
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,530
The case of 300 Loyal Souls is a national grief for the State of Qian.

868
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,510
If it's not the rebels of Lord Pingnan,

869
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,920
I can't imagine

870
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,720
who else would do this.

871
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,290
You have a point, Official Xie.

872
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,060
But Lord Pingnan is in Jiangnan, far away from us.

873
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,940
How could he get his hands on the imperial palace?

874
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,340
On the contrary, this exactly proves that

875
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,820
they have already got their hands on the palace.

876
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,190
Recently,

877
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,310
there have been rebels causing trouble in the capital repeatedly.

878
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,060
But they've only been doing trivial deeds like assassination.

879
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,150
Now it seems

880
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,170
they were trying to distract us

881
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,940
and cover up their actions in the palace

882
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,740
with rebellious assassination.

883
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,860
No wonder

884
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,440
Xingwu Guards and the Ministry of Justice

885
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,500
couldn't find anything even though they've searched thoroughly.

886
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,040
Turns out it was just a cover-up.

887
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,870
I can't believe it.

888
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,590
That old man is so evil.

889
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,320
I can't rest assured unless he dies a hundred times.

890
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,450
Your Majesty.

891
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,070
Lord Pingnan did this

892
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,360
to stir up chaos in the capital

893
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,750
and shake the foundation of our state.

894
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,030
The case of Ruyi jade

895
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,710
must be investigated,

896
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,870
but not in public.

897
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,220
Otherwise,

898
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,040
the people will waver,

899
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,870
and we'll be falling into the rebels' trap.

900
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:20,780
You're right.

901
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,450
I know what to do.

902
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,710
I feel relieved to have an official like you.

903
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,470
Go back and rest.

904
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,170
Mr. Xie, you are here.

905
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,110
Please go in.

906
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,710
His Majesty is waiting for you.

907
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,730
Uncle, are you assured now?

908
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,580
I did worry too much.

909
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,990
But Eunuch Huang found out that

910
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,600
the decree that the Imperial Household Department received to gift the Empress Dowager

911
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,710
was forged by someone

912
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,840
in the name of Your Majesty.

913
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,130
This means it must have been

914
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,720
someone close to you, Your Majesty.

915
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,380
Also,

916
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,370
the time when that Ruyi jade was sent into the palace,

917
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,500
it was also when

918
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,040
Mr. Xie proposed to teach Her Highness.

919
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,780
This matter is very important.

920
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,760
So it's understandable that

921
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,900
Her Majesty and I are especially cautious.

922
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,660
That's why I wanted to test Mr. Xie.

923
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,320
I know

924
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,450
what Mother is thinking about.

925
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,720
But Official Xie is loyal to me.

926
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,510
I'm confident about that.

927
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,040
It's getting late.

928
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,380
Uncle, you are still suspended.

929
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,130
You may leave now.

930
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,650
I'll take my leave.

931
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,420
Nanny.

932
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,730
We've been waiting here for more than two hours.

933
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,490
Why can't we go back first?

934
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,300
Miss You.

935
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,150
Something big happened in the palace.

936
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,960
Her Highness is still here for the inquiry.

937
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,560
You need to wait longer.

938
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,020
Then why does Sister Xue get to stay in the hall,

939
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,610
while we have to kneel here?

940
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,270
What does

941
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,200
their inquiry have to do with me?

942
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,770
At this point,

943
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,970
just talk less.

944
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,160
Nanny.

945
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,550
Her Majesty kept us here

946
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,420
just in case, I suppose.

947
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,720
But the girls are weak.

948
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,860
If they catch a cold,

949
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,340
I'm afraid we won't know what to say when Her Majesty inquires about this.

950
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,200
Besides,

951
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,960
Her Majesty sent people to investigate this matter secretly.

952
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,310
I guess she doesn't want to make it public.

953
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,940
Why don't you let us wait aside?

954
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:57,710
OK?

955
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,390
All right, you can wait aside.

956
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,260
Yes.

957
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,080
Your Majesty.

958
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,840
It's okay.

959
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,340
Are you hurt?

960
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,880
Your Majesty, you are finally here.

961
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,960
Her Majesty is waiting for you inside.

962
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,150
Nanny Xu.

963
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,390
It's too cold at night.

964
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,150
Let them go back first.

965
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,170
Yes, Nanny Xu.

966
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,730
The study partners live in the palace anyway.

967
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,090
They can't leave anyway.

968
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,650
If anything comes up, just ask someone to summon them.

969
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,190
If they get sick,

970
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,790
Her Highness will be worried.

971
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,660
Since His Majesty and Miss Xue have said it,

972
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,950
you may leave now.

973
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:54,810
Remember,

974
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,220
don't tell anyone

975
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,180
about what happened here today.

976
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,860
Yes.
