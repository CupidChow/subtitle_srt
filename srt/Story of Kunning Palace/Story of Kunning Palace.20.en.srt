00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,890
You mean

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,710
Do you know why I didn't carry out the mission before?

156
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,740
I knew something was wrong.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,580

the failure of the Tongzhou military camp rebellion last time

159
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,600
was also his work.

160
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,770
In my opinion,

161
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,130
we must go back to Jinling immediately

162
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,210
and inform Lord Pingnan

163
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,290
about this.

164
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,020
No.

165
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,820
Why not?

166
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,980
If we leave now,

167
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,030
we can't take back

168
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,040
the lost land in the capital.

169
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,420
No matter what,

170
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,640
we've to get Gongyi Cheng out of prison.

171
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,450
If he hasn't defected,

172
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,100
then that elusive Mr. Dujun

173
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,870
is the mole.

174
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,960
If he has defected,

175
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,840
I'll kill him immediately.

176
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,590
But the prison

177
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,310
is guarded by Xingwu Guards.

178
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,210
How can we barge in with the few men

179
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:58,860
we have?

180
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,870
To be honest,

181
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,040
a few days ago,

182
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,120
I heard that

183
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,550
a while ago, Lord Pingnan

184
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,170
sent Feng Mingyu to the capital secretly

185
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,540
with gunpowder to blow up the Tongzhou Pass.

186
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,140
Gunpowder?

187
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,060
So,

188
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,080
we'll find the right time

189
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,320
to bring Gongyi Cheng out of the capital.

190
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,310
Then, General Feng will take us back to Jinling.

191
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,870
Why didn't you tell me

192
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,550
about such a major matter?

193
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,440
Huang.

194
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,100
I really regarded you as my brother.

195
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,320
How could you hide things from me?

196
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,110
Lord Pingnan told me to keep it from you.

197
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,419
I follow Lord Pingnan's orders.

198
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,900
Fine.

199
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,570
Feng Mingyu is already here.

200
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,280
It seems that Lord Pingnan

201
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,960
doesn't want to lose his plan in the north.

202
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,300
In that case,

203
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,670
let’s take action

204
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,350
on the day the Yan family is exiled.

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,580
At that time,

206
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
a large portion of the Xingwu Guards

207
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,120
will be out for escort duties.

208
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,370
The prison will be empty

209
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,800
and it'll be easier for us to take action.

210
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,740
Fine.

211
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,270
Xue Dingfei sent a message.

212
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,680
According to what you taught him,

213
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,550
he managed to spur Huang Qian

214
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,560
to break into the prison.

215
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,430
But

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,110
there has been a slight change in this matter.

217
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,250
Change?

218
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,010
What change?

219
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,970
Lord Pingnan secretly sent Feng Mingyu to the capital

220
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,940
and he brought along a lot of gunpowder

221
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,460
to destroy the Tongzhou Pass.

222
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,980
For Huang Qian's prison break this time,

223
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,700
Feng Mingyu will also come to assist us.

224
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,540
Back in Jinling,

225
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,540
Gongyi Cheng and I

226
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,370
were strategists under Lord Pingnan's command.

227
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,770
Lord Pingnan is prone to suspicion

228
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,520
and often reinforced checks and balances between the two of us.

229
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
That's why I looked for a gap

230
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,640
to plot in secret.

231
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,490
But Feng Mingyu is different.

232
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,570
Under Lord Pingnan's command,

233
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,250
he's the only commander leading the military.

234
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,010
He's deeply trusted by Lord Pingnan.

235
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,010
Although he has never met me,

236
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,680
he must know a lot about me.

237
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,240
It won't be easy

238
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,820
for Zhang Zhe to act as Dujun

239
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,750
directly

240
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,160
under his nose.

241
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,510
Sir.

242
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,510
Then what should we do?

243
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,420
If Zhang Zhe slips up,

244
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,660
Feng Mingyu would definitely figure out

245
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,770
that it was your plan.

246
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,100
Exactly.

247
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,530
Xue Dingfei

248
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,090
is unreliable.

249
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,180
We can't be sure that he won't betray you.

250
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,000
But now's not the time

251
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,170
to cross swords with Lord Pingnan.

252
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,830
For now,

253
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,240
we can only take the risk

254
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,450
and tell Zhang Zhe things about Dujun

255
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,060
and hope

256
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,340
that he can stay alive until Tongzhou.

257
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,200
With Zhang Zhe's intelligence,

258
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,920
what you are doing is tantamount to
drinking poison to quench your thirst.

259
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,930
Even if you hide it from Feng Mingyu,

260
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,370
after Zhang Zhe returns to the capital,

261
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,390
you'll be interrogated by the Ministry of Justice.

262
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,430
If Zhang Zhe insists on doing it,

263
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,340
we can only use Feng Mingyu

264
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,850
to kill everyone

265
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,930
in Tongzhou.

266
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,460
Previously, you proposed to Shen Lang

267
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,300
to send Xue Yuan to Tongzhou to meet him

268
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,390
so that he'd fight with the rebels

269
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,830
and you'd reap the benefits easily.

270
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,140
But now, Feng Mingyu has gunpowder.

271
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,370
It's impossible to survive the explosion.

272
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,160
Do you intend to also let Xue Yuan...

273
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,090
Yes.

274
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,910
Those who have committed many crimes

275
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,990
should be punished.

276
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,100
But after all, he is your...

277
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,460
Think it through again.

278
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,460
-Let’s go.
-Sir.

279
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,310
Miss.

280
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,870
Mr. Zhou sent a message

281
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,350
saying that the court has issued a decree today

282
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,990
and Viscount Yan will be exiled tonight.

283
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,980
He asked you

284
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,790
if you want to see him off.

285
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,340
Tonight?

286
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,980
Why is it so sudden?

287
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,180
The last time, this didn't happen so quickly.

288
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,250
Miss.

289
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,640
I want to see him off.

290
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,940
Ask him to arrange it for me quickly.

291
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:05,640
Yes.

292
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,220
I don't know what happened today.

293
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,690
The exile date was suddenly decided

294
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,020
and many of the men of the Xingwu Guards were dispatched.

295
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,360
That's why I got the chance

296
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,770
to let you meet Viscount Yan.

297
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,110
Although I left in a hurry,

298
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,620
luckily, you told me in time.

299
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,570
If I weren't able to see him off,

300
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,900
I'd feel uneasy.

301
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,690
Don't mention it.

302
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,280
It's right ahead.

303
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,980
I've unlocked the door.

304
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,490
No one will come for the time being,

305
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,280
but hurry up.

306
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,240
I'll wait for you outside.

307
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,650
Don't move.

308
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,900
Didn't His Majesty order them

309
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,620
not to torture you and Marquis of Yan?

310
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,490
How dare they beat you?

311
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,520
How dare you come here?

312
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,510
You're all grown up.

313
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,550
You haven't recovered yet.

314
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,950
When you get the Huangzhou,

315
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,400
who knows how much more you'll have to suffer.

316
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,730
A few days ago,

317
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,770
Xue Ye looked for me

318
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,740
and caused trouble.

319
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,760
But everyone who had to hit me

320
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,150
knew about His Majesty's order.

321
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,850
They didn't dare to use actual force.

322
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,280
This is just a front

323
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,540
to scare others.

324
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,370
It doesn't hurt at all.

325
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,110
How many times have I been beaten by my father?

326
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,420
Others may not know,

327
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,830
but you do.

328
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,650
All right.

329
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,110
Look at

330
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,620
how dazed you are.

331
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,150
I'm afraid I can't rest assured

332
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,150
when I have to leave for Huangzhou.

333
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,170
Yan Lin.

334
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm not stupid.

335
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,380
I know.

336
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,670
You were the one who detected Xue family's plot

337
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,770
early on and informed us.

338
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,720
You were also the one

339
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,170
who looked for Zhou Yinzhi and bribed Xingwu Guards to look out for me.

340
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,190
There must be many other areas

341
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,870
you're helping me out with

342
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,890
that I don't know about.

343
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,370
Ning.

344
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,940
Thank you.

345
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,990
You never have to thank me.

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,320
Over these days,

347
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,810
I've ruminated about many things and gained clarity.

348
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,650
But there are also many things

349
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,510
that I couldn't figure out no matter what.

350
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:48,990
Ning.

351
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,570
You treat me so well

352
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,440
and I treat you so well.

353
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,840
But why don't you

354
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,390
like me?

355
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,430
It has nothing to do with you.

356
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,410
I told you.

357
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,100
I'm a bad person.

358
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,460
In what way

359
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,720
♫How many people can one love in a lifetime?♫

360
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,570
are you bad?

361
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,670
I had a dream.

362
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,820
In my dream,

363
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,730
♫Can you understand the love and hate♫

364
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,970
I told you foolishly

365
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,120
♫In the eyes looking at you?♫

366
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,860
that I wanted to be the empress.

367
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,820
That day,

368
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,090
you happened to be in a bad mood.

369
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,620
♫How much true love exists in this vast world♫

370
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,430
So, you were angry

371
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,110
and we had a big fight.

372
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,270
♫To be worthy of so many poems?♫

373
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,610
Then...

374
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,030
what happened next?

375
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,170
♫There are too many stories to be written♫

376
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,600

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,910
aren't all death row inmates.

567
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,140
Things are urgent.
I can't take everything into consideration.

568
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,120
When those gangsters rush in later,

569
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,830
we'll be the ones to die.

570
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,280
Kill them!

571
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,810
Yes.

572
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,820
Let's go!

573
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,490
Help! Help!

574
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,800
Who's there?

575
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,650
Brothers.

576
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,630
Let's fight these bastard officials!

577
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,350
Kill them!

578
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,010
Why are you here?

579
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,930
Hurry and find Mr. Gongyi!

580
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,310
Pardon me, Miss Jiang.

581
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,030
But this is not the time to talk.

582
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,700
The rebels will come and search here soon.

583
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,780
Please change your clothes.

584
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,220
It's too exquisite. It's easy to be suspected.

585
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,370
Rebels?

586
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,500
The ones who broke into the prison are rebels?

587
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,550
I'll do it myself.

588
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,840
♫Wind blows gently♫

589
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,820
♫The fallen flowers bloom in my heart♫

590
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:11,270
♫Your whisper under the moonlight sounds beautiful♫

591
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,900
♫Getting closer gently♫

592
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,200
♫The season stays in dreamland♫

593
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,470
♫The snow is very light♫

594
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,930
I'll use this to tie your hair.

595
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,670
♫It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eaves♫

596
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,110
Tonight, the court

597
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,900
plans to trap the rebels here.

598
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,910
♫You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snow♫

599
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,470
If you go out now,

600
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,790
I'm afraid your life would be in danger.

601
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,140
Later, please stay by my side

602
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,060
and act cautiously.

603
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,830
♫They're about to be erased now♫

604
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,450
Please forgive me

605
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,710
if I offended you.

606
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,160
♫Disrupting my expectations♫

607
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,670
Attack!

608
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,290
Duke.

609
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,850
The prison is in chaos now.

610
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,770
Please tell us

611
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,710
what we should do.

612
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,550
How dare those petty gangsters

613
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,650
wreak havoc under my nose?

614
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,570
Every one who's caused trouble in the prison tonight

615
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,080
must be killed.

616
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,790
Yes.

617
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,970
Kill!

618
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,610
Huang.

619
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,410
I haven't seen Mr. Gongyi.

620
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,320
He's not there either.

621
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,650
The information is clear.

622
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,670
How could it go wrong?

623
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,530
Keep searching.

624
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:43,890
Yes.

625
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,490
Stop searching.

626
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,010
Gongyi Cheng is not in the prison.

627
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,490
You've fallen into the court's trap.

628
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,120
Who are you?

629
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,360
I'm like you,

630
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,510
one of Lord Pingnan's men.

631
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,320
Stop talking.

632
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,310
It's still not too late.

633
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,280
Go out with me now.

634
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:00,890
Wait.

635
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,230
We didn't declare our identities.

636
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,940
How did you know who we are?

637
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,820
If you can't explain this,

638
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,010
don't blame me for being ruthless.

639
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,140
Kill!

640
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,290
Huang!

641
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,070
Huang!

642
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,310
Huang.

643
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,900
There are many men from the Xingwu Guards outside

644
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,990
and all our comrades are dead.

645
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,730
Let's run away.

646
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,250
What?

647
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,060
What are you waiting for?

648
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,290
The court deliberately released the news that Gongyi Cheng is here

649
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,520
to trap you.

650
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,710
If you don't leave now,

651
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,870
it'll be too late.

652
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,500
There are so many people outside.

653
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,040
How can we leave?

654
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,230
Follow me.

655
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:11,870
Let's go.

656
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,480
Everyone, stop what you're doing!

657
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,550
Tell me.

658
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,040
Who ordered you and what do you want to do

659
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,210
by breaking into the prison?

660
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,510
Cut the crap.

661
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,720
Kill me if you want.

662
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,350
Someone will avenge me.

663
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:03,840
Ye.

664
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,200
Bring some men to search the capital.

665
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,840
I don't believe a dozen of bandits

666
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:09,739
could

667
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,820
have wreaked such havoc in the prison.

668
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,159
There must be

669
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,800
something fishy in this.

670
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,270
Yes.

671
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,110
Duke, you are wise.

672
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,880
It's not that our defense was weak,

673
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,100
but that a lot of our men were dispatched to the court tonight.

674
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,370
There were barely any men for defense duties.

675
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,080
So...

676
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,010
That's just an excuse.

677
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,389
No matter how many men were dispatched,

678
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,389
the government will surely

679
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,219
leave enough men here for defense.

680
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,449
How could it've turned out like this?

681
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,540
I think there's someone among you

682
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,179
who either left their post without permission,

683
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,540
or is

684
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,380
colluding with the bandits.

685
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,110
Duke.

686
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,670
I...

687
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,060
I think Zhou Yinzhi is very suspicious.

688
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,760
He'd previously left his post without permission

689
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,600
for three consecutive days.

690
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,050
Who knows what he was up to.

691
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,020
Besides,

692
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,160
he was the one who ordered for

693
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,060
the prisoners here to be killed.

694
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,510
Left my post without permission?

695
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,080
I think you're the one who left your duty without permission.

696
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,030
Weren't you the last one to show up

697
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,320
when the bandits were causing chaos?

698
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,560
Nonsense!

699
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:14,930
Duke.

700
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,210
I can testify for Sergeant Zhou.

701
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:18,560
Wei Xi.

702
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,550
-You...
-Duke.

703
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,680
If we didn't kill these prisoners,

704
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,080
they'd definitely have joined the bandits in causing chaos.

705
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,720
Not only that,

706
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,070
they'd also have become eyewitnesses

707
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,370
to testify about the Xingwu Guards' incompetence.

708
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,510
I believe

709
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:33,810
that if you were there,

710
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,360
you'd have made the same choice.

711
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,150
If you don't believe me,

712
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,980
you can take

713
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,690
my life!

714
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,690
Thank you, Duke.

715
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,010
Get up.

716
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,820
I killed him

717
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,790
not because I trust you

718
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,970
or

719
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,260
that I want to protect you,

720
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,260
but to warn you.

721
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,650
And you.

722
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,580
See?

723
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,340
This is his end.

724
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,350
In my hands,

725
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,010
no matter if you're a stupid traitor

726
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,130
or a scheming

727
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,700
traitor,

728
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,480
no one will be spared.

729
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,930
Yes.

730
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,580
Huang.

731
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,970
They're coming this way soon.

732
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,280
Are we still leaving from the East Gate?

733
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,680
How did you know

734
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,510
about Gongyi Cheng?

735
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,820
And about your identity,

736
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,130
can you tell me now?

737
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,100
I entered the prison to save Gongyi Cheng

738
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,870
and now, I've rescued you from the Xingwu Guards.

739
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,320
Does it matter

740
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,630
who I am?

741
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,710
What do you mean?

742
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,040
You've been by Lord Pingnan's side for so many years.

743
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,340
Haven’t you heard of

744
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,190
Dujun, the Hermit?

745
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,820
Dujun, the Hermit?

746
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,050
You're Mr. Dujun?

747
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:40,960
Huang.

748
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,150
We can be saved.

749
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,290
We have Mr. Dujun here.

750
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,930
He'll have a way to get us out.

751
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,970
Dujun, the Hermit?

752
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,570
Under Lord Pingnan's order, it's true that

753
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,760
Mr. Dujun has been lurking in court.

754
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,770
But we've never seen

755
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,350
his face before.

756
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,670
How can I believe you?

757
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,510
You should have some way to prove it.

758
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,800
Was what happened tonight

759
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,790
not enough proof?

760
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,670
When Gongyi Cheng was arrested,

761
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,900
I tried my best and used every means to fool everyone

762
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,250
and entered the prison to find him,

763
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,760
but found nothing.

764
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,450
After thinking about it,

765
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,020
I realized I'd fallen into the court's trap.

766
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,590
Fortunately, I had a plan.

767
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,750
But I ran into you fools.

768
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,030
Do you mean that the court

769
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,610
knew we were going to break into the prison?

770
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,250
But we were ordered to come to the capital secretly.

771
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,360
How could it be leaked?

772
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,920
If my guess is right,

773
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,880
Gongyi Cheng must have already defected.

774
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,450
The court has found out

775
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,700
everything about you.

776
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,850
The East Gate must be heavily guarded right now.

777
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,850
We can't escape.

778
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,330
You can clarify my identity

779
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,010
by sending someone to the East Gate to have a look.

780
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,640
You go.

781
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,620
Be careful.

782
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,150
Yes.

783
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,690
Black clothes and prisoner clothes are too obvious.

784
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,000
Get some ordinary clothes.

785
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,670
Yes.

786
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,310
There are four city gates in the capital.

787
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,520
At night, His Majesty would order

788
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,870
the imperial guards

789
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,890
to be garrisoned at the East, South, and North gates in groups

790
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,020
and feign an ambush.

791
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,370
Only the West Gate will be unguarded.

792
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,100
By then, you'll

793
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,350
just have to bring the rebels who escaped from the prison

794
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,420
to the West Gate.

795
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,910
Once you say the secret code,

796
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,880
they'll let you go.

797
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,380
This move

798
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,870
will be enough

799
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,340
to gain the rebels' trust.

800
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,980
I heard that Dujun, the Hermit is very elusive.

801
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,190
This move

802
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,500
is feasible indeed.

803
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,630
If I’m right,

804
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,530
after the rebels leave the capital,

805
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,600
they'll find a place to stay outside the city

806
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,070
and gather their men

807
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,490
before heading to Tongzhou.

808
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,970
There are three routes

809
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:48,990
from the capital to Tongzhou.

810
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:49,990
I

811
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,930
can’t predict their choice.

812
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,300
So on this journey,

813
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,630
you're on your own.

814
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,140
On the way,

815
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,670
I'll try to find out where all the rebel strongholds are.

816
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,130
After you've

817
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,590
entered Tongzhou,

818
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,370
use this secret code again to find Yongding Pharmacy.

819
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,050
At that time, the people from the court will assist you.

820
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:14,670
Okay.

821
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,510
But

822
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,710
you seem to be very familiar with the rebels' behavior.

823
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,040
Are you sure

824
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,260
you got all this just from the confession of the rebels?

825
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,770
You work in the Ministry of Justice.

826
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,800
You handle unjust cases every day.

827
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,020
It's good to be cautious.

828
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,010
But if you go too far,

829
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,960
it's paranoia.

830
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,860
Paranoia

831
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,710
is not good for yourself.

832
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,310
Am I right?

833
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,510
Huang.

834
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,970
There are many soldiers at the East Gate.

835
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,790
We can't get out.

836
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,830
Gongyi Cheng

837
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,350
that bastard really sold us out.

838
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,220
It's not too late to find out now.

839
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,380
Now, the Xingwu Guards are searching the city

840
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,620
and the city gates are heavily guarded.

841
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,050
Do you still not believe what I said?

842
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,730
You make it sound like you can get us out.

843
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,770
I've been in the court for years.

844
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,210
I still have manpower.

845
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,620
If you want to live,

846
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,710
come with me.

847
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,710
Huang.

848
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,590
What should we do?

849
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,920
What else can we do?

850
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,410
Let's go.

851
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,500
Guys, check carefully.

852
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,560
Over there.

853
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,560
See if there's anyone else alive.

854
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,200
This one.

855
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:09,890
Okay.

856
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:30,940
Miss.

857
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,700
Miss!

858
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,720
Oh no.

859
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,260
At this point,

860
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,550
you still don't believe me?

861
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,200
If nothing happens at the city gate,

862
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,470
I'll return your men to you.

863
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,340
Who are you?

864
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,420
Boss Huang from Western City.

865
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,690
I have goods

866
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,920
that I have to pick up urgently from outside the capital.

867
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,600
The procedures are done

868
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:28,520
and all the documents are there.

869
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,250
Please open the gate.

870
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,930
So it's Boss Huang who needs to leave the city.

871
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,530
Open the gate.

872
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:35,900
Yes.

873
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,020
I've long heard that Mr. Dujun

874
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:38,880
is a spy

875
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,170
planted in the court by Lord Pingnan.

876
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,850
I didn't expect him to be so capable.

877
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,680
Guys.

878
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,450
Ning'er was kidnapped?

879
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,340
How did she get involved in this?

880
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,230
Junior Preceptor Xie.

881
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,370
You know about the prison matter?

882
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,430
Please forgive me.

883
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,170
It’s my fault.

884
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,150
I failed to protect her.

885
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,970
Those gangsters were vicious.

886
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,740
I was just worried about her safety.

887
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,200
If I weren't careful,

888
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,350
it might taint her innocence.

889
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,630
So

890
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,440
I didn't dare to report it to the Duke.

891
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,600
I have no choice.

892
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,620
I can only come to you.

893
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:39,870
You're a smart person.

894
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,700
You mustn't tell anyone anything

895
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,470
about Miss Ning'er being at the prison tonight.

896
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,110
Otherwise,

897
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,070
I'll kill you.
