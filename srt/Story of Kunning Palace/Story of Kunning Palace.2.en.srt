22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,270
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

23
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,050
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

But in the unfathomable,

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,770
there's always an invisible hand

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,539
that puts everything back to its original place.

31
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,530

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,800
How could you do such an evil thing

39
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,170
and disregard human lives?

40
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,960
Your Majesty, you're not God.

41
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,490
How do you know if what I'm doing is evil

42
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,829
and not righteous?

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,150

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,870

46
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,800
I've shown you.

47
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,300
Back then, when I was too muddleheaded from my illness,

48
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,940
I've once

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,070
said some outrageous and immoral stuff to you.

50
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,720
Fortunately, you had a bad memory then

51
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
and had no preconceived plans.

52
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,380
After returning to the capital, I repeatedly tried to sound you out,

53
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,620
but you didn't remember anything.

54
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,540
That's why I let you live on for a few more years.

55
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,720
Otherwise,

56
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,980

59
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,870
Xie Wei didn't kill me after he came to the capital

60
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,390
because I didn't remember things and wasn't smart.

61
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,140
But he took notice of what I did today.

62
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,990
If he detects something's unusual,

63
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,920
won't he kill me immediately?

Let me ask you.

67
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,730
Does that Mr. Xie who was present today

68
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,780
come here often?

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,040
I don’t remember him at all.

70
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,290
Mr. Xie and His Lordship both belong to the court

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,430
and regularly stay in touch.

72
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,650
And also because

73
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,579
he came to the capital with you in the past,

74
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,610
they're on especially friendly terms.

75
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,780
However,

76
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,900
he hasn't been here

77
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,200
for quite a few years indeed.

78
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,700
Mr. Xie comes from the Xie family in Jinling.

79
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,800
In the capital, he's known for his gentle disposition.

80

Even if you offended him in some way,

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,830
don't worry too much.

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,760
in your opinion,

87
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,560
how is Ning's temperament like?

88
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,350
The Second Young Lady is indeed smart.

89
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,650
She actually used a book of poetry to deceive others

90
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,750
and managed to deal with a sly slave in a few words.

91
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,810
She's very different from the rumors of her

92
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,900
being domineering and reckless.

93
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,470
Even you noticed it,

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,080
but Yanlin didn't.

95
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,600
Don't you think it's strange?

96
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,310
You went to the Jiang Mansion today because of Viscount Yan.

97
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,340
Yanlin is sentimental.

98
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,620
The one who hurt him

99
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,350
must be someone he cares about.

100
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,040
Ning is very shrewd

101
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,180
and good at hiding.

102
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,580
We have to be careful.

103
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,870
Shrewdness?

104
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,130
I can barely see a trace of that.

105
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,790
After all, she's just a girl from the palace.

106
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,490

107
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,770
do you feel...

108
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,550
Four years ago,

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,380
we went to the capital together.

110

[Four years ago]

111
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,400
I didn't realize

112
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,870
she had such a side.

113
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,840
She could even hide it from me.

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,210
Looks like

115
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,530
she's not an ordinary person.

116
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,360
Besides,

117
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,240
we encountered heavy snow on the way to the capital then.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,580
I'm afraid she already found out about my dementia.

119
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,530
She might also have noticed that

120
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,010
I utter nonsense during my dementia episodes.

121
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,370
Really?

122
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,770
If someone observant finds out about this,

123
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,040
they'd definitely find out who you are.

124
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,340
Originally, I thought

125
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,840
she was just a stubborn and ignorant girl.

126
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,500
Now it seems that

127
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,290
she might just be pretending to be crazy and foolish.

128
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,080
Send someone to keep an eye on the Jiang Mansion.

129
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,290
If something seems off with Ning,

130
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,290
report it immediately.

131
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,260
Yes.

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,770
Sir.

133
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:05,970
Well,

134
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,190
we also have to warn Viscount Yan about this.

135
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,250
My relationship with the Yan family

136
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,460
can't be exposed yet.

137
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,870
Don't tell Yan Lin

138
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,000
anything about Ning Er.

139
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,110
Yes.

[Xie Wei]

141
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,140
Last time, I only focused on the empress position.

142
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,150
I didn't pay much attention to anything else.

143
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,930
I'd overlooked too many details.

144
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,120
I still don’t know the details of Xie Wei's background

145
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,050
and his relationship

146
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,610
with Yan Lin.

147
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,520
What should we do now?

148
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,590
Keep playing dumb?

149
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,390
The problem is

150
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,970
whether Xie Wei will believe it.

151
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,110
How about

152
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,000
joining hands with Xie Xian?

153
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,940
But what skills and bargaining chips do I have

154
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,010
to win his heart?

155
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,410
Or,

156
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,710
I should go all the way with what I've started

157
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,690
and simply go against Xie Wei?

158
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,060
Your Majesty, do you have something to say?

159
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,850
How long are you going to lock me up for?

160
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,540
The Ning'an Palace belongs to the empress.

161
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,250
Your Majesty has been working hard to run it for years.

162
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,950
You've fought back and forth,

163
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,140
and even abandoned and exploited sincerity.

164
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,950
Didn't you do all that just so you could secure the empress position

165
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,400
and live here in peace?

166
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,460
Now, everything is as you wish.

167
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,890
What else do you want?

168
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,700
It's a serious crime to place the empress under house arrest.

169
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,670
When His Majesty was battling his illness, he ordered me to supervise the country.

170
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,680
How dare you!

171
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,100
Supervise the country?

172
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,020
Do you think

173
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,930
you can win the hearts of the people

174
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,030
with just one imperial jade seal

175
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,950
and one decree?

176
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,510
When you first entered the palace,

177
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,280
you were once the princess' study partner.

178
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,550
I was also once your teacher.

179
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,280
It seems that all the politics lessons I taught you

180
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,590
were for nothing.

181
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,250
What is your relationship

182
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,620
with Yan Lin,

183
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,200
such that you could join hands in the rebellion?

184
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,650
The relationship between the two of you

185
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,810
must be more than just superficial.

186
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,950
You just need to know that

187
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,330
you reap

188
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,880
what you sow.

189
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,620
The Xue family is not innocent.

190
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,940
And you

191
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,880
are also not innocent.

192
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,419
Or should I just forget it?

193
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,620
But actually,

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,460
if he could become my subordinate...

195
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,370
No.

196
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,640
That's unthinkable.

197
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,980
No matter what,

198
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,350
this time,

199
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,340
I must take the lead

200
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,050
to pursue good fortune and avoid disaster.

201
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,240
Your Royal Highness.

202
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,370
You may leave first.

203
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,120
Father.

204
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,630
You're back at the right time.

205
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,630
[Marquis of Yan, Yan Mu]

206
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,730
This is the schedule of your coming-of-age ceremony.

207
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,800
Take a look.

208
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,820
This isn't urgent.

209
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,900
There are more than two months left.

210
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,420
[Coming-of-age Ceremony Schedule]

211
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,560
I have something else to talk to you about.

212
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,790
Is it about that girl from the Jiang family?

213
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,430
You already knew about it?

214
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,640
As your father, how can I not know

215
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,530
what you're thinking about?

216
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,340
Don't worry.

217
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,680
After your coming-of-age ceremony,

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,740
I'll go to the Jiang family to propose the marriage for you.

219
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,400
Really?

220
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,610
Father, you can't go back on your word.

221
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,520
I only have Ning in my heart.

222
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,820
She's the only one I'll marry.

223
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,750
In this lifetime, my love for her will never waver.

224
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:53,870
Good.

225
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,790
You're so sincerely affectionate.

226
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,500
You're my son indeed.

227
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,800
But...

228
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,100
have you ever asked

229
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,660
how Miss Jiang feels about this?

230
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,240
Don't let this be your own wishful thinking,

231
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,090
or you'll be disappointed in the end.

232
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,170
I've already thought about it.

233
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,200
When the right time comes,

234
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,650
I'll confess to her.

235
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
Father, you should prepare the lavish gifts in advance.

236
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,560
Don't treat Ning shabbily.

237
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,340
Today's investigation at Miss Jiang's

238
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,630
uncovered many corrupt people.

239
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,250
Her court

240
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,680
should have been cleaned up long ago.

241
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,030
It's a mess.

242
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,690
You can't tell who's the master and who's the servant,

243
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,930
there's no order.

244
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,880
Seriously.

245
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,720
But she's quite smart.

246
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,980
Did she insinuate that

247
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,290
I was the one

248
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,850
who didn't manage the household well in front of my lord?

249
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,530
I didn't hear anything about that.

250
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,280
Actually, Miss Jiang will grow up eventually.

251
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,170
Why don't you calm down

252
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,580
and talk to her nicely?

253
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,560
Then maybe you can resolve the problem between the two of you.

254
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,620
All these years, I've said everything I could.

255
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,520
And we still ended up here, with chaotic arguments.

256
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,310
What else can be changed?

257
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,720
I don't know what's wrong.

258
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,700
Whenever I see her,

259
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,490
no matter what she says,

260
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,380
because of the expression in her eyes, her tone and her attitude,

261
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,530
I can't help

262
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,270
but be reminded of that bitch Wan Niang.

263
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,270
It's suffocating.

264
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,060
[Scar Cream]

265
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,010
What's the use of

266
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,520
this scar cream?

267
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,780
I've been using it for four years.

268
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,210
Why is there no effect at all?

269
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,180
Madam.

270
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,730
The physician said that

271
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,740
you need to keep applying the medicine.

272
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,690
You can't rush it.

273
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,210
Madam.

274
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,320
-Master.
-My Lord is here.

275
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,040
You may leave.

276
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,630
My Lady.

277
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,480
I'm so happy today.

278
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,510
What made you so happy?

279
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,440
Although Ju'an

280
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,470
is

281
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,810
young and promising,

282
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,850
his chess skills still lack experience.

283
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,700
I found a loophole

284
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,300
and beat him!

285
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,330
Look at how happy you are.

286
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,830
Xie Wei

287
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,090
is just the Crown Prince's junior preceptor.

288
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,760
Why do you think so highly of him

289
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,130
and maintain a close relationship with him?

290
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,350
This is called a woman's opinion.

291
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,230
His Majesty has no son now.

292
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,200
This so-called junior preceptor position

293
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,940
is more of an advisor to His Majesty,

294
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,250
scheming for His Majesty.

295
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,160
Ju'an is still young,

296
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,360
but he has already gained His Majesty's favor.

297
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,510
He doesn't have to worry about the future.

298
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,720
I see.

299
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,490
My Lord is wise.

300
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,600
By the way,

301
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,470
Ju'an also told me that

302
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,680
the Empress Dowager is choosing a study partner for the First Princess.

303
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,100
All the officials in the capital with daughters of a suitable age

304
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,710
should choose and send one good-natured daughter,

305
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,870
who will then go through the selection process in the palace.

306
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,950
Princess Leyang

307
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,200
is His Majesty and the Empress Dowager's favorite.

308
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,400
If one can become her study partner,

309
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,110
one's family will be greatly honored.

310
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,600
If our Hui gets this title,

311
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,470
it'll be great for her future marriage.

312
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,020
That's practically

313
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,030
really beneficial.

314
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,390
When she gets married in the future,

315
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,880
it'll definitely be infinitely dignified.

316
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,850
No wonder Ning said

317
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,090
you are biased.

318
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,550
With her personality, how can we send her to the palace?

319
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,100
Ning

320
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,460
is so disobedient.

321
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,960
If she causes any trouble in the palace,

322
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,040
the Jiang family will be implicated.

323
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,980
You're right.

324
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,310
In fact, in terms of character, talent,

325
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,550
and experience in handling matters,

326
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,200
of course,

327
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,800
Hui is more suitable.

328
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,850
Of course.

329
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:21,980
But

330
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,560
you know what Ning's temper

331
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,090
is like.

332
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,300
If she knows we went behind her back

333
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,240
and made this decision,

334
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,550
once she starts a ruckus,

335
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,100
she won't give up.

336
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,510
It's not up to her.

337
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,890
We have the right to make the decision as her parents.

338
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,240
We can't let her do everything she wants.

339
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,580
Okay.

340
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,280
My Lady.

341
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,110
Please give me some time

342
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,620
to think about it.

343
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,580
I'll find a good time

344
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,580
and a good reason

345
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,840
to tell her about it slowly.

346
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,670
Jiang Xuening.

347
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,400
You're really a liar.

348
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,120
Look where you're going!

349
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,270
Viscount Yan?

350
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,160
Why did you go up there again?

351
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,630
Be careful or my master might see you.

352
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,160
Viscount Yan.

353
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,210
Come down quickly.

354
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,470
Be careful or my master might see you.

355
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,820
Miss.

356
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,100
Ning.

357
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,190
You finally came out.

358
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,350
Miss.

359
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,720
It's fine that Viscount Yan didn't come through the front door,

360
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,450
but he threw a stone at me.

361
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,400
You have to back me up.

362
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,560
Silly girl.

363
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,140
Your Miss must be partial to me.

364
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,230
Am I right, Ning?

365
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:55,890
What are you thinking about?

366
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,590
Why are you here?

367
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,150
I have something to tell you.

368
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,160
It's the Double Ninth Festival the day after tomorrow.

369
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,360
There's a lantern show in the capital.

370
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,450
I want to bring you there.

371
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,040
The Double Ninth Festival's lantern show?

372
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,290
Wasn't that

373
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,230
when I first met Shen Zhiyi?

374
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,670
Look! It's on fire!

375
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,140
What happened?

376
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,270
Her lantern fell onto the ground and lit her dress on fire.

377
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,680
What happened? How did it get lit on fire?

378
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,670
Then, at the Double Ninth Festival's lantern show,

379
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,560
I'd mistakenly caused the First Princess, Shen Zhiyi,

380
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,360
[Princess Leyang, Shen Zhiyi]

381
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,460
to fall in love with me.

382
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,140
Later, when I entered the palace as a study partner,

383
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,010
she found out that I was disguised as a man then,

384
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,830
and got really angry,

385
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,070
giving me a hard time.

386
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,340
We can't bump into each other again.

387
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,820
Are you going or not?

388
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,890
I won't go this time.

389
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,740
Next time, if you're interested in any lantern shows,

390
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,680
come look for me

391
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,730
and I'll go with you.

392
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,440
What you just said is strange.

393
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,520
What's the difference between this time and the next time?

394
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,200
It's just that the lanterns

395
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,940
are different each time.

396
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,990
Or do you already have other plans on the day of the Double Ninth Festival,

397
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,660
so you can't join me?

398
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,930
I'm not feeling well these days.

399
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,360
I want to rest at home for a few days.

400
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,220
You do look pale indeed.

401
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,750
Fine.

402
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,740
For the next few days,

403
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,000
have a good rest at home.

404
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,010
I'll

405
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,140
find out when the next lantern show

406
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:26,710
will be,

407
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,680
and update you later.

408
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,120
You brat!

409
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,470
Did you climb over the wall again?

410
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,330
I caught you, didn't I?

411
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,930
Don't salute me.

412
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,270
You're the noble son of a marquis,

413
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,570
and you climb over her wall every day.

414
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,040
How inappropriate!

415
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,540
Mr. Jiang.

416
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,250
Isn't the wall built for someone to climb?

417
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,280
Let me tell you.

418
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,930
Mr. Yan.

419
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,520
Ning is not the only woman

420
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,990
in our Jiang family.

421
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,360
But every time I visit,

422
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,990
I only have eyes for Ning.

423
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,560
You...

424
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,090
Come here.

425
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,240
You're just making fallacious arguments.

426
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,600
Listen.

427
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,200
Don't climb over the wall again.

428
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,250
This is inappropriate.

429
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,760
All right, leave now.

430
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,350
Uncle,

431
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,839
I just want to say a few words.

432
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,420
-Ning, I…
-Say...

433
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,069
Say a few words?

434
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,430
Ning!

435
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,000
Leave!

436
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,720
You're not leaving?

437
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,569
Calm down.

438
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,030
Are you leaving or not?

439
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,589
Don't hit me.

440
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,079
Are you leaving or not?

441
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,400
-I’ll hit you if you don’t leave!
-I’m a martial artist.

442
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,180
Leave!

443
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,030
Uncle.

444
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,210
You're even trying to hide?

445
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,160
I...

446
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:26,900
Uncle.

447
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,210
Father, be careful.

448
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,420
Are you okay?

449
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,850
I got off on the wrong foot today.

450
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,040
I'll visit you again another day.

451
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,180
Brat,

452
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,710
you're not allowed to climb over the wall ever again!

453
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,850
Even if you want to visit,

454
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,280
you have to come through the front door!

455
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,430
I'll remember that.

456
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,600
That brat.

457
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,890
He's lucky he ran away fast.

458
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,050
-Get up.
-My back.

459
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,710
Tell me.

460
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,470
You...

461
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,730
You...

462
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,460
What in the world is this?

463
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,970
Father,

464
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,270
If you don't enter the palace now,

465
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm afraid you're going to be late.

466
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,140
Right.

467
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,480
All right.

468
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,600
Return to your room quickly.

469
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,220
The last time I went to the palace as a study partner,

470
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,230
not only did Shen Zhiyi and the others give me a hard time,

471
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,610
Xie Wei was also there as a teacher.

472
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,020
This time,

473
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,870
I must not run into him again.

474
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,510
This impeachment memorial says that

475
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,620
the Xingwu Defense Department has searched the entire city for the rebels of Lord Pingnan

476
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,120
without a warrant, which is against the law.

477
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,580
The abuse of illegal punishment is also a greater violation of the law.

478
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,530
Chen Ying.

479
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,180
Does the Ministry of Justice think I'm not employing my people properly?

480
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,400
Your Majesty, please simmer down.

481
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,370
About this matter,

482
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,190
an insignificant official of the Ministry of Justice

483
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,100
submitted the memorial without authorization.

484
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,510
I couldn't stop him in time.

485
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,940
[Vice Minister for Justice, Chen Ying]

486
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,900
It was definitely not my intention.

487
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,100
Ridiculous!

488
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,350
Can't you call the shots at the Ministry of Justice?

489
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,350
In that case,

490
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,630
you might as well give up your position

491
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,390
as the Vice Minister for Justice.

492
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,420
Your Majesty, please simmer down.

493
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,240
Your Majesty.

494
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,860
In my opinion,

495
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,340
The rebels of Lord Pingnan are a major threat to the country.

496
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,040
[Duke of Xue, Xue Yuan]

497
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,940
For the previous years,

498
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,190
all of the inspections were conducted by the Xingwu Guards.

499
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,820
Moreover, many of the cases that the Xingwu Guards handle are very dangerous.

500
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,360
We can't always wait for approval

501
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,270
before taking action.

502
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,030
The person who reported this is a low-ranking official, Zhang Zhe.

503
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,750
If we don't punish him severely,

504
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,350
then wouldn't that mean that

505
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,000
anyone can overthrow the old law

506
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,810
and rebel against your will?

507
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,340
Marquis of Yan, do you have anything to say?

508
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,190
Your Majesty.

509
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,190
It's because the court has always been open-minded,

510
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,050
that we were able to sustain our incorrupt government

511
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,840
up till today.

512
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,920
If we dismiss Zhang Zhe because of this,

513
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,520
I'm afraid it'll cast a chill over the officials.

514
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,630
Junior Preceptor Xie,

515
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,120
what do you think?

516
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,480
Your Majesty.

517
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,010
I think that

518
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,900
Zhang Zhe has offended His Majesty

519
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,000
and should be dismissed as punishment.

520
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,060
However, the Xingwu Guards have been investigating the cases of the rebels for years,

521
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,120
but to no effect.

522
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,460
Also, many rebels have sneaked into the capital recently.

523
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,030
Why don't we hand this case over to the Ministry of Justice?

524
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,110
If the Ministry of Justice has a plan for this search,

525
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,360
Zhang Zhe will be reinstated.

526
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,990
Then the public's dissents can be shut down

527
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,820
and the Xingwu Guards' power can be counterbalanced.

528
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,740
If the Ministry of Justice fails to handle the case,

529
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,240
and misses the chance to arrest the rebels,

530
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,600
what should we do?

531
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,160
If that's the case,

532
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,380
no one in the court

533
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,450
will stop the Xingwu Guards from doing their work.

534
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,690
If everyone is united,

535
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,380
these rebels will be like rootless wood

536
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,000
and will be destroyed sooner or later.

537
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,360
When the time comes,

538
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,490
Zhang Zhe would be deported out of the capital

539
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,470
and never rehired.

540
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,440
Junior Preceptor Xie, you're right.

541
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,060
Let’s do as you said.

542
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,550
Chen Ying.

543
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,940
Listen carefully.

544
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,100
If anything goes wrong again,

545
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,870
you'll be held responsible first!

546
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

547
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,230
I won

548
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,940
that piece by luck.

549
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:33,730
Mr. Xie.

550
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,130
Mr. Jiang.

551
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,120
Mr. Xie, thank you for your help today.

552
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,640
I've prepared a humble meal

553
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,540
at Cengxiao Restaurant.

554
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,520
I hope you would come.

555
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,070
Mr. Chen has been in charge of the Ministry of Justice for many years.

556
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,410
Even without me,

557
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,330
you would have been able to tide through this.

558
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,650
There's no need for a banquet.

559
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,230
I hope you can catch the rebels and purge the capital

560
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,370
as soon as possible.

561
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,280
Your Lordship.

562
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,700
Xie Wei's words

563
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,920
seems fair,

564
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,060
but he actually seized the real power of the Xingwu Guards.

565
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,260
Do you think

566
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,680
he is in cahoots with the Yan family?

567
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,250
So what if he is?

568
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,040
And so what if he isn't?

569
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,700
Under the reign of His Majesty,

570
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,500
no one can turn the tide.

571
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,960
You're right.

572
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,470
Ju'an understands His Majesty deeply

573
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,220
and doesn't form cliques.

574
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,210
He's indeed a gentleman.

575
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,670
Back then, Lord Pingnan betrayed the country

576
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,810
and led his troops straight to the capital

577
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,240
and killed many people.

578
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,420
Even after so many years,

579
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,810
this matter

580
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,460
is still a great threat to His Majesty.

581
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,010
Yes.

582
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,480
Fortunately,

583
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,000
the two families of Xue and Yan joined forces to quell the rebellion

584
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,410
so that we can have the peace today.

585
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,550
Mr. Jiang.

586
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,370
A few days ago,

587
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,250
the Xingwu Guards broke into the residence of a military official from Yan's troops,

588
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,560
and claimed that they caught a rebel.

589
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,010
They are interrogating him now.

590
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,440
I'm afraid there's going to be

591
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,690
bloodshed in the capital again.

592
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,430
Today,

593
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,880
the two families of Yan and Xue have since separated.

594
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,940
Mr. Jiang should also be prepared with a plan in advance.

595
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,520
I'm afraid that once things start happening,

596
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,600
it'll be tough to isolate oneself from the corruption.

597
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,890
Ju'an, what do you mean by that?

598
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,190
This matter...

599
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,000
should not be mentioned by me.

600
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,720
But the Second Young Lady is close with the Yan family,

601
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,420
and too many rumors can confound right and wrong.

602
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,550
Gossip is a fearful thing.

603
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,220
If you don't have the heart to brave the storm,

604
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,150
why bother getting involved?

605
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,440
Ju'an. you're right.

606
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,590
Here.

607
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,330
I heard that Viscount Yan

608
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,460
climbed over the wall today to look for you again.

609
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,410
How inappropriate.

610
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,380
Both of you are all grown up.

611
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,090
Can you be more careful

612
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,880
and be considerate to your sister?

613
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,660
Okay?

614
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,070
Mother, if you called me here for this,

615
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,420
you don't have to say anything more.

616
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,980
I don't want to control Yan Lin,

617
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,200
nor do I have the right to do so.

618
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,140
You...

619
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,520
Mother, don't worry.

620
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,450
With Viscount Yan,

621
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,080
my sister's wedding will definitely be a decent one.

622
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,500
Maybe

623
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,060
I can benefit from association too.

624
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,720
I'm back.

625
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,490
I was wondering why it's so quiet here.

626
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,880
So you're all gathered here.

627
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:26,800
Come on.

628
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,240
Have a seat.

629
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,040
Sit.

630
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,810
What's going on?

631
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,050
Are you fighting again?

632
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,540
I don't have time for that.

633
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,480
Nanny Yang.

634
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,060
Today, the Mansion of Duke of Xue

635
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,070
and the You family of the Mansion of Earl of You

636
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,410
sent banquet invitations to admire chrysanthemums on the Double Ninth Festival simultaneously.

637
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,010
The dates for the two families happened to clash.

638
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,730
I want to take the two girls

639
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,560
to attend the banquet at the Xue Mansion.

640
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,430
My Lord, what do you think?

641
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,240
The Mansion of Earl of You?

642
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,320
Her Majesty.

643
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,750
Wear my maid uniform

644
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,010
Head west from the Hua Gate.

645
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,020
I've prepared men

646
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,920
to escort you out of the palace

647
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,220
and I'll be here to stall them.

648
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,880
Don't waste your energy.

649
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,500
Xie Wei is extremely malicious,

650
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,650
and Yan Lin hates me intensely.

651
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,750
I can hide for a while,

652
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,890
but I can't hide forever.

653
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,290
If you hadn't saved me into the palace,

654
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:24,730
[The Empress' Personal Courtier, You Fangyin]

655
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,620
I'm still just an illegitimate daughter of the Mansion of the Earl of You. I have no choice.

656
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,660
You've treated me well.

657
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,950
How can I watch you die in Ning'an Palace?

658
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,540
Right.

659
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,770
Fangyin is the illegitimate daughter of the You family.

660
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,670
The Xue Mansion is bustling with guests,

661
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,230
and they enjoy a flashy status in the court.

662
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,070
I'm thinking

663
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,490
if it's necessary for our Jiang family to join the crowd?

664
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,270
My Lord,

665
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,700
you don’t know.

666
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,590
For years, the Xue Mansion's banquet to admire chrysanthemums

667
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,590
has been

668
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,090
the event for wealthy families in the capital to check out prospective marriage opportunities.

669
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,610
Soon,

670
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,960
Hui will no longer be 18 years old.

671
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,390
If we don't act now,

672
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,030
we'll be too late.

673
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,780
All right.

674
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,960
Our Jiang family

675
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,190
has never formed cliques for personal gains.

676
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,330
But in recent years,

677
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,580
we've become quite close with the Yan family.

678
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,450
People will inevitably gossip about it.

679
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,230
In that case,

680
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,690
you two

681
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,120
should go to separate banquets.

682
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,390
Father.

683
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,700
I want to go to the You family.

684
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,000
How dare you interrupt

685
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,370
when elders are speaking?

686
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,910
Mother, you're going to the Xue family to check out future son-in-laws.

687
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,990
If a disreputable person like me is present,

688
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,900
I'm afraid it might affect others around me too.

689
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,020
Then, you'll scold me again.

690
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,110
I might as well not go.

691
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,790
Enough.

692
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,340
Ning.

693
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,430
But now,

694
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,760
the dates of their banquets clash.

695
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,460
I estimate that on that day,

696
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,560
the You family will certainly not have many visitors.

697
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,210
Ning.

698
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,480
You like to be in boisterous crowds.

699
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,930
Will you regret...

700
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,530
After all, both families had already sent their invitations,

701
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,960
and they didn't say we can only choose one.

702
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,180
I'll go to the You family on behalf of the Jiang family

703
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,650
to send our kind regards.

704
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,480
That's great!

705
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,530
My Lady, look.

706
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,870
Our Ning has really grown up

707
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,990
and is becoming more and more sensible.

708
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,260
She knows how to be understanding of her parents' difficulties.

709
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,760
Am I right, My Lady?

710
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,300
This is the new species.

711
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:13,870
Yes.

712
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,320
It blooms really nicely.

713
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,870
It's gorgeous.

714
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,570
Look.

715
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,530
And there's this color too.

716
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,040
Your outfit today is really well-coordinated.

717
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,790
Seriously.

718
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,350
[The second daughter of the Earl of You, You Yue]

719
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,270
Why are there so few people?

720
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,920
After all, we're an Earl's Mansion

721
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,470
and our ancestors had received honors.

722
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,560
They can only see the wealth of the Xue family.

723
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,960
They are all snobs.

724
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,660
The Second Young Lady of the Jiang family is here!

725
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,660
Why is she here?

726
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,610
Right?

727
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,660
She's the wild girl raised by the Jiang family in the countryside.

728
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,670
I heard she has a bad temper.

729
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,300
But she looks quite good.

730
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,660
Tell me,

731
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,810
between the two of us, who's prettier?

732
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,640
Miss, of course you are.

733
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,520
You are born beautiful.

734
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,090
Miss.

735
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,450
The You family's Second Young Lady is there.

736
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,420
Are we going to greet her?

737
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:22,980
Not yet.

738
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,890
I need to find someone first.

739
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:33,950
She did it on purpose, didn't she?

740
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,990
She's an uncouth girl from the countryside.

741
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
I gave her some respect,

742
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,070
yet she dared to ignore me?

743
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,780
Miss, you don't have to stoop to her level.

744
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,080
By the way,

745
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,930
have you locked that wench You Fangyin up?

746
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,530
Usually, it doesn't matter.

747
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,700
But at today's grand event,

748
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,870
she's an embarrassment that must not be let out.

749
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,510
Miss, don't worry.

750
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,600
She's locked up in her room.

751
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,450
Just now, the nannies also taught her a lesson,

752
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,700
and she seems to be injured.

753
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,540
She's just like her mother.

754
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,660
A bitch with a despicable fate,

755
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,810
who deserves to die.

756
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,230
[The concubine's daughter of the Earl of You, You Fangyin]

757
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,870
Miss.

758
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:07,880
Time to eat.

759
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,220
Don't run!

760
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,040
You're not allowed to leave!

761
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,910
-You're not allowed to leave!
-Let me go see my mother.

762
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,350
She'll be buried soon.

763
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,700
It's just a concubine's death.

764
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,000
The village will handle it.

765
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,980
We're having a banquet in the Mansion today.

766
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,680
Don't go out and cause trouble.

767
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,820
Help!

768
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,950
The Third Young Lady ran away!

769
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,610
Help!

770
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,860
Hurry up. Untie the horse.

771
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,800
Okay.

772
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,570
His Highness.

773
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,490
Hurry up.

774
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,060
If we don’t set off now,

775
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,240
the banquet at the Xue Mansion will be over.

776
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,670
Then let it end.

777
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,590
Ning is not going there anyway,

778
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,230
and I don't have to be infuriated by seeing Xue Ye there.

779
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,010
Royal Highness!

780
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,330
Royal Highness!

781
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:51,810
His Highness.

782
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,670
[Yan Lin's Guard, Qing Feng]

783
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:52,730
Royal Highness.

784
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,640
I saw Miss Jiang going to the Mansion of the Earl of You.

785
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,250
What?

786
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,010
Did you see it clearly?

787
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,040
Absolutely.

788
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,720
Upon your order, I went to the Jiang Mansion

789
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,630
to deliver medicine to Miss Jiang.

790
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,100
I happened to see Miss Jiang going out

791
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,110
and followed her all the way.

792
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,500
I saw her entering the Mansion of the Earl of You.

793
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,540
I invited her to the lantern show on the day of the Double Ninth Festival

794
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,290
and she rejected it.

795
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,930
Yet, when she was invited to admire chrysanthemums on the same day,

796
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,190
she accepted it?

797
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,060
The Mansion of the Earl of You is shabby.

798
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,220
Is she trying to piss me off?

799
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,230
Maybe she made an appointment with someone else.

800
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,070
In my opinion,

801
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:16,980
we should set off quickly now,

802
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,220
or it'll really be too late.

803
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,830
His Highness.

804
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,250
Go there by yourself.

805
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,960
I have to go to the You Mansion

806
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,380
to see what ridiculous excuse she can make up to patronize me.

807
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:23,740
I...

808
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,560
He sure is temperamental.

809
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,100
In that case,

810
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,390
I'll also go check out the Mansion of the Earl of You.

811
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,020
Let's go.

812
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,360
Stop running!

813
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,520
You bitch!

814
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,130
How dare you run!

815
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,390
How dare you!

816
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,120
How dare you!

817
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,490
Don't you know where you came from?

818
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,040
We've raised you for so many years.

819
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,220
How dare you run away?

820
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,450
You sure run fast.

821
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,520
How dare you rebel!

822
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,520
Please let me see my mother one last time.

823
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,270
It'll be too late.

824
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,530
What are you yelling about?

825
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,440
If the Second Young Lady finds out that you're running around,

826
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,830
we'll all suffer.

827
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,770
Let her come to her senses.

828
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,820
Wake her up.

829
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,450
Let's go.

830
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,030
Quick! Look!

831
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,810
It's Viscount Yan.

832
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,350
He's coming our way.

833
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,430
He seems to be looking for someone.

834
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,030
He must be looking for Miss You.

835
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,630
Don't talk nonsense.

836
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,520
We didn't invite Viscount Yan.

837
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:35,820
Maybe

838
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,770
he's just passing by.

839
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,610
Lord Linzi is here too.

840
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,790
Sister You,

841
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,510
you're so well connected.

842
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,060
Yan Lin.

843
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,320
Why are you walking so fast?

844
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,930
Why didn't you wait for me?

845
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,670
Since you're here,

846
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,450
help me find her quickly.

847
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,130
Greetings, His Highness.

848
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:53,530
Greetings.

849
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:53,950
All right.

850
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,480
Let's forget the formalities.

851
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,130
Let me ask you.

852
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,030
Where is Jiang Xuening?

853
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,250
I'll teach you a lesson.

854
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,850
You little bitch!

855
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,410
Stop that!

856
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,430
Viscount Yan is actually here for Jiang Xuening?

857
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,840
Could they be...

858
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,830
Don't talk nonsense.

859
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,640
How could Viscount Yan like her?

860
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:21,830
Right.

861
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,870
It doesn't look like it.

862
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,220
Bad news!

863
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,120
Someone fell into the water!

864
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,190
Oh no.

865
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,970
Someone fell into the water?

866
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,020
How could that happen?

867
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,700
Let's go

868
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,380
and have a look.

869
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,470
Little bitch, I'll drown you! I...

870
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,370
Move!

871
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,210
Fangyin! Fangyin!

872
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,080
Who are you?

873
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,760
Who are you to meddle in our  Mansion's affairs?

874
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,430
Fangyin! Fangyin! Fangyin!

875
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,750
She's dying

876
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,570
and you don't want others to interfere?

877
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:58,930
It's none of your business.

878
00:32:59,520 --> 00:32:59,900
This...

879
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,670
Hurry, go and take a look.

880
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,590
She fell into the water.

881
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,520
What happened to you?

882
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,060
Which family's Lady is it?

883
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,770
I'm fine.

884
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:34,820
Wait.

885
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,140
Miss Jiang, what brings you here?

886
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,010
You're a guest at someone else's house

887
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,100
but you're roaming around everywhere.

888
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,250
It's really the first time I'm encountering such a situation.

889
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,790
Is it because you're from the countryside,

890
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,280
so you're ignorant?

891
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,660
These women were punishing the Lady.

892
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,220
It's indeed the first time I'm encountering such a situation,

893
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,470
where the slaves are bullying their master.

894
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

895
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,790
It was just some servants messing around

896
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,860
and something went wrong by mistake.

897
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,460
This lady is clearly a daughter

898
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,530
of your Mansion's concubine.

899
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
When did she become a servant?

900
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,120
It's none of your business.

901
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,219
My family will take care of my family's affairs.

902
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,650
I wanted to save her,

903
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,730
so naturally, I want to protect her.

904
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,429
You Yue.

905
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,409
if I see you torturing

906
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,010
and bullying her again,

907
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,159
don't blame me for showing you

908
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,380
even more drastic measures.

909
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,820
Jiang Xuening is so used to being unruly.

910
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,050
She even wants to meddle in another family's affairs.

911
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,130
But judging from her clothing,

912
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,510
she must be the illegitimate daughter of the You family.

913
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,230
I didn't expect the You family's tradition to be like this.

914
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,830
If this goes on, everyone will look bad.

915
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,750
Persuade Miss Jiang to change her clothes first.

916
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:45,780
Enough.

917
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,530
A girl fell into the water

918
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,679
and a group of people are crowding around to watch.

919
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,730
How unseemly.

920
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,800
Disperse the crowd.

921
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,199
Let's go.

922
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,469
How could something like this happen?

923
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,420
Change into dry clothes first before anything else.

924
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,200
Miss!

925
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,140
Miss.

926
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,680
What happened to you?

927
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,170
It's my fault for getting distracted and losing you.

928
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,540
Miss, wait a minute.

929
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,370
I'll go get your spare clothes in the carriage.

930
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,090
In that case,

931
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,870
let me borrow the Third Young Lady's bedroom to change.

932
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,760
You...

933
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,170
What?

934
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,910
Do you want me to change here?

935
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,850
As you please, Miss Jiang.

936
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,410
It's inconvenient for men to enter the room.

937
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,420
I'll wait for you in the forecourt.

938
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,890
Let's go.

939
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,350
Jiang, you sure are a hero.

940
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,200
I finally understand.

941
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,630
I'm afraid Ning came to the You Mansion

942
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,760
for the You family's Third Young Lady.

943
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,830
When did they get acquainted?

944
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,600
Why didn't I know about it?

945
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,780
Why?

946
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,440
Are you jealous of even girls?

947
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,340
Let's go.

948
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,160
There are many people around.

949
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,340
Show me some respect.

950
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,730
Thank you for saving my life, my savior.

951
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,620
Get up.

952
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,320
Get up.

953
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,800
In the future, don't just kowtow to anyone.

954
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:21,750
Sit down.

955
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,380
Here.

956
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,450
Thank you.

957
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,790
I heard you said

958
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,260
you wanted to go see your mother off.

959
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,770
Actually,

960
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,760
it's already too late.

961
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,690
I just wanted to see her one last time

962
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,190
and call her mother.

963
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,140
I knew you were miserable,

964
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,870
but I didn't know

965
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,530
it was to this extent.

966
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,590
You're the You family's Third Young Lady after all.

967
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,480
How dare those servants treat you like that?

968
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,030
They accused my mother of committing adultery.

969
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,920
They even called me a bastard.

970
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,230
We were already

971
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,680
living very cautiously and discreetly.

972
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,540
Is it wrong for us to even just live?

973
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,070
It's not your fault.

974
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,320
I can see that

975
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,600
you don't want to die.

976
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,660
Now that you had a close call

977
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,520
with death,

978
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,950
there's nothing to be afraid of from now on.

979
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,300
No matter how hard it is, you have to persist.

980
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,190
At least, live a decent life

981
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,250
so that you wouldn't have come to this world in vain.

982
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,980
I can't take your money.

983
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,390
In desperate situations,

984
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,460
don't act tough.

985
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,140
Take the money

986
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,180
and use it to build a tomb for your mother

987
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,200
and be good to yourself.

988
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,480
Miss.

989
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,450
I've brought your clothes.

990
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,390
Can I open the door?

991
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:56,960
Miss.

992
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,090
Why do you treat me so well?

993
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,410
I was also once treated as an illegitimate daughter

994
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,010
and sent to the villages for over 10 years.

995
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,430
I know how it feels

996
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,420
to be treated coldly and to lack the basic clothes and food.

997
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:12,950
Also,

998
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,100
we've met

999
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,540
a long time ago.

1000
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,250
I know you're a good lady.

1001
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,960
From now on,

1002
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,230
live a good life.

1003
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,320
[Mansion of the Earl of You]

1004
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,800
Hurry up.

1005
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,250
Report to Madam

1006
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,650
that Her Highness, the First Princess, is here.

1007
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,680
-Hurry. Hurry.
-Yes.

1008
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,180
Where is His Highness, Lord Linzi?

1009
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,630
He went to drink and admire the flowers.

1010
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,470
How refined.

1011
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,440
Tang'er.

1012
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,570
Let's go admire the flowers too.

1013
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,250
Don't you have anything to explain?

1014
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,840
What?

1015
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,750
You told me you were not feeling well

1016
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,040
and wanted to rest at home for a few days.

1017
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,750
But then?

1018
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,070
You came to someone else's mansion to admire the flowers.

1019
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,920
Are you trying to piss me off?

1020
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,730
I also only found out about You Mansion's invitation

1021
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,970
after you left.

1022
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,910
It was an impromptu decision.

1023
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,030
Besides,

1024
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,310
aren't you here now?

1025
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,890
Jiang Xuening.

1026
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,240
I was wrong.

1027
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,370
That's more like it.

1028
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,880
How is the Third Young Lady?

1029
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,830
Are the two of you acquainted?

1030
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,070
We've met once.

1031
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,440
She's fine for now.

1032
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,540
But you were too bold just now.

1033
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,420
So many people were watching

1034
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,660
and you just gave me your cloak.

1035
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,970
I don't know

1036
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,770
what kind of rumors they will spread.

1037
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,290
Then let them spread the rumors.

1038
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,230
In the past, a few years before my coming-of-age ceremony,

1039
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,880
I was afraid there might be some mishap in the process

1040
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,120
and you'd be implicated by the rumors.

1041
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,270
Now, my coming-of-age ceremony is in two months.

1042
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,120
I can't wait to let the whole world know.

1043
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,170
The coming-of-age ceremony...

1044
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,140
Since you're already out today,

1045
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,000
you don't have to rush back.

1046
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,130
Later this afternoon, when the female guests disperse,

1047
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,530
wait for me at Cengxiao Restaurant.

1048
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,620
I'll go look for you later

1049
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,400
and take you to the lantern show.

1050
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:05,910
Yan Lin.

1051
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,130
Actually, I...

1052
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,570
Miss Jiang.

1053
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,180
Viscount Yan.

1054
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,010
A distinguished guest showed up at the yard where the female guests are at.

1055
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,270
Madam is looking for you to join there.

1056
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,150
All right.

1057
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,910
You should go there quickly.

1058
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,520
His Highness is waiting for me to drink too.

1059
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,580
Don't forget about our appointment at Cengxiao Restaurant this afternoon.

1060
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,250
But I...

1061
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,570
[Qinlan Pavilion]

1062
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,090
Yue.

1063
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,190
Whether you get chosen to enter the palace as a study partner

1064
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,470
depends on today.

1065
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,100
I understand.

1066
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,130
Princess Leyang is here!

1067
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,580
Greetings, Princess Leyang.

1068
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,980
Why is she here too?

1069
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,620
This is bad.

1070
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,160
I didn't expect that I still couldn't escape despite trying so hard.

1071
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,840
Miss.

1072
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,120
Get up.

1073
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,970
[Princess Leyang, Shen Zhiyi]

1074
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,570
We are not in the palace.

1075
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,580
Let's forget the formalities.

1076
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,130
Why is there a scar on her face?

1077
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,330
I don't know.

1078
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,920
Her Highness and I heard that

1079
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,440
[Daughter of Duke of Xue, Xue Shu]

1080
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,560
Miss You was also holding a banquet to admire chrysanthemums,

1081
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,630
so we came to check it out.

1082
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,170
Everyone, please carry on and have fun as usual.

1083
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,750
I hope our presence has not dampened your spirits,

1084
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,080
or else Her Highness will have a heavy heart.

1085
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,880
They were just fussing about having a drawing competition.

1086
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,850
Her Highness and Miss Xue are just in time.

1087
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,890
Why don't you join the competition?

1088
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,490
[Madam of the Mansion of Earl of You]

1089
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,520
Shu is good at painting.

1090
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,000
If she participates, no one will stand a chance.

1091
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:58,900
It's fine.

1092
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,080
You guys can go on with your painting.

1093
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,650
In that case,

1094
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,790
everyone, please use the theme of the chrysanthemum

1095
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,660
for your paintings, which would be presented to Her Highness.

1096
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,290
Now that the First Young Lady is married off,

1097
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,690
Madam You is planning for the Second Young Lady again.

1098
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,870
You Yue has no talents

1099
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,070
but she's quite good at painting.

1100
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,730
I think she deliberately mentioned the painting competition

1101
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,990
because she wants to

1102
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,440
flaunt her skills in front of the Princess.

1103
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:19,910
Miss.

1104
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,270
What should we do now?

1105
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,440
Sit there.

1106
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,890
Later, we'll find a chance to slip away.

1107
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,440
What?

1108
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,810
Do you really think I'm good at everything?

1109
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,220
If I can't win, the best strategy is to leave.

1110
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,360
Why should I stay and embarrass myself?

1111
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,830
Princess, please.

1112
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,520
Are you Jiang Xuening?

1113
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:44,950
Raise your head.

1114
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,750
Today,

1115
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,090
I came here for you.

1116
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,860
No wonder Yan Lin, in spite of his arrogance,

1117
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,000
is so devoted to you.

1118
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,360
What a beauty.

1119
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,980
Even my heart's fluttering when I see you.

1120
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,300
How enviable.

1121
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,300
It seems that we're not the only ones

1122
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,410
to know about Miss Jiang and Viscount Yan.

1123
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,340
Even Her Highness, the Princess, has heard about it.

1124
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,210
It's even more interesting than a novel.

1125
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:12,280
Yue.

1126
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,040
That was a slip of the tongue.

1127
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,930
Miss Jiang is a noble lady.

1128
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,100
Of course she values her maiden name.

1129
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,620
How could I have made such a comparison?

1130
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,390
Princess.

1131
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,110
Please.

1132
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,190
Come on.

1133
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:33,840
Cheers.

1134
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,010
Come on.

1135
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,110
No need for the courtesy.

1136
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,580
Come. Have a seat first.

1137
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,570
Have a seat.

1138
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,090
[Qinlan Pavilion]

1139
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,200
Yan Lin.

1140
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,710
It's not gentlemanly

1141
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,280
to sneak around in public like this.

1142
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,200
Didn't your precious sister

1143
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,170
go to the banquet at Xue Mansion with the Empress Dowager?

1144
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,770
Why did she come here?

1145
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,490
I'm sure Miss Jiang also wants to ask you this.

1146
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,000
Look at Xue Shu.

1147
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:02,870
She looks like a vicious person.

1148
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,300
She'd better not scare my Ning.

1149
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,100
This won't do. I have to go over there now.

1150
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,860
Let it go.

1151
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,670
You still don't think you've gone far enough today?

1152
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,080
The women are reciting poems and painting.

1153
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,780
Don't go over there.

1154
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:15,900
You and I are here.

1155
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,350
No one will dare to do anything to your Ning.

1156
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,050
Let's go and drink.

1157
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:19,760
Come on.

[Qinlan Pavilion]

1159
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,270
Why aren't you moving?

1160
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,740
Can't you paint?

1161
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,200
What can a country bumpkin girl know?

1162
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,810
Shen Zhiyi is moody as usual.

1163
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,270
I mustn't offend her this time.

1164
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,930
I told you to paint.

1165
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,610
You won't even listen to me?
