00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,190
one's life and death.

189
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,160
I

190
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,410
dare not play any tricks.

191
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,040
I just thought about

192
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,120
the days we came to the capital together

193
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,150
and helped each other.

194
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,890
Now,

195
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm in a desperate situation.

196
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,100
I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

197
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,380
I just want to be safe.

198
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:32,940
Please

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,280
show mercy.

200
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,750
Your Majesty.

201
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,700
Is this how

202
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,980
you seduced Zhang Zhe?

203
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,890
His Majesty is still sick.

204
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,270
Zhang Zhe is still in prison.

205
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,850
And Yan Lin

206
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,650
stayed in Ning'an Palace every night.

207
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,620
Your Highness,

208
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,680
you still have the mood to come to me.

209
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,080
Don’t you have any self-respect?

210
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,420
You should know

211
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,920
what I'm like.

212
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,610
To keep my life,

213
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
now it seems,

214
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,650
only you, Sir, can help me.

215
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,200
Cinnabar imperial brush

216
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,410
determines life and death.

217
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,340
Your Highness.

218
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,100
Aren't you afraid?

219
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,700
Who I used to be

220
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,560
is just like what Xue Shu is now.

221
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,610
In order to protect her so-called pride,

222
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,520
she would do anything.

223
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,450
It won't end well.

224
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,110
Xie Wei hated me so much back then.

225
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,730
He would never like me.

226
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,150
He is a traitor and a rebel

227
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,190
He's heartless.

228
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,980
What he said today

229
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,970
was because he was afraid that I would get out of his control

230
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,520
and leak his secret.

231
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,030
Yes.

232
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,020
It must be like this.

233
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,080
Someone like him

234
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,370
would never like me.

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,940
I know you don't want to leave.

236
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,130
But I've made up my mind.

237
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,780
Please allow me.

238
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,290
Ning,

239
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,260
tell me the truth today.

240
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,550
Are you determined to leave

241
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,240
because of Xie Wei?

242
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,550
Yesterday at the wedding,

243
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,140
I was going to pick a nice husband for you,

244
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,280
but Xie Wei stopped me.

245
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,290
Father has been an official for many years.

246
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,060
If I can't even see this clearly,

247
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,990
how can I have a say in the court?

248
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,190
Tell me now.

249
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,210
Did he force you to do something?

250
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,930
If something like this happens,

251
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,170
you must tell me.

252
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,740
I can't let you suffer

253
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,350
even if I risk my life.

254
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,540
Father, what are you talking about?

255
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,250
I came to the capital

256
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,890
firstly because of Wan Niang's death

257
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,010
and I came back to my ancestors.

258
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,000
Secondly, I admire the wealth in the capital.

259
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,720
I have to see it with my own eyes.

260
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,080
But now,

261
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,020
I've been through all kinds of things in the capital.

262
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,980
My anticipation has long disappeared.

263
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,480
If I stay,

264
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,640
I will only feel trapped.

265
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,300
I'm not like the young ladies from noble families.

266
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,180
Others think I'm carefree,

267
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,930
but I don't feel free here.

268
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,960
I want to go out and take a look.

269
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,390
Fine.

270
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,330
In that case,

271
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,010
I'll allow you.

272
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,040
But this journey

273
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,270
will be a thousand miles.

274
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,660
After all, you are a girl.

275
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,930
I'm worried if you go alone.

276
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,570
How about this?

277
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,900
I'll arrange some capable men

278
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,140
to go with you.

279
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,190
I understand your efforts.

280
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,340
But my hometown is barren.

281
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,250
They are used to the wealth in the capital.

282
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,650
It'll be tough for them to go there.

283
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,760
Besides, I'm in an awkward situation.

284
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,010
The quieter my departure is, the better.

285
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,010
If you are really worried,

286
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,060
when I get there,

287
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,680
I'll buy some reliable handymen.

288
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,530
Okay?

289
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,410
-But...
-Father, don’t worry

290
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,340
Now the rebels of Lord Pingnan

291
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,620
has been expelled to Jinling

292
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,500
It's very safe along the way.

293
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,730
Just let me do what I want to.

294
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,390
He has never been in a coma this long

295
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,020
when his condition happened in the past.

296
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,200
What did the physician say this time?

297
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,410
What else can he say?

298
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,120
He has been relapsing over and over.

299
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,570
And doesn't control the amount of medication he takes.

300
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,200
The physician repeatedly instructed

301
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,700
for him not to get angry

302
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,920
or get cold.

303
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,780
Otherwise,

304
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,170
he might die.

305
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,160
Seems like I can't go to Huangzhou this time.

306
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,110
With him in this state,

307
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
I'm worried.

308
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,490
You always keep your word.

309
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,640
The matter of Huangzhou concerns the Yan family.

310
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,060
If we go against his will,

311
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,470
he will be even more angry.

312
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,450
Tao.

313
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,550
What are you carrying?

314
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,040
I went to the morning market today

315
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,300
and met a lady when I walked past the guard post.

316
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,940
She insisted on having me pass this to Sir.

317
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,450
She said it was a... farewell gift.

318
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,300
A farewell gift?

319
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,210
Jiang Xuening?

320
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,810
She's leaving?

321
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,870
That day at Lord Linzi's place,

322
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,360
Sir did meet Miss Jiang.

323
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,360
He fell sick after coming back from talking to her for a while.

324
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,910
It's still because of her this time.

325
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,790
Where are you going?

326
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,770
To the Jiang family.

327
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:47,880
To save his life.

328
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,940
Since Sir doesn't want it,

329
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:52,870
then forget it.

330
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,620
Thank you for coming all this way.

331
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,120
You misunderstood.

332
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,420
This is not his intention.

333
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,740
But mine.

334
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,550
I have something to tell you.

335
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,080
You don't know yet.

336
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,740
After the wedding banquet that day,

337
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,270
his dementia happened again.

338
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,720
His condition this time was bad

339
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,060
and almost killed him.

340
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,060
In order to pacify the rebellion last year,

341
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,610
he took a really strong medication

342
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,700
and caused him to become ill.

343
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,940
The physician said

344
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,150
if he gets so sad and angry,

345
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,410
his life will be in danger.

346
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,710
Y-You don't have to tell me these.

347
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,610
I will leave the capital soon.

348
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,080
His emotions

349
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,570
will have nothing to do with me.

350
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,770
Miss Jiang,

351
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,310
do you really not care about him at all?

352
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,910
All this way,

353
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,850
I can see

354
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,280
his love for you.

355
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,740
You really don't know?

356
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,940
Be careful of what you say, Mr. Lyu.

357
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,770
I panicked cause I was anxious.

358
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,510
I also

359
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,780
shouldn't be meddling in

360
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,810
what goes on between you two.

361
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,810
But

362
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,690
for a person like him

363
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,440
to be sick

364
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,690
makes me really worried.

365
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,820
I came here today

366
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,970
on my own decision.

367
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,200
It has nothing to do with him.

368
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,830
Don't get him wrong.

369
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,950
What are you trying to say?

370
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,870
I know

371
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,950
your worries.

372
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,140
Xie Ju'an is

373
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,540
smart and ruthless.

374
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,690
Not to mention you,

375
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,110
anyone would be scared of him.

376
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,460
But today,

377
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,500
I want to tell you a story.

378
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,140
Would you listen to me?

379
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,830
When I was a student,

380
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,380
I saw something in a county in the south.

381
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,570
The county government has been collecting taxes for years.

382
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,830
The commoners sealed money with white paper.

383
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,690
The rich families sealed it with red paper.

384
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,940
By distinguishing them like this,

385
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,900
there must be something wrong.

386
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,410
Very well.

387
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,300
See you.

388
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,570
Give us an explanation.

389
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,440
Yes.

390
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,580
How could this be?

391
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,780
That year,

392
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,640
a scholar passed by there.

393
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,630
He found out about what the county government did.

394
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,870
So he wrote a complaint for the people,

395
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,990
wanting to report this injustice to the province government

396
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,140
to seek justice.

397
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,020
Exactly.

398
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,550
Sir.

399
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,060
Arrest them all!

400
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,750
Take them away!

401
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,650
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

402
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,310
What are you doing?

403
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,120
Let go of me!

404
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,570
However, the scholar doesn't have much power after all.

405
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,680
This has been going on for a long time,

406
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,290
they won't let the commoners rebel.

407
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,800
The county magistrate let the officials

408
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,700
and arrested this scholar,

409
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,800
sentencing him to starting a rebellion.

410
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,530
To be executed according to the law.

411
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,120
So, he died like this?

412
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,030
He pleaded for the people

413
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,430
but was sentenced to execution.

414
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,150
Of course the commoners got angry.

415
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,990
It happened to be a year of disaster, and there were issues both internally and externally.

416
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,260
In rage,

417
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,730
the commoners staged a rebellion.

418
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,210
Not only did they break into the county office and rescue the scholar,

419
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,710
they also burned down the county government with fire.

420
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,220
Burning the government is a treason.

421
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,730
Exactly.

422
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,990
The higher-ups sent a magistrate

423
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,170
to investigate the crime of rebellion.

424
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,830
The villagers have never seen such a scene.

425
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,200
In less than three days,

426
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,040
someone reported the leader.

427
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,260
Was the leader that was reported

428
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,430
this scholar?

429
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,160
The commoners have to support their family.

430
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,180
Everyone will back down in front of life and death.

431
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,530
But this person wasn't arrested.

432
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,020
He turned himself in.

433
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,110
Why?

434
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,970
I was also confused back then too.

435
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,090
The magistrate also asked him that.

436
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,070
Why?

437
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,830
As for him,

438
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,760
he stood on the execution ground in plain clothes

439
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,810
and looked at everyone for a long time.

440
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,270
No one dared to look at him.

441
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,810
Later,

442
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,530
he calmly told everyone,

443
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,490
"The world is set,

444
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,230
and I will be tamed."

445
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,350
Is this person you're talking about

446
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,150
Xie Wei?

447
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,260
Do you think

448
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,090
he sounds like Xie Wei?

449
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,070
I don't know.

450
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,070
Mr. Xie is too complicated.

451
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,800
I don't understand him.

452
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,180
But these have nothing to do with me.

453
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,330
I was a scholar

454
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,500
and passed the imperial examination.

455
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,390
But I was still willing to serve under him.

456
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,280
Do you know why?

457
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,390
Because he may not always win.

458
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,010
But he won't lose no matter what.

459
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,740
That's true too.

460
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,780
But that's not all.

461
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,320
I'm afraid you won't believe me if I say it.

462
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,870
The reason why I work for him

463
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,750
is not because of how powerful he is.

464
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,430
It's more like

465
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,380
when you walk past someone drowing

466
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,790
and wanted to give them a helping hand.

467
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,170
Others might think

468
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,040
Xie Ju'an is ruthless

469
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,120
and doesn't need others to pity him.

470
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,810
But Miss Jiang has been with him for a long time.

471
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,300
Can’t you see

472
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,910
his struggle?

473
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,220
Heaven and Earth's furnace, the hell of the world.

474
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,960
He's just a pitiful person trapped within these.

475
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,220
Dao Qin, Jian Shu,

476
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,380
and everyone who works for him in the palace

477
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,920
were people who were saved by him

478
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,300
in the county that year.

479
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,000
He is much better than you think he is.

480
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,710
So,

481
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,690
what do you want me to do?

482
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,000
In a few days,

483
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,450
I will be heading to Huangzhou.

484
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,390
I won't be able to come back in a short time.

485
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,400
Xie Ju'an has made up his mind

486
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,060
to fight against the Xue family.

487
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,590
I ask sincerely, for you to take care of him.

488
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,540
Please help him when he's on the brink of death

489
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,590
when his condition relapses.

490
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,970
Only you

491
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,140
can help him.

492
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,040
Where is Lyu Xian?

493
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,140
He said he had something to do at Youhuang Pavilion

494
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:24,920
so he went back.

495
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,760
Did anything happen

496
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,050
during my coma?

497
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,910
No.

498
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:36,950
Everything is fine.

499
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,360
Sir, why don't you sleep a little longer?

500
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,750
Sir.

501
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,100
The palace sent someone and they said

502
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,180
His Majesty wants you to go to the palace.

503
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,350
Sir's still sick. How can he go?

504
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,690
Go get the Golden Stone Pills.

505
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,370
The doctor said the medicine can't be used anymore.

506
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,210
Why are you still...

507
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,850
His Majesty summoned me to the palace at this time,

508
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,890
he must have something important.

509
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,040
I have to go.

510
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,700
If you had the time to talk nonsense here,

511
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,510
you would have already brought the medicine here.

512
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,340
Yes.

513
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,570
The border sent a message

514
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,740
saying that the wedding procession

515
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,680
was supposed to go to State of Yue's imperial court directly,

516
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,460
but unexpectedly,

517
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,380
not long after leaving Shanyue Pass,

518
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,420
people from the State of Yue stopped them.

519
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,010
They suspected that among the procession

520
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,730
there are Qian spies

521
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,620
and used that reason to search Zhiyi's sedan publicly.

522
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,640
Zhiyi felt humiliated and beat the Prince of Yue.

523
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,400
Who knew, that barbarian got angry

524
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,130
and stabbed the

525
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,560
Ministry of Rites official.

526
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,940
Zhiyi was also abducted.

527
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,690
Hilling an envoy and abducting a princess.

528
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,200
Yue people

529
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,310
are provoking and humiliating the State of Qian with this.

530
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,410
I know it too.

531
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,830
But

532
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,680
this is not the time to start a war.

533
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,600
Your Majesty,

534
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,420
Yue people have been doing many things at the border.

535
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,390
I think

536
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,560
they might have other intentions from the beginning.

537
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,330
Go on.

538
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,900
Maybe the Yue people,

539
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,680
since Marquis Yan was exiled,

540
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,350
had intentions to conquer the south.

541
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,800
But the Yan family still have some prestige left.

542
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,440
So they can't be sure

543
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,720
if they can win.

544
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,500
That's why they keep testing State of Qian's bottom line.

545
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,450
Now that the envoy is killed and the princess is kidnapped,

546
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,050
if the State of Qian doesn't do anything,

547
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,990
Yue people will be sure that

548
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,290
other than Marquis Yan,

549
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,290
no one else in State of Qian can lead the army

550
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,920
and will invade the South

551
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,030
very soon.

552
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,950
How cunning and ambitious!

553
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,140
Do you have a solution?

554
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,670
Please allow me

555
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,430
to lead half of Yan's troops up Tongzhou

556
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,840
in the name of negotiation.

557
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,050
On one hand,

558
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,520
it would scare the State of Yue.

559
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,400
On the other,

560
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,830
we can find out how strong the State of Yue's army is.

561
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,130
If their army is only strong on the outside but actually weak on the inside,

562
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,780
then I can join the forces of the Yan's troops stationed at the border

563
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,060
and take them down at one go.

564
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,400
If their army is strong,

565
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,760
Your Majesty,

566
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,970
I can only ask Marquis Yan...

567
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,910
I know what you want.

568
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,950
This method

569
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,380
cannot be used unless necessary.

570
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,620
Official Xie,

571
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,020
go north for me

572
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,500
and find out the reality of the State of Yue.

573
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,720
As for the rest,

574
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,120
I will think about it.

575
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,530
Yes.

576
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,560
You're back from outside the city?

577
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,280
I've sent a letter to Huangzhou and the border.

578
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,980
You just need to save the people

579
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,260
and escort them to the border.

580
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,480
That's easy.

581
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,100
But you,

582
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,250
don’t push the Xue family too hard.

583
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,810
You're going far out to the border.

584
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,010
If they set you up in front of His Majesty,

585
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,260
you won't be able to stop them.

586
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,530
I know what to do.

587
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,080
What are you going to do

588
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,450
about Miss Jiang?

589
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,170
Are you really going to just watch her leave?

590
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,530
This has nothing to do with you.

591
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,930
Xie Ju'an.

592
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,540
Why don't you understand?

593
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,180
She has only seen you who is cunning and scheming.

594
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,610
It's normal for her to be afraid and run away.

595
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,080
If you really like her,

596
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,490
you should show her the real you.

597
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,790
Life is short.

598
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,180
It's not easy

599
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,380
to meet the right person.

600
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,380
I got it.

601
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,490
Take care of You Fangyin for me.

602
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,080
I'll be back after I'm done with my business.

603
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,550
I'll be on my way.

604
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,820
Take care.

605
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,160
Excuse me.

606
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,780
To the Jiang Mansion.

607
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,140
Yes.

608
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,450
I ask sincerely, for you to take care of him.

609
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,870
Please help him when he's on the brink of death

610
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,270
when his condition relapses.

611
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,760
Only you

612
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,280
can help him.

613
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,590
Who is he?

614
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,070
He is Xie Wei.

615
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,520
He was the one who led the army to rebel

616
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,630
and slaughtered everyone in the palace.

617
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,660
How could anything happen to him?

618
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,170
If I leave without saying goodbye,

619
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,080
he would be angry.

620
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,110
If he gets angry,

621
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,870
he'll get sick again.

622
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,130
Miss.

623
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,820
Miss.

624
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,340
Everything is more or less packed.

625
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,540
Take a look.

626
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,860
See if there's anything you need more off.

627
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,460
I've asked around.

628
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,300
Your hometown is warmer than the capital.

629
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,120
I won't pack so many winter clothes for you.

630
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,840
Which one do you like between these two?

631
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,080
Both are good.

632
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,350
It's up to you.

633
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:30,760
Miss,

634
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,520
is there something you're worried about?

635
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,930
If you don't want to leave,

636
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,810
you can stay.

637
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,300
Ning.

638
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,940
Father.

639
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,740
Everything is ready?

640
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,060
The carriage and horse are ready.

641
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,420
When the border pass documents are signed,

642
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,020
you can leave.

643
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,060
I thought

644
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,080
since you're leaving,

645
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,100
we should hold a farewell banquet at home.

646
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,490
We can gather together and talk as a family.

647
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,550
But who knew your mother would...

648
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,030
Forget it.

649
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,930
Forget it.

650
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,890
Sister just got married

651
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,860
and I'm leaving home.

652
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,000
It's normal for Mother to feel unhappy.

653
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,260
After I leave,

654
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,940
Father should comfort her more.

655
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,640
My girl Ning has grown up.

656
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,480
Master.

657
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,580
Mr. Xie is here looking for you.

658
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:28,960
What is he doing here?

659
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,430
Tell him I won't see him.

660
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,560
Father, wait.

661
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,100
I have something to ask him.

662
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,830
You're leaving.

663
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,680
There's nothing to say to him.

664
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,140
No matter what,

665
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,410
I have to make it clear to him in person.

666
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,960
Greetings, sir.

667
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,160
You...

668
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,230
are still leaving?

669
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,270
When?

670
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,340
Thank you for your concern.

671
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,080
I'm just waiting for the pass document.

672
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,590
The Jingzhao government is normally not fast.

673
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:29,940
I'll

674
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,590
ask them about it for you.

675
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,850
I was drunk and misspoke

676
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,880
when I was at Lord Linzi's mansion.

677
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,080
I shouldn't have done that.

678
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,510
Please forgive me.

679
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,140
Are you here

680
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,270
just to say this?

681
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,470
I'm here today

682
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,900
for something else.

683
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,780
It's about the princess.

684
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,490
Your Highness killed my Qian officials

685
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,500
yet you're still calm.

686
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,520
Aren't you

687
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,820
afraid of war?

688
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,420
Have you ever heard

689
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,790
of wolves being afraid of dogs

690
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,890
when you were in the capital?

691
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,900
You Qian people

692
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,640
are despicable

693
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,060
and cunning.

694
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,380
It makes me annoyed looking at you.

695
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,720
So what if I killed him?

696
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,170
What's the big deal?

697
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,530
If in your heart,

698
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,810
the State of Qian is so unsightly,

699
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,130
then why should we get married?

700
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,230
That's right.

701
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,960
Your Highness reminded me.

702
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,480
Now

703
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,870
we're married,

704
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,390
and you are my wife.

705
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,610
It's time to go to the bridal chamber.

706
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:52,880
How dare you!

707
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,090
Your Highness, please don't.

708
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,350
-It’s inappropriate.
-It’s none of your business.

709
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,740
Madam.

710
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,100
Didn't I tell you

711
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,630
women should behave like women?

712
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,420
Madam, you'll get hurt–

713
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,659
Princess...

714
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,130
Our marriage

715
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,090
is related to the national dignity.

716
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,199
If you dare to offend me again,

717
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,570
I will splash blood on the spot.

718
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,860
Killing the envoy is a provocation.

719
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,120
If I die,

720
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,989
the two states will definitely fight.

721
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:27,860
Your Highness,

722
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,420
have you really made up your mind

723
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,199
between war and peace?

724
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Once I set foot on the Central Plain,

725
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,679
and the whole State of Qian is under me,

726
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:36,980
by then,

727
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,940
let's see if you'd still be stubborn.

728
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,870
Your Highness, are you alright?

729
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:53,770
Your wound...

730
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,530
I'm fine.

731
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,760
You've suffered, Your Highness.

732
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,630
The Yue people kidnapped the Xingwu Guards

733
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,150
and abused them for fun.

734
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,040
They're not taking us to the State of Yue's imperial court

735
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,390
nor sending us back.

736
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,140
Say,

737
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,060
what they want to do?

738
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,650
How could they do this?

739
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,100
She is a princess.

740
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,550
She's the dignity of the State of Qian.

741
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,120
Now it seems

742
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,330
State of Yue

743
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,500
is not sincere about the marriage.

744
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,820
After the killing,

745
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,440
they didn't return to the imperial court immediately,

746
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,330
but wandered outside the Pass,

747
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,360
refusing to leave,

748
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,770
they must be up to something.

749
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,910
But if the two states go to war,

750
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,590
Her Highness...

751
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,750
Will definitely die.

752
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,310
You came to look for me.

753
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,720
Do you already have a way to save her?

754
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,370
His Majesty has allowed me to go north

755
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,720
to wait for the chance to fight against the State of Yue.

756
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,040
If I can

757
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,900
save the princess before the war starts,

758
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,370
I can save her life.

759
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,570
I'll go with you.

760
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,350
I promised the princess

761
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,810
to bring her back personally.

762
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,970
I made a promise.

763
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,820
I must go.

764
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,920
You're taking things lightly again.

765
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,190
We don’t know how many people State of Yue sent this time.

766
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,900
On this trip,

767
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,870
there will definitely be a war.

768
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,910
This trip is dangerous.

769
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,150
If anything happens,

770
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,830
you won't be able to save your own life.

771
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,990
Why do you have to...

772
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,980
Just because it is dangerous to go north,

773
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,090
I must go.

774
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,250
Princess is a lady after all.

775
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,640
How can you take good care of her?

776
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,800
Besides,

777
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,020
you're sick.

778
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,160
You may not be able to take care of that too.

779
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,170
With me there, I can take care of her.

780
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,200
Who told you that?

781
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,460
It doesn't matter.

782
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,070
Anyway, I already know.

783
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,230
Your illness

784
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,970
makes people around you worried about you.

785
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,650
I already know so many secrets about you.

786
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,820
It doesn't matter if I know one more.

787
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,610
You...

788
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,620
Don't get angry if you're ill.

789
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,530
Save the energy you use to scold me

790
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,910
and use that to get down to business.

791
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,850
I'll say that even if you stare at me.

792
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,600
If you let Lyu Xian go to Huangzhou,

793
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,610
that means you're ready to start a war.

794
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,020
Yan Lin and the others will go to the border too.

795
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,590
Shouldn't I meet them?

796
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,010
Forget it.

797
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,330
If I say one thing,

798
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,110
you will refute me with ten things.

799
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,070
I have no energy to waste with you today.

800
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,250
I can take you there.

801
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,600
But on one condition.

802
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:05,860
Go ahead.

803
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,050
You must listen to me along the way.

804
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,370
And this can't be leaked

805
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,400
to your father too.

806
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,980
Go back to your hometown as usual.

807
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,170
As for the rest,

808
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,560
I will come up with a solution.

809
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,200
What happened at Tongzhou is enough.

810
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,990
You still want them to worry more?

811
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,220
You're right.

812
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,350
When we reach the border,

813
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,620
you're not allowed to leave the city.

814
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,980
If you continue to act like last time–

815
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,840
I understand.

816
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,070
Don’t worry.

817
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,250
Why does Young Lady look completely different

818
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,540
after seeing Junior Preceptor Xie?

819
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,720
You're leaving?

820
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,460
No.

821
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,360
What do I do then?

822
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,560
There are traps everywhere in the capital.

823
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,430
The Xue family is even more dangerous.

824
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,270
Xie Wei.

825
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,140
No.

826
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,550
You must take me with you.

827
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,570
I am keeping this trip simple.

828
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,070
I can't let too many people know.

829
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,940
Besides, Ning'er is coming with me.

830
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,760
It's already troublesome.

831
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,290
How can I bring you along?

832
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,620
Jiang Xuening can go but not me?

833
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,420
After all,

834
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,070
we've known each other for 20 years.

835
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,420
We are close brothers.

836
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,700
You're bringing her but not me.

837
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,600
Are you choosing her over me?

838
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,440
What are you talking about?

839
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,750
I'm bringing Jiang Xuening

840
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,310
to pick up the princess.

841
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,910
I asked you to stay

842
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,930
to keep an eye on the Xue family.

843
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,390
I know.

844
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,770
But recently,

845
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,570
I do find it strange.

846
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,910
Isn't the Xue family too quiet?

847
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,780
Ever since Xue Shu became a concubine,

848
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,370
Xue Yuan has been quiet.

849
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,680
So abnormal.

850
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,520
Keep a close watch.

851
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,520
If anything happens,

852
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,430
tell Jian Zhu immediately.

853
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:10,860
Understood.

854
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,660
[Mansion of Duke Xue]

855
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,420
Wait.

856
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,780
Duke,

857
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,320
Mr. Dingfei has been frequenting Xie’s Mansion these days.

858
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,910
I sent someone to follow him.

859
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,350
I found that every time he went in,

860
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,920
he would come out after talking for at least two hours.

861
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,490
A few days ago, I asked the chef to make

862
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,500
some snacks he liked when he was young.

863
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,470
In front of people,

864
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,770
he ate so happily and quickly.

865
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,930
But according to the servant,

866
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,400
when no one was there,

867
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,430
he wouldn't even touch it.

868
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,690
In this case,

869
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,890
there's something wrong with this person.

870
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,240
It's just, who would be the one who planned this?

871
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,600
And why?

872
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,870
That's all for now.

873
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,420
Don't alert them.

874
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,070
I believe

875
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,910
he will show himself sooner or later.

876
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,890
Zhou Yinzhi

877
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,230
is still useful

878
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,200
to serve me again.

879
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,210
But this person is like a grass on the wall

880
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,520
who'd climb over any time.

881
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,040
So we should keep an eye on him.

882
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,210
Don't let him inform Xie Wei

883
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,450
or more things.

884
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,950
You're getting ready to make a move?

885
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,560
His Majesty issued a secret edict

886
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,840
for Xie Wei to lead his troops north.

887
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,710
To cover up his whereabouts,

888
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,330
he is taking a different path from the Yan Troop.

889
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,170
That means

890
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,550
no one is protecting him

891
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,100
other those few guards around him.

892
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,430
No matter what his plan is,

893
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,020
he and I

894
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,480
are definitely not people who would be on the same path.

895
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,560
So,

896
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,820
when you find a chance,

897
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,890
get rid of him.

898
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,960
Yes, Duke.

899
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,320
Wait.

900
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,530
Why haven't I

901
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,740
seen this dress before?

902
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,650
Nanny Yang delivered this

903
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,750
on your birthday.

904
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,520
First Young Lady and you both have a set.

905
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,770
This trip is dangerous.

906
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,990
If anything happens,

907
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,420
you'll lose your life too.

908
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,880
We thought

909
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,580
you would take us back too.

910
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,610
Without us,

911
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,440
who will take care of your life?

912
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,410
The countryside is poor.

913
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,130
You grew up in the mension.

914
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,370
You've never suffered like that.

915
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,640
Who knows who will be taking care of who when we get there.

916
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,400
What are you talking about?

917
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,290
We are not afraid of these.

918
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,190
That's right.

919
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,460
Alright, I know what you're thinking.

920
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,400
But someone has to take care of the mansion.

921
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:35,750
I don't know

922
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,320
what will happen when I leave.

923
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,960
Now that Sister is married,

924
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,220
Father, Mother still needs your help.

925
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,570
But Miss...

926
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,540
Ning.

927
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,410
It’s late.

928
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,490
Hurry up.

929
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,060
Stop dawdling.

930
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,840
You need to leave as soon as possible.

931
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,780
So that you can get to the post house before dark.

932
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,620
I've asked them

933
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,090
to put your things on the carriage.

934
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:58,790
Also,

935
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,600
remember what I said.

936
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,120
When you are free,

937
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,550
write a few letters back home.

938
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,410
If you encounter any difficulties outside,

939
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,920
go to my colleagues and old friends I told you about.

940
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,500
I've talked to them.

941
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,750
Don't be shy.

942
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,920
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

943
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,270
Your mother

944
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,840
is not feeling well today.

945
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,830
Let me send you to the carriage.

946
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:41,840
Wait.
