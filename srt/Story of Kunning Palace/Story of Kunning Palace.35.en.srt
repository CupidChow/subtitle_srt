00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,200
As long as I can take over Ning'an Palace,

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm willing to pay any price.

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,500
Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,630
The cinnabar imperial brush determines one's life and death.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,870
Everything

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,250
is like a dream.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,560
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,870
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,700
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,570
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,190
There are things

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,940
you can't give me.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,240
But he can.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,140
To keep my life,

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,910
only you, Sir, can help me.

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,300
Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,820
But I'm the only one who can't.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,420
I want to do my best to make up for

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,310
my past regrets and wrongdoings.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,410
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,009
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,130
Welcome, Your Highness.

24
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,979
Welcome, Your Highness.

25
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,270
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

26
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,000
Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

27
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,310
But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,820
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,570
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,720
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,660
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,810
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,390
A life of absurdity, a story of mistakes and regrets.

[Story of Kunning Palace]

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,490
[Episode 35]

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,579
Since you're injured,

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,790
I'll give you the bed.

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,310
I'll sleep on the table.

39
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:39,930
No need.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,060
If you don't want to sleep with me,

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,530
I can sleep on the floor.

42
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,370
What are you doing?

43
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,550
Who are they?

44
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,490
Someone sent by Lord Pingnan to keep a lookout.

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,020
On what?

46
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,440
Why do you think Lord Pingnan

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,470
locked us together?

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,510
Why?

49
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,570
Lord Pingnan

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,510
believes that love is born from lust.

51
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,250
What you and I did in front of him today

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,540
made him feel that

53
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,340
there is something between us.

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
But if we stay in the same room,

55
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,820
but do nothing,

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,780
do you think he will still believe us?

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,560
It will only make him think

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,540
I can't be bothered with love

59
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,560
and I'm just thinking about how to deal with him.

60
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,150
In this way,

61
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,250
he'll be more vigilant.

62
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,640
S-So?

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,870
Ning'er.

64
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,850
Let's put on a show.

65
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,910
What show?

66
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,810
Just like this.

67
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,510
You...

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,810
Trust me.

69
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,329
The more he believes that I'm obsessed with you,

70
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,399
the more he thinks he can control me,

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,360
and the safer we would be.

72
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,660
But it's already midnight.

73
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,980
Isn't it inappropriate?

74
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,700
Do you need my help?

75
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,070
No need.

76
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,650
I'll act, okay?

77
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,700
Can you turn away?

78
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,050
Your Highness,

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,110
there is indeed something going on in Mr. Dujun's room.

80
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,200
He has always been self-restrained.

81
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,360
He's finally let go of himself.

82
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,540
As his godfather, I'm relieved.

83
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,530
You may leave.

84
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,110
Yes.

85
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,420
Here.

86
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,570
I...

87
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,750
You can sleep wherever you want.

88
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,140
Stop talking to me.

89
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,640
Your Highness,

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,970
I received news from the border.

91
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,240
Yan Mu and Yan Lin are launching an attack.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,890
Attack!

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,510

94
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:00,770

[Huangzhou]

96
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:33,890
You may leave.

97
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,640
Yes.

98
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,710
His Majesty trusts Xie Wei so much.

99
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,220
Yet Xie Wei colluded with the criminal Yan family to forge the imperial edict,

100
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,260
deceiving His Majesty and led troops down south.

101
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,580
Your Majesty, Xie Wei should be executed.

102
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,840
Your Majesty.

103
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,770
Xie Xie has always been loyal to Your Majesty.

104
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,290
Through the annihilation of the rebels

105
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,640
he has contributed to the country greatly.

106
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,000
He's already a minister.

107
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,670
How could he

108
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,820
take such a big risk

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,880
to stage such a rebellion?

110
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,190
I think there's something behind it.

111
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,590
Something behind it?

112
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,140
Minister Gu,

113
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,300
Yan's troops are about to reach the capital.

114
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,100
What could there be behind it?

115
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,750
I think

116
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,610
this is his wild ambition.

117
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,990
He saved the princess long ago.

118
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,240
But he hasn't sent her back to the capital

119
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,090
because he clearly wants to hold the princess hostage.

120
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,770
What's the point of discussing

121
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,920
Xie Wei's motive?

122
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,100
I want a solution.

123
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,460
Your Majesty, I request to redeem myself

124
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,169
by going to the rebels and suppressing their internal rebellion.

125
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,960
Please allow it, Your Majesty.

126
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,240
Your Majesty, please don't.

127
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,220
Although the State of Yue has yet to make any movement,

128
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,150
their motive is still there.

129
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,020
Down south. the rebels are also eyeing us.

130
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,010
If we start a war rashly, the State of Qian will be in chaos.

131
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,460
With both the north and south attacking,

132
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,800
the State of Qian will be in great danger.

133
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,570
I think we should send an envoy to the front line

134
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,290
to ask Xie Wei and Yan family's father and son

135
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,910
why they launched the troops.

136
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,850
And for that, whether it's a request

137
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,450
or they were wronged,

138
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,730
Your Majesty will be the one to decide.

139
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,330
This rebellion might be able to

140
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,590
turn the tide.

141
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,050
All right.

142
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,820
Both of you are right.

143
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,200
But now,

144
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,640
we should take the safest way first.

145
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,740
Zhang Zhe.

146
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,410
I order you to lead a team of Imperial Guards to the front line

147
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,600
to negotiate with Xie Wei.

148
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,870
Ask him why he launched the troops.

149
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,340
If

150
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,700
he refuses to see you,

151
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,360
or does something else,

152
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,230
it will be considered a rebellion

153
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,430
and kill him immediately.

154
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,630
Yes, Your Majesty.

155
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,900
Rebellion?

156
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,210
Xie Wei has always been loyal to the court.

157
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,070
How dare he forge the imperial edict this time?

158
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,830
What's going on?

159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,740
Your Majesty.

160
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,060
At the coming-of-age ceremony of Yan Lin,

161
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,680
Xie Wei was the one who gave him the praise.

162
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,180
If they weren't relatives or long-time friends,

163
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,480
Yan Mu wouldn't have invited him.

164
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,650
I'm afraid they've already colluded.

165
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,050
This time, they just took the chance of sending out troops

166
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,060
to the State of Yue to save the prince

167
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,130
to attack.

168
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,350
But there is still a chance to reverse this.

169
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,220
Although Yan's troops have quite a good amount of soldiers,

170
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,790
attacking the capital is disloyalty.

171
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,880
Everyone would be execuded.

172
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,380
If I can receive an order

173
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,070
to gather the garrisons from various Zhous

174
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,340
to go up north for resistance efforts,

175
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,240
we can definitely defeat Yan family's conspiracy.

176
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,320
So,

177
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,460
I mean...

178
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,770
I understand what you mean.

179
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,320
But this morning,

180
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,920
His Majesty has rejected you in public.

181
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,880
If I speak now,

182
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,270
I will anger His Majesty.

183
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,410
Your Highness.

184
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,090
His Majesty must have done this

185
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,450
because he listened to Gu Chunfang's

186
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,760
snobbish words.

187
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,870
That's why he has his guard up

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,040
against me and Xue family.

189
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,190
Everyone in Xingwu Guards

190
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,160
is loyal to the court and

191
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,700
Your Majesty.

192
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,320
What's the use of me trusting you?

193
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,990
Since Qin was pregnant,

194
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,910
His Majesty's guard against me

195
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,490
has been building up day by day.

196
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,140
After Xue Shu entered the palace,

197
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,470
they stuck to each other every day

198
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,990
and worked together,

199
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,020
treating me as the outsider.

200
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,220
Even if I want to help you,

201
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,310
what can I do?

202
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,930
His Majesty is wary and difficult to deal with.

203
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,830
Do you still remember

204
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,830
our agreement?

205
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,010
If one day His Majesty passes on,

206
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,250
as long as Lord Linzi ascends the throne,

207
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,180
the Xue family will be undefeatable.

208
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

209
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,620
His Majesty is fine now.

210
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,110
How could something happen?

211
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,430
What if I can make sure that

212
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,430
something happens to His Majesty?

213
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,570
Actually, the Imperial Hospital has already concluded

214
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,470
that His Majesty is suffering from tuberculosis.

215
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,820
For a disease like this,

216
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,880
it's just a matter of time.

217
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,470
Don't you understand, Your Majesty?

218
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,180
As long as His Majesty doesn't trust me,

219
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:20,840
then

220
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,900
those things in the past

221
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,260
will be used by someone with ulterior motives one day.

222
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,970
By then,

223
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,220
both of us

224
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,540
will be condemned by thousands of people.

225
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,850
It won't be a pity if I die.

226
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,070
But can Your Majesty

227
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,490
endure

228
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,840
the hardships in the palace?

229
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,300
Shut up!

230
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,020
Xue Yuan.

231
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,370
His Majesty is my own son.

232
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,090
Those things in the past,

233
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,040
I did them to protect His Majesty.

234
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,600
What do the things you have done have to do with me?

235
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,430
Don't mention these things again

236
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,590
in the future.

237
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,520
Leave now.

238
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,440
Very well.

239
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,140
In just a short time,

240
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,230
Yizhou, Huangzhou and Qizhou

241
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,410
have been taken in by us.

242
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,540
If we take down two more Zhous,

243
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,440
and we can go straight for the capital.

244
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,150
These days,

245
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,620
I've sent a letter to the front line

246
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,590
to rush the war.

247
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,720
Within ten days,

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,790
we will be able to take down Yuzhou and Jinzhou.

249
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,660
Dujun.

250
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,380
I was right about you.

251
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,960
What reward do you want?

252
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,350
I'm in a good mood today.

253
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,860
Just tell me anything.

254
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,340
It's my pleasure to serve Godfather.

255
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,600
I dare not ask for any reward.

256
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,890
However,

257
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,510
at this time,

258
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,370
I have a request.

259
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,100
Go ahead.

260
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,510
We are about to succeed, we should celerbate.

261
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,060
The Dragon Boat Festival is in five days too.

262
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,860
In Jinling,

263
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,170
we celebrate this festival.

264
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,360
Please allow me

265
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,460
to prepare a banquet

266
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,120
to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival with everyone.

267
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,160
It can also be seen as a reward to everyone.

268
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,530
Okay.

269
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,260
I'm glad that you still think about

270
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,550
your hometown.

271
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,500
All right.

272
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,680
I agree to what you said.

273
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,620
By the way,

274
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,470
Xue Dingfei is also here.

275
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,940
He's good at eating and having fun.

276
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,560
Why don't we let him handle this?

277
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,100
Everyone will have more fun too.

278
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,210
Fine, he has nothing to do anyway.

279
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,610
Since you said so,

280
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,260
I have no reason to refuse.

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,870
Thank you, Godfather.

282
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,300
Pay attention to the defense here.

283
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,610
Xie Wei sent a letter.

284
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,590
Are there any plans?

285
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,380
From the first letter to now,

286
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,030
Xie Wei has sent six letters.

287
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,080
The first five letters, on the surface,

288
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,240
were on the arrangements and rushing of the city attacks.

289
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,200
This sixth letter seems normal,

290
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,940
but after thinking about it, there is actually a hidden hint.

291
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,750
The journey to the south is safe.

292
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,980
We've got Yuzhou.

293
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,950
It's only a matter of time we get Jinzhou.

294
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,380
Victory or defeat will depend on this.

295
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,030
We should reward the soldiers

296
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,190
to boost the morale of the army

297
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,980
and prevent any changes.

298
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,050
I will be waiting at my hometown

299
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,100
for good news.

300
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,700
When you are met with a decision you can't make,

301
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,540
you can refer to the strategies of several battles.

302
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,060
Think twice before you act.

303
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,990
Ju'an is hinting that he's about to act

304
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,990
and have us read his previous letters.

305
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,850
That's right.

306
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,350
I checked the first five letters repeatedly.

307
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,760
As expected, I found something.

308
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,690
That day, Jiang Xuening

309
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,660
bought the second half of Marquis Yan's letter

310
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,490
from the rebels.

311
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,950
She drew a turtle on the binding of the silver banknotes.

312
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,900
And Xie Ju'an used

313
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,290
the same method to convey the message.

314
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,460
Marquis Yan, please take a look.

315
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,350
There is an irregular ink

316
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,270
at the edge of each letter.

317
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,600
Fold the letter

318
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,670
and the corresponding letters nearest to them

319
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,630
from these six letters read...

320
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,210
"Execute Pingnan on

321
00:15:59,190 --> 00:15:59,810
Dragon

322
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,570
Boat

323
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,230
Festival."

324
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,490
He had a plan from the beginning.

325
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,380
In the eyes of Lord Pingnan,

326
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,460
Yan's troops are far away in Yuzhou.

327
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,240
He would never expect that

328
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,940
we would return to kill him.

329
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,760
Father will lead the army to stay in Yuzhou

330
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,220
to confuse the spy of Lord Pingnan.

331
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,200
I'm going to go select a troop of elite soldiers,

332
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,540
along with Jian Shu and Dao Qin,

333
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,290
to go catch him off guard.

334
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,320
Be careful.

335
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,740
The news to the front line has been sent.

336
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,170
Yan Lin should be able to attack on the Dragon Boat Festival.

337
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,210
At the Dragon Boat banquet,

338
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,000
I will take action with Xue Dingfei.

339
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,610
Once there's a fight,

340
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,790
the situation will be chaotic.

341
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,090
Find a place

342
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,960
to hide then.

343
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,340
If you don't hear Yan Lin,

344
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,780
Dao Qin, or Jian Shu's voice,

345
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,680
don't come out.

346
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,030
Do you hear me?

347
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,790
But there are many masters in the manor.

348
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,869
If we fail...

349
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,780
We won't fail.

350
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,200
I'm here.

351
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,000
If only I leave safely,

352
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,200
even if I go back,

353
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,240
Jian Shu won't let me go.

354
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,040
Are you worried about me?

355
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,500
Have you forgotten what you said?

356
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,820
Xie Ju'an might not win,

357
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,210
but he will never lose.

358
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,020
Take this.

359
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,640
If you give me your dagger,

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,650
what will you do?

361
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,760
I know how to deal with it.

362
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,280
Having a blade in your hand,

363
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,170
is better than being empty-handed.

364
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,610
If something happens,

365
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,110
it can be used for defense.

366
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Mr. Xie ordered me to send this to Your Majesty.

367
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,680
Ning'er.

368
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,890
What's wrong?

369
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,420
Did I

370
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,740
misunderstand him?

371
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,600
Nothing.

372
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:31,960
Don't worry.

373
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,800
I'll take you home safely.

374
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,520
Are you asleep?

375
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,510
Why?

376
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,630
That day...

377
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,480
I said you once killed me.

378
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,270
Why didn't you ask me about it?

379
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,710
Because I don't want to know.

380
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,030
It doesn't matter to me

381
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,780
if you have secrets.

382
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,490
Asking too much about certain things

383
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,180
might not be good.

384
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,420
You're so smart.

385
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,980
Do you want to talk about it, then?

386
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,110
No, I don't.

387
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,370
Then don't.

388
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,930
But I can't be clear-headed

389
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,390
like you.

390
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,330
Actually, I've been wanting to ask you a question.

391
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,330
What is it?

392
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,170
When I came to the capital,

393
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,360
you suspected that I knew your secret.

394
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,640
Have you ever

395
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,000
tried to kill me?

396
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,250
♫We made a promise♫

397
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:57,970
No.

398
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,360
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

399
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,730
But you said

400
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,380
you can't let others know your weakness.

401
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,200
♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

402
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,840
A man who kills as decisively as you do,

403
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,120
♫Without you♫

404
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,400
why didn't you want to kill me?

405
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,800
♫Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winter♫

406
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,060
Because you saved me.

407
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,480
I know you may not believe it.

408
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,450
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

409
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,760
But the world is an oven

410
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:18,930
♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

411
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,040
and everyone are but meat within it.

412
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,860
I have killed.

413
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
And I have also used and tricked many people.

414
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,890
♫Wind blows gently♫

415
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,060
But only you,

416
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,520
♫The fallen flowers bloom in my heart♫

417
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,670
were the only person

418
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,940
who didn't abandon me at a critical moment.

419
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,360
I've never forgotten.

420
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,850
♫Your whisper under the moonlight sounds beautiful♫

421
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,090
I don't want to owe you.

422
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,960
I said I'll pay you back.

423
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
♫Getting closer gently♫

424
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,940
I won't break my promise.

425
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,680
♫The season stays in dreamland♫

426
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,450
Xie Ju'an.

427
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,080
If you really die at the Dragon Boat banquet.

428
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,320
♫The snow is very light♫

429
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,620
I won't cry.

430
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,920
I know.

431
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,320
♫It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eaves♫

432
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,570
So you can't die.

433
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,090
A bad guy like you

434
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,690
♫You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snow♫

435
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,970
should live well.

436
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,640
♫They're about to be erased now♫

437
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,140
Okay.

438
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:19,210
♫Disrupting my expectations♫

439
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:20,660
Come on.

440
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,210
Drink more.

441
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,100
Come on. Drink.

442
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,320
Pour it for me.

443
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,820
Cheers.

444
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,800
Good wine.

445
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,230
Drink more.

446
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,440
I haven't drunk like this in a while.

447
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,520
Enough.

448
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,090
Let me fill it up for you.

449
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,890
Come on.

450
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,510
Good wine.

451
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,460
Great!

452
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,090
Nice.

453
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:36,970
Here.

454
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,750
Marquis Yan.

455
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,340
Marquis Yan.

456
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:38,950
Dujun.

457
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,550
Let me pour it for you.

458
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,160
Eat more.

459
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,730
Have some meat.

460
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,720
Cheers.

461
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,460
Drink!

462
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,490
Come on.

463
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,650
Come on.

464
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,010
Come on.

465
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,780
Bottoms up.

466
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,750
Come on.

467
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,270
Let's continue drinking.

468
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,520
Don't worry. It's enough.

469
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,230
Good wine.

470
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,230
Have some meat.

471
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,670
It feels good.

472
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,710
Let's eat. Let's eat.

473
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,450
Have some meat.

474
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,420
One more.

475
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:34,980
This is too much meat.

476
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,700
Everyone.

477
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,140
Everyone here

478
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,380
has been with me

479
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,320
through thick and thin for many years.

480
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,820
After planning for over 20 years,

481
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,160
our great cause is about to be achieved.

482
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,240
Every one of you

483
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,270
has contributed to this.

484
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,940
Let me propose a toast to all of you.

485
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,430
Everyone

486
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,640
has part of it in this world.

487
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,070
I'll keep my word.

488
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,810
-Good!
-Good!

489
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,470
-To Your Highness!
-To Your Highness!

490
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,860
Godfather, you're indeed a man of character.

491
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,380
It's our great honor to follow you

492
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,050
and commit a great cause.

493
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,820
I'll drink up this glass first.

494
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,340
Very well!

495
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,210
Bottoms up, everyone!

496
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,180
-Come on.
-Cheers.

497
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,020
-Drink up.
-Cheers.

498
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,820
Come on.

499
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,680
Cheers.

500
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,160
Here.

501
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,170
Keep eating.

502
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,650
Here.

503
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,420
Come on.

504
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,100
Come on.

505
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,630
Keep eating.

506
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,220
Eat meat.

507
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,120
Eat.

508
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,140
Let me pour it for you.

509
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,940
Everyone,

510
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,020
I've prepared a show

511
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,060
to cheer everyone up.

512
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,640
Guards!

513
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,970
Bring Jiang Xuening here.

514
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,790
Godfather,

515
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,810
aren't we celebrating with our brothers today?

516
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,830
Why did you bring her here?

517
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,560
I've found out that

518
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,290
the reason why it went wrong in Tongzhou

519
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,250
was because Jiang Xuening

520
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,950
informed Yan's troops,

521
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,180
causing our plan to fail

522
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,610
and us to lose three generals.

523
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,590
Today,

524
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,900
I will kill her as a memorial!

525
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,650
-Kill her!
-Kill her!

526
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,330
Kill her!

527
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,110
-Kill her!
-Kill her!

528
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,920
Godfather.

529
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,290
I know that you are upset

530
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,160
about General Feng's death.

531
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,820
But Jiang Xuening is a noble lady after all.

532
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,010
With what capabilities

533
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,310
could she have ruined Tongzhou's plans?

534
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,770
There must be some misunderstanding.

535
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,430
Godfather,

536
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,640
don't hurt the innocent.

537
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,620
The things that you want to do,

538
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,320
I've already made Xie Wei do them for you.

539
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,280
Now that Yan's troops are about to make it to the capital,

540
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,110
and that the world's about to be yours,

541
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,640
no matter how we look at it, I've contributed to this.

542
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,600
But now, you're giving me a hard time.

543
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,860
Are you burning bridges?

544
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,890
I didn't say I won't kill you.

545
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,140
I kept you

546
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,680
to make Dujun work for me.

547
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,610
Now that the situation is settled,

548
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,140
I must settle it with you.

549
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,810
Dujun.

550
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,390
It's for a fact that

551
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,320
Jiang Xuening was

552
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,780
involved in the Tongzhou matter.

553
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,390
We are not in a court for trial.

554
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,800
Why must I have all the evidence

555
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,330
before I can deal with her?

556
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,180
She's mine.

557
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,110
If you touch her,

558
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,650
how can I be loyal to you?

559
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,710
Dujun.

560
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,430
You're one to achieve great things.

561
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,740
Is it worth it

562
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,120
for a woman?

563
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,560
Fine.

564
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,880
She's your woman.

565
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,680
And you've made great contributions.

566
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,160
I'll

567
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,430
give you face.

568
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,170
Use the contributions you've made

569
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,480
to make up for her mistake.

570
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,390
She can stay alive,

571
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,520
but she must be punished.

572
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,650
How about this?

573
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,340
Ruin one of her hands personally

574
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,270
and cut ties with her.

575
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,380
From now on,

576
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,980
she will be on her own.

577
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,460
This Tongzhou matter

578
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,670
will be over.

579
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,540
You and I

580
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,680
can still be as close as father and son.

581
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,550
You want to protect her?

582
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,970
Don't forget,

583
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,030
according to the rules of Jinling,

584
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,730
if you don't do it,

585
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,030
this knife

586
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,160
will fall on you.

587
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,190
Think carefully.

588
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,540
Actually, I know

589
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,130
what you've done.

590
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,720
The fact that you came alone to save the person you love...

591
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,920
I've

592
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,260
already started to be suspicious about it.

593
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,960
Everything is going too smoothly.

594
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,480
It made me feel that

595
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,450
there has to be something behind this.

596
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,840
Do you know why I must punish her?

597
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,520
I'm warning you.

598
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,820
Don't try anything.

599
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,270
Your lives

600
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,130
are under my control.

601
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,330
Your life

602
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,470
and death

603
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,630
are all up to me.

604
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,570
Dujun.

605
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,400
I will just consider it as you were confused.

606
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,710
Ruin her hand

607
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,940
and make me believe that

608
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,760
you are still on my side.

609
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,440
We've been father and son for 20 years.

610
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,590
You and I can still take over the capital

611
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,530
and share the glory and wealth.

612
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,150
Dujun.

613
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,490
Prove it to me,

614
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,280
your loyalty.

615
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,660
Xie Ju'an.

616
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,590
It's just a hand.

617
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,650
Do it if you want.

618
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,810
You saved my life

619
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,080
on a snowy day in the capital.

620
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,670
I still owe you my life.

621
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,000
Do you still remember?

622
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,540
Enough!

623
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,350
Dujun.

624
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,880
Are you reluctant?

625
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,620
Between the world and women,

626
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,900
which one is more important?

627
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,230
I'll count to three.

628
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,410
If you don't do it,

629
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,500
I will...

630
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,270
No need to count!

631
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,660
I've made my choice.

632
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,780
Don't....

633
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,570
No!

634
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,490
Xie Wei!

635
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,270
No!

636
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,610
Xie Ju'an...

637
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,420
You can't do this.

638
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,560
I can't afford it.

639
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,130
Isn't that better?

640
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,870
From now on,

641
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,690
you pay me back what you owe me.

642
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,510
Xie Wei...

643
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,810
You ruined your hand

644
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,680
for a woman?

645
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,560
Is she more important

646
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,690
than the qin you've been obsessed with?

647
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,830
Not to mention the qin,

648
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,810
the world,

649
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,670
revenge,

650
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,210
nothing in this world

651
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,480
can compare to her.

652
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,630
Report!

653
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,190
Bad news, Your Highness.

654
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,610
There is an army coming our ways.

655
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,650
Please give us your order!

656
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,940
Go back them up! You must stop them!

657
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,820
Yes!

658
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,230
It's you.

659
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,050
Very well.

660
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,730
I value you so much.

661
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,600
I can even forgive your betrayal.

662
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,090
I didn't expect

663
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,000
you...

664
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,860
How dare you set me up!

665
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,540
You...

666
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,680
Xie Wei!

667
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,610
Xie...

668
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,960
Xie Wei...

669
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,660
I gave you a chance to be reincarnated.

670
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,380
But I forgot

671
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,460
you are the blood of the Xue family.

672
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,720
Just like your father,

673
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,830
you are ungrateful

674
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,150
and despicable.

675
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,820
I not only have the blood of the Xue family,

676
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,790
but also Yan family's blood.

677
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,860
The Yan family is loyal.

678
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,470
How could there be a state traitor?

679
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,860
Very well...

680
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,640
I didn't expect

681
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,800
I actually cultivated a tiger that bit me instead.

682
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,560
But you are still too naive.

683
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,340
Even if you

684
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,910
manage to escape from here today,

685
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,740
what awaits you in the capital

686
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,750
is an endless hell.

687
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,000
Ning'er.

688
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:49,560
Don't be afraid.

689
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,350
You did well.

690
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,580
Xie Wei...

691
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,790
Xie Wei!

692
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,290
-Sir.
-Sir.

693
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,880
What happened?

694
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,060
Why can't you stop the bleeding?

695
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,720
Mr. Xie's wound is too deep.

696
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,210
He needs some strong medicine and try his luck.

697
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,370
Please understand

698
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,340
and wait outside.

699
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,050
Let's go.

700
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,890
We will only cause trouble here.

701
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,780
Physician Zhou is a skilled physician.

702
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,970
He saved my father when my father was

703
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,900
taken off the battlefield multiple times.

704
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,850
Teacher will be fine.

705
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,900
Why don't you go back and rest first?

706
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,670
I'll keep an eye on him.

707
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,910
Don't you fall

708
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,610
before he wakes up.

709
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,190
I'll wait here.

710
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:47,960
I'm not going anywhere.

711
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,270
Yan Lin.

712
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,870
Actually, I know

713
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,670
his identity

714
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,890
and your relationship.

715
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,740
Xie Wei said

716
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,220
he sent you a letter

717
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,330
with a secret code?

718
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,000
Yes.

719
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,290
He has already planned the time.

720
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,280
After we conquered the fourth city,

721
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,470
he secretly ordered to ambush Guiyi.

722
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,660
If we succeed in this,

723
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,430
Lord Pingnan will die.

724
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,280
If we were to fail,

725
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,240
the State of Qian wouldn't be ruined in his hands too.

726
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,220
Besides,

727
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,120
he also gave Xue Dingfei a death order.

728
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,430
No matter what,

729
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,460
I must take you away

730
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,090
and ensure your safety.

731
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,560
Because you saved me.

732
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,740
I know you may not believe me.

733
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,650
But you are the only one

734
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,760
who didn't abandon me

735
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,970
at the critical moment.

736
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,180
I don't want to owe you anything.

737
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,080
I'll pay you back.

738
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,860
I won't break my promise.

739
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,540
He knew what would happen.

740
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,500
Xie Ju'an...

741
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,430
Everyone says that you always have a perfect plan.

742
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,760
But sometimes,

743
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,460
you are not smart at all.

744
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,960
You're so stupid.

745
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,520
Ning,

746
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,860
towards him, you...

747
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,350
His hand was ruined because of me.

748
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,210
I can't let him down.

749
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:18,640
It's not that you can't.

750
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,620
You just don't want to.

751
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:21,440
♫The story seems to be about me♫

752
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,850
Right?

753
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,460
♫I love this bitter happiness too♫

754
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,770
♫I shall embrace my last loneliness♫

755
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,820
He came alone.

756
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,510
He seemed to have a perfect plan

757
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,770
and had everything set up.

758
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:39,910
But in actuality, he was putting himself in danger

759
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,930
♫ And not focus on the ending ♫

760
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,760
and gave it his all.

761
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,990
All his madness and the risks he took

762
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:46,470
were for you.

763
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,290
♫How many times have I jumped over that cliff♫

764
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,540
His feelings for you...

765
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,550
♫A fate of conspiring with love is too twisted♫

766
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,640
I feel inferior to it.

767
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:04,080
♫Even if it's a whirlpool of darkness♫

768
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,990
♫I'm willing to fall for you♫

769
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,590
Your Lordship.

770
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:16,830
How is it?

771
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,130
The letter says that Lord Pingnan has been annihilated.

772
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,900
But Ju'an is seriously injured.

773
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,320
He's still being treated at the same spot.

774
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,660
His old injury hasn't recovered.

775
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,480
Wouldn't that make it worse?

776
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:31,960
Report!

777
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:35,480
General.

778
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,510
An urgent report from the capital.

779
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,850
Ministry of Justice's Zhang Zhe is heading to Yuzhou with an imperial edict.

780
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,120
it's said that he's going to reward the three troops.

781
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,260
Take your leave.

782
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,150
Yes.

783
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,730
Reward the three troops...

784
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,920
Our army is about to reach the capital.

785
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,450
His Majesty will reward the three troops.

786
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,890
Things have changed.

787
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,980
His Majesty has become mature.

788
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,290
What do you mean?

789
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,800
Zhang Zhe has an old relationship with Ju'an.

790
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,360
And he's straightforward.

791
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,600
He sent Zhang Zhe,

792
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,540
firstly, to talk him out of it.

793
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,980
Secondly, it's a warning.

794
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,830
For Yan's troops to stop.

795
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,330
At this point,

796
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,970
I don't know how much trust

797
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,500
His Majesty has left

798
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,340
in me

799
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,920
and Ju'an.

800
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,650
Although the external troubles are stable,

801
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,160
I'm afraid there will be much accusations

802
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,340
from the capital.

803
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,330
I will write a report on

804
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,380
annihilating Lord Pingnan right now

805
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,600
to be submitted to the court

806
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,280
to reassure His Majesty.

807
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,250
We can’t let Xue Yuan

808
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,040
make us the rebels

809
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,680
with this.

810
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,250
You're finally awake.

811
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,030
How long did I sleep for?

812
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,840
One day and one night.

813
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,280
Why didn't you go back and rest?

814
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,190
I have to stay here.

815
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,070
To thank you for your loyalty and courage towards the state.

816
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,750
If anything happens to you,

817
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,870
I can't afford it.

818
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,330
Don't move.

819
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,710
What a pair of hands for playing the qin.

820
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,040
Yet you don't cherish it.

821
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,250
It's not worth it for me.

822
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,090
Actually, I'm not good at playing qin since I was a child.

823
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,790
I'm just an ordinary person who wanted to tough it out.

824
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,750
My mother once told me

825
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,660
there's nothing in this world that one is not good at.

826
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,170
People who work hard will be good in everything.

827
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,670
So, I have persisted these 20 years

828
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,570
and have never given up.

829
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,250
Now,

830
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,960
I've achieved something.

831
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,440
But don't blame yourself.

832
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,580
I

833
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,220
will never allow myself

834
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,910
to lose.

835
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,530
Learning the qin is just one of them.

836
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,200
The more you do this,

837
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,200
the more upset I feel.

838
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,630
I'd rather you scold me

839
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,030
and hate me.

840
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,310
I just can't play it right for now.

841
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,130
Besides,

842
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,730
it's just an obsession that I couldn't let go.

843
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,300
It's good to let it go.

844
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,440
Xie Ju'an.

845
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,450
I'll play the qin for you from now on.

846
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,840
How's that?

847
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,470
You play the qin?

848
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,220
How could one listen to the qin you play?

849
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,750
And you don't know many qin pieces too.

850
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,760
Then teach me one song every day.

851
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,580
You will be satisfied one day.

852
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,040
Fine.

853
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,810
You can't go back on your word.

854
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,290
No going back.

855
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,120
[Mansion of Duke Xue]

856
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,990
Yan's troops destroyed Lord Pingnan and his trusted subordinates.

857
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:05,440
The remnants of Jinling lost their command.

858
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,790
There's nothing to be afraid of.

859
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,550
It won't take long to eliminate them.

860
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,650
Xie Wei and the others seem to be plotting a rebellion.

861
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,470
But in fact, they want to eliminate the rebels

862
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,160
and lower everyone's guard.

863
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,360
Now that His Majesty knows about this,

864
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,840
he only has praises for Xie Wei.

865
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,570
This move

866
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,540
is really sinister.

867
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,170
Duke.

868
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,470
We can't wait any longer.

869
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,640
If we don't act now,

870
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,610
when Xie Wei and Yan's troops return,

871
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,140
we will die.

872
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,830
Your Highness.

873
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,470
Duke Xue requests to see you.

874
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,740
Let him in.

875
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:49,900
Yes.

876
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,040
You may leave.

877
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,270
Yes.

878
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,890
Why did Father come to see me today?

879
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,340
I thought

880
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,230
you no longer see me as your daughter.

881
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,630
No matter if I do or not,

882
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:09,660
we

883
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,870
are still father and daughter.

884
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,130
So we are father and daughter today?

885
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,200
Do you think you can rest assured

886
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,520
just because you're His Majesty's consort now?

887
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,820
Don't forget that I taught you

888
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,710
that you should think about the dangers even when in safety.

889
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,150
What do you mean, Father?

890
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,620
I don't want to guess your thoughts anymore.

891
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,400
Just cut to the chase.

892
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,170
As long as your surname is Xue,

893
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,350
you'll always be a member of the Xue family.

894
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,080
Don’t forget

895
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,960
how Yan family was destroyed.

896
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,700
But now,

897
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,590
Yan Family not only destroyed the State of Yue

898
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,050
but also annihilated Lord Pingnan.

899
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,670
We contributed to the country.

900
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,460
If they return to the capital,

901
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,600
they will definitely take revenge on us Xue family.

902
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,900
By then,

903
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,710
do you think

904
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,950
you can get away with it?

905
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,070
Also,

906
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,390
Noble Consort Qin is about to give birth.

907
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,020
If she gives birth to a prince,

908
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,590
will you still

909
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,320
have a place in this palace?

910
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,710
Shu, you've always been smart.

911
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,970
You should know that

912
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,850
instead of just thinking of solving the problems on the surface,

913
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,020
you should

914
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,310
solve it from the root.
