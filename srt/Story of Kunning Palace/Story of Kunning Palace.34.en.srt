As long as I can take over Ning'an Palace,

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm willing to pay any price.

Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

The cinnabar imperial brush determines one's life and death.

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,790
Everything

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,060
is like a dream.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,560
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,870
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,680
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,350
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

12
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,260
There are things

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,930
you can't give me.

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,420
But he can.

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,170
To keep my life,

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,960
only you, Sir, can help me.

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,300
Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,010
But I'm the only one who can't.

19
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,450
I want to do my best to make up for

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,310
my past regrets and wrongdoings.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,280
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,020
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,120
Welcome, Your Highness.

24
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,900
Welcome, Your Highness.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,360
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,210
Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,240
But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,840
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,600
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,720
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,750
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,889
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,430
A life of absurdity, a story of mistakes and regrets.

[Episode 34]

36
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,930
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,600
Duke Xue requested to meet with you.

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,440
He said he has something important to report.

39
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,230
What important matter could he have?

40
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,560
Reject him.

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,940
But the Duke said

42
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,480
it's an important matter about the border and of vital importance to the country.

43
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,390
Consort Xian, you may leave first.

44
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,720
Yes.

45
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,760
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,579
I'm here

47
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,720
to report something important.

48
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,170
Go ahead.

49
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,020
Your Majesty.

50
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,690
Somebody is usurping the authority of the State of Qian.

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,170
Please look into it.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,220
Ridiculous!

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,829
The world is at peace now.

54
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,110
Yet you're spreading alarmist rumors in front of me.

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,460
What ulterior motive do you have?

56
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,190
Your Majesty, please investigate it.

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,800
Xie Wei, the Crown Prince's Junior Preceptor,

58
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,940
forged an imperial edict without permission

59
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,280
to transfer the guilty Yan family's father and his son to the border

60
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,710
and let them take over Yan's troops again.

61
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,050
How could that be possible?

62
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,560
No.

63
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,360
Xie Wei won't do that.

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,760
Your Majesty, I know that you have great faith in Xie Wei.

65
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,800
But he is up to no good.

66
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,150
This is absolutely true.

67
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,490
Your Majesty, if you have any doubts,

68
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,350
you can immediately issue an edict to Huangzhou

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,610
to inquire about it, and you will know.

70
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:07,860
Your Majesty.

71
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,940
If the Yan family rebels

72
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,830
and commands the troops to head south,

73
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,070
the capital will be in danger.

74
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,030
Your Majesty, please make the first move

75
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,240
and immediately issue an edict

76
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,899
to convict Xie Wei and the Yan family

77
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,140
of treason.

78
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,770
This is a grave matter.

79
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,690
I...

80
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,870
I need to verify it in detail.

81
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,270
You may leave first.

82
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,480
-Your Majesty...
-I told you to leave.

83
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,210
How dare they do this to you?

84
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,900
Compared to those innocent people who died,

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,010
I'm lucky enough to have survived.

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,680
After spending some time here at the border, I realized

87
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,690
how important a state's power is.

88
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,690
If the State of Qian were peaceful inside and outside,

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,990
and everyone were united,

90
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,700
how would the Yue people dare to attack us?

91
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,840
When I was in the capital back then,

92
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,930
I lived a carefree life.

93
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,300
Now that I think about it,

94
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,930
I was really short-sighted

95
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,370
and ignorant of worldly affairs.

96
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,530
Your Highness,

97
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,400
you've done a very good job.

98
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,190
Not many in the world have the courage

99
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,580
to cement relations by marriage like you.

100
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,780
All right.

101
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,700
I'm back in one piece now.

102
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,320
Stop pulling a long face.

103
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,880
Let me ask you something.

104
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,860
Isn't Yan Lin in Huangzhou?

105
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,670
Why did he suddenly arrive at the border?

106
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,260
Is His Majesty finally willing to revive the Yan family?

107
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,250
It's a long story.

108
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,750
Before this, we'd suspected Lord Pingnan was colluding with the Yue people.

109
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,390
But when did it start?

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,540
We didn't get wind of it at all.

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,550
Xue Dingfei is currently in the capital,

112
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,260
but there's no news from him.

113
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,400
I'm afraid that

114
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,190
he's already under the control of Lord Pingnan.

115
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,690
Do you mean

116
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,350
Lord Pingnan came to the capital personally?

117
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,280
He's risking his life.

118
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,330
It looks like he's really enraged this time.

119
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,160
That means Xue Dingfei...

120
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,640
With Lord Pingnan's temper,

121
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,990
he won't kill Xue Dingfei so easily.

122
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,320
Get some men

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,800
to search the city.

124
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,100
Since the Prince of Yue failed his operation this time,

125
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,520
he'll definitely make a move.

126
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,560
Don't let your guard down.

127
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,790
Yes.

128
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,010
Forging an edict is regarded as treason.

129
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,990
What Mr. Xie did

130
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,490
will not only harm himself

131
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,370
but also drag you and the Yan family

132
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,320
into a predicament.

133
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,460
I understand that.

134
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,490
So does he.

135
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,760
But Your Highness, do you know?

136
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,940
On the way from the capital to the border,

137
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,090
the Xue family sent many assassins

138
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,310
to assassinate Mr. Xie.

139
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,600
Also,

140
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,750
Yan Lin and Marquis Yan

141
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,060
have endured a series of hardships.

142
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,530
If there had been another way,

143
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,190
no one would have wanted to go this far.

144
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,090
Besides, he did so

145
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,570
to guard against Xue Yuan

146
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,740
and to save you.

147
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,360
I'm grateful

148
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,570
for being rescued.

149
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:22,900
But Ning,

150
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,530
do you really believe

151
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,890
that he did so

152
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,660
just for these reasons?

153
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,090
What do you mean, Your Highness?

154
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,030
Mr. Xie has reached the highest rank among the officials.

155
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,690
Yet, owing to his promises to you,

156
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,330
he took a risk to save me.

157
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,659
He even disregarded his own life for that.

158
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,850
I don't believe

159
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,830
he has no other feelings for you.

160
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,590
What about you?

161
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,580
You came all the way with him.

162
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,860
How do you feel about him?

163
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,880
I came here for you,

164
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,190
not for him.

165
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,820
I know you are nice to me.

166
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,280
But

167
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,770
I hope you can know how you feel.

168
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,010
Ning, that's not all I'm worried about.

169
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,660
Mr. Xie pacified the State of Yue

170
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,980
and also helped the Yan family.

171
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,690
If His Majesty wants to punish him,

172
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,510
with his current prestige,

173
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,520
in order to protect himself,

174
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,570
I don't think

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,610
he's averse to rebellion.

176
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,760
By then,

177
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,540
what should you do?

178
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,930
Anything you need from me?

179
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,040
Let's talk inside.

180
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,090
Mr. Xie, you are indeed a man of your word.

181
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,000
You brought the princess back safely.

182
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,270
I appreciate that very much.

183
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,860
Since I did that to keep my promises,

184
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,520
you don't have to thank me.

185
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,580
Just take it as what I should do.

186
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,300
You aren't here

187
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,330
just to thank me, are you?

188
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,940
Now that we have rescued the princess,

189
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,620
the chaos of the State of Yue has subsided,

190
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,260
and the Yan family has regained their military power.

191
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,040
So, what is

192
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,690
your next plan?

193
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,360
Will you escort the princess back to the capital

194
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,980
with Yan Lin and Marquis Yan

195
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,650
and face the crime of forging the edict

196
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,610
or

197
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,190
stay in this border city

198
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,770
and protect yourselves with the troops,

199
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,500
no longer being controlled by the imperial court?

200
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,950
Which way do you think

201
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,250
I'll choose?

202
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,040
Actually,

203
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,080
no matter which path you choose,

204
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,800
it may have nothing to do with me.

205
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,410
Neither the capital,

206
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,690
the border city,

207
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,780
nor the other hotbeds of trouble

208
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,900
is where I want to stay.

209
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,380
I was going to leave anyway.

210
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,070
Jiang Xuening.

211
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,410
If that's what you're here for,

212
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,720
I can tell you my answer right away.

213
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,380
I disagree.

214
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,490
You can't leave.

215
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,460
Mr. Xie, your ambitions are as high

216
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,840
as the clouds in the sky.

217
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,710
While I'm shallow and short-sighted

218
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,110
like the mud on the ground.

219
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,960
A sparrow will not know the will of a swan.

220
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,450
A miner's lady is a stranger to the sea.

221
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,050
A mortal hopes for nothing else

222
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,600
but to live peacefully.

223
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,730
Mr. Xie,

224
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,230
please have some mercy on me.

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,300
♫Close your eyes before dark♫

226
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,960

♫I'll see you again♫

♫I finally realize that I can't go back♫

229
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,130
You miss the princess and care about Yan Lin.

230
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,630
You're worried about Zhang Zhe and concerned about You Fangyin.

♫To that day♫

232

♫Only when my weak points are hit can I see♫

234

It's my fault.

248
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,290
I shouldn't have asked about this at this hour.

I want you to know your true self.

328
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,860
You once told me

329
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,990
the cracked white bottle can't be restored to what it was.

330
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,290
But to me,

331
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,230
what you said

332
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,590
was just self-deceiving nonsense.

333
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,410
Do you think

334
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,190
you are qualified to be that white porcelain?

335
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,140
Look at this.

336
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,520
You and I...

337
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,190
are just boiling liquid iron

338
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,970
in the furnace.

339
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,970
I know your origins

340
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,750
and you know what happened to me.

341
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,830
God never gave us a chance

342
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,310
to be weak and useless.

343
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,240
We have to suffer a lot

344
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,840
to become decent.

345
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,250
The cracked white bottle

346
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,760
can't be restored to what it was.

347
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,630
But if you were born to be a piece of iron,

348
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,460
you should know

349
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,840
that you're not that fragile.

350
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,100
Even if your bones are broken,

351
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,790
you must go back to the furnace and endure the pain

352
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,360
to get a new look.

353
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,300
Who loves you and who cares about you?

354
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,650
Who even needs you?

355
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,000
Living in this world,

356
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,330
you don't have the same keen insight as me.

357
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,150
If you want to be joyous,

358
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,840
you can't gain without pain.

359
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,850
If you only want to enjoy the pleasure and avoid the pain,

360
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,880
what's the difference between you and the pests and vermin

361
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,880
in the sewers?

362
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,580
How many people in the world can achieve your level?

363
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,090
I'm not you.

364
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,280
That's why a coward like you

365
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,180
doesn't deserve to be together with Zhang Zhe.

366
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,210
Either he saw through you,

367
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,770
or he's stupid

368
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,100
like you!

369
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,110
Shut up!

370
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,490
What's wrong?

371
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,800
You feel hurt?

372
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,340
Run away then.

373
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,310
Run to the ends of the earth.

374
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,770
♫A dark night♫

375
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,820
But I'm telling you,

376
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,860
no matter where you run to,

377
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,230
♫A flash of fireworks♫

378
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,880
I'll find you.

379
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,880
Xie Ju'an.

380
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,280
♫Lend me half a lucid dream♫

381
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,160
When you force things, they'll eventually break.

382
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,880
It's just torturing each other.

383
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,910
The pain is also a result.

384
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,350
♫I knew there's no right or wrong♫

385
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,910
♫Love has no cause and effect♫

386
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,090
♫But I didn't know on the day of snowfall♫

387
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:01,950
Ning'er.

388
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,240
Tell me.

389
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,090
♫You were here♫

390
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,770
What are you afraid of?

391
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,790
Why are you afraid of me?

392
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,660
♫How much do I have to give♫

393
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,940
What if I say you've killed me before?

394
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,010
♫In exchange for the love I deserve♫

395
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:22,050
♫I thought letting go was the best choice for memory♫

396
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,530
♫Lend me a breeze♫

397
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,340
♫To pursue the unsolved dream♫

398
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,240
♫But it disappeared as the snow fell♫

399
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,160
Come on.

400
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,170
Kill me.

401
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,020
Kill me.

402
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,040
Let go.

403
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,390
Are you crazy?

404
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,520
Let go!

405
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,079
♫How much do I have to give♫

406
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,420

♫To pursue the unsolved dream♫

410
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,740
Now,

411
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,670
can you not be afraid of me anymore?

412
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:40,650
♫But it disappeared as the snow fell♫

413
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,170
Xie Ju'an.

414
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,210
You're really crazy.

415
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,040
Miss Jiang.

416
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,370
Go get the physician.

417
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,340
Sir!

418
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,050
Sir, are you okay?

419
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,730
What about you?

420
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,510
You came all the way with him.

421
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,960
How do you feel about him?

422
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,720
The pain is also a result.

423
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,910
Ning'er.

424
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,900
What are you afraid of?

425
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,680
Tell me.

426
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,390
Why are you afraid of me?

427
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,540
Miss.

428
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,050
The propitious star governing your marriage is in the ascendant.

429
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,290
Looks like you're in love with somebody.

430
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,560
May I read your fortune?

431
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,930
Sorry.

432
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,460
I don't believe in these.

433
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,490
You don't.

434
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,300
But Xie Ju'an does.

435
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,790
Perhaps the cure for his illness

436
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,050
is you.

437
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:32,820
Sir.

438
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,290
How is Mr. Xie?

439
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,430
No worries.

440
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,590
It's not a big problem.

441
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,860
As for the wound,

442
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,170
fortunately, it didn't hurt the vulnerable spot.

443
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,900
It's just that he bled a lot.

444
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,000
But it's fine.

445
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,830
It won't kill him.

446
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,370
Change fresh dressing and take medicine on time.

447
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
Also, rest well, and he'll recover.

448
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,130
Ju'an.

449
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,520
What happened exactly?

450
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,020
How did you

451
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,230
get into a knife fight?

452
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,580
What happened?

453
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,040
You were fine when I left.

454
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,740
What happened?

455
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,660
Who did it?

456
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,490
Did you catch him?

457
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:06,750
Jiang...

458
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:07,860
Jiang?

459
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,600
Why would she...

460
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,800
You forced her.

461
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,530
Right?

462
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,800
Xie Ju'an.

463
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,260
She, who is tough on the outside but soft inside,

464
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,500
could even stab you.

465
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,850
How terrible you are.

466
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,930
You must have gone overboard for her to do that.

467
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,320
-I...
-All right.

468
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,640
Sir.

469
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,260
Where is Ning?

470
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:26,970
Have you found her yet?

471
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,580
We found this on the street outside the mansion.

472
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,770
She was taken away by Lord Pingnan.

473
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,000
This is the note left by Lord Pingnan on purpose.

474
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,290
[You have received favors and been repaid with revenge.] 
[If you turn back, you can still survive.]
[I invited Second Miss Jiang to have a chat tonight.]

475
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,290
[I'll wait for you at Guiyi Heights for three days. Come alone or you'll die.]

476
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,010
[Guiyi Heights]

477
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,850
Miss Jiang.

478
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,870
You're awake.

479
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,350
You are drugged-out.

480
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,970
I suggest you

481
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,500
sit well and have a good rest.

482
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,700
Don't move around.

483
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,950
You are quite calm.

484
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,810
No wonder Dujun likes you.

485
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,840
Dujun?

486
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,880
You didn't know?

487
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,920
He even has such an identity.

488
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,700
Junior Preceptor of the State of Qian,

489
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,110
Viscount Dingfei,

490
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,220
and Dujun, the Hermit.

491
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,970
He has so many identities.

492
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,270
You can only see his bones

493
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,170
after removing his skin and flesh.

494
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,150
If my guess is right,

495
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,700
you are Lord Pingnan.

496
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,700
You are so smart.

497
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,400
Bring them here.

498
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,150
You...

499
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,910
His arm and leg tendons

500
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,130
were all cut.

501
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,150
He's just a kid.

502
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,080
How could you do such a cruel thing?

503
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,180
I heard some rumors in the capital

504
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,480
that during the battle in Tongzhou,

505
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,940
you were also there.

506
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,290
And you seemed to have contributed much at that time.

507
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,710
Xue Dingfei and this child were also in Tongzhou back then.

508
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,430
They must know something about it.

509
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,490
So I invited them here

510
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,830
to catch up with you.

511
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,800
Xiao Bao.

512
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,040
Xue Dingfei always talks nonsense.

513
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,170
You tell me.

514
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,190
As long as you tell the truth,

515
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,440
I will spare your life.

516
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,640
I know nothing.

517
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,190
Think carefully.

518
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,220
I know nothing.

519
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,390
Xiao Bao!

520
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,680
Xiao Bao.

521
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,870
This is the consequence of betraying me.

522
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,210
All right. Drag him out.

523
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,440
You tried so hard to catch me

524
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,530
but didn't hit or kill me.

525
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,410
Instead, you threatened me with human lives.

526
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,180
What are you trying to do?

527
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,010
Are you trying to threaten Xie Wei with me?

528
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,360
If he really comes for you,

529
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,200
it means that you must be

530
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,860
significant to him.

531
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,470
I want you to persuade him to help me.

532
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,220
Otherwise,

533
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,400
whether it's you,

534
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,070
Xue Dingfei,

535
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,660
or Xie Wei,

536
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,340
you'll meet the same end.

537
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,100
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

538
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,260
Although I want to survive,

539
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,550
with your intelligence means,

540
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,920
you must have found out

541
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,900
that I just stabbed him with a knife.

542
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,210
He can't wait to kill me at the moment.

543
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,370
Why would he risk his life to save me?

544
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,060
No.

545
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,350
That's true for others.

546
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,060
But you should know that

547
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,460
Xie Wei is not an ordinary person.

548
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,950
The calmer a person is,

549
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,760
the more he loses control

550
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,580
when he falls in love.

551
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,480
I want to see

552
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,750
to what extent

553
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,860
he can sacrifice for you.

554
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,070
By the way,

555
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,210
I want to remind Miss Jiang.

556
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,240
We're at Guiyi Heights.

557
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,980
It's on a cliff,

558
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,410
one hundred miles away from the border.

559
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,060
If you want to run away,

560
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,660
I'm afraid you'll die sooner.

561
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,920
We've searched every household in the city.

562
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,400
I also sent Yan's troops to search outside the city

563
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,380
but there was no sign of Ning.

564
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,940
I'm afraid she was indeed taken away by Lord Pingnan.

565
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,340
How long do you want to

566
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,700
keep me in the dark about Ning?

567
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,190
Marquis Yan.

568
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,470
You should have told me last night.

569
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,160
You just returned to the court after the accident.

570
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,180
I didn't allow them to disturb you.

571
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,360
I beg for your mercy, Your Highness.

572
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,420
Marquis Yan, you're exaggerating.

573
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,540
I'm not blaming anyone.

574
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,090
I'm just worried about

575
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,430
Ning being at

576
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,070
such a wolf's den on her own.

577
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,260
What should we do?

578
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,300
I won't let her be there alone.

579
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,560
I'll get her out.

580
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,050
I'll lead the troops with you.

581
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,500
-We will go too. 
-No.

582
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,440
Lord Pingnan asked me to go alone.

583
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,700
He must have sent someone

584
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,880
to keep an eye on the troops and the movements along the way.

585
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,390
Besides, he is not as gullible as the Prince of Yue.

586
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,980
If anything goes wrong,

587
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,790
Ning'er will be in danger.

588
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,290
But if you go alone,

589
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,560
you'll just be walking into his trap.

590
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,140
Maybe

591
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,950
there is another way to make it a win-win situation.

592
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,650
I know what kind of person Lord Pingnan is.

593
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,430
What should come

594
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,870
will come.

595
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,660
I have to meet him in person.

596
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,270
-Who are you? 
-Who are you?

597
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,820
Dujun's here

598
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,810
to meet with Godfather.

599
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,230
Lord Pingnan invited you to come over.

600
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,690
Greetings, Godfather.

601
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,690
It seems that you really care about the girl.

602
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,210
I dare not ignore your summon.

603
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,780
As for Jiang Xuening,

604
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,800
she saved my life once.

605
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,590
Be it emotionally or logically,

606
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,700
she should not be implicated by me.

607
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,320
But in the end,

608
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:43,810
she is just

609
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
an insignificant outsider.

610
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,450
She has no value at all.

611
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,660
You're doing well at the border right now.

612
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,920
And you're in a good position.

613
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,220
But you're risking your life here

614
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,660
for an insignificant outsider.

615
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,280
Then you tried to denounce your personal relationship with her.

616
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,060
Don't you think trying to hide it makes it more conspicuous?

617
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,310
I know

618
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,260
who you are.

619
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,400
Since you dare to come alone,

620
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,230
you must have thought about how I will deal with you.

621
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,960
Let me ask you something.

622
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,250
Are you the mastermind

623
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,670
of Gongyi Cheng's death?

624
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,600
I think you already have the answer.

625
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,140
I want to hear it from you.

626
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,360
He was too ostentatious in the capital,

627
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,280
arousing the court's vigilance.

628
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,030
If I hadn't killed him,

629
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,130
everything we'd been working hard for all these years

630
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,440
would have been ruined.

631
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,850
I had no choice.

632
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,140
Then why didn't I

633
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,410
hear from you at all

634
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,180
before the battle at Tongzhou?

635
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,400
Now, you're standing in front of me.

636
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,240
Yet you dare to lie to me.

637
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,850
Godfather.

638
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,770
What I'm saying to you

639
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,910
is the honest truth.

640
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,730
There are many people in the capital.

641
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,180
It's not easy to send a message to Jinling.

642
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,320
Besides,

643
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,730
I went to Tongzhou

644
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,530
to sabotage the court's plan.

645
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,540
I almost exposed my identity on the way.

646
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,640
But unfortunately, I couldn't stop them.

647
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,430
However, I'm loyal

648
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,410
as before.

649
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,290
As before?

650
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,330
When I think of it,

651
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,770
you were so eloquent in persuading me

652
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,900
that I allowed you to go back to the capital to set up a trap,

653
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,820
but then you gradually escaped my control.

654
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,930
Xie Wei, don't forget

655
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,500
who forced you to be separated from your mom.

656
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,520
Who tried to kill you at the city gate?

657
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,310
Who spared your life in the fire?

658
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,510
All these years,

659
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,910
I've devoted myself to cultivating you.

660
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,120
But I didn't expect

661
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,820
that I'd have created a great disaster.

662
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,730
Now,

663
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,740
you even ruined

664
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,210
my setup for the State of Yue.

665
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,310
Everything I did in the capital

666
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,240
was for the sake of Jinling.

667
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm telling nothing but the truth.

668
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,410
Regarding the State of Yue,

669
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,900
I didn't know it was your setup.

670
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,440
When I found out,

671
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,570
I couldn't turn the tables anymore.

672
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,980
Really?

673
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,200
Fine.

674
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,340
Today, I'll make you

675
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,450
tell the truth.

676
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,100
Stop!

677
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,220
Are you hurt?

678
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,890
Are you really crazy?

679
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,200
You shouldn't have come.

680
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,870
I can't leave you here alone.

681
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,520
It's said that heroes always fall for the beauty.

682
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,210
But unexpectedly,

683
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,330
even someone like you

684
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,620
would sacrifice your life for a woman.

685
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,340
It's my fault

686
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,990
for what has happened.

687
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,680
If you want to punish somebody,

688
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,020
just punish me.

689
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,760
But let her go first.

690
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,420
That won't do.

691
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,610
It wasn't easy to invite her.

692
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,120
How can I just let her go?

693
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,170
Unless...

694
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,570
What do you want me to do?

695
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,400
You know what I want.

696
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,110
Now, Yan's troops are under your control.

697
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,820
People like Yan Mu

698
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,500
won't obey me.

699
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,820
But they obey you.

700
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,830
I want you to persuade Yan Mu to head south

701
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,409
and attack the capital.

702
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,040
This is treason.

703
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,820
You won't do it?

704
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,719
He was just stabbed.

705
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,719
He can't tolerate any more abuse.

706
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,679
Since he's here,

707
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,010
he has me in his heart.

708
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,420
As long as you promise not to hurt him,

709
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,739
I can help you persuade him.

710
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,670
Look.

711
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,370
Miss Jiang

712
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,940
is much more loyal than you.

713
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,290
Xie Wei.

714
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,949
As long as you help me, we're still father and son.

715
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,139
After I take over the throne,

716
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,260
the State of Qian

717
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,040
will still be up to us.

718
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,190
But if you are ungrateful

719
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,630
and forget my favors,

720
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,139
I wonder if Miss Jiang can survive today...

721
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,700
Don't touch her!

722
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,800
Get up.

723
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,350
Okay.

724
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,730
I promise you.

725
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,230
Okay.

726
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,260
You should have done this earlier.

727
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,120
Send Mr. Dujun

728
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,440
and Miss Jiang back to their rooms.

729
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,580
Prepare all the necessities well.

730
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,360
Don't be negligent.

731
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,870
Mr. Dujun.

732
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,820
You can walk around freely here.

733
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,000
No one dares to stop you.

734
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,320
Miss Jiang,

735
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,430
as for you,

736
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,280
just rest in your room obediently.

737
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,220
Don't mess around.

738
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:40,760
Yes.

739
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,200
I knew it.

740
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,000
You were just acting in front of Lord Pingnan.

741
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,040
With your temper,

742
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,170
you wouldn't kneel and beg for mercy.

743
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,720
It's clear that I can't fight him head-on.

744
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,070
Do I still have to ask for a beating?

745
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,850
Take off your clothes.

746
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,210
♫We made a promise♫

747
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,630
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

748
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,700
To apply the medicine.

749
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,390
Who knows how long we have to stay at this dangerous place?

750
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,090
♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

751
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,080
Injuries will inconvenience you.

752
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,360
♫Without you♫

753
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,740
♫Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winter♫

754
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,510
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

755
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,270
♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

756
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,320
♫Wind blows gently♫

757
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,740
♫The fallen flowers bloom in my heart♫

758
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,340
As long as you don't come,

759
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,020
♫Your whisper under the moonlight sounds beautiful♫

760
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,860
it's useless for them to keep me.

761
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,880
Then, I'll use some dirty tricks

762
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,350
♫Getting closer gently♫

763
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,370
to give the wicked old man some fake news in the capital.

764
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,280
It could have been a blessing in disguise.

765
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,660
♫The season stays in dreamland♫

766
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,370
Not only would I escape from your control,

767
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,950
but I'd also regain my freedom.

768
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,140
♫The snow is very light♫

769
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,370
But look at you.

770
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,860
You came here alone.

771
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:35,150
♫It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eaves♫

772
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,310
I don't need your rescue.

773
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,450
Your life is not important.

774
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,240
But what about Lyu Xian, Jian Shu, and the rest?

775
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,630
And Yan's troops.

776
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,520
♫You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snow♫

777
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,810
What do you want them to do after this?

778
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,510
♫They're about to be erased now♫

779
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,210
You care about me.

780
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,040
You still care about me.

781
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,750
♫Disrupting my expectations♫

782
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:47,940
Right?

783
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,260
This is not the time for you

784
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,300
to think about that.

785
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,700
♫We made a promise♫

786
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,550
Apply it yourself.

787
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,220
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

788
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,560
♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

789
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,880
♫Without you♫

790
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,930
What do you think about

791
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,460
♫Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winter♫

792
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,300
what Lord Pingnan just mentioned?

793
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,170
Are you really going to ask Yan's troops to head south?

794
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,790
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

795
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,350
♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

796
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,450
I don't believe you came without preparation.

797
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,220
You always have your own plan.

798
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,790
You've always been extremely calculative.

799
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:26,120
♫We made a promise, yet we are only left with our memory♫

800
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,760
This time, you came to Guiyi alone.

801
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,140
Apart from saving me,

802
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,770
what else do you plan to do?

803
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,340
♫Snow covers the street once more♫

804
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,780
The court must have received news

805
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,690
♫My heart freezes into a cocoon♫

806
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,330
about reviving Yan's troops and fighting with the State of Yue.

807
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,320
The current situation in the court

808
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,380
will only be worse than we think.

809
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:38,140
♫The seasons repeat ruthlessly♫

810
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,060
I must get rid of Lord Pingnan

811
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,930
♫Stealing my heart slowly♫

812
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,650
before the court makes a decision.

813
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,410
I'll trade his head in for the military merit of the Yan family.

814
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:46,650
♫I forgot I've never been sure when♫

815
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,540
Only in this way

816
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,720
can we calm His Majesty's anger

817
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,250
and pacify the impeachment from the court.

818
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,610
♫I'll break the cocoon and become a butterfly♫

819
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,680
As the saying goes, "To catch the bandits, first catch the ringleader."

820
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,760
When we were at the border,

821
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,580
we also assumed

822
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,030
that Xue Dingfei's already under Lord Pingnan's control.

823
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,910
I wonder if he has been brought here.

824
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,270
If he is here,

825
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,770
he might be able to help.

826
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:07,820
What's wrong?

827
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,950
Not only Xue Dingfei,

828
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,850
but Xiao Bao was also arrested.

829
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,820
But Xiao Bao...

830
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,300
was killed by Lord Pingnan.

831
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,950
He did it to protect me

832
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,970
but I failed to protect him.

833
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,420
I will take revenge

834
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,900
for him.

835
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,020
I will.

836
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,710
I knew it.

837
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,340
Although he is suspicious

838
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,150
and afraid of you,

839
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,000
he still values you the most.

840
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,450
No matter how big your mistake is,

841
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,740
he still has to put you in an important position.

842
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,640
Unlike me

843
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,990
nor Xiao Bao,

844
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,990
who can be abandoned at any time.

845
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,630
I will

846
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,820
take revenge for you.

847
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,980
But I need your help.

848
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,970
Help you?

849
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,120
Xiao Bao died.

850
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,460
He died in front of me.

851
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,340
I saw Lord Pingnan's knife

852
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,690
stab into his heart.

853
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,010
If I dare to mess around again,

854
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,980
won't I be the next to die?

855
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,280
Xie Wei.

856
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,280
I'm afraid.

857
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,500
We've known each other for 20 years.

858
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,470
You know,

859
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,450
I just want to live.

860
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,670
Because I've known you for so long,

861
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,520
I know you don't want to live like this.

862
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,980
You want to live a carefree life.

863
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,300
But as long as you're controlled by Lord Pingnan,

864
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,020
you'll not get what you want.

865
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,200
Even if you fear him and obey him,

866
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,180
he can kill you anytime.

867
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,380
Even if he succeeds,

868
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,310
you won't survive.

869
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,940
To be manipulated until death

870
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,630
or to fight for a chance of survival.

871
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,470
You can still make a choice.

872
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,120
[General's Mansion]

873
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,430
Is this really Ju'an's handbook?

874
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,270
He wants to head south from the border

875
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,250
and attack Yizhou, Huangzhou, Qizhou, Yuzhou, and Jinzhou.

876
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,540
Isn't this a rebellion?

877
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,500
Lord Pingnan wants to take control of the world.

878
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,530
This time, Xie Wei went there.

879
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,730
He will do whatever it takes

880
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,910
to force him.

881
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,560
The handwriting in the letter is real.

882
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,730
But what is written in the letter

883
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,820
doesn't seem like something Xie Wei would say.

884
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,130
I'm afraid this is not his intention.

885
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,710
If the five cities fail to defend themselves,

886
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,490
we'll lose our defence in the northwest of the capital.

887
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,880
If Jinling

888
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,910
takes the chance to attack,

889
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,600
the court will be left in isolation.

890
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,290
We can't compromise with them.

891
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,290
But Father,

892
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,910
Ning is still in their hands.

893
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,170
And we have no idea what happened to my brother.

894
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,610
Are we really going to

895
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,970
disregard their safety?

896
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,500
Marquis Yan.

897
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:05,820
I know the Yan family

898
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,220
has been loyal to the emperor and patriotic for generations.

899
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,450
It is very difficult to make a decision.

900
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,120
But Xie Wei is also a descendant of the Yan family.

901
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,880
He is a loyal person.

902
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,520
He suffered so much pain when he was young

903
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,240
but he never surrendered to anyone.

904
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,880
I believe

905
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,850
this time, he is just pretending to

906
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,350
collude with Lord Pingnan

907
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,360
while waiting for the perfect time.

908
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,930
Don't you trust him?

909
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,560
Father, I know

910
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,030
Xie Wei has a grudge against the royal family

911
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,700
and hates the Xue family.

912
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,950
But he would never

913
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,370
prioritize his personal anger

914
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,530
over the lives

915
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,360
of innocent civilians and soldiers.

916
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:42,250
How could I not know

917
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,480
about Ju'an's character?

918
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,320
But

919
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,650
the war

920
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,640
is not a trivial matter.

921
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,220
All these years,

922
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,060
Xie Wei has gone through so many life-and-death moments.

923
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,280
But he could solve the crises every time.

924
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,960
Just like when he came to the border this time,

925
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,620
he even dared to use the method of forging the imperial edict.

926
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,000
I have to admit that

927
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,720
although his method was risky,

928
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,460
it worked.

929
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,150
I believe

930
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,270
there will be a way out after this letter.

931
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,660
Are you really going alone?

932
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,040
It's too dangerous.

933
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,270
Lord Pingnan's purpose is still unknown.

934
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,750
But judging from the current situation,

935
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,170
we have to take a risk.

936
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,640
Uncle, don't worry.

937
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,030
I have a plan.

938
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,380
No matter what happens,

939
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,370
I'll resolve it.

940
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,390
Okay.

941
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,020
Do as Ju'an said.

942
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,900
If there is any further correspondence from him,

943
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,300
you must receive them in time.

944
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,340
Among these cities,

945
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,180
there are people we've made connections with in the court before.

946
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,320
If we can persuade them

947
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,340
to surrender without a fight,

948
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,090
it would be the best.

949
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,180
If we have to fight,

950
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:58,290
we will try to sneak into the city

951
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,920
and capture the commander-in-chief first.

952
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,960
Anyway,

953
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,830
try to minimize

954
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,320
the effect of the war.
