00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,270
As long as I can take over Ning'an Palace,

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,440
I'm willing to pay any price.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,470
Cleanse the court of traitors and sycophants.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,570
The cinnabar imperial brush determines one's life and death.

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,870
Everything

7
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,260
is like a dream.

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,580
I once was indebted to a lot of people.

9
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,970
Zhang Zhe, help me.

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,650
I'll be a good person after this.

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,550
I'll marry the one I spoiled.

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,130
There are things

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,860
you can't give me.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,390
But he can.

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,080
To keep my life,

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,910
only you, Sir, can help me.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,350
Everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,930
But I'm the only one who can't.

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,520
I want to do my best to make up for

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,280
my past regrets and wrongdoings.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,280
Mr. Zhang, do you believe in predestination from the previous life?

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,060
I'd rather believe in what's in front of me.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,140
Welcome, Your Highness.

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,940
Welcome, Your Highness.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,300
Congratulations on returning to the capital of our homeland.

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,130
Ning'er, what are you afraid of?

27
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,300
But in the unfathomable,

28
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,910
there's always an invisible hand

29
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,630
that puts everything back to its original place.

30
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,660
You've taken revenge and paid your debts.

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,590
At the end of the day, who are you?

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,740
A bustling place, or a battleground.

33
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,450
A life of absurdity, a story of mistakes and regrets.

[Story of Kunning Palace]

35
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,660
[Episode 28]

36
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,630
In terms of taking down the Xue family,

37
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,610
it's a good thing.

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,890
But it's not for Her Highness.

39
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,790
If she really marries into the State of Yue,

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,060
when we declare war against them,

41
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,280
she'll be the first to die.

42
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,230
Why are you so sure that there will be war?

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,030
Because…

44
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,740
Xue Shu cut off the limb to save the body.

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,440
Her Highness will get married.

46
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,810
It's decided.

47
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,380
Mr. Xie.

48
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,640
That year, on our way to the capital,

49
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,580
I fed you my blood and saved your life.

50
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,570
Please, take my life

51
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,100
and spare his

52
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,840
to repay that debt.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,170
Deal.

54
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,600
In the previous life, I asked him to repay his debt to me

55
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,060
by sparing Zhang Zhe's life.

56
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,470
This time,

57
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,030
I may use that debt

58
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,740
to get his help again.

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,070
You once told me

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,760
to fight against my fate.

61
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,329
Even if it's already a done deal,

62
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,240
for Her Highness,

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,200
I'll keep trying.

64
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,310
Even if it means risking your life?

65
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,750
Yes.

66
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,820
What are you doing?

67
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,880
You said

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,829
you've helped me so much

69
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,790
because I saved your life 4 years ago.

70
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,130
I know,

71
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,910
stopping Her Highness from getting married

72
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,730
will definitely cause you trouble.

73
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,990
That's not what I meant.

74
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,140
There's too much at stake.

75
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,650
I can't turn the tide myself.

76
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,380
So I'm asking you to return my favor.

77
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,410
If you help Her Highness stay,

78
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,560
we

79
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,990
will call it even

80
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,880
and wipe the slate clean.

81
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,260
Shut up.

82
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,800
Are you that desperate to get rid of me?

83
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,450
T-That's not what I mean.

84
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,450
Shen Zhiyi,

85
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,029
I'll help her stay for you.

86
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,780
But don't you ever

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,420
say anything like that again.

88
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,460
I'll take my leave.

89
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:51,440
Mother.

90
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,880
The State of Yue still wants to bring down the State of Qian.

91
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,280
Who knows if they'll break the alliance again?

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,909

Mother.

96
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,880
Please talk to Lang and let Zhiyi stay.

97
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,660
The imperial edict has been issued.

98
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,870
What do you want me to do?

99
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,870
Do you want me to disobey the imperial edict?

100
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:11,790
I…

101
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,030
Mother, for Jie's marriage

102
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,980
and for the Xue family's future,

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,300
you defied Lang.

104
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,810
But you can't

105
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,560
do the same for me?

106
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,420
Zhiyi.

107
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,830
You're the Princess of the State of Qian.

108
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,300
You should fulfill your duty as the princess.

109
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,140
Jie.

110
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,590
Don't beg her.

111
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,190
When Father was alive,

112
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,280
you only cared about Lang.

113
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,890
After Lang ascended the throne,

114
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,920
you focused on making the Xue family thrive

115
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,970
and only cared about Jie.

116
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,790
In your heart,

117
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,159
who am I to you?

118
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,560
You're my child too.

119
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,140
I only wish you the best.

120
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,520
If Xue Shu

121
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,880
hadn't sweet-talked Lang and clouded his judgment,

122
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,590
there would still

123
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,020
be something we could do

124
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,400
about your marriage.

125
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,130
Xue Shu is where she is now

126
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,670
all thanks to you, Mother.

127
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,350
Didn't you play a part

128
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,630
in making me end up like this?

129
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:16,940
Zhiyi.

130
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,700
Power and wealth

131
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,020
are actually

132
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,600
transient like clouds.

133
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,840
I hope one day,

134
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,680
Mother,

135
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,840
you can understand that.

136
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,409
Zhiyi.

137
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,970
Zhiyi.

138
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:45,659
Zhiyi.

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,260
Zhiyi.

140
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,850
You can't be married off just like this.

141
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,190
I'll go talk to Lang.

142
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,330
You've said and done

143
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,000
everything you could.

144
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,940
It's useless.

145
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,640
Lang never issues an imperial edict arbitrarily.

146
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,730
Once it's issued, it can't be changed.

147
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,250
Jie.

148
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,410
You've got enough on your plate.

149
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,810
Don't pique Lang and Mother

150
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,640
for me again.

151
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,410
But you…

152
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,300
Your consort selection day is coming soon.

153
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,240
You should think about

154
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,790
how not to let Miss Jiang down.

155
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,980
If we

156
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,700
hadn't been born into the royal family

157
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,850
and were just normal siblings,

158
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,030
it would be great.

159
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,170
Have you heard

160
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,630
that His Majesty has ordered

161
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,100
First Princess to marry into the State of Yue?

162
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm so angry.

163
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,300
Unbelievable.

164
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,390
How has the State of Qian been reduced to that?

165
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,470
There was a rumor circulating

166
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,210
that the bride would be Miss Xue.

167
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,070
Why is the bride First Princess in the end?

168
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,270
Miss Xue?

169
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,620
She's His Majesty's Consort Xian now.

170
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,580
Besides,

171
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,020
the Xue family is so influential.

172
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,810
Who knows if they've pulled strings.

173
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,370
Have you thought it through?

174
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,220
Are you really going to help Jiang Xuening?

175
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,790
I can't cancel the princess's engagement,

176
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,700
but there's something else I can do.

177
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,010
It's the princess who will get married.

178
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
What can you possibly do?

179
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,780
I've consulted the Ministry of Rites.

180
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,190
Her Highness will leave the capital on March 21st.

181
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,240
She'll bid farewell to her family in the Taiji Hall

182
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,480
before hitting the road.

183
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,100
The imperial guards will escort her to the north.

184
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,040
Then

185
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,090
the Prince of Yue will have the wedding with her

186
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,310
on the prairie.

187
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,590
If I take action in the court,

188
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,700
there will be too many eyes watching

189
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,690
and we may easily get caught.

190
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,450
So,

191
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,600
I'll ask Dao Qin to follow her carriage

192
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,470
with a dead prisoner.

193
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,620
On the road,

194
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,070
he'll replace the princess with the prisoner

195
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,620
and then set the carriage on fire.

196
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,490
The dead can't talk.

197
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,789
Everyone

198
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,030
will think the princess has died in the fire.

199
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,190
Great idea.

200
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,390
This way,

201
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,770
the court won't try to find the princess back.

202
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,500
However,

203
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,490
if the bride dies halfway,

204
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,820
the State of Yue will ask for an explanation.

205
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,010
Don't worry.

206
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,870
Dao Qin will set the fire disguised as a Yue person.

207
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,070
They won't be able to prove themselves innocent.

208
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,070
If they want to start a war,

209
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,720
they'll be criticized by the whole world.

210
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,820
Moreover,

211
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,580
if a war really breaks out,

212
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,340
the court will need a commander

213
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,580
and we can seize the chance

214
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,640
to get Marquis Yan back.

215
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,360
Is that a plan

216
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,840
to help Jiang Xuening

217
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,040
or to achieve your own goal?

218
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,630
Is there any difference?

219
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,720
If you're helping each other out,

220
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,240
there's no difference.

221
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,620
But to get Marquis Yan back,

222
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,400
you just need to kill Shen Zhiyi

223
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,330
and start a war between the two countries.

224
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,570
To save the princess for her, you'll be risking too much.

225
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,800
If anything goes wrong,

226
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,800
all your efforts these years

227
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,250
will be in vain.

228
00:09:51,410 --> 00:10:01,800
[Loyalty and Filial Piety]

229
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,950
When it dawns,

230
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,080
it'll be the consort selection day.

231
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,920
Looks like Hui has made up her mind.

232
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,500
As they say,

233
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,540
the young will eventually fly the nest.

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,740
It's just the way it is.

235
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,350
She's no exception.

236
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,640
It's all your fault.

237
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,260
You spoiled our girls.

238
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,340
I don't understand.

239
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,560
We always stayed neutral.

240
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,810
How come you have the guts

241
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,260
to stand against the Xue family this time?

242
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,060
You're right, My Lady.

243
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,170
I shouldn't have set a bad example for them.

244
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,710
But My Lady,

245
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,350
our girls have grown up.

246
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,630
They have their own paths to follow.

247
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,060
We can't stop them.

248
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,590
Think about the moon.

249
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,080
It waxes and wanes

250
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,430
at its own pace.

251
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,930
We can't change that.

252
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,010
Mother.

253
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,340
Miss.

254
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,400
Let's go.

255
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,400
You need to enter the court on time.

256
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,300
Empress Dowager.

257
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,870
The eldest daughter of the Jiang family

258
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,290
is elegant,

259
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,020
well-educated, and virtuous.

260
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,030
If His Highness chooses her,

261
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,580
she'll definitely make a great wife.

262
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,850
In that case,

263
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,290
you and His Majesty can get some peace and quiet too.

264
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,400
Go take a seat.

265
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,900
Yes.

266
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,650
Her Majesty is here.

267
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,590
-Greetings, Mother.
-Greetings, Empress Dowager.

268
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,310
What is she doing here?

269
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,650
Mother,

270
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,710
His Majesty wants her here.

271
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,290
What a great son

272
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,320
and a great niece I have.

273
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,710
Miss Xue is really Consort Xian now.

274
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,450
So the rumor is true.

275
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm dispensable in this selection.

276
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,530
I'm just here as a formality.

277
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,650
I threw the I Ching when I left home this morning.

278
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,480
Today is inauspicious.

279
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,040
I wonder who's the poor girl who'll be selected.

280
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,150
Lord Linzi is here.

281
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,930
Your Highness, you'll have your consort today.

282
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,690
Why do you look so upset?

283
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,610
Your Highness, after you make your decisions,

284
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,600
give the peony

285
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,370
to the girl you want as your consort

286
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,660
and the roses to those

287
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,940
you want as your concubines.

288
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,940
Jiang Xuehui has got into too much trouble.

289
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,850
You can't make her your consort.

290
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,560
You can only make her your concubine tomorrow.

291
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,600
That's the biggest concession I can make.

292
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,330
Mother.

293
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,700
If I can't have Jiang Xuehui as my consort,

294
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,320
I'd rather not marry anyone in my life!

295
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,930
You stupid thing!

296
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,900
Mother, calm down.

297
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,710
That's nonsense.

298
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,660
You should know that you're Lord Linzi.

299
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,720
You have no right to be willful.

300
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,940
Mother allows you to have the Jiang girl as your concubine.

301
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,460
She's already being lenient.

302
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,330
Mother.

303
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,100
What has Jiang Xuehui done wrong?

304
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,340
Why are you so hostile to her?

305
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,830
Her mistake

306
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,380
is to make you disobey me.

307
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,310
You used to be the most obedient among your siblings

308
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,000
but have got into so much trouble

309
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,870
because of that woman.

310
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,850
What do you expect me to feel about her?

311
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,250
Choose someone else as your consort,

312
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,620
or just stay on your knees.

313
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,830
Because of Consort Xian,

314
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,090
Mother has been very angry.

315
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,690
Jie.

316
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,360
After you get married,

317
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,980
you'll move out of the court.

318
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,490
Does it matter that much to you

319
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,000
whether she's your consort or concubine?

320
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,520
Get up.

321
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,650
Do you think

322
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,230
I wanted to marry Xue Shu?

323
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,590
When you refused to marry her,

324
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,350
you humiliated the Xue family.

325
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,040
Duke Xue was resentful about it.

326
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,460
The Xue family has been in charge of Xingwu Guards for many years.

327
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,690
Although they've been accused of being responsible for several old cases,

328
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,710
no solid evidence has been found.

329
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,970
Besides, the Xue family carries a lot of clout in the court.

330
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,780
They can't be easily uprooted.

331
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,860
I married Xue Shu

332
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,480
for you

333
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,340
and for the balance of power in the court.

334
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,830
Sorry for causing you trouble, Lang.

335
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,200
Jie.

336
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
You have to understand this.

337
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,980
Today, Mother allows you to give her a flower.

338
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,790
But if you insist on making Jiang Xuehui your consort,

339
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,670
what she'll be given

340
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,840
will be poisoned wine.

341
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,520
Sorry.

342
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,280
Everything is possible.

to take that step,

348

♫I traveled so far but still can't forget you♫

375
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,430
♫I spent half my life loving you but ended up being a joke♫

376
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,590
I knew I left home at an inauspicious time.

377
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,820
Something terrible has really happened.

378
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,550
♫My heart is broken♫

379
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,740
♫But I never regret loving you♫

380
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,130
First Young Lady is such a poor thing.

381
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,020
Marrying the prince sounds great,

382
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,340
but she'll only be his concubine.

383
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,310
His consort was given a peony,

384
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,770
but she was only given a rose.

385
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,110
She'll be inferior to another woman her whole life.

386
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,580
I feel so sorry for her.

387
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,440
Let's go.

388
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,990
[Ancestral Hall]

389
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,970
A long while ago,

390
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,030
in the Baiguo Temple,

391
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,680
I lit a lamp for Wan Niang.

392
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,660
After I marry Lord Linzi,

393
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,930
I won't be able to come out very often.

394
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,920
I didn't want her to feel lonely

395
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,140
so I begged Father and Mother

396
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,080
to allow me to bring her lamp back.

397
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,150
I made so many efforts

398
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,600
but ended up like this.

399
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,550
You must be gloating now.

400
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,380
I used to envy you

401
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,520
and hate you.

402
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,860
You used my identity,

403
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,340
stole my parents,

404
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,320
and enjoyed a wealthy life that was supposed to be mine.

405
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,640
But you're better than me in everything.

406
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,500
I'm tactless

407
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,600
and irritable.

408
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,130
The harder I try to impress others, the more likely I'll fail

409
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,380
and be looked down upon.

410
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,590
But recently, I've realized

411
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,200
that my mother loves you

412
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,520
but also constrains you.

413
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,360
There are so many fine ladies in the capital.

414
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,070
You see each other as rivals and don't dare to make any mistakes.

415
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,850
So I think,

416
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,700
if I could be showered in riches

417
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,560
and have doting parents

418
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,870
but had to live a boring life

419
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,870
and become a cold person,

420
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,980
I'm afraid I wouldn't find that

421
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,110
very appealing.

422
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,260
So growing up in the countryside

423
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,410
sounds more appealing to you?

424
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,230
Do you want to know

425
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,530
what kind of person Wan Niang was?

426
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,840
You're not like her at all.

427
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,780
As long as I can remember,

428
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,180
she'd been a woman with backbone.

429
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,040
We lived in the countryside at that time.

430
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,880
Because we were kicked out of the Jiang Mansion,

431
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,460
many people bullied us

432
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,650
and said nasty things about us.

433
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,450
I was scared.

434
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,890
But she would walk out of the house

435
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,650
and argue with them with a smile.

436
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,290
Can you believe it?

437
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,840
Even in a hellhole like that,

438
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,380
she still made herself

439
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,750
look beautiful every day,

440
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,750
even if she could only use the cheapest rouge.

441
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,040
She was literate,

442
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,690
so she taught me to read

443
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,960
and do accounts.

444
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,000
She also told me

445
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,670
I needed to have my pride.

446
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,040
At that time,

447
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,050
Wan Niang was the most unique,

448
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,750
beautiful,

449
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,280
and amazing woman

450
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,610
I'd ever seen.

451
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,850
But she sometimes looked at me in an absent-minded way

452
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,330
as if she was trying to see

453
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,480
someone else in me.

454
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,410
It's so beautiful.

455
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,420
It's fine that the Jiang family wouldn't let you go back to the capital.

456
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,820
I'll take you back one day

457
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,960
and buy you the best rouge and clothes.

458
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,850
No one will dare to bully us again.

459
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,600
If you want to go back to the capital,

460
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,070
go back yourself!

461
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,480
Later,

462
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,620
I learned about my true identity.

463
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,110
Thinking back to the time I spent with her,

464
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,050
I realized why she was so temperamental

465
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,430
and why she often looked at me that way.

466
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,480
She didn't want to go back to the capital

467
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,230
perhaps because of fear.

468
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,320
She was afraid that if she came back,

469
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,810
the truth would be revealed

470
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,970
and I'd abandon her.

471
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,130
She was also afraid of

472
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,670
ruining the bright future of her own daughter.

473
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,800
Before Wan Niang died, she held my hand

474
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,150
and asked me to give you this bracelet.

475
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,670
After she passed away,

476
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,630
I clutched this bracelet in my hand

477
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,270
and cried for two days and three nights.

478
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,170
When I met you in the capital,

479
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,550
I thought

480
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,120
I'd rather die

481
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,380
than give you this bracelet.

482
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,320
If I were you,

483
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,160
maybe I would've thought the same.

484
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,510
She owed me a lot.

485
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,960
But I owe her nothing.

486
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,210
I've fulfilled

487
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,110
her last wish.

488
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,250
I've returned to you

489
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,770
everything that belongs to you.

490
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,060
Since you've chosen your path,

491
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,330
just keep moving forward.

492
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,180
Being a concubine is not the end of the world.

493
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,100
It can't be worse

494
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,390
than the whole identity-swapping situation.

495
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,840
In this life, Jiang Xuehui's fate

496
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,390
has changed.

497
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,250
So the princess's fate can be changed as well.

498
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,280
I also have Xie Wei's help this time.

499
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,420
I can definitely change it.

500
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,370
What?

501
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,310
Xingwu Guards will replace the imperial guards to escort the princess?

502
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,930
His Majesty just decided that today.

503
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,360
The empress is not feeling well,

504
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,200
so His Majesty has let my sister

505
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,200
be in charge of all the marriage rites.

506
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,010
Xingwu Guards have been under the Ministry of Justice's

507
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,610
investigation these days.

508
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,330
But my sister said,

509
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,840
"Instead of letting them idle around

510
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,460
and be paid for doing nothing,

511
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,620
we should give them this job

512
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,650
so that the imperial guards can stay to defend the Imperial City."

513
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,700
I wonder what has got into her head.

514
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,360
Has Consort Xian

515
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,850
found out about your plan?

516
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,410
Whether she has or has not,

517
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,760
I have to give up that plan.

518
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,560
Then what are you going to do?

519
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,290
I have to go out on a limb

520
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,350
and do it in the court.

521
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,340
The court is heavily guarded.

522
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,960
There's no way to bring a corpse in.

523
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,180
Looks like

524
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,780
you have to replace the princess

525
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,410
with a secret sworn guard

526
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,750
who is a similar size.

527
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,880
That way, even if it comes out,

528
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,150
you won't be implicated.

529
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,090
I'll go tell Ning'er about it.

530
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:34,880
How…

531
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:35,440
How about me?

532
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,270
Stay here.

533
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:41,650
Fine.

534
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,470
I shouldn't

535
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,100
have asked.

[Mingfeng Palace]

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,630
I'm the bride today.

538
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,220
You should feel happy for me.

539
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,430
Why do you look so sad?

540
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,750
Every girl

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,050
Some are married near home.

543
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,880
Some are married in faraway places.

544
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,040
You care a lot for me.

545
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,520
But you can't look out for me my whole life.

546
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,690

the world outside myself.

548
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,280
I have to face

549
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,970
the storms outside myself.

I'll only be looked down upon.

553
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,980
So I'd rather smile

554

560
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,070
So I came to check on you.

561
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,840
Consort Xian,

562
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,890
you brought so many people to my palace.

563
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,130
Are you worrying that I'll run away?

564
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,190
You may not run away,

565
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,760
but someone may come to take you away.

566
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,670
That day, you went to meet Jiang Xuening in a hurry.

567
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,500
She's quite bold.

568
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,040
Let me

569
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,650
remind you.

570
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,460
If she does anything she shouldn't do today,

571
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,240
I won't

572
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,920
be easy on her.

573
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,250
That day, outside the Tai'an Hall,

574
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
you accused us of making you end up like this.

575
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,930
Actually, even if you had married Jie,

576
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,870
in the end,

577
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,800
there wouldn't be much of a difference.

578
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,320
You'd just hide your true colors for a little longer.

579
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,090
Xue Shu.

580
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,000
We're cousins.

581
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,650
I should feel close to you.

582
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,040
But recently, there's been something

583
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,410
I've really wanted to tell you.

584
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,100
Do you know

585
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,760
how shameless you are?

586
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,850
I didn't choose to be shameless.

587
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,400
I wish I'd had a better choice.

588
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,840
There's been something

589
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,460
I've been meaning to tell you too.

590
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,340
Since I was little,

591
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,280
I've thought

592
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,330
if being willful is being a princess all about,

593
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,940
I can be

594
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,340
a princess too.

595
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,340
You're so high on the pedestal

596
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,250
that you don't know how hard life is

597
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,280
or what it feels like

598
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,300
to be inferior

599
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,100
and condescended to.

600
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,380
Your Highness.

601
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,190
The State of Yue

602
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,800
is far away from here.

603
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,600
Take care of yourself.

604
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,410
Remove all the additional guards from the Mingfeng Palace

605
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,920
and send them to watch the two gates in the northwest and northeast.

606
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,670
Without my permission,

607
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,020
no one can leave his post.

608
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,570
Besides,

609
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,910
get someone to watch over the princess.

610
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,890
If Jiang Xuening comes,

611
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,240
report to me immediately.

612
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,250
She's close to the princess.

613
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,870
I don't believe

614
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,160
she won't do anything.

615
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,450
-Yes.
-Yes.

616
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,310
Your Highness.

617
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,590
All the other study partners have bid you farewell.

618
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,640
You've been waiting here for a long time.

619
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,280
Maybe something has happened and Miss Jiang can't come.

620
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,930
She will come.

621
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,280
She will definitely come.

622
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,330
Consort Xian has changed the guards

623
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,960
and must have taken other precautions.

624
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,680
You won't have much time

625
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,920
to be with Her Highness alone.

626
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:56,990
It's fine.

627
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,690
After I meet Her Highness,

628
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,000
I'll play it by ear.

629
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,280
I've found a substitute.

630
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,140
She'll hide in the Mingfeng Palace in advance.

631
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,850
Her Highness will leave the court at 5:45 PM.

632
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,760
You must get her replaced by 5:15 PM.

633
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:13,070
My men will help her leave through the Shunzhen Gate.

634
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,470
After she leaves,

635
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,850
she'll no longer be a princess.

636
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,120
Are you sure she'll agree?

637
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,130
She once told me

638
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,830
she wanted to live freely outside the court.

639
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
She'll surely agree.

640
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:34,920
Your Highness.

641
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,580
It's almost time.

642
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,010
His Majesty and Empress Dowager

643
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,460
have gone to the Taiji Hall.

644
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,090
It's time for you

645
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,110
to go to bid them farewell.

646
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,150
Your Highness.

647
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,210
Your Highness.

648
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,940
Time is running out. I'll make it short.

649
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,570
I've arranged everything.

650
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,210
I'll get you changed now

651
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,690
and someone will lead you out of the court.

652
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,670
A quarter later,

653
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,240
there will be a fire in the Mingfeng Palace.

654
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,470
Everything will burn to ashes.

655
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,820
They won't even find a body.

656
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,670
Princess Leyang will no longer exist.

657
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,440
After you leave the court,

658
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,420
you'll be free

659
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,940
and can live the life you want.

660
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,010
Your Highness?

661
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:39,930
Ning.

662
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,660
I can't leave.

663
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,570
Your Highness.

664
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,480
That day, in the Baiguo Temple, you told me

665
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,980
you wished you hadn't been born into the royal family

666
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,170
and wanted to escape the court

667
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,760
to live a free life.

668
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,070
You silly girl.

669
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,830
I drank too much and was joking.

670
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,220
You can't take it seriously.

671
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,830
You must be joking now.

672
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,080
Didn't you leave the court to meet me

673
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,850
because you didn't want to get married?

674
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,610
Why do you have to do something you don't want to?

675
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,040
I've arranged everything.

676
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,740
As long as you leave the court,

677
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,199
you'll be a free person.

678
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,440
I'm very happy

679
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,080
that you've done so much for me.

680
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,159
But Ning,

681
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,630
everyone in the world is entitled to escape.

682
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,580
But I'm the only one who can't.

683
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,500
Mr. Xie told us in class

684
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,460
that if the emperor provides for one,

685
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,340
one shall serve the emperor faithfully;

686
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,280
if the people toil to keep one fed,

687
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,670
one shall strive for their well-being.

688
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,260
I'm respected as a princess

689
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,210
and enjoy the privileges of the royal family,

690
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,590
but I can't take it for granted.

691
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,489
Taxes are levied

692
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,830
and labor is forced

693
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,389
so that I can live a luxurious life.

694
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,710
Growing up in the court,

695
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,320
I was spoiled

696
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,580
and didn't know much about the outside world.

697
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,429
That day,

698
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,730
you showed me around the capital.

699
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,040
Only then did I know how the people lived.

700
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,040
If I escape,

701
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,300
the engagement will be broken off

702
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,030
and war will be declared.

703
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,980
The enemies are powerful

704
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,580
yet we don't have capable commanders.

705
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,750
How can we win?

706
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,070
The royal family will be overthrown.

707
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,830
But what's worse is that the people will suffer.

708
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,910
No matter how corrupted the court is,

709
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:19,940
I'm still

710
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,550
the Princess of the State of Qian.

711
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,040
The State of Qian is not yours alone to defend.

712
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,950
Why should you make such a sacrifice?

713
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,570
Your Highness.

714
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
If you marry into the State of Yue,

715
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,830
you'll die.

716
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,010
I beg you.

717
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,920
Please don't be a hero.

718
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,280
Just be selfish for once.

719
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,590
I'm not trying to be a hero.

720
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,990
I'm just afraid.

721
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,150
I'm afraid if I run away,

722
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,000
I'll become a coward.

723
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,550
I'm afraid if I weasel out of my duty,

724
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,690
in the future,

725
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,330
when the world is in chaos,

726
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,780
I can't hold my head up

727
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,770
when I hear children cry.

728
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,030
Don't do this.

729
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:10,750
Don't do this.

730
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,070
Your Highness.

731
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,620
Leave the court with me.

732
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,750
I'll take you away.

733
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,230
I've made up my mind.

734
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,000
I have a long journey ahead.

735
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,030
There's no telling when I can come back.

736
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,060
Don't cry when you see me off,

737
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,520
will you?

738
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,600
You once said to Yan Lin

739
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,590
that in the future,

740
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,810
he'll definitely become an invincible general.

741
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:09,970
This time,

742
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,540
give me your blessing as well,

743
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,170
will you?

744
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,490
One day,

745
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,480
when Yan Lin brings down the State of Yue

746
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,340
with the troops of the State of Qian,

747
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,590
come to me with the soil of my homeland

748
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,490
and bring me back

749
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,210
to the capital

750
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,780
of my home country.

751
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,650
Ning.

752
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,660
Don't cry.

753
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,000
Now that you're here,

754
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,450
draw a flower around my scar again,

755
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,540
will you?

756
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,300
You told me

757
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,990
that as long as I'm strong enough,

758
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,880
nothing can daunt me

759
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,010
and no one can hurt me.

760
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,530
Ning.

761
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,920
I'm not afraid of anything now.

762
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,460
Don't worry about me.

763
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,470
Your Highness.

764
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,860
His Majesty and Empress Dowager have arrived at the Taiji Hall.

765
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,340
It's time

766
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
for you to go meet them.

767
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,720
Ning.

768
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,590
From now on,

769
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,320
I can't protect you anymore.

770
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,490
In the future,

771
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,830
don't be so reckless again.

772
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,620
When I'm not around,

773
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,650
you must take good care of yourself

774
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,810
and stay safe.

775
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,920
Do you hear me?

776
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,770
I'm leaving.

777
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,600
Your Highness.

778
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,670
I promise you.

779
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,210
I promise you,

780
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,210
when our troops take the State of Yue,

781
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,830
I'll come to you with the soil of our homeland

782
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,380
and bring you back to the capital

783
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,510
of our home country.

784
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,280
Consort Xian.

785
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,070
Miss Jiang has arrived at the Mingfeng Palace.

786
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,230
Here is my order.

787
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,800
Close the northern gate immediately.

788
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:50,940
You guys,

789
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,430
go to the Mingfeng Palace with me.

790
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,220
She actually didn't do anything.

791
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,960
You watched the princess leave

792
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,280
and couldn't do anything.

793
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,220
How do you feel now?

794
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,850
She was married off because of you.

795
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,520
You cajoled Zhang Zhe into speaking ill of me in the court

796
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,370
and made me unable to marry Shen Jie.

797
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,580
Then you pulled strings

798
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,190
and made me Consort Xian.

799
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,110
Aren't you the mastermind behind everything?

800
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,840
You chose this path yourself.

801
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,820
Trying to shift blame

802
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,290
can't change the fact that you have no shame at all.

803
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,730
I have no shame. So what?

804
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,420
Now, my status is higher

805
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,370
than yours.

806
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,780
Shen Zhiyi leaving the court is just the beginning.

807
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,330
Jiang Xuening.

808
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,270
I'll make you pay

809
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,750
for everything

810
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,760
you put me through.

811
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:58,900
Why are you laughing?

812
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,410
Do you think

813
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,430
Her Highness is leaving

814
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,280
because your words carry great weight?

815
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,890
Her Highness is getting married

816
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,060
of her own accord.

817
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,210
She's brave and dutiful.

818
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,270
But you

819
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,240
are selfish, ruthless, and snobbish.

820
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,210
Just looking at

821
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,190
someone like you

822
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,960
disgusts me.

823
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,220
Jiang Xuening, how dare you

824
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:28,960
look down on me?

825
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,120
Let me show you

826
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,800
what someone like me

827
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:34,830
is capable of.
