00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,110
If someone's spreading such rumors at this time,

190
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,500
they must have done it on purpose.

191
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,250
I think

192
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,640
that the Xue family are responsible for this.

193
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,430
Fine.

194
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,350
Even if the Xue family did it,

195
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,010
you should ask yourself.

196
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,850
If you hadn't been frivolous,

197
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,890
how could such a ridiculous thing happen?

198
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,520
Mother, do you mean

199
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,140
it's my fault

200
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,260
that others are scheming against me?

201
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,610
If you hadn't gone to the prison,

202
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,600
how would you've gotten involved in this?

203
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,940
If you hadn't offended the Xue family

204
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,830
at the Yan family's coming-of-age ceremony,

205
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,550
why would a duke's family

206
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,390
be so petty and scheme against

207
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,260
a girl like you?

208
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,070
After everything that has happened,

209
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,780
shouldn't you reflect on yourself?

210
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,550
Mother, I'm afraid you're so angry

211
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,600
not for my sake,

212
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,180
but because you're worried that the reputation of the Jiang family

213
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,160
and my sister's marriage will be implicated by me!

214
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,390
You...

215
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,430
You...

216
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,590
My Lady.

217
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,430
My Lady, please don't.

218
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,120
Mother, don't worry.

219
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,350
I caused the trouble alone.

220
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,160
I will solve it myself.

221
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,350
I won't implicate the Jiang family and elder sister.

222
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,460
You...

223
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,410
How could we have given birth

224
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,250
to such a treacherous daughter?

225
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,140
All right, My Lady.

226
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,540
I know you feel sorry for her.

227
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,240
But you know that Ning

228
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,600
is very stubborn.

229
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,180
Why did you say things to provoke her?

230
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,230
Besides,

231
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,450
I’m afraid

232
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,990
this trouble wasn't caused by Ning.

233
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,320
My Lord.

234
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,270
What are you talking about?

235
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,730
In this selection of Consort Linzi by the Ministry of Rites,

236
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,460
Hui is also one of the candidates.

237
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,320
Hui?

238
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,590
Miss, I just heard

239
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,560
that Madam is very angry with Second Young Lady.

240
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,250
Master has grounded Second Young Lady

241
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,730
to stop her from going out.

242
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,450
Did Father say how many days she'll be grounded for?

243
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,360
Don't worry about her.

244
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,460
It's time for the ladies to get appraised

245
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,650
for marriage.

246
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,670
The rumors about Second Young Lady

247
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,130
have spread all over the capital.

248
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,490
You'll definitely be implicated.

249
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,980
Instead of worrying about yourself and Lord Linzi,

250
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,370
why are you worried about her?

251
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,000
Nonsense!

252
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,940
The Jiang family is one whole.

253
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,430
If Ning is bullied,

254
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,840
how can I just look out for myself?

255
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,890
Miss, I was wrong.

256
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,590
Miss, where are you going?

257
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,800
I'm afraid this happened because of me.

258
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,950
The Xue family wants me to give up.

259
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,130
It's all my fault that I got Ning into trouble.

260
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,360
I need to explain to Mother.

261
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,730
Miss, please don't.

262
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,200
If you tell her,

263
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,290
Madam will know that you've been secretly...

264
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,510
secretly involved with Lord Linzi.

265
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,270
With Madam's temper,

266
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,170
she'll definitely ask Master to disqualify you.

267
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,870
First Young Lady.

268
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,860
Someone sent a letter to you.

269
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,950
[To Elder Miss Jiang]

270
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,810
Get out of the way!

271
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,560
Don't stop me.

272
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,820
Sir is exhausted and needs to rest.

273
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,200
What can be so important?

274
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,120
Don't disturb him.

275
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,870
What do you know?

276
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,140
If we delay this matter about her,

277
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,100
we'll all be in trouble.

278
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,680
No way.

279
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,680
Let go of me!

280
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,580
-Stop!
-Let go...

281
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,460
What happened?

282
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,710
I've been looking for a chance

283
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,380
to talk to Elder Miss Jiang alone.

284
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,310
What do you want to talk about?

285
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,920
A good show in the capital recently?

286
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,840
You're indeed a smart girl.

287
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,750
Don’t you know how important one's reputation is

288
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,680
to a maiden?

289
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,070
So what?

290
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,310
Jiang Xuening wasn't a part of this game.

291
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,760
She didn't have to suffer such a disaster.

292
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,260
Since someone didn't know her limits,

293
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,220
I might as well teach her a lesson

294
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,360
on how to retreat

295
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,670
when faced with difficulties.

296
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,230
Miss Xue.

297
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,450
You're already the Consort Linzi chosen by Empress Dowager.

298
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,660
Why are you still resorting to such despicable means?

299
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,600
Aren't you afraid people will find out what you did

300
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,690
and gossip?

301
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,860
Gossip?

302
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,140
Jiang Xuehui.

303
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,990
With the power of the Xue family,

304
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,710
who dares to judge me?

305
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,580
Since the consort title is already in your hands,

306
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,100
why did you still do this?

307
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,680
I can influence Empress Dowager's thoughts,

308
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,390
but I can't influence

309
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,640
Lord Linzi's thoughts.

310
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,930
I'm afraid you don't know

311
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,660
that Lord Linzi has already told the Empress Dowager

312
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,680
about his feelings for you.

313
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,790
Aunt thought that a concubine position

314
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,690
could dismiss you.

315
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,430
But I know

316
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,350
that with Lord Linzi's personality,

317
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,170
he'll definitely try to make you his wife no matter what it takes.

318
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,720
By then,

319
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,060
I, the Xue family,

320
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,660
and Aunt will be humiliated.

321
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,180
I will never let that happen.

322
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,550
So you called me here today

323
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,010
because you want me to give up on my candidacy?

324
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:19,980
That's right.

325
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,620
As long as you give up,

326
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,270
the Jiang family and Jiang Xuening's reputations

327
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,910
will be untarnished.

328
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,220
Miss Xue.

329
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,520
Deep down,

330
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,940
are you doing this for Lord Linzi

331
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,780
or that position?

332
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,700
Is that important?

333
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,630
Send someone to pass this to Zheng Bao in the palace

334
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,470
and ask him to give it to Lord Linzi.

335
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,970
Miss.

336
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,550
Will Lord Linzi be able to help

337
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,640
for this matter?

338
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,630
The Xue family chose to do it now

339
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,320
to ruin the reputation of the Jiang family.

340
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,690
Their intentions are obvious.

341
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,570
They don't want Jiang Xuehui to be in the running for the concubine position.

342
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,210
She always

343
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,520
prioritizes the Jiang family's reputation

344
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,750
over everything else.

345
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,810
Now that this happened,

346
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,010
she'll definitely give up for the peace of the Jiang family.

347
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,780
So this matter

348
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,580
can only be solved by Lord Linzi.

349
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,530
So, you're trying to help her?

350
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,480
No.

351
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,190
I'm doing this for my own peace of mind.

352
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,970
Whatever belongs to her

353
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,530
should be returned to her.

354
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,880
Besides,

355
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,850
someone bullied my family

356
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,250
with such despicable means.

357
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,580
Naturally,

358
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,770
I can't just tolerate it.

359
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,300
[Jie Zhi]

360
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,710
Zhe.

361
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
You're finally back.

362
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,630
Mother.

363
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,410
Today, many people who claimed to be from the Yao family

364
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,270
sent so many things here.

365
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,240
I didn't dare to touch them at all.

366
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,530
Don't worry, Mother.

367
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,540
Leave them here first.

368
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,050
I'll take care of them.

369
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,940
These things

370
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,200
seem to be engagement gifts.

371
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,740
Zhe.

372
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,250
If you want to get married,

373
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,880
don't worry about me.

374
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,130
All these years,

375
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,130
I've accumulated a lot of betrothal gifts for you.

376
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,520
I won't let my daughter-in-law

377
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,850
feel mistreated.

378
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,230
Mother.

379
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,290
Tell me the truth.

380
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,170
Do you dislike the marriage with the Yao family

381
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,740
because you have another girl in your heart?

382
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,550
Bring her here someday

383
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,190
and let me see her.

384
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,810
I believe

385
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,330
that the girl my son likes

386
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,450
must be the best girl in the world.

387
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,030
I’m afraid I’ll let you down.

388
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,160
The three-year period of mourning

389
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,810
shouldn't be observed only because of the law,

390
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,400
but also out of the filial piety

391
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,400
of a child.

392
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,330
I'm unworthy of your teaching.

393
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,740
But

394
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,480
I don't want to return to the court yet.

395
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,880
I'm here today

396
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,270
because someone wants to see you.

397
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,640
After that,

398
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,780
you may change your mind.

399
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,440
About how you've designed the plan

400
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,430
to get me to investigate Duke Xue,

401
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,390
it's already been reported to His Majesty.

402
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,200
You're very suspicious,

403
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,450
but I didn’t mention a word.

404
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,490
At this point,

405
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,830
what else do you want me to do?

406
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm grateful for

407
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,860
everything you did.

408
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,780
But I came here today

409
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,830
for Ning'er.

410
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,430
Miss Jiang's affairs

411
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,510
have nothing to do with me.

412
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,060
Someone from the Xue family

413
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,020
leaked about Ning'er's involvement

414
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,670
in the matter of Tongzhou.

415
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,900
Rumors are spreading in the capital.

416
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,930
The restaurants here

417
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,600
are where the rumors originated.

418
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,540
But right now,

419
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,710
I'm at the critical moment of investigating the Xue family’s suspected crimes.

420
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,990
It's inconvenient for me to come forward.

421
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,870
Mr. Zhang, you're in charge of the Ministry of Justice.

422
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,780
His Majesty has also exempted your period of mourning.

423
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,830
And this matter concerns the reputation of a noble lady in the court.

424
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,860
It's justifiable for you

425
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,410
to investigate it.

426
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,570
Mr. Zhang, although this has nothing to do with you,

427
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,110
in the trip to Tongzhou,

428
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,690
Ning'er shielded you from the arrow.

429
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,210
Throughout the trip,

430
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
there must be some truth to her sincerity.

431
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,620
Mr. Zhang.

432
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,360
Are you really going to stand by and do nothing?

433
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,650
What's wrong?

434
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,320
He kicked me.

435
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,670
Really?

436
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,570
Let me feel it.

437
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,640
Your Highness.

438
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,450
His Majesty and Noble Consort are resting.

439
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,800
Please don't intrude, Your Highness.

440
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,130
Your Highness...

441
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,480
Your Majesty.

442
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,160
I deserve to die

443
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,960
for my intrusion.

444
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,210
But please grant my wish.

445
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,380
You may leave.

446
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,570
Yes.

447
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,920
You're a prince after all.

448
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,950
It's inappropriate

449
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,910
to break into the Imperial Study at night.

450
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,860
All my life,

451
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,560
I've been fettered,

452
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,970
unable to protect my friends,

453
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,140
and unable to seek freedom.

454
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,250
Now, even my marriage is being manipulated.

455
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,430
I'd rather give up

456
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,250
my title as a prince.

457
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,700
Lord Linzi.

458
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,230
What are you doing?

459
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,090
You're His Majesty's favorite brother.

460
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,380
Whatever it is,

461
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,370
you can talk things through.

462
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,260
Lang.

463
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,680
I'm at my wit's end.

464
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,980
Mother and the Xue family

465
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,560
are forcing me to marry Xue Shu.

466
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,700
But in my heart,

467
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,890
I already have someone I love.

468
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,790
If I can't marry her,

469
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,860
I'd rather die.

470
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,240
Please grant my wish.

471
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,800
Ridiculous!

472
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,780
What nonsense are you talking about?

473
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,770
Lang.

474
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,130
I'm sincere.

475
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,340
I've told Mother countless times

476
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,290
that I have no feelings for Xue Shu.

477
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,800
But she still insisted

478
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,160
on choosing the daughter of the Xue family as the consort.

479
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,160
Now, only you can help me.

480
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,640
Please show mercy

481
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
and fulfill my wish.

482
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,510
You...

483
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,410
Your Majesty.

484
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,130
Your Highness, stop talking.

485
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,930
Guards!

486
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,690
Hurry up and ask His Highness to leave.

487
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,330
Let's talk again tomorrow.

488
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,660
Lang.

489
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,790
I beg you, Lang.

490
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,160
Lang!

491
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,920
Your Highness, please stop talking.

492
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,580
Lang.

493
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,590
If you don't agree,

494
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,020
I will kneel in front of the palace

495
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,370
until you agree!

496
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,660
-Lang!
-Your Majesty.

497
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,280
Lord Linzi is usually mild-mannered.

498
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,060
He has never acted like this.

499
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,590
He

500
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,050
is just yearning the one he loves.

501
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,920
Don't be mad at him.

502
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,540
What worries me

503
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,370
is not this,

504
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,460
but Mother's intention.

505
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,580
She worked so hard

506
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,860
to make Shen Jie marry the Xue family’s daughter.

507
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,360
Don’t you understand?

508
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,320
I’m afraid the Xue family

509
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,810
is so greedy now

510
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,360
that there won't be room for me, you, and our child.

511
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,310
My mother

512
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,220
has never cared about us.

513
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,250
She only cares about the power that never changes.

514
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,440
[Ministry of Justice]

515
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,690
Master.

516
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,640
All right, you may leave.

517
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,000
Father.

518
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,770
You're here.

519
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,350
Look at this.

520
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,550
Retire and return to your hometown?

521
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,240
Father, your career has been smooth in recent years.

522
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,790
It's time to show your ambition.

523
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,420
Why are you suddenly resigning and returning to your hometown?

524
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,820
The two sects fought.

525
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,350
The Yan family was defeated.

526
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,630
The Xue family is in power.

527
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,650
His Majesty is afraid of the Xue family.

528
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,740
Our Jiang family

529
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,080
hasn't formed cliques

530
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,140
nor has military power.

531
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,820
That's why the minister position

532
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,910
landed in my lap.

533
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,390
But also because of that,

534
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,410
the Xue family dared to hurt you

535
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,040
because of your sister.

536
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,730
Father.

537
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,100
You know everything?

538
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,270
I'm not blind or dense.

539
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,750
I know some things instinctively.

540
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,500
The Xue family has long regarded the Consort Linzi position

541
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,230
as being in the bag.

542
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,920
Although His Majesty and Empress Dowager suppressed the scene

543
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,960
that Lord Linzi made in the Imperial Study,

544
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,260
how many secrets can the court hide?

545
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,240
The struggles in the court are subject to sudden and perplexing changes.

546
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,940
Even the Yan family has fallen.

547
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,480
How can I protect you?

548
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,470
Why don't I just get out of here as soon as possible?

549
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,570
Father, you can't.

550
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,170
I was reckless in Tongzhou.

551
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,150
Even the matter of the Xue family attacking me is my fault.

552
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,380
How can my father be the one to resign and leave the capital?

553
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,520
Don't talk nonsense.

554
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,080
If you admit to this,

555
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,850
how will you get married in the future?

556
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,880
Then I won't get married.

557
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,060
That's even more nonsensical.

558
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,000
As a girl,

559
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,440
how can you not get married?

560
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,830
You and the Xue family have been battling wits in the court for many years.

561
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,380
Do you still not know

562
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,580
how the Xue family operates?

563
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,100
The grudge between the Jiang family and the Xue family has been formed.

564
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,130
Once the Xue family is in control,

565
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,840
even if we hide far away in the countryside,

566
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,530
they won’t let us off.

567
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,620
I know that,

568
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,780
of course.

569
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,240
But the Xue family

570
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,370
is protected by the Empress Dowager

571
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,790
and supported by many officials.

572
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,560
It's not easy

573
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,350
to compete with them.

574
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,920
Ning.

575
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,920
I only have Hui and you, my two daughters.

576
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,430
As long as you two can be safe,

577
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,770
I don't mind giving up

578
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,640
this minister position.

579
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,470
What are you doing?

580
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,370
In this world,

581
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,260
I once thought

582
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,670
I had the most difficulties.

583
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,940
But at this moment, I realized that

584
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,180
apart from myself,

585
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,600
I seemed to have seldom

586
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,410
tried to understand others' difficulties.

587
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,660
As someone in the imperial court, you're walking on thin ice.

588
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,140
I should have

589
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,030
understood your distress sooner.

590
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,680
It was my willfulness

591
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,010
that caused so much trouble to our family.

592
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,460
Get up now.

593
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,520
I should be responsible

594
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,250
for my own mistakes.

595
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,430
You shouldn't have to sacrifice for me.

596
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,370
All right.

597
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,060
Why are your eyes all red?

598
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,120
My heart is not as bitter as you said.

599
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,170
All right.

600
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,790
I'll consider

601
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,810
these things properly myself.

602
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,390
Go back and rest.

603
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,660
I'll take my leave.

604
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,790
Rest early, Father.

605
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,460
Okay.

606
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,120
[Discussing the embezzlement of the disaster relief funds in Jiangnan]

607
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,420
I don't feel well these days.

608
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,970
If there's nothing serious,

609
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,510
submit the reports first

610
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,320
and we'll discuss them after I read them.

611
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,150
Your Majesty.

612
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,980
I have something to report.

613
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,490
Minister Jiang.

614
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,080
What is it?

615
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,230
Your Majesty.

616
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,730
I want to report

617
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,190
that Duke Xue, Xue Yuan,

618
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,710
embezzled the disaster relief funds for provisions three years ago,

619
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,620
which caused the refugees in Jiangnan to starve

620
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,080
and resulted in a tragedy.

621
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,040
Jiang Boyou.

622
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,680
The case was closed three years ago.

623
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,780
It was instigated by an official from the Ministry of Revenue.

624
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,380
Now, you're bringing up the past

625
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,470
and even putting the blame on me.

626
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,000
What are you up to?

627
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,530
If you have a clear conscience,

628
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,570
why are you afraid of the retrial of the old case?

629
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,130
Nonsense!

630
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:53,940
Your Majesty.

631
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,010
I'm innocent.

632
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,460
Please help me, Your Majesty.

633
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,750
Minister Jiang.

634
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,160
Do you know who you're accusing today?

635
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,820
If it's a false accusation,

636
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,180
not just you

637
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,740
but the entire Jiang family

638
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,160
will be guilty of a severe crime.

639
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,610
Your Majesty.

640
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:09,660
I...

641
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,040
know that.

642
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,300
Okay.

643
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,780
In that case,

644
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,860
do you have any evidence?

645
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,990
Your Majesty.

646
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,960
I've found a witness who was involved in the case.

647
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,800
And he is currently detained in the Ministry of Justice.

648
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,060
Please allow the investigation, Your Majesty.

649
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,020
Your Majesty.

650
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,660
Right now, rumors are rampant in the capital

651
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,050
that the Jiang family

652
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,170
has corrupt moral standards and are uncultivated.

653
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,270
So,

654
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,020
I think

655
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,320
he's doing this

656
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,930
to quell the troubles of his Jiang family.

657
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,050
That's why he's bringing up the past and stirring up trouble.

658
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,550
He's even framing me.

659
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,770
If Your Majesty doesn't punish him,

660
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,690
bad practices will arise

661
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,860
and cause chaos in the court.

662
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,840
Your Majesty, please be impartial and punish Minister Jiang.

663
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,260
Your Majesty, Minister Jiang is wronging others by making false accusations.

664
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,410
He has an evil intention

665
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,650
and should be punished severely.

666
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,520
I second it.

667
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,560
Your Majesty.

668
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,350
I also have something to report.

669
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,280
Zhang Zhe?

670
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,420
We'll discuss your matter later.

671
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,460
Your Majesty, what I want to report

672
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,070
is related to Minister Jiang's report about Duke Xue.

673
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,820
Mr. Zhou.

674
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,580
Is this

675
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,220
real?

676
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,270
Zhang Zhe.

677
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,040
Is what you said in the report

678
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,960
true?

679
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,110
Your Majesty.

680
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,690
Everything I said

681
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,920
is true.

682
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,590
Everything is true...

683
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:52,930
Duke Xue!

684
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,480
How dare the Xue family do such a thing?

685
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,650
Your Majesty.

686
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
Junior Preceptor Xie and I once worked together to quell the rebellion in Tongzhou.

687
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,480
During that period,

688
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,060
Minister Jiang's daughter was mistakenly involved in this

689
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,740
and was forced to enter the enemy's camp with me.

690
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,460
This

691
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,510
was a righteous act.

692
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,280
But Duke's daughter

693
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,750
abused the authority of Xingwu Guards,

694
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,040
fabricated the facts of this matter and turned it into something foul,

695
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,280
and spread it widely throughout the restaurants in the capital.

696
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,440
Her intention

697
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,420
was to destroy the Jiang family.

698
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,420
I've been visiting the capital for days.

699
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,000
I have eye witnesses and physical evidence.

700
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,130
Tell me.

701
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,820
Who ordered you?

702
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,920
My Young Lady wrote these words.

703
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,050
She asked me to deliver them there.

704
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,660
It has nothing to do with me.

705
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,740
Who else is involved?

706
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,080
Tell me.

707
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,480
Young Lady even asked the Xingwu Guards

708
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,250
to intimidate their family.

709
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,860
I'm just following orders.

710
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,590
It really has nothing to do with me.

711
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,020
Your Majesty, please make the appropriate judgment.

712
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Your Majesty, please investigate this.

713
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,930
This matter involves a woman's reputation.

714
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,510
Everyone related to the Tongzhou case has agreed

715
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,850
not to tell anyone about it.

716
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,270
Miss Jiang is a righteous person.

717
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,480
She almost died in Tongzhou

718
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,120
for the country.

719
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,430
In order to protect her family's reputation,

720
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,780
she didn't want any reward.

721
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,050
With such loyalty,

722
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,560
she's just as capable as her male counterparts.

723
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,490
She shouldn't have to suffer from the rumors.

724
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,810
Duke Xue.

725
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,660
What else do you want to say?

726
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,430
Your Majesty.

727
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,310
I know nothing about this.

728
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,110
There must be something wrong.

729
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,120
Your Majesty...

730
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,850
It's clearly written in this report

731
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,370
that every move was made by Xingwu Guards.

732
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,830
Stop making excuses.

733
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,850
Duke.

734
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,720
The consort selection

735
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,230
is a family matter and a state affair.

736
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,000
It should be decided by His Majesty.

737
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,100
If the daughter of the Xue family is really virtuous and talented,

738
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,640
she will be chosen.

739
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,720
Why do you have to do this?

740
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,520
Your Majesty.

741
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,040
Duke said everything

742
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,600
out of his love for his daughter.

743
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,290
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

744
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,760
What a loving father.

745
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,940
Duke, I think

746
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,420
you regard state affairs as your personal business

747
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,410
and the Xingwu Guards as the Xue family's servants, right?

748
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,630
Your Majesty.

749
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,540
I didn’t mean that.

750
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,340
-Please...
-We'll find out your true intentions

751
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,450
after an investigation.

752
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,150
Xie Wei, Zhang Zhe.

753
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,610
I order you two to go to Xingwu Guards' government office

754
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,980
to investigate the case from three years ago that Minister Jiang brought up.

755
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,670
Also,

756
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,560
carry out a detailed investigation of

757
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,350
the theft of Tongzhou's barracks.

758
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,910
I'd like to see

759
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,820
how deeply corrupted

760
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,490
the Xingwu Guards are.

761
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

762
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,160
You bastard!

763
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,280
How dare you do something like that

764
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,470
behind my back?

765
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,080
You even got caught.

766
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,200
Aunt, please investigate it.

767
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,550
This has nothing to do with Shu.

768
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,390
You...

769
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,660
Aunt!

770
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,150
It has nothing to do with you?

771
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,350
I taught you personally.

772
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,280
How could I not know your methods?

773
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,150
I've warned you many times

774
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,580
not to make any mistakes

775
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,780
before the consort selection.

776
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,710
Is Jiang Xuehui worthy of you

777
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,739
stooping so low?

778
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,469
Is this what I taught you?

779
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,400
Aunt, calm down.

780
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,330
I'm just worried about His Highness,

781
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,429
that he might be bewitched

782
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,150
and make trouble during the selection.

783
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,530
Aunt, please give me another chance and show some mercy

784
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,090
on account of your amicable relationship with the Xue family.

785
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,210
Mercy?

786
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,310
I raised you by my side since you were a child

787
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,239
for the Xue family.

788
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,260
But you

789
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,190
did such stupid things time after time.

790
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,980
After the Jade Ruyi Scepter matter last time,

791
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,389
I already warned you

792
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,500
to be careful

793
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,080
and not to leave any traces.

794
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,610
This time, you actually let Zhang Zhe

795
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,550
expose your dirty deed in court.

796
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,310
You dragged the Xingwu Guards,

797
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,469
your father and I into it, such that we're in such a plight.

798
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,690
How can I show you mercy?

799
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,230
Aunt.

800
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,880
Aunt, I didn't mean it.

801
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,940
Get lost!

802
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,480
Aunt!

803
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,280
Aunt.

804
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,460
Aunt, I didn't mean it.

805
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,620
Aunt!

806
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,180
Aunt, I didn't mean it.

807
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,600
Aunt!

808
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,190
Your Majesty.

809
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,480
Don't blame yourself

810
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,640
for the mistakes of others.

811
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,360
Your health is more important.

812
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,830
Did I really misjudge her?

813
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,100
Master.

814
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,250
Bastard!

815
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,910
You've put the Xue family in such an awkward situation.

816
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:37,940
Look at

817
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,260
-the great daughter you raised!
-I…

818
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,700
Master.

819
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,990
Why don't we beg the Empress Dowager?

820
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,390
She has always adored Shu.

821
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,020
There must be another way.

822
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,900
If there weren't any evidence,

823
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,780
it could be handled.

824
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,510
But now it's all just wishful thinking!

825
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,850
You have disgraced

826
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,260
the entire Xue family!

827
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,860
I disgraced the Xue family?

828
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,540
Didn't I do all this

829
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,380
for the Xue family?

830
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,540
For his daughter, Jiang Xuening's father bet against heavy odds

831
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,010
and boldly made a report in court.

832
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,850
But what about you?

833
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,810
You hate me for losing my Consort position

834
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,690
and ruining the plan of the Xue family.

835
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,510
But did I say anything false?

836
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,200
It's true that Jiang Xuening went to Tongzhou

837
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,830
and hung out with the rebels.

838
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,500
Her reputation should be ruined,

839
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,740
not mine!

840
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,820
You fool!

841
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,230
Shu!

842
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,380
How dare you talk back to me?

843
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,560
Whether she hung out with the rebels

844
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,550
or is a loyal heroine,

845
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,310
it's all up to His Majesty to decide.

846
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,470
Do you think your dirty tricks

847
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,550
can withstand His Majesty's precious words?

848
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,690
Father.

849
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,220
-Bad news!
-What happened?

850
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,410
Xie Wei and Zhang Zhe

851
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,220
headed to Xingwu Guards' government office with the imperial guards.

852
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,310
What?

853
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,780
[Xing]

854
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,080
Listen.

855
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,960
From now on,

856
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,570
you're not allowed to leave the Xue Mansion.

857
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,160
Reflect on yourself!

858
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,150
Shu.

859
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,900
Let me see.

860
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,740
Junior Preceptor Xie, Zhang Zhe.

861
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,510
What are you trying to do?

862
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,930
We're ordered to investigate the case.

863
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,190
His Majesty just issued an imperial edict today.

864
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,060
Have you forgotten it already?

865
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,160
You can investigate the case,

866
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,390
but why did you bring

867
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,120
so many imperial guards?

868
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,710
Minister Jiang's report involves you.

869
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,420
Naturally, Mr. Zhang and I have to start

870
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,380
investigating the people and files related to Xingwu Guards.

871
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,330
But this is a military camp after all.

872
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,740
In order to prevent any crooks from making trouble,

873
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,760
His Majesty allowed me to bring the imperial guards here.

874
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,650
Why?

875
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,550
Do you even want to go against

876
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,970
His Majesty's orders?

877
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,810
Let's go.

878
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,290
[Xingwu Guards]

879
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,490
Master.

880
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,290
How could you be so foolish?

881
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,420
You know what kind of person

882
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,910
Duke Xue Yuan is.

883
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,230
He is the biological uncle of the Emperor

884
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,300
and the biological brother of the Empress Dowager.

885
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,640
Even if the Xue family collapses,

886
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,320
the Empress Dowager will still be here.

887
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,400
If Mr. Zhang and Junior Preceptor Xie didn't speak up for you

888
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,870
in front of the emperor today,

889
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,880
do you think you could have gotten away unscathed?

890
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,600
All right, My Lady.

891
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,710
I'm not telling you this

892
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,300
so that you can scold me.

893
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,460
I want you to know

894
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,620
that the rumor

895
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,330
was indeed started by Miss Xue.

896
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,460
She did it because of

897
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,310
the consort selection of Lord Linzi.

898
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,610
Her target this time

899
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,110
was not Ning,

900
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,880
-but...
-Master. Madam.

901
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,960
First Young Lady is here.

902
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,300
She said she's here to apologize.

903
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,340
It's my fault.

904
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,380
I had an affair with Lord Linzi

905
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,010
and aroused the fear of the Xue family.

906
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,440
That's why all this trouble was caused.

907
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,280
My Lady.

908
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,060
Don't do that!

909
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,360
What have I taught you since you were young?

910
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,470
How could you be so foolish

911
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,880
and do such a disgraceful thing?

912
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,040
You...

913
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,970
My Lady.

914
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,870
Talk things out nicely.

915
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,360
Don't hit her.

916
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,660
Mother.

917
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,300
His Highness and I have feelings for each other but we've acted virtuously.

918
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,480
We've never crossed the line.

919
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,880
Mother, please believe me.

920
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,730
That's right.

921
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,300
My Lady.

922
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,180
You've raised your own child all this time.

923
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,850
Don't you know Hui's character?

924
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,530
Fine.

925
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,190
Since you took the initiative to admit your mistake,

926
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,120
I won't punish you.

927
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,270
But you must promise me

928
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,540
to quit the consort selection

929
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,850
and never see Lord Linzi again,

930
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,010
lest you get into trouble.

931
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,260
Get up.

932
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,360
Hui.

933
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,870
You've always been by my side.

934
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,190
You've always been obedient

935
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,170
and never went against my wishes.

936
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,800
Please listen to me this time too.

937
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,080
I do everything for your own good.

938
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,710
I won't harm you.

939
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,920
You know about Lord Linzi intruding into the Imperial Study

940
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,990
at night, right?

941
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,500
For you,

942
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,680
he defied the Empress Dowager and offended the Emperor.

943
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,510
You should know how he feels about you.

944
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,040
I've always been aware

945
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,180
of his feelings.

946
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,990
I've also always believed them.

947
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,270
Then what are you afraid of?

948
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,500
The Xue family?

949
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,400
You should understand

950
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,090
that against evil,

951
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,560
hiding is not a solution.

952
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,550
This is not simply about a moment,

953
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,010
but about a marriage of a lifetime.

954
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,710
Do you think

955
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,550
I should persist?

956
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,860
It's not up to me.

957
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,670
Jiang Xuehui.

958
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,810
You've stifled yourself for more than ten years.

959
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,160
It's time to ask your heart

960
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,870
what you really want.

961
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,400
Everything depends on what you do.

962
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,060
If you haven't tried it,

963
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,520
how do you know it won't work?

964
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,300
As long as you're willing to join the consort selection

965
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,300
and take this step,

966
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,660
I'll take care of

967
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,810
everything else.

968
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,040
Okay?

969
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,300
Please forgive me for being unfilial.

970
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,310
I've always listened to you my whole life.

971
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,100
But this time,

972
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,080
I want to follow my heart.

973
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,270
Just this once.

974
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,920
What did you say?

975
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,590
Say that again if you dare!

976
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,020
My Lady!

977
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,080
Please grant me this wish.

978
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,390
My Lady.

979
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,310
Nanny Yang!

980
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,940
Bring me the punishing rod.

981
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,760
It's not that serious!

982
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,920
My Lady, I know everything you do

983
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,800
is for the safety of the Jiang family.

984
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,290
But you should know

985
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,980
that no matter how powerful the Xue family is,

986
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,540
they can't just hide the truth from the masses.

987
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,730
Sometimes, retreating is not the way

988
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,520
to attain peace,

989
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,160
but instead a way to let others bully us even more.

990
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,050
Besides, My Lady,

991
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,150
the consort selection list

992
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,380
has been decided.

993
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,240
No one can change it now.

994
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,070
Fine!

995
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,330
Fine.

996
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,620
The old and the young.

997
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,390
You're all ambitious.

998
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,970
Aren’t you afraid of death?

999
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,920
You're all surnamed Jiang.

1000
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,650
I'm the only outsider.

1001
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,330
What are you talking about?

1002
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,110
Do whatever you want.

1003
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,430
I don't care anymore.

1004
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:17,970
Mother.

1005
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,170
Don't call me mother.

1006
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,350
The daughter Hui whom I raised

1007
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,130
is not so rebellious and unfilial.

1008
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:25,870
My Lady.

1009
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,480
You...

1010
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,680
First Young Lady went against Madam about the selection.

1011
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,610
After that, she's been punishing herself

1012
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,090
and hasn't stopped kneeling in the ancestral hall.

1013
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:42,850
However,

1014
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,880
she didn't agree to give up the candidacy.

1015
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,490
I didn't expect

1016
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,000
that First Young Lady

1017
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,280
could be this stubborn.

1018
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,520
Maybe this is her real self.

1019
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,350
This is good.

1020
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,870
At least she finally figured out what she wants.

1021
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,310
I heard

1022
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,300
Madam even got angry with Master this time.

1023
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,970
She wouldn't even let him in the room.

1024
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,670
It's understandable for Madam to be this infuriated.

1025
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,990
This matter sounds dangerous indeed.

1026
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,820
But I heard that it was all thanks to

1027
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,420
Mr. Zhang and Junior Preceptor Xie

1028
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,620
that we could be safe.
