know about this?

No, he doesn't.

I didn't even

41
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,800
send him the wedding candies.

42
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,040

You can't simply get married

But actually,

70
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,710
I have thought this through.

71
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,530
I grew up in the You family.

72
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,290
My father is lustful,

73
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,710
so there are many concubines at home.

74
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,400
They have to be kept in place by Madam all the time.

75
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,220
Since I was young, my mother told me that

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,910
I should never be a concubine in the future.

77
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,080
She said that I should be a proper wife,

78
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,460
even if I live in poverty.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,450
That's true.

80
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,460
But you can't simply choose Lyu Xian recklessly.

81
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,850
It wasn't a random choice.

82
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,880

84
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,190
No, I don't like him.

85
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,350
No... I mean, it's not that kind of like.

86
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,950
I just think that

87
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,320
getting married is currently the best way

88
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,930
for me to leave the You family.

89
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,330
Besides, Mr. Lyu is a nice person.

90
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,990
He treats me well.

91
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,770
He also taught me how to do business patiently.

92
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,610
He is the only person

93
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,170
who treats me sincerely besides you.

94
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,530
I don't have any big ambitions.

95
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
Now, I just want to help you

96
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,230
manage the salt well business.

97
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,630
Besides, I don't have

98
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,580
much thoughts about marriage.

99
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,260
Also...

100
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,180
He promised me that

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,560
I would be free to continue doing business after marriage.

102
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,090
It would just be like before we got married.

103
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,690
If I no longer want to do business anymore,

104
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,790
he'll be willing to divorce me anytime.

105
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,650
Well, he's still a gentleman.

106
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,790
Are you sure about this?

107
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,660
Yes, Miss.

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,330
I've made up my mind.

109
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,610
Miss...

110
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,340
Miss Jiang.

111
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,880
If you are marrying her for the salt well business,

112
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,400
I can just give you my shares.

113
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,390
I might be avaricious,

114
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,909
but there's no need for me to trade my marriage for money.

115
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,140
In other words,

116
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,730
you are serious about Fangyin?

117
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,659
If I say that my love is

118
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,040
deep and unwavering,

119
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,330
you wouldn't believe me either.

120
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,250
However,

121
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,850
Miss You is kind and innocent.

122
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,320
All these years,

123
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,860
I've seen a lot of selfish and cunning people.

124
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,910
I never thought there could be

125
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,720
such a kind woman in this world.

126
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,380
I really want to help her.

127
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,020
You just want to help her?

128
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,370
If it's just motivated by a moment of compassion,

129
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,290
how can your love last?

130
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,800

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,960
as a girl,

132
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,220
her reputation will be ruined.

133
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,070
What will she do then?

134
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,500
You have misunderstood me, Miss.

135
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,930
I know

136
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,620
you're a true friend to her,

137
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,150
so I dare not lie to you.

138
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,140
Since we are going to get married,

139
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,430
I, Lyu Zhaoyin,

140
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,310
swears to God that,

141
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,080
from today onwards,

142
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,480
I won't let her suffer

143
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,270
or be humiliated ever again.

144
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,250
You'd better.

145
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,920
If you break your promise, I will...

146
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,980
If so, I will spend my life earning and then losing all my keep.

147
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,870
I'll never make any money.

148
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,330
Sir, your health is finally getting better.

149
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,910
The physician told me repeatedly that

150
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,730
you must not eat anymore Golden Stone Pills.

151
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,650
Morning, everyone.

152
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,430
You knew to come here.

153
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,110
I was going to send Jian Shu to find you.

154
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,090
How are things going with you these days?

155
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,930
Don’t mention it.

156
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,500
Xue Yuan, that old prick,

157
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,160
is really tolerant.

158
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,280
I hired a prostitute at the brothel

159
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,190
in the name of the Xue family,

160
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,860
and then didn't greet Mrs. Xue on purpose.

161
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,930
I thought it would be enough to provoke them.

162
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,740
Then, the debt collectors came looking for us,

163
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,860
but Xue Yuan didn't even say a word about it.

164
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,830
Xue Yuan has been in control of the court for many years.

165
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,370
Naturally, he's way more patient than others.

166
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,040
You have just returned to the capital,

167
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,130
and you are favored by His Majesty.

168
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,040
Plus, Xingwu Guards have made many mistakes lately.

169
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,570
Of course, he will know how to avoid his enemies.

170
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,560
I really don't understand.

171
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,780
Did you really go through all this trouble to get me back in the capital,

172
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,750
just so that I could piss off that old man?

173
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,340
Of course not.

174
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,330
In the case of the 300 Loyal Souls,

175
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,470
Xue Yuan was greedy for credit and committed a serious crime.

176
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,000
But, Shen Lang

177
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,520
doesn't know anything about it.

178
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,680
The Xue family has been in control of the court for many years.

179
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,770
They maintained a private army,

180
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,990
conspired with the Yan family,

181
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,110
and tried to get their hands on Yan's troops.

182
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,780
Their ambitions speak for themselves.

183
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,620
I am asking you to create trouble,

184
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,830
so as to mess with his mind,

185
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,310
and arouse His Majesty's suspicion.

186
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,170
When the Ministry of Justice finds evidence of Xue Yuan's crimes,

187
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,430
that's when we will take action.

188
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,260
But didn't Zhang Zhe

189
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,880
just went to his Mother's?

190
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,260
I’m afraid the Xue family's case will be delayed.

191
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,400
That’s why I am asking you to buy time.

192
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,340
As for the rest,

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,440
I've got my own arrangements.

194
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
I've used

195
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,480
all the tricks in my book.

196
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,350
I really don't know

197
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,200
how else to offend this old man.

198
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,810
Xue Yuan

199
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,360
only wants power and fortune.

200
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,110
I'll go to the palace tomorrow,

201
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,010
and create an opportunity for you.

202
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,670
Sir.

203
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,480
How is it?

204
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,310
What is Lyu Xian doing recently?

205
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,340
Oh, that's right.

206
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,720
Since I returned to the capital,

207
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,190
I haven't seen that greedy Lyu Xian.

208
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Back in Jinling,

209
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,080
didn't he like to

210
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,240
follow you around?

211
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,670
Lyu Xian...

212
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,520
married You Fangyin.

213
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,520
What?

214
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,480
Lyu Xian and Miss You...?

215
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,120
How could someone like Lyu Xian get married?

216
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,770
It's a real blossoming of the iron tree.

217
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,790
Dao Qin.

218
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,000
Who's the girl

219
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,240
who was willing to marry him?

220
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,590
Dao Qin,

221
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,610
does Ning'er know?

222
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,060
She's someone under Miss Jiang?

223
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,670
When I went over to the Lyu's,

224
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,850
I happened to bump into Miss Jiang.

225
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,780
She didn’t look well when she left.

226
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,750
Look,

227
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,810
she's definitely going to put all the blame on you.

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,450
Who asked you to always be scheming against her?

229
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,490
Lyu Xian is your man.

230
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,710
She doesn't like you,

231
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,180
of course she wouldn't like Lyu Xian either.

232
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,310
Poor Lyu.

233
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,320
It's not easy for him to get married and have a wife.

234
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,610
Yet, he has to suffer with you.

235
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,750
Are you done?

236
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,830
I thought you were.

237
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,880
Why are you still here?

238
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Have you done what needs to be done?

239
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,800
Fine, I'm leaving.

240
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,470
You don't have to rush me.

241
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,700
I'm also a busy person.

242
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,440
I'm leaving.

243
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,500
Mr. Gu.

244
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,800
Mr. Xie, why are you here?

245
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,590
His Majesty summoned me to the palace

246
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,470
to discuss the rewards and punishments for eliminating the rebels in Tongzhou.

247
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,260
I heard you were also summoned,

248
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,720
so I decided to wait here for you.

249
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,080
I want to discuss something with you, Sir.

250
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,810
It's up to His Majesty to decide.

251
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,640
If you want to take credit and be rewarded handsomely,

252
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,400
I'm afraid you got the wrong person.

253
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,130
You've misunderstood me, Mr. Gu.

254
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,400
I’m waiting here

255
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,730
not for myself,

256
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,820
but for Mr. Zhang, Zhang Zhe.

257
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,450
Zhang Zhe has an upright character.

258
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,590
He's sometimes at odds with you, Junior Preceptor Xie.

259
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,710
Why are you helping him?

260
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,110
Since I have been favored by His Majesty,

261
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,220
I must repay His Majesty's grace.

262
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,140
Now,

263
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,350
within the court,

264
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,510
the Xue family covets imperial power,

265
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,490
while the rebels of Lord Pingnan are eyeing us from the outside.

266
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,980
How can I go up against

267
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,710
the Xue family and Lord Pingnan all on my own?

268
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,370
On the other hand, Mr. Zhang is a clean

269
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,560
and upright man

270
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,850
that works for the people.

271
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,800
He is a rare asset to have on my side.

272
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,470
With him,

273
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,710
I’m sure he can help me solve problems for His Majesty,

274
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,180
and stabilize the court.

275
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,320
Do you really think so, Junior Preceptor Xie?

276
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,760
As an official,

277
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,560
it's my job to fulfil my duties.

278
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,790
Junior Preceptor Xie, I hope

279
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,910
this heart will never change.

280
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,470
Are you suggesting to exempt Zhang Zhe from the three-year period of mourning?

281
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,210
Official Gu,

282
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,880
you seem to value this student of yours very much.

283
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,550
Your Majesty,

284
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
I have a suggestion.

285
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,680
Tell me.

286
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,710
I also feel that

287
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,710
Zhang Zhe should be exempted from the three-year period of mourning.

288
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,400
You think so too?

289
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,180
Your Majesty,

290
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,260
the court has been facing problems internally and externally.

291
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,760
We are in need of capable talents like Mr. Zhang.

292
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,230
Although Mr. Zhang might be low in rank,

293
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,720
he has an upright character,

294
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,100
and he never forms alliances for personal gains.

295
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,520
With him,

296
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,510
I'm sure he would help Your Majesty clear the court of deep-seated problems.

297
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,720
I am guessing

298
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,450
Mr. Gu had the same intention

299
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,100
when he made this suggestion to Your Majesty, is that right?

300
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,240
Yes.

301
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,670
Your Majesty,

302
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,470
I'm already very old.

303
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,720
Although I would very much like to resolve the problems plaguing Ministry of Personnel,

304
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,470
I am limited by my ability to keep up.

305
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,690
With Zhang Zhe around

306
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,020
to assist me,

307
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,800
we will be able to help Your Majesty stabilize the court.

308
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,170
You guys have some good points.

309
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,790
However, observing the period of mourning is usual practice.

310
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,400
If he is exempted...

311
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,050
[Tai'an Hall]

312
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,110
You mean

313
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,680
His Majesty summoned Xie Wei

314
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,190
and Gu Chunfang,

315
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,000
but didn't summon Duke Xue?

316
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,600
Exactly.

317
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,570
Summon Xue Shu into the palace.

318
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,480
Just tell her that...

319
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,350
I would like to hold a banquet.

320
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,770
Yes.

321
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,850
[Imperial Study]

322
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,470
When it comes to Zhang Zhe's mother,

323
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,380
I'm ultimately

324
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,910
also partially responsible.

325
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,040
How about this?

326
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,840
I'll pass an edict

327
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,200
to get the Ministry of Personnel exempt Zhang Zhe from his period of mourning,

328
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,610
and confer a title to Zhang Zhe's mother,

329
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,930
as a form of consolation.

330
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,900
Your Majesty is benevolent.

331
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,160
The Ministry of Justice is in need of manpower.

332
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,400
I thank Your Majesty for your compassion on behalf of Mr. Zhang.

333
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,120
Your Majesty,

334
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,540
the battle of Tongzhou was extremely precarious.

335
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,510
Everyone almost died at Shangqing Monastery.

336
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,420
If Your Majesty grants a reward to everyone,

337
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,230
we can announce that

338
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,560
Jinling is not to be feared,

339
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,270
while comforting the hearts of all the officials.

340
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,310
It will also make Mr. Zhang's individual reward

341
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,060
not look overly conspicuous.

342
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,090
What do you think, Your Majesty?

343
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,090
Official Xie is right.

344
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,960
Pass on my orders.

345
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,350
All the officials have done a great job in the fight against the rebels.

346
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,440
Yan's troops will be rewarded with 100,000 winter coats,

347
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,590
10,000 taels for Xingwu Guards,

348
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,240
Zhang Zhe shall be exempted from his period of mourning,

349
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,630
and be promoted to the fourth rank.

350
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,560
As for Official Xie,

351
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,920
I will endure my pain,

352
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,990
and give you a great qin.

353
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,770
Thank you, Your Majesty.

354
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,200
Your Majesty, I feel that

355
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,240
we should think about the rewards

356
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,510
for Duke Xue and Xingwu Guards a little more.

357
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,030
Xingwu Guards didn't do a good job after all.

358
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,000
If they get rewarded because of this,

359
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,030
I'm afraid people will be upset.

360
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,620
But if we don't reward them,

361
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,490
I'm afraid Duke Xue might think too much.

362
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,580
Your Majesty,

363
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,210
I do have a plan to solve this problem.

364
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,520
Take a look at this.

365
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,030
Aunt,

366
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,850
this is...

367
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,500
This was sent by the Ministry of Rites.

368
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,240
This is a list of ladies from the capital's noble families,

369
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,080
who are suitable to marry into the royal family.

370
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,270
I've read them all.

371
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,060
[Concubine Selection List]

372
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,880
They are all gentle and calm women.

373
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,050
Don't worry.

374
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,190
The position of First Lady is still yours.

375
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,630
As for the concubines,

376
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,410
you can just choose among them.

377
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,300
Would that be okay?

378
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,060
I'll do as you say, Aunt.

379
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,900
Jie told me that

380
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,670
his heart belongs to a lady from the Jiang family.

381
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,760
Men

382
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,720
just like novelty.

383
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,870
When you're in this position later on,

384
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,930
you are bound to be surrounded by beautiful girls.

385
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,270
Instead of that,

386
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,820
why don't you choose someone

387
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,880
who is quiet and doesn't like to fight?

388
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,090
The Jiang family is a noble

389
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,040
and well-educated family.

390
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,490
The First Young Lady is educated and well-mannered.

391
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,640
Since Jie likes her,

392
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,010
I don't want to develop a rift

393
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,850
between Jie and myself over this matter.

394
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,080
So,

395
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,990
how about we choose Jiang family's First Young Lady for the position of the concubine?

396
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,890
We will follow your wishes, Aunt.

397
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,470
What a good girl.

398
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,130
By God's blessing, the Emperor commands:

399
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,260
[Mansion of Duke Xue]

400
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,980
In the battle of Tongzhou, the officials were successful in crushing the rebels.

401
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,010
They should be rewarded.

402
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,760
In view of Xue Dingfei's fearlessness

403
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,380
and loyalty in defending the country,

404
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,230
I hereby award you 100 taels of gold,

405
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,050
and 10 pieces of goldware.

406
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,890
Thank you, Your Majesty.

407
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,480
Please rise.

408
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,870
What are you waiting for?

409
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,160
Go get the stuff.

410
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,110
Yes.

411
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,270
Eunuch Wang,

412
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,160
I must say,

413
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,520
you are my lucky star.

414
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,400
Every time I meet you,

415
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,329
something good happens.

416
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,210
I don't think we can afford to say that.

417
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,230
It's only because of your good fortune

418
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,780
that you've won the favor of the Emperor today.

419
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,140
Your grace is immeasurable.

420
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,910
Ridiculous!

421
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,770
Eunuch Wang is here to issue a decree.

422
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,550
Do you have any manners?

423
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,880
Send Eunuch Wang back to the palace.

424
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,380
Yes.

425
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,910
Eunuch Wang, please.

426
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,870
Wait a minute!

427
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,740
What's the rush?

428
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,000
This is the Duke's Mansion, right?

429
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,160
It's been hard for Eunuch Wang

430
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,230
to come all the way here.

431
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,850
Yet, you guys aren't showing any form of appreciation.

432
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,680
You guys are so stingy.

433
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,750
What did you say?

434
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,310
Eunuch Wang,

435
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,330
you see, I was just too happy.

436
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,720
I've forgotten my manners.

437
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,740
Please accept this.

438
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,780
Thank you, Madam.

439
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,640
Thank you, Duke Xue.

440
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,520
Thank you, Viscount Dingfei.

441
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,000
I'll go back to the palace and report to His Majesty.

442
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,100
Please.

443
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,710
What are you waiting for?

444
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,600
Take His Majesty's rewards

445
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,840
to my room now.

446
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,900
Yes.

447
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,410
Go.

448
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,240
There is no doubt about His Majesty.

449
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,450
He can clearly tell

450
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,260
who is loyal and who isn't.

451
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,010
You...

452
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,120
Ye!

453
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,290
Stop!

454
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:41,980
Let me ask you.

455
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,880
Where were you

456
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,480
fooling around last night?

457
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,810
That goes without saying.

458
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,960
It's a beautiful day,

459
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,410
so I'm going to have a drink.

460
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,810
What's up, Your Lordship?

461
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,130
Do you want to go too?

462
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,850
Xue Dingfei.

463
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,440
No matter what, you're from the Duke's Mansion.

464
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,790
From now on, you'd better not

465
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,500
[Respect and Peace]

466
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,250
engage in such filthy acts again.

467
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,770
You can be shameless,

468
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,380
but you must not tarnish the reputation of our Xue family.

469
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,250
So you think I'm a disgrace.

470
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,430
That's easy.

471
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,310
Since you think it's so troublesome for me to bear the Xue surname,

472
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,340
how about

473
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,510
I change my surname to...

474
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,670
Yan?

475
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,880
You bastard!

476
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,080
-You unfilial son! Xue Dingfei!
-Calm down.

477
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,480
How dare you disrespect your father like that?

478
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,120
Don't you have any respect for your elders?

479
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,900
Xue Dingfei!

480
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,610
How dare you hit Ye!

481
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,460
What do you want?

482
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,950
How dare the son of a concubine

483
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,870
talk to his eldest legitimate brother like that?

484
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,790
Well then, let me teach him

485
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,750
what is seniority,

486
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,120
and what is respect.

487
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,400
What do you want?

488
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,760
You bastard!

489
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,350
Listen,

490
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,450
if I don’t teach you a lesson,

491
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,090
I'm not the head of the Xue family.

492
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,010
That hurts!

493
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,380
Xue Yuan, you...

494
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,240
You are jealous that I'm the only one who got rewarded by His Majesty.

495
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,890
How dare you hit me?

496
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,250
Don't forget,

497
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,900
His Majesty personally bestowed me with the position of Commandant Zhongyong.

498
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,150
What are you doing?

499
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,410
You evil thing,

500
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,890
let me tell you.

501
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,430
Let alone a mere commandant,

502
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,130
even if you are a general,

503
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,100
don't try to cause trouble in my Xue Mansion.

504
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,130
You're hurting me so much!

505
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,020
My Lord!

506
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,440
Stay there!

507
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,740
Duke Xue is hitting someone!

508
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,290
Stop!

509
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,510
Help! Help!

510
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,550
That hurts!

511
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,450
My Lord!

512
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,530
You are hurting me!

513
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,090
-Father! 
 -My Lord!

514
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,420
-My Lord! My Lord!
-Father!

515
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,580
My waist!

516
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,220
My waist!

517
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,160
Are you okay?

518
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,880
Screw you!

519
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,390
Ye!

520
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,800
You unfilial son!

521
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,750
He hit me!

522
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,710
Duke Xue is hitting someone!

523
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,080
Help!

524
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,580
Is there anyone to take a look at this?

525
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,180
Ye.

526
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,570
Let me see.

527
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,000
It's been a long day, hasn't it?

528
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,480
You still have time to ask Jian Shu to get me here?

529
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,070
Aren't you tired?

530
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,830
About me and You Fangyin...

531
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,380
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

532
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,860
But it happened suddenly,

533
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,640
and she didn't want to publicize it.

534
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,100
So we got married in a hurry.

535
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,840
But, don't be sad.

536
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,080
Although I have a wife now,

537
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,970
I won't forget you.

538
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,350
There are many ways to save someone.

539
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,430
Yet, you had to choose this method.

540
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,130
Is your relationship with her

541
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,110
deep enough to even talk about marriage?

542
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,080
You have a good chemistry

543
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,980
with Miss Jiang.

544
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,640
She asked me the same question.

545
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,460
Well...

546
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,420
It's not true if you say that

547
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,980
I don't like even her for a bit.

548
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,080
But,

549
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,690
it's also not that

550
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,670
that I like her very, very much.

551
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,090
I just think that

552
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,770
this girl is different.

553
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,320
How so?

554
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,420
She's stubborn.

555
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,130
So, this is the type of girl that you like.

556
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,250
You haven't got to know her,

557
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,480
so you wouldn't know.

558
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,990
This girl

559
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,400
is very loyal.

560
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,100
If you treat her well,

561
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,170
she'll return the favor by a hundred, or even a thousand percent.

562
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,760
It's just like...

563
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,170
how she treats Miss Jiang.

564
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,010
Talk about yourself.

565
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,670
You Fangyin

566
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,700
is a timid

567
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,720
and weak woman.

568
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,400
But in the name of loyalty,

569
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,320
she will be willing to do anything.

570
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,630
If she gets stubborn,

571
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,220
she wouldn't leave even if the sky collapsed.

572
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,120
She's so stupid that it's frustrating.

573
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,730
But it's also because of this temperament of hers,

574
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,630
that I feel sorry for her.

575
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,310
So I thought,

576
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,710
there should at least be someone,

577
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,160
who would hold up the sky for her.

578
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,880
So you want to be that person?

579
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,720
How long do you plan on doing this?

580
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,200
Since I have married her,

581
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,870
of course I'll take responsibility.

582
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,440
But she might not like you.

583
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,970
Are you underestimating me?

584
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,820
I'm a charming man.

585
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,610
Why wouldn't I be able to make her fall for me?

586
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,990
Fine.

587
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,980
I wish you and your wife

588
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,560
an everlasting marriage.

589
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,350
Don't just congratulate me.

590
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,180
Where's the accompanying gift?

591
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,930
Did I get to be at your banquet?

592
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,410
Who asked you not be around?

593
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,230
That's why.

594
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,000
I didn't even get to enjoy your banquet.

595
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,200
You...

596
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,600
Are you not going to give me anything?

597
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,660
At least give me something!

598
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,320
This is from Mr. Xie.

599
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,570
Qin and se?

600
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,190
It's his wedding gift for you.

601
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,960
Well, I will consider that he has a conscience.

602
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,290
Where are the gifts from you and Dao Qin?

603
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,770
Dao Qin, don't run. Where's your gift?

604
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,500
You fooled me!

605
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,460
You have to give me double!

606
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,150
Stop!

607
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,590
Nobel Consort Qin is getting bigger by the month.

608
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,620
It's no longer appropriate for outsiders to stay in the palace,

609
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,220
so we can't enter the palace and be study partners for Her Highness anymore.

610
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,040
I thought it would be hard to see you again.

611
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,290
I didn't think

612
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,120
we would meet at this temple today.

613
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,690
Actually,

614
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,130
it's not a coincidence.

615
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,410
There's no such thing as coincidence.

616
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,020
I just thought

617
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,260
if you like to study Buddhism,

618
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,610
you would come here to worship.

619
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,490
I was here day after day,

620
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,040
with the hopes that I will see you one day.

621
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,900
Your Highness,

622
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,720
I am undeserving of how highly you think of me.

623
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,520
If I think you are deserving, then you must be deserving.

624
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,640
Actually, I waited for you here

625
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,570
to tell you something.

626
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,410
What do you...

627
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,900
want to tell me?

628
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,010
Miss Jiang,

629
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,600
Mother will choose a consort for me soon.

630
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,720
I hope you can join the selection.

631
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,190
Are you...

632
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,920
unwilling?

633
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,650
I thought you and I had a connection.

634
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,710
I didn't realize it was my wishful thinking.

635
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,190
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

636
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,650
Sorry to bother you.

637
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,820
I'm very grateful for your kindness.

638
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,850
But,

639
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,140
everyone knows that

640
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,890
your consort...

641
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,370
is the First Young Lady of the Xue family.

642
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,340
But in my heart,

643
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,040
I've made up my mind.

644
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,410
My consort

645
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,110
must be someone I love.

646
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,380
But I'm afraid,

647
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,200
things don't go as we wish.

648
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,840
It's just a matter of our efforts.

649
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,690
If you haven't tried it,

650
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,170
how do you know it wouldn't work?

651
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,850
As long as you're willing to join the selection

652
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,200
and take this step,

653
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,100
I'll take care

654
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,340
of the rest.

655
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:23,670
Okay?

656
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:43,990
Miss.

657
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,750
There's news from Xingwu Guards

658
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,350
that His Highness, Lord Linzi comes here every day.

659
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,930
So it's because of Elder Miss Jiang.

660
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,270
What scholarly family?

661
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,330
How dare she seduce His Highness?

662
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,530
How shameless!

663
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,000
You must

664
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,010
tell the Duke and Empress Dowager.

665
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,440
I don't need to bother

666
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,570
Father and Auntie with such a trivial matter.

667
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,070
It's just Jiang Xuehui.

668
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,150
Let's go.

669
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,220
Yes.

670
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:11,940
Ning,

671
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,960
you finally came to see me today.

672
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,900
Tell me.

673
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,640
How many letters have I written to you these days?

674
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
You don't even bother to reply me.

675
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,130
Do you not treat me as a friend anymore?

676
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,180
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

677
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,430
A few days ago,

678
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,190
my mother asked my sister to go to a Buddhist temple outside the city,

679
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,110
so she stayed at the temple for a while.

680
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,020
After she came back, she fell sick.

681
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,780
I don't think she had a chance to read Your Highness' letters yet.

682
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,620
You fell ill?

683
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,060
Are you okay now?

684
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,460
Of course.

685
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,060
I only came to see you after I got better.

686
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,140
In that case,

687
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,850
I wouldn't blame you.

688
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,980
But if anything happens in the future,

689
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,140
please tell me.

690
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,490
Yes, I will.

691
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,100
Thank you for your generosity, Your Highness.

692
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,060
Miss, where are you going?

693
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,960
The Empress Dowager is waiting for you.

694
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,590
I need to speak to Her Highness.

695
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,960
It won't take long.

696
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,520
Why are you being so polite with me?

697
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,540
Your Highness.

698
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,680
Shu, you're here.

699
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,020
Your Highness.

700
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,280
What a coincidence.

701
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,530
Why are the two ladies of the Jiang family here in the palace?

702
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,790
We all used to be study partners.

703
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,100
Since Miss Xue is here,

704
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,270
of course we would be here too.

705
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,950
You're joking, Miss Jiang.

706
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,020
I am here because my aunt summoned me.

707
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,000
Today, there's venison at Tai'an Hall,

708
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,740
which His Highness, Lord Linzi, likes to eat.

709
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,280
Aunt asked me to come and accompany him.

710
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,840
So?

711
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,270
Haven't you heard?

712
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,680
His Highness intends to select

713
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,040
his consort among the study partners.

714
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,860
But His Highness, Lord Linzi, is noble.

715
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,190
The position of consort

716
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,350
is not something that anyone can simply take on.

717
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,520
I'm just afraid that someone may want to fly up the ladder,

718
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,230
but ends up in pieces instead.

719
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,020
Miss Xue is right.

720
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,430
But I think

721
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,500
only a true phoenix can fly to the heights.

722
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,840
Some pheasants and birds

723
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,560
mistake themselves for phoenixes

724
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,040
just because they have a few colored feathers.

725
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,050
In the end, it's just a joke.

726
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,480
Your Highness,

727
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,220
Empress Dowager is still waiting for me.

728
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,880
I'll leave now.

729
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,710
What's wrong with her today?

730
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,400
Who doesn't know that she's

731
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,870
the Consort Linzi designated by Mother?

732
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,170
Who can compete against her?

733
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,360
What's the point of coming here

734
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,730
just to say something so nasty?

735
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,220
Help! Help!

736
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,530
Duke Xue hit his son!

737
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,590
-Let me see His Majesty.
-What’s going on outside?

738
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,400
Hurry!

739
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,840
It hurts!

740
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,620
Your Majesty,

741
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,820
Commandant Zhongyong is waiting outside.

742
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,200
He insists to see His Majesty.

743
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,240
He said...

744
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,360
he's here to file a complaint.

745
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,460
Complaint?

746
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,660
What is he complaining about?

747
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,180
Well...

748
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
I have no idea.

749
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,140
Let him in.

750
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,300
Yes.

751
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,440
Your Majesty!

752
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,590
You must uphold justice for me, Your Majesty.

753
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,240
Duke Xue... He hit me!

754
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,540
Look.

755
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,970
He's trying to kill me.

756
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,590
How could Duke Xue be so ruthless?

757
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,090
Why else?

758
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,680
He is used to being arrogant and domineering.

759
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,040
He was jealous that even I was rewarded by Your Majesty,

760
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,690
but he and Xingwu Guards weren't.

761
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,050
That's why I was embarrassed.

762
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,700
Nonsense!

763
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,510
Your father is a duke.

764
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,330
Why would he punish you for such a reason?

765
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,220
Your Majesty,

766
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,900
I'm telling the truth.

767
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,070
Not only is he envious of Your Majesty's favors to me,

768
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,550
he...he also said...

769
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:49,790
What did he say?

770
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,710
He said that Your Majesty has long forgotten

771
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,660
his support and advocacy for you back then.

772
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,690
He said that you have abandoned him after making use of him.

773
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,090
Now that Your Majesty is treating him like this, even when he is your uncle,

774
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,180
he wants to tear bridges and turn his back against you.

775
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,800
So much for his support.

776
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,650
What a great uncle.

777
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,520
I want to ask him,

778
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,350
as an official,

779
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,320
how dare he threaten me?

780
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,820
Where is his loyalty?

781
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,580
Summon Duke Xue into the palace.

782
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,520
Calm down, Your Majesty.

783
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,040
Commandant Zhongyong must have been aggrieved,

784
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,470
so he spoke out of turn.

785
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,090
Duke Xue has been loyal for many years.

786
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,780
He is also Empress Dowager's brother.

787
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,570
I don't think he would have such thoughts.

788
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,480
That's not true.

789
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,080
How am I just spewing nonsense?

790
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,970
Although he is my biological father,

791
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,350
I've had it with him for a long time.

792
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,900
Just because Empress Dowager favors him,

793
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,620
and that he is Your Majesty's uncle,

794
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,470
he is relying on all these familial relationships to do what he wants.

795
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,400
Also, not forgetting

796
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,630
all the unexplained military achievements from 20 years ago.

797
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,500
Besides that,

798
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,930
what else did he do

799
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,630
for Your Majesty and this court?

800
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,200
What do you mean by unexplained military achievements?

801
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,040
What else do you know?

802
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,120
Your Majesty,

803
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,450
since I got to know that

804
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,330
you have been thinking about the case of the 300 Loyal Souls,

805
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,850
I have been wanting to find out the truth.

806
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,660
I kept trying to recall what happened day and night,

807
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,330
and I finally recalled what I overheard from the rebels

808
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,610
when I was trapped in Jinling.

809
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,190
Although I only heard a little,

810
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,600
but there's something strange about it.

811
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:04,990
What is it?

812
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,150
That year, Marquis Yan led an army of 30,000 men,

813
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,450
while Duke Xue only had 5,000 soldiers.

814
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,280
Even if a majority of Lord Pingnan's army

815
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,140
went to fight against Yan's troops in the east,

816
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,040
just how valiant and skillful Duke Xue must be

817
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,910
in order to get the credit of being first to break into the city?

818
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,500
After what happened in Tongzhou,

819
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,630
I just feel that

820
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,380
besides beating his son,

821
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,360
he doesn't seem to be that capable.

822
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,040
Your Majesty,

823
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,800
it has been a long time since then.

824
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,290
Besides, Mr. Dingfei's words are just guesses.

825
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,300
I'm afraid it's inappropriate for

826
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,660
Your Majesty to question Duke Xue's achievements back then

827
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,050
just based on his words.

828
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,230
You must not mention

829
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,450
this to anyone.

830
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,550
Official Xie,

831
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,990
Dingfei has suffered a great deal.

832
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,900
Take him to the Imperial Hospital to get his injuries checked,

833
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,460
so as not to get sick.

834
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,680
Yes.

835
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,800
Your Majesty,

836
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,710
please protect me.

837
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,720
It hurts so much, Your Majesty.

838
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,220
Aren't you

839
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,080
usually upright and respectful?

840
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,280
How come just a few words from Xue Shu

841
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,080
could cause you to get all rattled up today?

842
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,650
Have you ever wondered

843
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,580
why she came to look for you

844
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,420
if she wasn't worried about her chances?

845
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,900
Of course I know.

846
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,780
It's not entirely because of her.

847
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,640
You heard it just now.

848
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,300
Even Her Highness

849
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,600
acknowledges that the future consort of Lord Linzi

850
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,750
is Xue Shu.

851
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,630
I can definitely participate in the selection out of my admiration for His Highness.

852
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,710
But if I fail,

853
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,740
not only would I be disgracing myself,

854
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,630
but I will also cause the Jiang family to become the laughing stock of the capital.

855
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,410
One shouldn't live for the opinion of others,

856
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,010
but for one's heart.

857
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,410
From the moment you saved Nobel Consort Qin,

858
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,100
haven't you made up your mind

859
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,320
to walk this path?

860
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,320
Why are you so timid now?

861
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,699
Xuening,

862
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,620
not everyone

863
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,400
is as courageous as you.

864
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,949
In this world, besides other people's opinions

865
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,719
and one's own feelings,

866
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,860
there is another thing

867
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,350
called destiny.

868
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,270
If this is my destiny,

869
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,770
what's going to happen

870
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,880
even if I try to fight against it?

871
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,659
Is it destiny?

872
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,790
It hurts so much.

873
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,620
Enough.

874
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,380
Stop pretending.

875
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,070
I knew it.

876
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,920
I could possibly fool everyone else,

877
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,750
but not you.

878
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,600
How could I let myself suffer?

879
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,310
It's just an act to drive a wedge in His Majesty's heart.

880
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,380
I've learned this trick from you.

881
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,180
You’d better be careful.

882
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,070
Xue Yuan is not stupid.

883
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,470
If we overdo it,

884
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,660
we'll be in trouble if we get caught.

885
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,450
Miss Jiang.

886
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,570
Miss Jiang,

887
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,590
who is this beautiful girl?

888
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,750
This is the infamous Viscount Dingfei.

889
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,060
You don't have to mind him, Sister.

890
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,340
What have you been doing

891
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,520
these days?

892
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,430
Have you neglected your studies?

893
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,040
I have been studying and practicing the qin at my mansion.

894
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,010
I dare not let you down.

895
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,960
Since we've met,

896
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,180
go back to my place with me.

897
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,960
I have something to tell you.

898
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,370
I have something urgent at home.

899
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,490
I'll visit you another day.

900
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,260
There's a letter from Huangzhou.

901
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,370
Don't you want to know what's inside?

902
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:18,990
Yan Lin?

903
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,390
Sister,

904
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,300
I need to go to Mr. Xie’s residence.

905
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,340
As for our place...

906
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,260
Sister, please go.

907
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,750
I'll report to Mother at home.

908
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,240
Hey little sister Jiang,

909
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,560
why don't you...

910
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,820
you give me a ride?

911
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,280
No...?

912
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,450
Xie Wei!

913
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,270
Jian Shu!

914
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,740
Mother.

915
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,870
Sister.

916
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,400
How did he get hurt?

917
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,410
Take a look yourself.

918
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,300
What happened?

919
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,060
Sister,

920
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,310
you might not know,

921
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,730
but that Xue Dingfei was absolutely outrageous.

922
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,800
He didn't respect me and Mother at all.

923
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,580
I'll go to the palace now

924
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,110
and ask Aunt to remove him from his post.

925
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,640
Let's see how he can still stay this arrogant.

926
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:19,940
No, you must not!

927
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,860
During Lord Pingnan's rebellion back then, it was Xue Dingfei

928
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,670
who stepped forward to die on behalf of His Majesty.

929
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,850
He also contributed to the peace in Tongzhou this time.

930
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,190
Now, he's in the limelight,

931
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,320
and enjoys favors from His Majesty.

932
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,090
If there are rumors of

933
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,390
sibling rivalry within the two brothers of the Xue family,

934
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,750
it will only embarrass Father and Aunt

935
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,420
in the court.

936
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,960
Then, what should we do?

937
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,670
If he is so favored by His Majesty,

938
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,590
wouldn't your brother's position as Royal Highness be a lost cause?

939
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,280
Mother, don't worry.

940
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,190
As long as Aunt decides on Ye,

941
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,300
His Majesty will not disobey the Empress Dowager

942
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,670
for a long-lost cousin.

943
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,220
Moreover, the Yan family has fallen.

944
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,370
He has no family to rely on.

945
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,500
Shu,

946
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,300
it's not as simple as you think.

947
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,440
Before he died,

948
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,190
the late emperor decided that he would be the Royal Highness.

949
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,860
This is known

950
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,050
to the whole court.

951
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,880
It's all my fault.

952
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,760
All these years,

953
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,290
I thought he was dead.

954
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,910
In order to avoid attracting gossip,

955
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,100
I thought I'd ask your father for a new title,

956
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,860
only after your brother's coming-of-age.

957
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,100
I didn't expect that he didn't die,

958
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,420
and could even come back safe and sound.

959
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,840
Shu,

960
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,440
you've always been smart.

961
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,250
You must find a way

962
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,030
to protect your brother's title.

963
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,220
Mother, don't worry.

964
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,510
Let me think about it.

965
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,660
It's all because of Xie Wei and Jiang Xuening.

966
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,230
If they did not protect Xue Dingfei in Tongzhou,

967
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,760
this wouldn't have happened.

968
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,980
What did you say?

969
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,430
You mean...

970
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,230
Jiang Xuening...

971
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,030
also went to Tongzhou?

972
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,590
Yes.

973
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,900
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

974
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,090
Father didn't want to offend Xie Wei,

975
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,140
so he did it as a favor to him.

976
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,620
As a lady from a noble family,

977
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,510
she's always hanging out with the rebels.

978
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,230
Who knows what happened along the way?

979
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,820
Mother.

980
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,130
Mother, don't worry.

981
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,360
We don't know if Noble Consort Qin is carrying a boy or a girl.

982
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,340
His Highness, Lord Linzi is most likely

983
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
still going to take up that position.

984
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,220
As long as I

985
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,450
become the consort of Lord Linzi,

986
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,390
no one can take away

987
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,610
the power of my Xue family.

988
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,970
I've got my people in Huangzhou.

989
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,110
They're all set for now.

990
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,610
You don't have to worry too much.

991
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,870
It's just that it's really cold in the North.

992
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,730
His Lordship's old injuries were on the verge of relapsing.

993
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,810
Fortunately, he's fine now.

994
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,690
Yan Lin's nature is free-spirited.

995
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,370
Although Huangzhou is not as prosperous as the capital,

996
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,350
it doesn't seem so bad

997
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,380
as long as he gets to roam freely.

998
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:33,930
What about you?

999
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,480
Do you also want to leave the capital,

1000
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,470
and search for your freedom?

1001
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,520
I grew up in the countryside.

1002
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,770
I used to yearn for the prosperity of the capital.

1003
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,300
But after coming here,

1004
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,130
I found out that underneath all the glamour, there was havoc.

1005
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,560
Freedom?

1006
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,410
I dare not ask for anything more.

1007
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,950
Perhaps,

1008
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,590
no one can escape

1009
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,710
the grip of fate.

1010
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,660
Looking at the letter,

1011
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,430
I can tell that

1012
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,950
it has been a while since it arrived.

1013
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,610
Yet, you are only showing it to me now.

1014
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,960
I don't think you stopped me outside the palace

1015
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,340
just for this.

1016
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,010
So, what is it that

1017
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,060
you wanted to tell me?

1018
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,840
Since you won't tell me,

1019
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,280
I'll take my leave.

1020
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,580
♫A dark night♫

1021
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,050
♫A flash of fireworks♫

1022
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,090
♫Lend me half a lucid dream♫

1023
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,170
♫I knew there's no right or wrong♫
