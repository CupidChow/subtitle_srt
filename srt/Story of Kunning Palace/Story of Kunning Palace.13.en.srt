189
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,520
Look.

190
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,810
Isn't he the one who was kicked out?

191
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,340
If you left without permission, that's running away.

192
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,560
It's fine to cause trouble in the mansion.

193
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,870
But you're even hanging out with people

194
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,920
-who are indecent and disreputable.
-Don’t move.

195
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,480
Aren't you afraid of 
ruining our family's reputation?

196
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Take her away now.

197
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,310
Don't embarrass yourself here anymore.

198
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,460
You Yue.

199
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,180
You Yue.

200
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,880
Who is she?

201
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,020
Are you sure?

202
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,130
Absolutely.

203
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,210
From Mr. Ren to the manager,

204
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,660
they all said she was taken away by You Yue.

205
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,190
Mr. Ren was even beaten up.

206
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,600
This is bad.

207
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,400
According to You Yue's personality,

208
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,700
a mountain can be made out of a molehill.

209
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,230
Fangyin must have been punished harshly by her.

210
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,549
I wonder how bad a state she's in.

211
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,620
I spoke too much.

212
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,410
There are many people in the capital 
who toy with illegitimate daughters.

213
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,110
Although it's ugly if outsiders hear about it,

214
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,900
it's still their family matter.

215
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,580
If you interfere,

216
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,260
I'm afraid you'll just bring trouble upon yourself.

217
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,070
I know that.

218
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,870
But if it weren't for me,

219
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,070
Fangyin wouldn't be in such a situation.

220
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,960
I have to find a way

221
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,230
to save her.

222
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,280
How about

223
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,000
we ask Master to talk to Earl of You?

224
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,960
The You family is in a mess.

225
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,690
He’ll do Master a favor.

226
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,210
For Earl of You

227
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,880
to allow Fangyin to act like she does all this time,

228
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,440
he must be one of the same.

229
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,110
I need to find a way to save her

230
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,790
once and for all.

231
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,270
By the way,

232
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,520
I remember that 
when I was packing the jewelry last time,

233
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,660
I had a pair of gold hairpins worth two taels.

234
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,770
Yes.

235
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,460
Master gave it to you on your birthday two years ago.

236
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,480
Didn't you say that

237
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,000
you didn't want to wear them 
because they were too ostentatious?

238
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,390
Go find them.

239
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,000
This time, we'll rely on them to save Fangyin.

240
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,790
[Mansion of Earl of You]

241
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,380
Jiang Xuening.

242
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,090
What's wrong with you again?

243
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,150
Why are you looking for me?

244
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,950
We are classmates.

245
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,180
Why do we have to fight whenever we meet?

246
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,190
Is Fangyin at home?

247
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,590
Why don't you call her out?

248
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,880
You came at the wrong time.

249
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,000
She went out to pray.

Tang.

251
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,890
This hairpin

252
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,500
is worth about two taels.

253
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,340
What are you scheming this time?

254
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,140
In the past,

255
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,690
we had some misunderstandings.

256
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,940
Today, I'm giving you a small gift 
to express my sincerity.

257
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,050
Fangyin.

258
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,830
About what happened yesterday,

259
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,600
I hope you'll just forget about it.

260
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,030
Not to mention talking about it at the palace.

261
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,660
As you know,

262
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,580
my family situation is complicated.

263
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,150
I'm not like you.

264
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,020
If my parents know about this,

265
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,280
I'm afraid...

266
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,120
Thank you, You Yue.

267
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,800
Go have fun.

268
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,480
Thank you, boss.

269
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,620
Candied hawthorns!

270
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,930
Is there anything better?

271
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,050
It's here. I think it's good.

272
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,960
[Julai Inn]

273
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,450
Manager, get me some food.

274
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,410
Okay.

275
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,460
He Erlang

276
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,270
became famous after a battle

277
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,440
and became the great hero

278
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,120
-praised by everyone all over the country.
-Your usual?

279
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,690
Okay, coming right up.

280
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,530
Great.

281
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,170
At this very time,

282
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,220
another lawsuit came to him.

283
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,510
-If you want to know what happens next...
-Mr. Ren.

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,280
-listen to the breakdown next time.
-Miss Tang.

285
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,760
Finished already?

286
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,240
What happens next?

287
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes, I...

288
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,750
Tell us more.

289
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,520
Miss.

290
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,610
Miss Jiang

291
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,190
is never easy to deal with.

292
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,800
Why was she so meek today?

293
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,140
I know.

294
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,200
When did she get close to You Fangyin?

295
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,250
She even mentioned yesterday's matter.

296
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,990
What are they colluding on secretly?

297
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,170
That wretch You Fangyin

298
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,770
won't say anything no matter how hard she's hit.

299
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,280
I think there must be something fishy here.

300
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,700
If she weren't guilty, why would she do this?

301
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,390
I've asked the accountant's office to reconcile the accounts.

302
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,960
The mansion didn't lose any money.

303
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,810
How did You Fangyin get the hundreds of taels?

304
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,910
And Jiang Xuening

305
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,550
is a just a girl from the countryside.

306
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,160
Even if she gets an allowance from her family,

307
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,800
she wouldn't have been able

308
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,180
to give such an expensive gift.

309
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,440
Something's off.

310
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,310
Cui.

311
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,770
Go to yesterday's inn and ask around

312
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,300
-to find out what's going on.
-Okay.

313
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,980
They are all for me?

314
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,280
Didn't Miss Fangyin tell you everything?

315
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,280
We should work together

316
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,240
and make a fortune.

317
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,250
Of course it's real.

318
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,080
I see.

319
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,260
So Jiang Xuening's making private money

320
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,290
behind her family's back.

321
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,920
No wonder she spends money lavishly to send gifts.

322
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,930
No wonder everyone in the palace likes her.

323
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,880
Everyone indulges her.

324
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,760
It turns out that money can make the world go round.

325
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,060
Also, Third Young Lady is too much.

326
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,310
She recognized that the businessman Ren Weizhi

327
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,640
has a way to make money,

328
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,920
yet she didn't tell us.

329
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,760
Isn't she helping an outsider instead?

330
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,160
She's a wretch after all.

331
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,590
I underestimated her before.

332
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,670
When I was tricked by Jiang Xuening in the palace,

333
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,690
she was probably so happy.

334
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,370
Miss.

335
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,420
Why don’t we tell Master

336
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,790
to get Madam to marry that wretch off

337
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,200
to an old widow to vent your anger?

338
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,770
Idiot.

339
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,590
Is this the time to punish her?

340
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,480
Since the business is so profitable,

341
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,290
why can't I do it

342
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
when they can?

343
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,490
That's right.

344
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,220
But we don't have money.

345
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,130
In order to cover up

346
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,800
her business cooperation with Ren Weizhi,

347
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,410
Jiang Xuening was willing to spend so much money.

348
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,330
If something bigger happens,

349
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,020
she will give me the capital money.

350
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,510
You Yue, where are you taking me to?

351
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,370
You Yue.

352
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,170
What do you want me to do?

353
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,200
Third Young Lady.

354
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,570
You just stay obediently in the room.

355
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,090
When the time comes,

356
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,750
we'll call you back.

357
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,370
But...

358
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,330
Enough talking.

359
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,750
I'm giving you a chance to make amends.

360
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,210
If you do as I say later,

361
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,310
I won't make things difficult for you anymore.

362
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,160
Okay?

363
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,440
Third Young Lady.

364
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,380
Go in.

365
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,720
Don't worry.

366
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,590
I’ve taken care of the waiter.

367
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,740
When Ren Weizhi comes back,

368
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,410
I’ll ask him to bring some wine to the room.

369
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,550
An unmarried woman

370
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,720
with a strange man in a room together.

371
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,890
This is clearly lasciviousness.

372
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,390
Many people come and go in this inn.

373
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,220
It will spread throughout the city within a day.

374
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,030
Then, I'll go to Jiang Mansion

375
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,970
to accuse Jiang Xuening

376
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,110
of instigating a lady from our family to do such a scandalous thing.

377
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,080
In order to pacify the situation,

378
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,710
she'll become submissive to me.

379
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,270
You've come up with such a clever scheme with that brain of yours.

380
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,420
It seems that all the studying you did
in the palace was worth it.

381
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,210
Just thinking about Earl of You finding out about this

382
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,810
makes me happy.

383
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,090
Jiang Xuening?

384
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:29,630
Why...

385
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,550
Why are you here?

386
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,530
I'm here to watch your show, of course.

387
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,340
It's a large-scale show 
that's self-proclaimed to be ingenious.

388
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,770
It's a pity to miss it.

389
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,670
You set me up.

390
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,020
What exactly do you want?

391
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,600
I should be asking you that.

392
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,480
Fangyin and you are sisters after all.

393
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,220
I didn't expect you to do such a despicable thing.

394
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,130
Not only did you abuse your sibling,

395
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,620
but you also want to ruin her reputation.

396
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,940
You are really vicious.

397
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,320
Miss You.

398
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,600
Why did you hit me?

399
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,200
I...

400
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,280
You're nuts.

401
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,810
Who are you putting up an act for?

402
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,940
Fine.

403
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,320
I'll really beat you up today.

404
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,480
What can you do to me?

405
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,020
Did you hit Miss Jiang?

406
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,670
How dare you!

407
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,420
Who allowed you to talk to me like this?

408
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,440
Say it again.

409
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,010
It's fine that you always bully and insult me,

410
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
but Miss Jiang is a good person.

411
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,140
I won't allow you to bully her.

412
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,750
You Fangyin!

413
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,750
Are you crazy?

414
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:26,740
Miss!

415
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,160
Miss!

416
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,850
Miss, wait for me!

417
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:34,770
Are you crazy?

418
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,430
Miss.

419
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,320
Miss, aren't we going up to stop her?

420
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,010
No.

421
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,810
Not only should You Yue be punished today...

422
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,430
Stop right there!

423
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,110
But also, more importantly,

424
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,410
Fangyin should come to the realization by herself

425
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,030
to stand up for herself.

426
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,800
That's why you pretended to be hit

427
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,600
to antagonize Miss Fangyin.

428
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,350
This is crazy.

429
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,110
You brat.

430
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,570
How dare you hit me? Do you want to die?

431
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,560
So what if I'm hitting you?

432
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,460
Miss.

433
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,900
Don't you dare bully Miss Jiang again, or else...

434
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,860
Miss.

435
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,550
How's a lady acting like this?

436
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,069
Miss Jiang!

437
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,349
Third Young Lady, stop hitting Second Young Lady!

438
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,579
You're rebelling.

439
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,300
I think you even forgot which family you come from

440
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,140
and what your own name is.

441
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,670
And you, Jiang Xuening.

442
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,660
I didn't know

443
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
you are such

444
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,640
a despicable and shameless person.

445
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,930
Miss You Yue.

446
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,550
You're slinging mud at me.

447
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,550
We're classmates after all.

448
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,650
Today, I was just passing by to take a break.

449
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,010
Who knew I would run into You Fangyin

450
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,040
hurting others?

451
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,480
-Jiang Xuening.
-Miss, are you alright?

452
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,690
What did you say?

453
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,240
You are the legitimate daughter,

454
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,370
while she's a concubine's daughter.

455
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,700
You are older

456
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,880
than her.

457
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,680
It's natural for the legitimate older sister

458
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,560
to teach her illegitimate younger sister a lesson.

459
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,730
In broad daylight,

460
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,010
how dare she be so insolent?

461
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,530
Not only did she offend you,

462
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,180
but she also almost killed you.

463
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,570
Is there no justice?

464
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,900
Everyone, am I right?

465
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,470
That's right.

466
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,410
That makes sense.

467
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,000
Why couldn't she talk things out nicely?

468
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,690
Why must she hit her?

469
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,520
That's right.

470
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,160
It's inappropriate.

471
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,020
Don't worry.

472
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,220
Miss Jiang has her own plan.

473
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,650
Exactly.

474
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,570
Why go to that extent? 
You're all just young women.

475
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,390
Fortunately, someone came out to seek justice.

476
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,380
You've suffered so much.

477
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,060
How can you let it go so easily?

478
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,190
Let's report her to the government.

479
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,380
Are you crazy?

480
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,710
Look.

481
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,800
She's already all confused.

482
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,750
If such an ungrateful person

483
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,770
isn't punished by law,

484
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,800
all the women in the capital might follow suit.

485
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,680
In the future,

486
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,420
who would abide by the hierarchy and ethical codes?

487
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,520
She has to be locked up for a few months

488
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,180
-so that she'll learn her lesson.
-Yes.

489
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:38,850
Yes.

490
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,480
You must report it to the government.

491
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,210
That's right.

492
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,550
If she reports it to the government, 
it will become a big deal.

493
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,650
Who wants to report to the government?

494
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,360
Why are the Xingwu Guards here?

495
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,960
Why is it the Xingwu Guards 
that have come?

496
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,720
Xingwu Guards?

497
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,170
How did this matter blow up?

498
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:56,980
What's going on?

499
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,550
Why are all the Xingwu Guards here?

500
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,130
-I don’t know.
-They don't go by the rules.

501
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,580
They are ruthless.

502
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,460
I'm afraid she'll be in trouble.

503
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,670
Exactly.

504
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,150
Trust me.

505
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,040
I'm afraid this girl will be in trouble.

506
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,850
What a huge scene.

507
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,080
Say something!

508
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,950
Didn't you hear what Sir said?

509
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,140
Who wants to report to the government?

510
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,050
It's her.

511
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,710
Don't talk nonsense.

512
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,730
You were so loud just now.

513
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,850
Even the deaf heard you.

514
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:25,660
Sir.

515
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
It's just a trivial matter.

516
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,860
I don't have to report it to the government.

517
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,650
How is this a trivial matter?

518
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,080
Just now, you were

519
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,800
screaming at the top of your lungs and asking for help.

520
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,710
Is what she said true?

521
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,140
Sir, I ask for your discretion.

522
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,090
The one who tried to hit me 
is actually the illegitimate daughter of my family.

523
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,680
But she didn't manage to hit me.

524
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,470
When I...

525
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,830
When I go back home, 
I'll ask my father to punish her.

526
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,250
There's no need to pursue it.

527
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,260
No way.

528
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,500
A country has its laws and a family has its rules.

529
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,460
If You Fangyin commits a crime in your mansion,

530
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,510
it's none of other people's business.

531
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,410
But if she commits a crime outside,

532
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,250
it has to be handled by the law.

533
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,180
This could be dismissed as just a fight.

534
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,150
But to put it bluntly,

535
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,740
it was attempted murder.

536
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,070
How is this not a serious matter?

537
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,350
What's wrong with you?

538
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,370
She said she'd let it go.

539
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,260
Why are you yelling?

540
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,460
Why are you yelling?

541
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,830
Recently,

542
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,100
rebels have been wreaking havoc in the capital.

543
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,870
His Majesty has issued an order

544
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,100
not to stir up trouble.

545
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,150
Are you

546
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,320
breaking the law on purpose?

547
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,810
Or are you colluding with the rebels?

548
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:30,680
Guards.

549
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,680
Detain them both and bring them back to prison

550
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
to wait for their trial.

551
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:35,950
Yes.

552
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,050
Cui.

553
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,090
Miss, don't be afraid.

554
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,580
I'll go find Master and Madam to save you.

555
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,140
Cui!

556
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,060
-Let’s go.
-Cui!

557
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,680
Let go of me!

558
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,430
Let go of me!

559
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,030
-Miss! 
-I don't want to go!

560
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,010
-Miss!
-I’m the princess' study partner.

561
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,380
I'm the legitimate daughter of the Earl of You.

562
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,530
How can you do this to me?

563
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,020
Let go of me!

564
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,290
-Miss!
-Let go of me!

565
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:08,940
Let go of me!

566
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,500
Where are you taking me?

567
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,260
Let me go!

568
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,730
I didn't do anything.

569
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,340
I didn't do anything.

570
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,710
Let go of me!

571
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,250
Let me go!

572
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,570
Let me go!

573
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,830
Do you know who I am?

574
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,890
How dare you treat me like this?

575
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,330
I don't care who you are. Get in.

576
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,690
Get in!

577
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,440
Let me out!

578
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:40,980
Go!

579
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,600
Why did you lock me up?

580
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,160
-What are you yelling for? Stay here obediently!
-Let me out!

581
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,130
I didn't do anything.

582
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,720
I really didn't do anything.

583
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,420
I really didn't do anything.

584
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,550
Look!

585
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,740
Someone new has joined us.

586
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,020
It's a woman.

587
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,440
A woman?

588
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,530
A woman's here.

589
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,720
What happened?

590
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,550
She's quite pretty.

591
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,130
Who knows what she did?

592
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,040
Get in.

593
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,880
Miss Jiang?

594
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,250
Miss Jiang.

595
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,220
Did you

596
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,990
plan all this?

597
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,600
Miss.

598
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,640
The men here

599
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,130
are my close friends.

600
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,400
Take your time to talk.

601
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,580
I’ll wait outside.

602
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,880
Miss Jiang.

603
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,350
What happened

604
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,230
today?

605
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,970
Just now,

606
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,030
you acted quite well in the inn.

607
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,690
You told me

608
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,960
to commit to the act.

609
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,340
But

610
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,710
why are you helping them?

611
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,230
I'm not just helping them,

612
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,960
but also ourselves.

613
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,980
Everything that happened today

614
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,940
was to save you.

615
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,220
Fangyin.

616
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,570
The Mansion of Earl of You is a wolf’s den.

617
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,040
No one treats you well.

618
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,040
I only have one question.

619
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,310
If you lose the title as the daughter of the Mansion of Earl of You,

620
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
you'll have to stay in this prison for a long time.

621
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,380
Are you willing?

622
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,130
There's nothing to be upset about.

623
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,380
Miss Jiang.

624
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,850
If it weren’t for you,

625
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,520
I would probably have died in that mansion.

626
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,940
I don’t want any title.

627
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,440
I'm willing to live here forever

628
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,390
and never go back.

629
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,060
With your words,

630
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,800
I know what I should do.

631
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,480
Stay here and recuperate.

632
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,500
If you need anything,

633
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,940
feel free to ask Mr. Zhou.

634
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,210
I'll take care of the rest.

635
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,500
But...

636
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,240
But my sister won't let it go.

637
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,820
She will definitely take revenge on you.

638
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,220
And about the salt well...

639
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:00,920
Well...

640
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:01,900
Silly girl.

641
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,880
You don't even trust me?

642
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,480
You Yue won't give up easily?

643
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,200
Great.

644
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,330
I still want her to atone for

645
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,950
all the abuse she's done to you.

646
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,370
Miss.

647
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,700
The You family

648
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,120
is still that of an Earl's.

649
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,420
What should we do

650
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,490
with the two in the prison?

651
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,810
You Fangyin is on my side.

652
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,120
You can deal with her as you deem fit.

653
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,090
As for the other one,

654
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,540
she's inhumane, stupid and vicious.

655
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,930
If she isn't tamed,

656
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,480
she'd definitely do immoral things again.

657
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,490
It's true that the You family has lost power.

658
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,360
Have you heard of the saying 
that even a bad person has their value?

659
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,140
He favors his legitimate daughter.

660
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,060
He wouldn't bear to see her suffer.

661
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,690
Right, Mr. Zhou?

662
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:43,590
Yes.

663
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,340
[Xingwu Guards]

664
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,440
I'm extremely grateful

665
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,430
that you're willing to see me.

666
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,060
Sir.

667
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,020
Here are 3,000 taels worth of silver banknotes.

668
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,000
I hope you'd show me some mercy

669
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,480
[Earl of You]

670
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,050
and let my daughter out.

671
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,270
Is this necessary?

672
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,180
If your daughter

673
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,730
has nothing to do with provoking trouble,

674
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,820
nothing will happen to her.

675
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,080
She'll be sent home after the trial.

676
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,630
At most, it'll take seven to eight days.

677
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,090
Seven to eight days?

678
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:17,890
This…

679
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,730
Earl of You, do you really think 
the Xingwu Guards' government office

680
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,690
is a place you can just come and go freely?

681
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,040
We will investigate thoroughly to find out

682
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,040
if your daughter is related to the rebels.

683
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,230
We have to follow the law.

684
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,450
I have no choice.

685
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,680
-You should go back.
-This…

686
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,480
No, no, no.

687
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:44,930
This...

688
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,320
The rebels?

689
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,850
My daughter would never

690
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,300
have any connections with the rebels.

691
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,040
Sir.

692
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,480
Did you get it wrong?

693
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,570
This...

694
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,270
Sir.

695
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,900
This is a total of

696
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,710
13,000 taels.

697
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,300
This is the best I can do.

698
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,430
Since my daughter was born,

699
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,680
she has never suffered any hardships.

700
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,220
I've been spoiling her at home.

701
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,100
Even if she acts stupid sometimes,

702
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,440
it doesn't hinder others.

703
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,690
Mr. Zhou.

704
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,310
Please have mercy

705
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,500
and make an exception.

706
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,700
You love your daughter so much.

707
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,790
I feel sorry for you.

708
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:25,960
How about this?

709
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,900
I'll send someone

710
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,640
to interrogate her overnight.

711
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,790
Come and pick her up tomorrow morning.

712
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,190
Sir, thank you.

713
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,230
Earl of You.

714
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,350
This case still needs to be accounted for.

715
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,140
If I let Miss You Yue go,

716
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,060
then the other one...

717
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,010
As long as it doesn’t get in the way of my family,

718
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,390
you can deal with that useless You Fangyin

719
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,750
however you like.

720
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,440
I promise to never interfere.

721
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,510
That's good to hear.

722
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,000
She's here?

723
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,210
Who?

724
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,960
Are you referring to Miss Jiang?

725
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,020
She's not here.

726
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,460
I didn't even catch a glimpse of her.

727
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,250
Then why did you come in?

728
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,220
Me?

729
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,660
I came to change your hand-warming stove for you.

730
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,370
Go find out

731
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,180
what she has been doing

732
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,450
for the past few days.

733
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,470
Yes.

734
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,520
I only heard that the plum blossom flower 
has five petals.

735
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,370
You carved so many petals.

736
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,580
It's quite unique.

737
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,580
Don't carve when you have a restless heart.

738
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,400
What a waste of good wood.

739
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,610
Go out.

740
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,860
Have some sunflower seeds.

741
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,540
Miss.

742
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,410
This is a total of 10,000 taels.

743
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,370
Please count them.

744
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,050
No need.

745
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,150
You act prudently.

746
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,350
Of course I can rest assured.

747
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,720
Today, someone from the You family

748
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,500
came to take You Yue back.

749
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,850
But not a word was mentioned of You Fangyin.

750
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,950
They've spent so much money to get You Yue out.

751
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,130
They wouldn't spend any more money on bribes.

752
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,330
That's why I said that Fangyin has a hard life.

753
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,250
I'll have to trouble you

754
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,890
to take care of the Yan family.

755
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,960
Although it can't solve all the problems,

756
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,910
at least

757
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,920
it's worth it to reduce the suffering

758
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,690
of the Yan family.

759
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,290
Marquis of Yan is not feeling well.

760
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,690
Please take good care of him.

761
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,680
Yes.

762
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,530
For this matter,

763
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,050
it's all thanks to your help.

764
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:13,730
This is for you.

765
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,520
This...

766
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,530
It's no big deal.

767
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,790
I told you

768
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,400
I'm a scoundrel.

769
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,620
As the saying goes, scoundrels cooperate for profit.

770
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,760
If you work for me,

771
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,890
I'll reward you accordingly.

772
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,990
Just take it.

773
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,510
Okay.

774
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,780
As for the rest,

775
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,620
please give these to Fangyin for me.

776
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,950
Let her stay there for a few more days.

777
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,410
If she needs to go out to handle matters for me,

778
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,230
let her.

779
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,880
Don't worry.

780
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,120
I'll take good care of You Fangyin for sure.

781
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,840
However,

782
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,120
you did so much

783
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,150
for the Yan family.

784
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,740
How about I help you send a message to the Royal Highness?

785
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,670
No need.

786
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,820
Don't say a word.

787
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,740
Don't let him know it's my idea.

788
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,310
I'm doing all this

789
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,060
because I owe him.

790
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,840
I don't want

791
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,340
anything else.

792
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,120
-You...
-Yue!

793
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,500
Xingwu Guards are backed by 
the emperor and Duke of Xue.

794
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,190
They are ruthless.

795
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,290
Jiang Boyou

796
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,860
is also a minister with real power.

797
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,400
Our You family doesn't have much.

798
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,090
It's good enough that we can 
hold onto this nominal title

799
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,650
passed down by our ancestors.

800
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,320
Do you want our whole family

801
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,620
to perish with you?

802
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,460
-I’ll kill you!
-Master! Stop!

803
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,970
Stop, Master!

804
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,010
Yue still has to go to the palace 
as a study partner.

805
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,400
My Lady.

806
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,180
This matter involves the Xingwu Guards.

807
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,540
And the palace is a place 
where one can easily get into trouble.

808
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,330
One wrong step

809
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,960
will lead to a disaster, My Lady.

810
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,580
Besides,

811
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,290
she got herself into such trouble.

812
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,110
Are you not ashamed to go to the palace?

813
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,260
No matter how much of a mess

814
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,330
my family's situation is,

815
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,690
I can't afford to compromise my dignity.

816
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,010
Listen.

817
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,180
From now on,

818
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,610
you'll just stay obediently

819
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,960
in the mansion.

820
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,510
Don't you dare go out,

821
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,650
or I'll break your leg.

822
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,500
Master! Master!

823
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,210
Father!

824
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,450
Father!

825
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,370
[Zhou Mansion]

826
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:07,970
You...

827
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,180
Mr. Xie?

828
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,930
Sir, what brings you here?

829
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,860
I found out about Xingwu Guards'

830
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,670
recent affairs.

831
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,030
Mr. Zhou, thank you

832
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,870
for taking care of my useless student.

833
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,950
No, Miss Jiang and I are just...

834
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,810
But

835
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,610
the prison is made up of 
a motley crowd after all.

836
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,570
As a woman,

837
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,700
It's inconvenient for her to frequent it often.

838
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,780
Mr. Zhou, please tell your men

839
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,980
to watch

840
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,220
their words.

841
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,740
Yes, don't worry.

842
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,990
I will

843
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,290
take care of it.

844
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,230
Let's go.

845
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,180
Where are we going?

846
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,300
I sneaked out.

847
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,590
The carriage is waiting for me.

848
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,280
Jian Shu will inform them.

849
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,500
How long has it been 
since you practiced the qin?

850
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,570
I'm sure you don't need me 
to teach you the logic of

851
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,660
achievement being founded on diligence 
and wasted upon recklessness.

852
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,960
Even so,

853
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,560
I didn't bring my qin with me.

854
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,700
Come to me if you need anything.

855
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,040
Missy.

856
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:07,690
Here.

857
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,050
Miss Jiang gave this to me just now.

858
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,070
Keep it.

859
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:11,520
This...

860
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:13,760
Sir.

861
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,460
Before, you kept 3000 taels.

862
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,630
If Miss Jiang finds out...

863
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,700
Who says she doesn't know?

864
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,370
Some things are just not said out loud.

865
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,540
It doesn't matter.

866
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,010
Do you realize what you did wrong?

867
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:32,990
Yes.

868
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,200
I'm earning money 
from the salt wells and the You family

869
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,380
to help Yan Lin.

870
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,920
I should have told you this.

871
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,040
But you didn't tell me about

872
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,180
Marquis of Yan's assassination either.

873
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,360
It was urgent that night.

874
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,440
What about the next day?

875
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,210
You entered the palace early in the morning.

876
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,050
You had the time to scold me right to my face,

877
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,410
yet you didn't have the time to mention 
such an important matter?

878
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,810
Sir.

879
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,900
We're in the same boat now.

880
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,690
We share weal and woe.

881
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,940
If you hide everything,

882
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,030
how can I cooperate with you?

883
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,630
The Xue family

884
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,280
has been provoking His Majesty quite a bit.

885
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,520
Before I left the palace this time,

886
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,240
His Majesty summoned me to go probe.

887
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,860
If I weren't smart,

888
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,740
you would have been suspected 
by His Majesty already.

889
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,020
How can you say I was wrong

890
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,070
when you were the one at fault?

891
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:14,830
Forget it.

892
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,180
Why should I be angry with a little girl?

893
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,270
Let's share information

894
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,740
on a quid pro quo basis.

895
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,690
What happened recently...

896
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,210
See?

897
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,090
Everything has its conqueror.

898
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,540
A ruthless person will eventually suffer
at the hands of someone even more ruthless.

899
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,890
To think the teacher was 
so worried about her.

900
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:30,890
She has no conscience.

901
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:32,680
Enough.

902
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,630
Let's go.

903
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,810
Let's go.

904
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,700
This is strange.

905
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,740
The rebels

906
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,250
clearly have all the letters.

907
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,950
Why did they only give half of them 
to the Xue family?

908
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,280
Their purpose

909
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,220
is to get rid of the Yan family 
with the help of the court.

910
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,110
Isn't it better to succeed in one fell swoop?

911
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,290
I also find it strange.

912
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,540
They want to exterminate the Yan family,

913
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,730
yet they haven't taken any action.

914
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,750
Maybe

915
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,420
they're waiting for a chance.

916
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,200
Also,

917
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,670
on the night Marquis of Yan was assassinated,

918
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,690
he was on his way back to the capital 
from Tongzhou.

919
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,890
The Xue family planted someone in the barracks

920
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,870
so they found out about it.

921
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,980
It's normal to design the ambush 
midway of the journey.

922
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,750
But how did the rebels

923
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,250
know about this?

924
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,040
How could they have had the time 
to poison the arrow?

925
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,780
Unless...

926
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:19,639
Unless

927
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,040
there were already rebels lurking

928
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,360
in Tongzhou's barracks.

929
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,850
This is bad.

930
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,790
The Xue family is struggling 
to find substantial evidence

931
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,190
to prove the Yan family's rebellion.

932
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,900
If something goes wrong in the barracks,

933
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,679
the Yan family will never be able 
to clear their name.

934
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,350
I have a lead with this matter.

935
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,800
After the holiday,

936
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,480
go back to school with a peace of mind.

937
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:36,610
As for the rest,

938
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,460
I'll handle it.

939
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,489
Also,

940
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,040
about your salt well business,

941
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,780
I'll ask Lyu Xian to assist You Fangyin.

942
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,780
With him around,

943
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,389
nothing should go wrong.

944
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,170
Thank you for your help.

945
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:47,840
Also,

946
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,250
after you enter the palace,

947
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,210
you must be cautious of 
the Empress Dowager and the Xue family.

948
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,130
The maid of the Office of Punishment is dead.

949
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,110
Next,

950
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,280
they will definitely

951
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,370
target you.

952
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,030
Sir, don't worry.

953
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,150
I have plenty of ways

954
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,180
to deal with them.

955
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,890
[Jiang Mansion]

956
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,450
Sister, to what do I

957
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,890
owe the pleasure?

958
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,560
Nothing.

959
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,840
Just to drink some tea and chat.

960
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,860
Can't I?

961
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,050
Then what do you want to talk about?

962
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,120
This handkerchief

963
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,750
is made according to 
the Jiang family's unique style.

964
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,030
I didn't lose mine

965
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,450
but someone picked up a handkerchief 
that looks exactly the same.

966
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,660
Isn't it a coincidence?

967
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,740
That's true.

968
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,950
What a coincidence.

969
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,110
But that man

970
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,950
kept the handkerchief by his side

971
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,210
at all times.

972
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,300
It's precious to him.

973
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,690
Tell me.

974
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,260
Why is it so?

975
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,160
Do you know who

976
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,900
has your handkerchief?

977
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,000
I think so.

978
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,820
You do?

979
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,080
I saw him from afar

980
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,810
at the Xunyuan Poetry Club 
three months ago.

981
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,350
I asked around

982
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,930
and found out who he is.

983
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,200
Why didn't you tell me?

984
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,550
What can I say?

985
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,530
We just met briefly once.

986
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,960
We're not even acquainted.

987
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,330
Can I

988
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,910
use this to cling onto him?

989
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,840
It turns out that Jiang Xuehui 
knew Shen Jie’s identity.

990
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,630
That means she knew

991
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,970
that I took her place on purpose the last time,

992
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,610
but she didn't expose me

993
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,930
and even gave up the empress position.

994
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,740
So,

995
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,940
you clearly knew everything,

996
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,860
including the fact that 
I was stealing what's yours.

997
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,760
But you never said a word,

998
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,010
threw a tantrum or tried to steal it back.

999
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,680
You even made me think

1000
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,610
that you knew nothing.

1001
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,580
But it turns out

1002
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,640
that you were being a good sister

1003
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,280
and giving way to me all this time.

1004
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,270
Not quite.

1005
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,270
I have to repay you

1006
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,380
for what I owe you eventually.

1007
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,630
In this way,

1008
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,720
I can feel better.

1009
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,500
You feel better now.

1010
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:42,870
But what about me?

1011
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,190
You never speak up

1012
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,000
or fight for things.

1013
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,930
You think you can bear the humiliation

1014
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,100
and compromise.

1015
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,200
But what does that make me?

1016
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,700
You are a virtuous and noble older sister,

1017
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,210
while

1018
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,530
I'm relegated to being the one

1019
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,170
who's ignorant, aggressive, 
and loves to fight.

1020
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,700
I didn't think that much.

1021
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,840
It's none of my business 
how you do things.

1022
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,600
But I don't need you to 
pay me back in this way.

1023
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,520
The person who picked up the handkerchief 
has feelings for you.

1024
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,490
He still can't forget you.

1025
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,380
I'll ask Tang to send him a letter

1026
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,920
and ask him to go to Baiguo Temple.

1027
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,570
It's up to you whether you want to

1028
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,590
go and meet him or not.

1029
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,880
Why are you telling me this?

1030
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,970
I'm not a good person,

1031
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,110
but I have to confirm your feelings first.

1032
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,740
If you have feelings for him,

1033
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,170
then what I'm going to do next

1034
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,490
doesn't qualify as using you.

1035
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,370
Your Highness.

1036
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,350
We've been waiting for 
more than an hour.

1037
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,470
Miss Jiang

1038
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,060
said she could find the person 
you want to see.

1039
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,160
Could that be a lie?

1040
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,950
And how did she know about this?

1041
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,390
Zhiyi must have told her.

1042
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,340
It's fine.

1043
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,230
We're already here.

1044
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:01,940
Let's wait a bit longer.

1045
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,620
Okay.

1046
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,810
Wait for me here.

1047
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:32,690
Remember.

1048
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,640
Don't talk nonsense when you go back.

1049
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,300
I, Jiang Xuehui,

1050
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,550
pray to Buddha.

1051
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,070
May my parents

1052
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,160
be healthy.

1053
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,550
May my sister, Xuening,

1054
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,030
be safe and sound in the palace.

1055
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,250
Buddha.

1056
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,220
I, Shen Jie,

1057
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,220
am afraid that I've been disrespectful 
by being willful.

1058
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,590
But I also do good deeds

1059
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,540
and I'm morally upright.

1060
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,930
Buddha,

1061
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,060
please bless me

1062
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,550
so that I can gradually get closer to

1063
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,590
the person I yearn for

1064
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,510
and get what I want.

1065
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,500
He's smashing his head on the floor.

1066
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,270
Look.

1067
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,430
Mr. Shen.

1068
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,330
This place is for praying for peace,

1069
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,450
and not those matters.

1071
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,630

1072
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,210
living a good life.

1073
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,220
What are you hiding it for?

1074
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,250
I saw it already.

1075
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,190
Excuse me.

1076
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,060
Who are you?

I am

00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,770
You're Mr. Lyu?

1080
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,270
Mr. Zhou told me

1081
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,520
you'll be here to teach me business.

1082
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,470
Please have a seat.

1083
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,790
They say

1084
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,690
that money can make the world go round.

1085
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,840
Your place here seems

1086
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,840
more comfortable than my mansion.

1087
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,590
You must have earned a lot

1088
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,110
from the raw silk business.

1089
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:41,780
Tell me.

1090
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,540
What's

1091
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,580
the progress of your discussion 
with Ren Weizhi?

1092
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,940
We’ve signed the contract.

1093
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,410
How much did you invest?

1094
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,830
1,000 taels in cash.

1095
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,120
Don't tell me

1096
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,150
you paid him all at once?

1097
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,140
My goodness.

1098
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,500
Whether the bamboo salt well

1099
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,240
will be a success or failure 
is still uncertain.

1100
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,180
You... you should have paid him in instalments 
according to the work progress.

1101
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,590
Aren't you afraid 
he'll run away with the money?

1102
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,710
This won't do.

1103
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:08,950
I have to go

1104
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,430

[Julai Inn]

1108
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,900

aren't you going to 
check out the results?

00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,330
Jiang has been out for four hours

1114
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,240
and still hasn't returned home.

1115
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,540
They must have fallen in love.

1116
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,900
There's nothing else to see.

1117
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,300
Let's go check out the crispy candy.

1118
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,870
Her Highness likes these new things.

1119
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,130
I'll bring some to her tomorrow.

1120
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:35,710
Okay.

1121
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,300
Mother, I want to buy it.

1122
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,350
There are more ahead.

1123
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:40,770
Zhang Zhe?

1124
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,240
Lian.

1125
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:46,890
Go buy the crispy candy.

1126
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,620
I'll go over there and have a look. 
I'll see you back at the mansion.

1127
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,350
Miss!

1128
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,390
It can fit a little rope.

1129
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,030
Mr. Zhang, look.

1130
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,730
What happened?

1131
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,030
They're new employees.

1132
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,360
These young men

1133
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,830
weren't careful when they were cleaning...

1134
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,540
Can I help you with anything?

1135
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,820
-and cracked the mouth of this bottle.
-I’m just looking around.

1136
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,780
Mr. Zhang, I have to trouble you again.

1137
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,890
It's no trouble.

1138
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,380
It's just that this white jade is delicate

1139
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,540
and very fragile.

1140
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,260
I don't know how confident I am 
in restoring this.

1141
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:13,900
Just try your best.

1142
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,270
Even if it can't be fixed,

1143
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,470
I'll still pay you

1144
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,940
the restoration fees.

1145
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,030
♫We made a promise♫

1146
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,420
♫Yet we are only left with our memory♫

1147
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,880
♫Flowers bloom in the street♫

1148
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,140
♫Without you♫

1149
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,520
♫Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winter♫

1150
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,290
♫Keep the memories slowly♫

1151
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:44,460
Mr. Zhang.

1152
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,520
What a coincidence.

1153
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:50,060
♫I've forgotten about the four seasons without you by my side♫

1154
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,100
♫Wind blows gently♫

1155
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,720
Miss Jiang.

1156
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,210
Are you here to look at antiques too?

1157
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,520
♫The fallen flowers bloom in my heart♫

1158
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:56,960
Then,

1159
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:57,950
help yourself.

1160
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,300
I only knew that you're good at solving cases.

1161
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,830
I didn't expect you to 
know how to restore antiques.

1162
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,800
♫Your whisper under the moonlight sounds beautiful♫

1163
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:03,800
That's just right.

1164
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,560
I've dabbled a little in this.

1165
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,690
I wonder if I can help you.

1166
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:08,580
You know how to do this too?

1167
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,140
♫Getting closer gently♫

1168
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,140
I'm not very skilled.

1169
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,310
But it should be enough

1170
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,180
to assist you.

1171
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,450
♫The season stays in dreamland♫

1172
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,230
Sir, please sit down.

1173
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,920
♫The snow is very light♫

1174
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:28,940
♫It doesn't stop even after filling all the cracks in the eaves♫

1175
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,310
♫You left in a hurry, leaving traces in the snow♫

1176
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,300
♫They're about to be erased now♫

1177
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:45,540
♫Disrupting my expectations♫

1178
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,490
♫We made a promise♫

1179

♫Watching the clouds wait anxiously for winter♫
