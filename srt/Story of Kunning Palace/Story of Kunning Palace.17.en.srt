I’m afraid

114
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,660
they will find some unfavorable evidence.

115
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,460
They have to be capable enough to do that.

116
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,250
The Xue family thinks they are smart.

117
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,540
But they don't know

118
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,960
they are already in the trap.

131
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,500

were stubborn and went.

137
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,170
But at least we can still say

And this incident

142
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,600
has nothing to do with us.

143
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,160
Then we won't get involved.

144
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,940

145
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,650
the Jiang family can be well on our own now.

146
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,670
But we also failed to be loyal to Marquis Yan

147
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,750
and their kindness towards us.

148
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,440
My Lord,

149
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,420
I know.

150
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,970
What I'm going to say next

151
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,090
may not be pleasant to hear.

152
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,200
Maybe you will think

153
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,360
I'm afraid of death and am heartless.

154
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,100
But I still have to say it.

155
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,310
I have to remind you.

156
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,660
Our Jiang family

157
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,930

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,450
We can't withstand any hardships.

161
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,160
In the past,

162
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,220
you have secretly helped the Yan family.

163
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,180
That’s fine.

164
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,390
But now,

165
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,870
if you step out and show your position,

166
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,530
in the future,

167
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,090
someone with evil intentions

168
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,620
might use it to

169
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,640
spread gossip.

170
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,410
I’m not afraid of these.

171
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,790
My Lord.

172
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,740
I believe you know

173
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,380
what I just said better than I do.

174
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,660
You know

175
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,530
how to assess the situation.

176
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,430
Otherwise,

177
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,390
you wouldn’t have been stopped by me.

Things have been settled.

180
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,530

182
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,180
we don't want wealth or glory,

184
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,680
at least ask for

185

the safety of our family.

186

Uncle,

187
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,090
you said the Yan family was disloyal.

188

But what happened?

Tongzhou has been peaceful.

190
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,720
They couldn't find any evidence in Yan Mansion too.

191
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:40,440

192
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,270
How can I

193
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,660
explain to the officials?

194
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,810
Your Majesty,

195
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,350
I saw it with my own eyes.

196
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,350
in Yan Mansion's study,

197
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,060
there are great amounts of burnt marks.

198
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,240
The Yan family must have

199
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,800
took the chance to burn all the letters

200
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,560
to ashes

201
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,300
when I returned to the palace.

202
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,850
So,

203
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,250
please give the order

204
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,640
to allow me

205
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,160
to punish the father and son.

206
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,030
I'm sure

207
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,590
I will be able to get something on them.

208
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,800
Uncle, don't you understand?

209
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,950
These are all impeachments from the court

210
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,860
saying that your Xingwu Guards are using your power for personal gains

211
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,340
to frame the Yan family.

212
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,450
Some even said directly that

213
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,270
you wanted to assassinate them in prison.

214
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,970
At this critical moment,

215
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,070
you still want me to issue a decree?

216
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,000
Do you want me to become the talk of the town?

217
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,420
Anyway,

218
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,470
find the evidence as soon as possible.

219
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,500
Otherwise, even if the Yan family disobeyed the edict,

220
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,310
I will have to punish you for your wrongdoings.

221
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,430
I understand.

222
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,960
Greetings, Duke.

223
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,520
Junior Preceptor Xie.

224
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,400
You are very busy.

225
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,120
I saw you gave the praise at Marquis Yongyi’s Mansion yesterday.

226
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,120
And today

227
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,600
you're in the palace.

228
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,830
In the past,

229
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,210
I didn’t know

230
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,420
how close you were

231
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,570
to the Yan family.

232
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,650
I teach Yan Lin to study.

233
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,690
Of course I am close to them.

234
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,340
When Mr. Xue's Coming-of-Age Ceremony comes by,

235
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,840
if you don't mind,

236
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,890
I can also give him my praises.

237
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,430
No need.

238
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,250
You're His Majesty's favourite minister.

239
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,160
I can't

240
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,500
ask you for this favor.

241
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,480
Please.

242
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,590
Due of Xue had a bone to pick with you

243
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,610
at the door just now?

244
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,800
Duke hasn't solved the case.

245
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,250
It's inevitable that he's in a bad mood.

246
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,810
I'm not worried.

247
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,670
You were there yesterday.

248
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,110
What do you think

249
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,270
about this matter?

250
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,080
My opinion doesn't matter.

251
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,210
As long as Duke can help Your Majesty get back your military power

252
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,610
and find the Yan Family seal,

253
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,540
it doesn’t matter what the process is like.

254
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,700
Why?

255
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,730
Didn't Duke come just now

256
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,360
to hand in the seal?

257
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,320
Yesterday, Marquis Yan was taken away.

258
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,240
Duke has been controlling Yan Mansion for so long.

259
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,400
It's fine that he can't find evidence for the crime,

260
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,230
but he even lost such an important seal?

261
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,430
You reminded me.

262
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,960
Since the Yan family is innocent,

263
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,480
yet Duke Xue insisted on arresting him,

264
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,360
my uncle might really be doing this

265
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,920
for his personal gains.

266
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,530
Your Majesty, you mean...

267
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,760
Duke is interested in military power?

268
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,130
Can't you see?

269
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,540
I found it strange

270
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,040
at Yan Mansion yesterday.

271
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,100
Something that even Your Majesty hasn't received yet,

272
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,940
the Duke reported it first.

273
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,400
This is too abnormal.

274
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,350
Besides,

275
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,130
why did he choose to attack yesterday

276
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,860
and controlled Yan Mansion for so long,

277
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,330
not allowing anyone to leave?

278
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,130
If Duke is really doing this for his own personal gains,

279
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,110
what he wants to do the most now

280
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,920
is to execute the Yan father and son in prison.

281
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,600
There will be no more evidence when they are dead.

282
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,100
No wonder he wanted me to send a decree today

283
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,240
to question the Yan father and son.

284
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,520
So this is his plan.

285
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,720
He wants me to be his knife.

286
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,240
Official Xie,

287
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,930
go to the prison for me.

288
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,280
Find out where the seal is.

289
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,390
I want to know

290
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,370
whether the Xue family is investigating this case seriously

291
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,200
or that they are up to something.

292
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,480
Understood.

293
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,860
First Young Lady, you're finally here.

294
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,940
We don't know who

295
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,330
Lord Linzi heard this from

296
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,110
and came to plead for Yan Family early in the morning.

297
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,390
Empress Dowager got furious

298
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,220
and asked His Highness to go back.

299
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,030
But His Highness is stubborn

300
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,710
and insisted on staying here.

301
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,890
Please help persuade him.

302
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,850
Your Highness.

303
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,160
Your Highness, you...

304
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,740
will hurt yourself if you continue to kneel like this.

305
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,900
You're making Empress Dowager upset

306
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,400
for the sake of others.

307
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,310
Please get up.

308
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,750
Miss Xue, no need to persuade me.

309
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,660
I trusted you to be an upright person before.

310
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
But yesterday in Yan Mansion,

311
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,450
I saw clearly

312
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,810
what you and Mr. Xue did.

313
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,300
I tried my best to stop the conflict yesterday.

314
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,770
Do you want me to defy my father

315
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,260
in front of everyone?

316
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,960
I don't want you to do anything.

317
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,700
But Miss Xue,

318
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,180
have you heard of this saying?

319
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,240
We are people of different goals and thus think differently.

320
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,349
We'd better stay away from each other.

321
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,430
Lest Mother misunderstands

322
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,000
and have other intentions.

323
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,030
First Young Lady.

324
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,720
You should go in first.

325
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,450
The Empress Dowager is waiting for you.

326
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,090
You think we are people of different goals and thus think differently.

327
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,040
Is that different from others?

328
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,070
In the palace,

329
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,300
can people like us

330
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,690
really do whatever we want?

331
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,110
Not everyone is like you.

332
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,690
Someone will

333
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,260
understand my loyalty towards my friends

334
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,020
and support all my decisions.

335
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,650
If he wants to plead for the Yan family,

336
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,030
let him kneel in the Imperial Ancestral Temple

337
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,590
and ask the ancestors of the State of Qian

338
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,720
if he's still a descendant of the Shen family.

339
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,200
Aunt, calm down.

340
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,160
His Highness just took things too hard.

341
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,470
In a few days,

342
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,030
he'll understand your intentions.

343
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,380
But I don't understand.

344
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,070
His Highness used to be the most easygoing.

345
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,370
Why is he so stubborn all of a sudden?

346
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,260
Yesterday at Yan Mansion,

347
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,980
how dare that Jiang Xuening

348
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,460
confront your father openly.

349
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:22,750
With her in the palace,

350
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,060
everything will be in chaos.

351
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,010
Your Majesty.

352
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,660
Bad news!

353
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,620
Something happened in Pixiang Hall.

354
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,540
Why are you panicking?

355
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,860
Noble Consort Qin is a fool.

356
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,410
What could happen to her?

357
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,260
Aunt.

358
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,270
I'll take my leave first.

359
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:37,690
No need.

360
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,400
It's good for you to listen more

361
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,710
about things that go around in the palace.

362
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,170
Given Jie's personality,

363
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,950
you need to stay with him

364
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,660
and keep an eye on him.

365
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,780
Go ahead.

366
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,790
Your Majesty,

367
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,070
the people we sent to Pixiang Hall sent a message

368
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,090
saying that Nobel Consort Qin

369
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,630
hasn't had her period in two months.

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,310
I secretly found a physician

371
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,450
and trying to sniff things out using the excuse of checking her pulse.

372
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,490
What did the physician say?

373
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,020
Though the pulse is weak,

374
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,730
she is definitely pregnant.

375
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,670
His Majesty has been in poor health.

376
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,830
There hasn't been any news from the harem for years.

377
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,210
How could something like this happen?

378
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,850
Did Noble Consort Qin notice?

379
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,790
Your Majesty.

380
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,840
No.

381
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,410
If she gives birth to a child,

382
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,450
they must be the future Crown Prince.

383
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,390
The child that crawled out of her womb

384
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,530
will definitely not be close to me.

385
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,120
Us Xue family

386
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,910
finally took down the Yan family.

387
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,730
At this moment,

388
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,830
we can't let any mistake happen.

389
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:37,990
Your Majesty,

390
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,640
how about I secretly...

391
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,740
No.

392
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:42,950
Aunt,

393
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,530
Eunuch Huang is your servant.

394
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,630
His Majesty knows that.

395
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,620
If something happens to Noble Consort Gao,

396
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
His Majesty will not tolerate it.

397
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,580
In this way,

398
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,810
you and His Majesty will fall apart.

399
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,690
I have an idea.

400
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,970
It can help you solve your problem

401
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,890
and get rid of the annoying person.

402
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,810
Tell me.

403
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,730
I received the news this morning

404
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,090
that you came here under the order of His Majesty.

405
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,620
So I've changed the guards

406
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,760
to my own brothers.

407
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,220
It's more convenient for you to talk.

408
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,170
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

409
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,470
You've helped me quite a few times.

410
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,430
I will take note

411
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,840
of this kindness.

412
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,420
Well...

413
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,780
It's my honor to work for you.

414
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,160
Hurry, open the door.

415
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:31,730
Please.

416
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,930
Well,

417
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:50,990
State Duke ordered

418
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,200
to lock Marquis Yan and Viscount Yan apart.

419
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,310
But don't worry.

420
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,250
They haven't been punished.

421
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,810
You...

422
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,890
You go ahead and take your time.

423
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,530
I'll wait for you outside.

424
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,680
Greetings, Marquis Yan.

425
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,370
You've suffered a lot.

426
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,050
It doesn't matter.

427
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,440
It's much better than

428
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,660
the days I lived on the battleground.

429
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,170
Xue Yuan didn't want to make a fuss

430
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,770
and didn’t make things difficult.

431
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,210
Don't worry.

432
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,140
My Lord.

433
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,140
The Xue family hasn’t found any evidence in Yan Mansion.

434
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,300
They are trying to find a way to convict Yan family.

435
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,920
I have sowed discord between His Majesty and Xue Yuan.

436
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:48,900
I think

437
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,700
they won't be too quick

438
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,450
to punish you for disobeying the orders.

439
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,570
However,

440
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,520
I'm here today

441
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,000
to ask you

442
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,970
instead of staying in the capital for a long time

443
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,940
and be controlled by others,

444
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,060
are you willing to shed your identity

445
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,680
and live a new life after your death?

446
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,180
What do you want to do?

447
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,510
Give Tongzhou Camps to His Majesty

448
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,280
to keep your life.

449
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,070
If the Xue family's plan failed,

450
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,390
they will make a big mistake when in a rush.

451
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,840
As long as we have something on them,

452
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,750
there will be a chance

453
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,950
to bring down the Xue family.

454
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,590
But

455
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,780
tens of thousands of soldiers of Yan family

456
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,670
have been suspected of colluding with the rebels because of me.

457
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,370
Will His Majesty...

458
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,930
really treat them well?

459
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,490
My Lord, don't worry.

460
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,230
Handing over the military power

461
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,810
is just what's being said.

462
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,210
I will be the one protecting

463
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,120
the Tongzhou Camps.

464
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,620
Okay.

465
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,740
I'll do as you say.

466
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,160
However,

467
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,280
if you really want those soldiers to listen to you,

468
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,100
you have to

469
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,480
go to the camps personally.

470
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,460
I'll write you a letter.

471
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,650
With these,

472
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,430
Yan Liu will definitely help you.

473
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,980
Although it's different from Yan Mansion's blood bath

474
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,750
last time,

475
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,560
Yan Lin is in prison after all.

476
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,000
Is it really that hard to chage

477
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,430
destiny that has been set?

478
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,470
I have to

479
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,820
find a chance

480
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,170
to ask Xie Wei again.

481
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,170
Okay.

482
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,500
That's all for today.

483
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,600
Dismissed.

484
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,090
Goodbye, Scholar.

485
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,610
Are you still worried about Yan Lin?

486
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,670
Look.

487
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,550
The military camp hasn't rebelled yet.

488
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,060
As long as we keep investigating,

489
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,010
they will be cleared of suspicion in no time.

490
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,430
Brother and I will put in a good word for Yan Lin.

491
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,920
His Majesty won't punish him severely.

492
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,640
Your Highness.

493
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,780
We didn't go to the Yan family for the ceremony yesterday.

494
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,300
Was it really as dangerous as the rumor said?

495
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,570
Duke Xue rushed into the palace yesterday

496
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,730
and made a lot of trouble.

497
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,200
I heard it was stopped by Mr. Zhang.

498
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,440
Sister Yao,

499
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,290
Mr. Zhang is so powerful.

500
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,770
He's not even afraid of Duke Xue.

501
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,250
What's wrong?

502
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,000
You and Mr. Zhang...

503
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,690
You and Zhang Zhe

504
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,630
are ungrateful.

505
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,790
He's from a small family.

506
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,720
Even if he's handsome,

507
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,870
he looks poor.

508
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,670
Besides, I asked someone to do a reading.

509
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,990
He has a harsh fate and is destined to live his life alone.

510
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,760
So after thinking about it,

511
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,840
I gave up on him.

512
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,840
Harsh fate and is destined to live his life alone?

513
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,810
Isn't this like what Sister You said–

514
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,210
Yes, Your Highness.

515
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,550
However,

516
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,860
people I don't like,

517
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,990
those from small families

518
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,950
would still fight for them.

519
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
Although she's not as good as me,

520
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,250
you never know,

521
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,560
he might take a liking to her

522
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,840
too.

523
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,370
Jiang Xuening!

524
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,720
My hand slipped.

525
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,390
Your hand slipped?

526
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,700
Where did you want to hit?

527
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,460
What do you think?

528
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,540
One wouldn't have a guilty conscience if they didn't do something wrong.

529
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,010
You did something lowly in secret.

530
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,140
Of course you'd get embarrassed.

531
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,850
You don't have to scold me.

532
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,740
You'd better behave yourself.

533
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,180
After all, it's fate that we met. Let's not part on a bad note.

534
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,830
Others wouldn't gossip about it too.

535
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,830
But if you want to lose face,

536
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,170
and have to ruin others' reputation,

537
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,420
I do dare to let the whole capital know

538
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,680
what you did

539
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,360
that made them break off the engagement.

540
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,210
I see.

541
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,940
Yao Xi,

542
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,330
you are the daughter of a Minister after all.

543
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,750
How could you be so impolite?

544
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,400
Your Highness.

545
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,930
What brings Eunuch Huang here?

546
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,220
Empress Dowager, Empress, and Noble Consort Qin

547
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
are enjoying flowers in the Imperial Garden.

548
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,870
They asked me to invite Your Highness

549
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,980
and everyone here to accompany them.

550
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,030
Didn't Mother ask Shu

551
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,500
to accompany her early in the morning?

552
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,360
Why is she asking for everyone now?

553
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,520
Her Majesty said

554
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,180
the flowers are blooming just in time.

555
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,770
It's better to enjoy with everyone than alone.

556
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,440
That makes sense.

557
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,240
Let's go.

558
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,650
What?

559
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,540
Do I have to invite you?

560
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,580
Miss Jiangs,

561
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,560
please.

562
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,450
Your Majesty, you chose a good date.

563
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,830
Look.

564
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,030
The sky is clear and bright.

565
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,210
Just now,

566
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,530
I passed by the Imperial Garden.

567
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,400
The flowers

568
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,860
were blooms beautifully.

569
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,750
You are so sweet.

570
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,020
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

571
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,980
This sachet

572
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,220
is filled with medicinal herbs from State of Yue.

573
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,040
It can calm your nerves.

574
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,020
Keep it well.

575
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,550
Thank you, Mother.

576
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,330
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

577
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,650
This sachet is so exquisite.

578
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,280
Could it be

579
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,540
made by Miss Xue?

580
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,080
I dare not accept your praise.

581
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,460
This sachet

582
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,290
was embroidered by another study partner.

583
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,870
Really?

584
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,940
I'm glad you like it.

585
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,150
I like it.

586
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,200
It's so beautiful.

587
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,990
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

588
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,260
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

589
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,910
Be careful later.

590
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,340
I think Eunuch Huang

591
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,450
looks suspicious.

592
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,990
I also think something is wrong.

593
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,600
Yesterday, Lord Linzi told me

594
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,060
he would go to the Empress Dowager to plead for Yan Family.

595
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,310
I don't think Empress Dowager would be in the mood to enjoy flowers today.

596
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,090
Why is she suddenly in the mood to?

597
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,690
And even got everyone to come?

598
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,430
I'm afraid

599
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,230
something is amiss.

600
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:32,800
Mother,

601
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,740
why are you in such a good mood today?

602
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,540
Have a seat.

603
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,010
I thought

604
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,460
you've been studying hard.

605
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,560
You should have a rest.

606
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,300
The Imperial Kitchen happened to have

607
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,720
made some new desserts.

608
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,250
Have a taste.

609
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,650
Sit next to me.

610
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,210
A few days ago,

611
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,090
His Majesty talked to me about

612
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,250
selecting a concubine for Lord Linzi.

613
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,710
He said His Highness is still a little boyish.

614
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,670
It's time for him to get married and start his career

615
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,200
so he can become more reliable.

616
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,200
Both His Majesty and His Highness are Mother's children.

617
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,360
This time,

618
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,990
I'm afraid you'd have to spare no effort

619
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,330
to take a closer look.

620
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,310
In my opinion,

621
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,280
there's no need to put in so much effort.

622
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,030
The capital's most talented

623
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,350
and beautiful girls

624
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,460
are all here.

625
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,730
In my opinion,

626
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,670
First Princesses's selection for her study partners

627
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,090
is killing two birds with one stone.

628
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,890
We don't need to go through another selection for a wife.

629
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm afraid that Mrs. Linzi

630
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,360
is right here.

631
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,090
As an elder,

632
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,600
I can only help him take a look.

633
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:35,980
What's important is

634
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,730
he has to like her himself.

635
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,540
All right.

636
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,750
I called you here to admire flowers.

637
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,820
Don't just sit around here to chat with me.

638
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,130
Go and have a look.

639
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,230
Don't be shy.

640
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,100
Noble Consort Qin.

641
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,300
Since the flowers are blooming now,

642
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,720
could you go to Tingxue Pavilion

643
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,120
and pick the two most beautiful flowers for me to put

644
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,650
in my flower vase?

645
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,700
Your Majesty, you want me to

646
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,310
pick them myself?

647
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,080
Isn't this what a maid does?

648
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,550
Besides,

649
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,790
Tingxue Pavilion is so far away.

650
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,380
I have to walk for a long time.

651
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,930
Look.

652
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,830
The older one becomes,

653
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,500
the lazier they get.

654
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,900
The flowers there are blooming the best.

655
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,010
I asked you to pick them for me

656
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,800
because you have good taste.

657
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,350
How about this?

658
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,880
I'll find someone

659
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,720
to go with you. How's that?

660
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,070
Sure.

661
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,820
Jiang family's Second Young Lady, please.

662
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,870
Then I'll pick the two most beautiful flowers

663
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,360
for you.

664
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,340
It's my pleasure to be able to pick flowers with Nobel Consort.

665
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,410
Didn't Your Highness say that

666
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,800
the garden is exquisite.

667
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,210
Do you want to go with us?

668
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,830
Yes, Mother.

669
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,150
I want to go too.

670
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,600
I'll go with Ning.

671
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,680
You grew up in the palace.

672
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,070
Haven't you gotten tired of it after seeing it for so many years?

673
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:05,930
You're not allowed to go.

674
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,510
Are you worried

675
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,940
I can't take good care of Her Highness?

676
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,120
But I'm clumsy.

677
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,830
I'm afraid I'll implicate Nobel Consort.

678
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,860
How about

679
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,940
having Miss Xue come along,

680
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,350
so we can talk along the way too.

681
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,580
It's rare that Jiang family's Second Young Lady has invited me.

682
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,190
Please allow it, Aunt.

683
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,670
Since all the study partners are here,

684
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,770
why don't we

685
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,550
all go together?

686
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,890
Sure.

687
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,350
Be careful.

688
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,430
You sit down.

689
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,310
Chat with me.

690
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,770
She doesn't like me,

691
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,560
yet insisted on ordering me to pick flowers with Noble Consort.

692
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,540
Looks like today's plan

693
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,080
is most likely related to Nobel Consort.

694
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,820
This is a troublesome place.

695
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,070
I have to get out as soon as possible.

696
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,730
There are flowers everywhere.

697
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,760
Go pick them yourselves.

698
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,120
Stop following me.

699
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,140
Miss Fang. Miss Zhou.

700
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,370
Why don’t we

701
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,320
take a look over there together?

702
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,270
Let's go.

703
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,520
Jiang family's Second Young Lady.

704
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,410
Her Majesty said

705
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,920
you have to keep me company.

706
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:48,710
Your Highness,

707
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,470
I have a stomachache.

708
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,710
I'm afraid I've eaten something wrong.

709
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,650
I need to go to the toilet.

710
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,300
Please excuse me.

711
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:54,710
Wait.

712
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,740
Weren't you fine just now?

713
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,470
Well...

714
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,580
All right.

715
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,070
Go ahead.

716
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

717
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:04,950
Seriously.

718
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,030
What's wrong with her?

719
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,030
She's so weird.

720
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,880
Your Highness, there's something you don't know.

721
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,430
Jiang family's Second Young Lady

722
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,750
always does whatever she wants.

723
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,430
In the past, when the teacher taught us,

724
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,640
when she was unhappy,

725
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,040
she also likes to make excuses like she isn't feeling well to leave.

726
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,610
She doesn't respect the teacher at all.

727
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,020
What?

728
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,350
She's upset because

729
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,740
she has to accompany me to pick flowers?

730
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,770
Miss Jiang hides what she thinks well.

731
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,480
I can’t figure it out.

732
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,120
However,

733
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,480
she has always been hot-tempered.

734
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,150
Back in Tai'an Hall,

735
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,490
even the Empress Dowager couldn't do anything about her.

736
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,580
She

737
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,970
is not simple.

738
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,800
I've heard about

739
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,800
what happened in Tai'an Hall

740
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,580
but I don't know the details.

741
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,190
Come.

742
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,500
Tell me

743
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,250
what happened?

744
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,060
That day,

745
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,590
Empress Dowager called us to Tai'an Hall.

746
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,850
Empress Dowager is targeting me.

747
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,170
Now that I left,

748
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,090
I don't think anything will happen.

749
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,600
Back then,

750
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,190
that hairpin was so long.

751
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,190
She just pointed it

752
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,440
to her own neck.

753
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:09,860
It shocked everyone.

754
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,690
Go away!

755
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,480
Go away!

756
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,370
Hurry up!

757
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,590
Go away! Help!

758
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,040
What is this?

759
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,650
Go away!

760
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,730
Get rid of it!

761
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:32,780
Over there!

762
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,300
Your Highness, are you okay?

763
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,239
Are you hurt?

764
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,650
That scared me.

765
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,710
Is my face okay?

766
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,190
Don't worry.

767
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,500
Your face is fine.

768
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,969
Your Highness, would you like to move your limbs

769
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,510
and see if you hurt yourself anywhere?

770
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,080
It hurts everywhere.

771
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,550
This...

772
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,540
What's wrong with Miss Yao?

773
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,490
You were so careless.

774
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,820
How dare you push Her Highness.

775
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,680
I didn't.

776
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,640
When we came here,

777
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,660
we saw it with our own eyes.

778
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,790
What's there to deny?

779
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,560
Instead of figuring out whose responsibility it is,

780
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,430
let's see if Noble Consort is all right.

781
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,550
If there's anything wrong,

782
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,560
no one here

783
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,850
can escape this responsibility.

784
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,860
That's right.

785
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,650
Her Highness's safety comes first.

786
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,440
Your Highness.

787
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,550
What's wrong?

788
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,680
I don't feel well in my abdomen.

789
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,930
Could she be...

790
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,880
It's cold and windy here.

791
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,940
It's easy to catch a cold.

792
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,310
Her Highness broke out in cold sweat from the shock.

793
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,340
Why don't we go back to Pixiang Hall first?

794
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,710
No!

795
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,130
Your Highness.

796
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,260
I think

797
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,180
your health is precious.

798
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,530
You should stay here.

799
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,690
We can leave after the Imperial Physician's diagnosis.

800
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,090
Then...

801
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,370
Since Elder Miss Jiang said so,

802
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,470
this place is not far from the Imperial Hospital.

803
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,810
Instead of letting Her Highness stay here in the cold,

804
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,010
why don't we help Her Highness

805
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,100
to the Imperial Hospital?

806
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,380
Yes.

807
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,930
Your Highness.

808
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,690
I learned some medical skills at home.

809
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,270
I know that if someone fell and hurt themselves somewhere,

810
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,960
they might have hurt their bones and ligaments.

811
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,610
All though it's cold here,

812
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,600
the Imperial Physician hasn't diagnosed you yet.

813
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,860
We mustn't move.

814
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,400
I...

815
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,390
I won't move.

816
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,880
I can't move then.

817
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,500
If I hurt my bone or liagament,

818
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,430
I can't dance for His Majesty anymore.

819
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,420
M-Miss Xue,

820
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,900
go get an imperial physician for me.

821
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,540
I'll stay here.

822
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,460
Yes.

823
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,260
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

824
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,990
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

825
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,420
The Noble Consort of Pixiang Hall is pregnant.

826
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,030
The Imperial Hospital just checked her pulse.

827
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,800
Her Majesty sent someone to inform His Majesty.

828
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,400
Really?

829
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:03,710
Really?

830
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,930
Indeed.

831
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:05,990
How about

832
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,980
you go and take a look for yourself?

833
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,760
Hurry up.

834
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,280
Let's go to Pixiang Hall.

835
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,550
I told you to be careful.

836
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,900
That's how you do things?

837
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,500
Not only did you lose the chance to kill two birds with one stone,

838
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,120
if Noble Consort Qin really gives birth to a prince,

839
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,870
how can Jie ascend the throne?

840
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,760
How can the Xue family still have a foothold?

841
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,650
You really let me down.

842
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,160
What did His Majesty say?

843
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,060
Did he find anything?

844
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,280
I've taken away the pouch

845
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,940
that can attract rats on Nobel Consort Qin.

846
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,530
No matter who investigates it,

847
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,290
it will only be an accident.

848
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,700
Best if that's it.

849
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:42,940
Otherwise,

850
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,070
the whole Xue family will suffer.

851
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,240
Aunt, don’t worry.

852
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,810
Consort Qin has been pregnant for months.

853
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,660
There is still room to fix it.

854
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,570
And that Jiang Xuehui...

855
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,390
I wanted Jiang Xuening to be convicted

856
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,730
and get her involved,

857
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,040
to get rid of her.

858
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,620
I didn't expect

859
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,270
she's also a smart one.

860
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,080
The Jiang family

861
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,590
is full of troubles.

862
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,550
If I don't get rid of them,

863
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,080
I won't be able to sleep in peace.

864
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,120
I didn't know you were so sharp in the past.

865
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,430
I have underestimated

866
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,460
you.

867
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,180
As expected from someone Mother raised.

868
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,130
How did you find that Noble Consort is pregnant?

869
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,220
I didn't know.

870
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,440
But given what happened today,

871
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,720
I had to overthink about it.

872
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,460
With this result,

873
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,330
it's also considered a merit.

874
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,170
I'm afraid it's not all out of kindness.

875
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,240
You're not the type to take the risk.

876
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,560
You're doing this because you heard Her Majesty

877
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,240
talk about Lord Linzhi's selection for wife

878
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,380
which affected you.

879
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,840
By doing this,

880
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,440
Noble Consort Qin will remember your kindness.

881
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,660
His Majesty will also reward you if he finds out about it.

882
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,440
But,

883
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,630
aren't you afraid of offending the Empress Dowager?

884
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,440
It's give and take.

885
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,340
In this world,

886
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,190
we can't make everyone like us.

887
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,750
It's fine if I offended them.

888
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,230
This is the carefree attitude

889
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,690
that what you taught me?

890
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,480
It's good that you think this way.

891
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,280
I hope that

892
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,130
your wish will come true then.

893
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,080
Ning.

894
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,110
If things went as their plan

895
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,330
and something happened to His Majesty's only son,

896
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,980
you could have died.

897
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,660
Have you figured out

898
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,450
how to deal with Xue family yet?

899
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,810
I have my own thoughts.

900
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,340
Instead of worrying about me,

901
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,280
you should worry about yourself first.

902
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,200
You are the one Lord Linzi loves.

903
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,780
You did a good thing today too.

904
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,620
I'm afraid they're already thinking about

905
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,230
how to deal with you.

906
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,400
After Shen Lang died,

907
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,650
the country had no Crown Prince

908
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,840
and Shen Jie ascended the throne.

909
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,220
Shen Jie was indecisive

910
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,660
and couldn't fight against the Xue family.

911
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,700
That's why Duke Xue and his lackies kept growing.

912
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,990
When the war at the border started,

913
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,990
Jinling found a chance

914
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,850
and rebelled everywhere.

915
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,970
Xie Wei took that chance to rebel against Yan Lin

916
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,730
and became the sinner of the world.

917
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,630
If Noble Consort Qin can keep her baby,

918
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,910
if the baby is born,

919
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,350
and if the baby is a boy,

920
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,290
everything that happens from now on

921
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,600
will be a overturning chaos

922
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,300
as compared to what happened last time.

923
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,790
It seems that people and things

924
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,070
can be changed.

925
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,700
Yan family

926
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,250
still have hope.

927
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,760
Are you sure you want to hand it over?

928
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,030
Do you know

929
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,350
this is the most powerful army

930
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,630
in the world.

931
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,200
If you have this,

932
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:48,990
you...

933
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,360
Let alone revenge,

934
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,560
you can even be the emperor if you want to.

935
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,690
I just want the Yan family is safe.

936
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,310
I have no use of this thing.

937
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,020
Dao Qin and I

938
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,270
have brought Gongyi Chen's people back alive

939
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,440
according to your order.

940
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,070
But there are already Lord Pingnan's

941
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,060
base and spies in Tongzhou.

942
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,320
What if the news of your rebellion

943
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,410
spreads back to Jinling?

944
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,440
Then strike first

945
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,100
and use the court

946
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,920
to eliminate all their men in and outside

947
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,860
of the capital.

948
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,200
Even if they want to spread messages,

949
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,800
they will have no way out.

950
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,100
Yes.

951
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,840
That makes sense.

952
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,880
But how do you explain

953
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,450
how you know so much about the rebels?

954
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,100
Sir.

955
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,310
His Majesty summons you to the palace.

956
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,860
Xie Qing, you came at the right time.

957
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,370
Your Majesty.

958
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:56,870
The imperial physician said

959
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,030
Noble Consort Qin has been pregnant for two months.

960
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,110
I feel relieved.

961
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,510
I'm discussing an amnesty with Mr. Gu.

962
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,560
As the saying goes,

963
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,160
people are refreshed when they are happy.

964
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,790
It seems that it's the same for Your Majesty.

965
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,490
But I'm here today

966
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,010
to tell you another good news.

967
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
Fortunately, I didn't let you down.

968
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,870
I’ve brought back

969
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,610
Yan family's official seal.

970
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,600
Show it to me.

971
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,840
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau said

972
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,960
a lucky star will enter the temple this year.

973
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,300
It's just as they said!

974
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,700
We have taken in this military power,

975
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,760
and the court has a successor too.

976
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,770
[Yan]

977
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,920
God bless State of Qian.

978
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:48,630
Mr. Xie,

979
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,530
hundreds of people from Xingwu Guards

980
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,930
failed to find it in the search.

981
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,520
How did you get it?

982
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,990
I met Yan Mu.

983
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,340
and reasoned with him

984
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,490
and told him the Emperor's benevolence

985
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,440
which inspired him.

986
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,050
I apologize but

987
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,470
I can't believe what you said.
