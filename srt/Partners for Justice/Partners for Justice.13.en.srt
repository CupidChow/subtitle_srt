1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,209
In a toilet at Gimpo Airport,

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,540
a man was found dead.

3
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:06,080
It could be MERS.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,480
I can't do this.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,380
- Soo Yeon, where are you going?
- What's wrong?

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,580
From now on, no one can enter
or exit the autopsy room.

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,650
I get that you want to
find out why he died,

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,059
but I'm... I'm scared.

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,089
What if it was a homicide?
We're letting the killer get away.

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,129
Then what do I need to do?

11
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:25,500
Do you know how to use that?

12
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,409
(Episode 13)

13
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,130
What's wrong?

14
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:57,600
What is it?

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,960
I think I cut myself.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,469
What? Blood?

17
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:06,469
You're bleeding?
Prosecutor Eun, are you all right?

18
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:07,709
How did you get the cut?

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,579
If you got it from the used scalpel,
you'll be in great danger!

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,439
Darn it.

21
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,099
I knew something bad was going
to happen. Come on, Dr. Psycho!

22
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,829
- What if she gets infected?
- Come on, do something. Please?

23
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,400
It's not a used scalpel. Let me see.

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,099
No, I think I'll be fine.

25
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,469
- Let me see.
- I just need to put on a Band-Aid.

26
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,109
Come here.

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,489
- Don't be such a crybaby.
- But it hurts!

28
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,120
- You just said you were fine.
- Unbelievable.

29
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:58,989
Stay still.

30
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,110
- Bring me the suture kit.
- Will you stitch it in there?

31
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,849
- Yes.
- What?

32
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,289
What? You're going to stitch it up?

33
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:31,419
I can't let the cut stay open.
Hold this tightly.

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Prosecutor Kang.

35
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,860
Sol! Are you all right?

36
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,969
- Hyun.
- How did this happen?

37
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,800
She was on the ladder, and she put
her hand in a wrong spot.

38
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,210
I was helping him with the autopsy.

39
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,969
What? You were helping him?

40
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,039
It all happened because Dr. Psycho
forced her to help him.

41
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,949
I'm Prosecutor Kang Hyun
from Seoul Eastern District.

42
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,479
I'm Director Park Joong Ho
of the NFS.

43
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,919
What do you mean she was
helping him with the autopsy?

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,819
I was just taking some photos.
I messed up. I'm fine.

45
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,360
Don't you think treating
her cut is our first priority?

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm sending you the suture kit,
disinfectant, and saline solution.

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,469
He's going to treat her in there?

48
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,599
Not treating her is more dangerous.

49
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,469
The cut is deep.

50
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,909
Will that be okay?
There's a corpse in the same room.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,780
We don't have another choice.

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,349
Darn it.

53
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,960
Be patient.
It'll be under anesthesia.

54
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,129
You crashed into it on purpose.

55
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,199
You wanted to kill your fiancee
who had changed her mind about you.

56
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,100
That's why you lost your mind
and wanted to kill her!

57
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,040
Stop that right now!

58
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,310
You killed with those hands!

59
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,709
- What?
- My gosh.

60
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,360
Don't exaggerate.
It's under anesthesia.

61
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,529
Every medical examiner
at the NFS is a doctor.

62
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:53,829
You have nothing to worry about.

63
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,569
You can't control
Dr. Baek Beom, can you?

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,939
- Are you going to just watch...
- Right now,

65
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:04,180
he's making his decision
as a doctor, not a medical examiner.

66
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,310
And I trust his judgment.

67
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,519
Do you think his judgment is
worthy of your trust?

68
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,680
Yes.

69
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,649
Hey, Seong Joo.

70
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,720
What did he just say?

71
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,660
Did he say Baek killed someone?
He killed a person?

72
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,800
- What did he mean by that?
- I don't know.

73
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,470
But I thought...

74
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,180
you had a problem with your hands.

75
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:49,050
- That was just my guess.
- Do you know why I go to the range?

76
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,360
- To control your anger?
- To prove my hands are fine.

77
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:03,269
Dr. Park.

78
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,170
We couldn't find
Ms. Han Soo Yeon yet.

79
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,779
- You're sure she's in the building?
- Yes.

80
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,779
I checked every surveillance camera
at the entrance and the exit.

81
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,810
I think she must be
hiding somewhere.

82
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,449
Check the surveillance cameras in
the building. She has to be in here.

83
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,519
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,959
(Investigator Seo)

85
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,100
Yes, what is it?

86
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,060
- Let me talk to him.
- Okay.

87
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,329
Please inform the prosecutor.

88
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:39,199
- Hello?
- I'm Prosecutor Kang Hyun.

89
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,170
- When will we have the results?
- We won't know right away.

90
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,939
- We'll follow the protocol...
- Protocol?

91
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,579
Is locking people up right away
your protocol?

92
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:51,050
Quarantining the infection is the
first step according to our system.

93
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,389
Then what about those who were
quarantined with the corpse?

94
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,959
Would you have done the same
if that person was your family?

95
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,889
It's chaotic at the airport too.

96
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,089
He was in touch with more than
just a couple of people.

97
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,560
This is an emergency for us too.

98
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,800
We must stop the infection
from getting out of the airport,

99
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,600
the trail of the body, and the NFS.

100
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,069
Are you telling me that
there's nothing...

101
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,269
you can do for the areas
where it has spread?

102
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,470
Controlling the virus from spreading
is our first priority.

103
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,910
I understand.

104
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,379
It's all done.

105
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,560
Let's continue.

106
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,459
I hate to be a burden to someone.

107
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,029
Look through the viewfinder.

108
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,029
Pardon?

109
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,970
Don't look at the body with
bare eyes. Look through the lens.

110
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,509
That'll be better.

111
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,560
- What are you doing? Take photos.
- Sorry?

112
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,980
- Soo Yeon!
- Soo Yeon!

113
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,779
Where are you, Soo Yeon?

114
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,920
- Soo Yeon!
- Ms. Han!

115
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,490
- Soo Yeon.
- Soo Yeon.

116
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,590
Ms. Han!

117
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,460
- Soo Yeon.
- Soo Yeon.

118
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,590
Soo Yeon!

119
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,460
Come on, where did she go?
She's driving me crazy.

120
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,769
Hey, Seo Hyun.

121
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,710
Mommy is so sorry.

122
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,679
I'll be there soon.

123
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,909
Play there for a while longer. Okay?

124
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,750
All my friends left.

125
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,389
- Whom should I play with?
- Put your teacher on the phone.

126
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,429
It's my mom.

127
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,860
Hello?

128
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,700
Hello.

129
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,669
I'm so sorry.
I always do this to you.

130
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,370
Could you please
look after her once again?

131
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:29,639
No one can pick her up right now.

132
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,840
Are you aware that
we had a class with their dads?

133
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,809
Seo Hyun didn't join the class.

134
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,379
I found her crying
in the bathroom by herself.

135
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,590
Please get here soon.

136
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,559
We have to get off work too.

137
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,259
Yes, I understand.

138
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,330
I'm so sorry.

139
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,129
I'm so sorry to do this every time.

140
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,370
Yes, all right. I'm sorry.

141
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,149
Mommy will come home soon.
Just wait a little longer.

142
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
Don't cry.

143
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:14,750
It's okay. Look at me.

144
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,759
- Don't cry.
- Mommy...

145
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,450
- Rib cutter.
- Pardon?

146
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,710
(Rib cutter: a machine that
cuts through ribs)

147
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,580
Those that look like pincers.
The biggest one.

148
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,919
Yes, those.

149
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,740

(Smoking gun: conclusive evidence
of an action or an assumption)

151
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,720
- Look. Listen carefully.
- Okay.

152
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,659
Heart. Left lung. Right lung.
Liver. Spleen. Stomach. Pancreas.

153
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,190
Left kidney. Right kidney.

154
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,690
That's the order of evisceration.
Make sure you get it on camera.

155

Left and right kidney.
Is that right?

158
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,330
- Yes. You're correct.
- Okay.

159
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,230
- You're here, Prosecutor Kang.
- Hello.

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,110
- What are you doing?
- An autopsy.

161
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,710
We need to disclose
the cause of death.

162
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,009
How can you conduct
an autopsy right now?

163
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,350
Does this make...

164
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,590
- Pulmonary fibrosis.
- What?

165
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,789
(Pulmonary fibrosis: a disease
in which one's lungs harden)

166
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,659
Write it down on the board for
everyone to see. Pulmonary fibrosis.

167
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:02,929
Pulmonary fibrosis.

168
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,740
(Pulmonary fibrosis)

169
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,149
Barely any stomach contents.

170
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:24,120
Barely any stomach contents.

171
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,220
(Barely any stomach contents)

172
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,090
Does he know anyone
who lives in Qatar?

173
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,190
He was on a business trip. A local
employee was probably with him.

174
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,230
- Get them on the line.
- Right now?

175
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,490
Immediately.

176
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:37,659
Okay.

177
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,100
Look. This is weird.

178
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,539
Do you see the green?

179
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,080
We can't jump to a conclusion
with that little evidence.

180
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,250
You can also see some green
when a body decomposes.

181
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,950
The local employee is on the line.
You can talk to him.

182
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,419
I have a few questions.

183
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,620
How was Mr. Lee when he was there?

184
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,730
Did he say anything
about abnormal symptoms?

185
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,200
I'm not sure.

186
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,830
Oh, he did cough a bit.

187
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,029
Dry coughing?

188
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,100
Yes. He kept coughing.

189
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,970
Any blood?
Did he spit out any blood?

190
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,409
I'm not sure about that.

191
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,169
Was he ever out of breath?

192
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,610
Let's see. Yes.
He said he needed to exercise more.

193
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,950
He'd run out of breath
after climbing up a few stairs.

194
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,019
What about the food he brought
from Korea? Did he eat them?

195
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,690
I don't know about that.

196
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,350
But there were a few times...

197
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,960
when his wife packed him food
for his business trips.

198
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,929
Okay. Thank you.

199
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,289
Thank you.

200
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,799
His lungs were getting destroyed.

201
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:47,230
That's why he ran out of breath.

202
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,970
Difficulty breathing. Dry coughs.
Write those down.

203
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,669
Difficulty breathing. Dry coughs.

204
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,139
(Difficulty breathing)

205
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,210
Whom does he live with?

206
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,539
His son lives in the rural area,

207
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,539
and we can't reach his wife.

208
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,179
We need to visit his house.

209
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,779
There's a possibility
that he was murdered.

210
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,580
- What?
- What? Murdered?

211
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,820
- Chief Ma, you can go.
- Wait.

212
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,590
Me?

213
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,629
Come on.

214
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,200
Pulmonary fibrosis doesn't prove
that he was murdered.

215
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,370
How will you rule out
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?

216
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,769
Is there a possibility
that he was murdered?

217
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,539
There's a higher possibility
that he suffered from a disease.

218
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:28,409
That's why I'm suggesting
that we go find out.

219
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,240
Interstitial pneumonia.
Organizing pneumonia.

220
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,580
Chronic pulmonary disease.

221
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,179
Family history of pneumonia.
Pulmonary emphysema.

222
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,350
There are numbers of diseases.

223
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,309
And he had a cold too.

224
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,289
Liver, 2,014g.

225
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,059
Liver weight, 2,014g.

226
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,490
See? His liver has swollen up too.

227
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,100
- It's not interstitial pneumonia.
- What about pulmonary asbestosis...

228
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,169
or lung invasion of rheumatism?

229
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,610
What about chronic
hypersensitive pneumonitis?

230
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:04,080
You need to do a biopsy
before you go to his house.

231
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,179
What do you think?

232
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,450
We'll know for sure
when we see his place...

233
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,610
if he survived even with
pulmonary asbestosis,

234
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,480
or if he suffered from pneumonitis.

235
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,990
Whom are you trying to teach?

236
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,759
Or he could've been poisoned.

237
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,230
Then you two can go over.

238
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,639
His articles are all expensive...

239
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,179
and well-taken care of.

240
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,610
There's a possibility
that he's very wealthy.

241
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,019
We'll conduct a background check.

242
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:45,179
You must go.

243
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,220
Did someone say he was poisoned?

244
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,289
How did you know, Ms. Hwang?

245
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,129
I'm going over to find poison
that might not even be there.

246
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Interested?

247
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,259
My precious. I'm in. Who's coming?

248
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,700
Me, me, me. I'm in.

249
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,970
Seong Joo, you need to go too.

250
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,570
Yes. I'll go with them.

251
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,269
Okay. Poison Avengers. Let's go.

252
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,909
Okay. Let's go.

253
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,639
Why aren't you coming along?

254
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,379
I need to protect Prosecutor Eun.
You can go.

255
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:18,820
Protect her from what?
From MERS? Or Dr. Psycho?

256
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,950
Both.

257
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,750
There's a risk element
and a risky person.

258
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,419
You have no idea. Go, now.

259
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:26,889
I'll stay. You can go.

260
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,889
- Yes, sir.
- I told you so. Come on.

261
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,559
- Come on, we need to hurry.
- Goodness.

262
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,259
My gosh.

263
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,740
What are you doing? Take pictures.

264
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,140
Goodness, I need to stretch.

265
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,569
My gosh.

266
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,680
What are you doing?

267
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,109
Gosh, your face is oily. Stop.

268
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,809
Did I fall asleep? Did I snore?

269
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,180
Gosh. We all got involved in this
because of Doctor Baek.

270
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,220
That's why everyone calls him
Dr. Psycho, not Dr. Baek.

271
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,730
That's perfect. Dr. Psycho.

272
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,200
Anyway, what do you think
Prosecutor Kang meant?

273
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,470
He said Dr. Psycho
killed with his hands.

274
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,369
Stop that right now!

275
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,700
You killed with those hands!

276
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,109
Hey, Jang. You're the closest
with Dr. Psycho.

277
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:51,240
Do you know anything?

278
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,450
I don't. I haven't
heard anything before.

279
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,210
Is he an ex-convict?

280
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,250
You can't work with the government
if you were convicted of murder.

281
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,279
What about medical malpractice?

282
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,119
His autopsies are perfect.

283
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,950
I'm sure he was
a perfect surgeon too.

284
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,089
Who killed whom? I feel left out.

285
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:08,160
Ms. Hwang,
Prosecutor Kang called out...

286
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,900
Doctor Baek for killing someone.

287
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,470
Doctor Baek?

288
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,599
- Whatever. I don't care.
- I don't care either.

289
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,369
What?

290
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:21,539
Anyway...

291
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:25,079
- What?
- What is it? Tell us.

292
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:26,849
We're here.

293
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,950
My gosh.

294
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,519
Goodness.

295
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,220
Was he trying to make us laugh?

296
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,119
(National Forensic Service)

297
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes. Just for today.

298
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,910
Ms. Han. Are you in there?

299
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:05,849
Director Park.

300
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,920
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,160
It's all right.

302
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:14,359
I was scared. That's why.

303
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:16,700
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,259
But...

305
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,170
But I...

306
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,269
It must be really tough
bringing up a girl by yourself.

307
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:28,339
Seo Hyun is...

308
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,079
on her way to my house right now.

309
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,779
My sister will take care of her
until everything is over.

310
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,250
Don't worry about her.

311
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,650
- How?
- I called an ambulance,

312
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,619
and it's in the entrance right now.
Take it, and go to the hospital.

313
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,190
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,130
Sir...

315
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,269
Thank you.

316
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,470
Everything will be okay.

317
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,910
Thank you, sir.

318
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,819
Thank you.

319
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,809
Eun Sol.

320
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,869
Are you okay?

321
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,049
Hyun, is it okay for you
to stay here?

322
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,880
- Aren't you busy?
- I'll stay until you can come out.

323
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,650
I won't eat her up.
I won't kill her.

324
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,119
Am I some serial killer?

325
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,819
What do they call people...

326
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,359
who cannot feel any guilt?

327
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,460
Psychopaths.

328
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,130
All right.

329
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,440
Since we're at it...

330
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,180
Let's talk about it.

331
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,349
Why are you so obsessed with me?

332
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:15,549
I promised...

333
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,220
to make you pay the price.

334
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,319
To whom?

335
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,460
You needn't know.

336
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:31,900
If you're going to keep me out,
talk about it somewhere else.

337
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:35,500
Or call a temporary truce
and try to get along.

338
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,640
It's tough being locked up,
and you call him a psychopath?

339
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,069
I feel almost claustrophobic that...

340
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,549
Doctor.

341
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,890
What is it?

342
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,400
What are you doing?

343
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,299
I think you have a fever.

344
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:13,039
- Are you okay?
- I just dozed off.

345
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,109
You're burning up.
You didn't just doze off.

346
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:18,039
- You're sick, aren't you?
- Don't exaggerate.

347
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,950
It's just a slight fever.

348
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,680
MERS.

349
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,349
Could you have it?

350
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,019
A viral infection doesn't
show symptoms in just a few hours.

351
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,859
It's not MERS.

352
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,759
How can you be so sure?

353
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,730
If there were a viral disease
that manifested so quickly,

354
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,230
we'd have been wiped out.

355
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:42,769
That jerk.

356
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:44,569
I don't care.

357
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,470
It looks like Dr. Baek has a fever.

358
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,240
Dr. Baek, are you all right?

359
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:55,609
- Do you need medicine?
- Forget that.

360
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:58,680
- Do you need something?
- I'd like some cup noodles.

361
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,019
I'm starving.

362
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,460
He's joking around.
That means he's okay.

363
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,099
Get my phone.

364
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:29,880
It's a new house
and a nice one at that.

365
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,650
It was inspected and cleared
three months ago.

366
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,789
A new house?

367
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,220
Yes, it could be
sick house syndrome.

368
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,759
Bring a wallpaper sample
from each room.

369
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,289
The glue from inside the walls.
I need some of that too.

370
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,599
Okay.

371
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,140
Is there a carpet?

372
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,309
- Yes, there is.
- Bring a piece.

373
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,109
- Bring the scissors and container.
- Okay.

374
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:12,990
There's an air purifier.

375
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:15,559
- Is there a humidifier?
- Yes.

376
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,059
Get the air purifier filter...

377
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,000
and humidifier's water tank.

378
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,500
Get the filter.

379
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,369
It's all evidence.

380
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,609
- Any plants?
- Plants? Just a moment.

381
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,309
- Are there any plants?
- A potted one over here.

382
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:33,849
Get samples of those.

383
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,680
Don't you see I'm getting some?

384
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,619
Perfume, insect repellent,
bring the whole lot.

385
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,890
Especially anything
that can be sprayed.

386
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,700
His sense of style
and scent is no good.

387
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:55,369
Bingo.

388
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,940
Boring, boring.

389
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,470
No fun, boring.

390
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,309
Interesting.

391
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:06,380
What is it, Hwang?
You found something?

392
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,480
NAC. N-Acetylcysteine.

393
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,980
He'd been taking it for a while.

394
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,190
NAC?

395
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,119
- Check when it was prescribed.
- Okay.

396
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,500
Search the trash can.

397
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:25,630
See if there are any bloody tissues.

398
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,000
He had a dry cough.

399
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,640
His lungs and airways
could've been damaged and bled.

400
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,410
He could've taken something orally.
Bring everything food-related.

401
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:50,920
Also, bring the medical history
of his family members.

402
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:52,089
What?

403
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,990
Not just his but
his family members' too?

404
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,130
Yes, everything.

405
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,700
That'll do.

406
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,940
Eun Sol, are you okay?

407
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,170
What?

408
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,039
- I think...
- What is it?

409
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,710
I think my hand stings
a bit more than before.

410
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,880
And I feel warmer.

411
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,019
Doctor.

412
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,359
Am I okay?

413
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,359
There's a thermometer
in that drawer.

414
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,140
Yes, that.

415
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,819
Why is there...

416
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,289
a thermometer in an autopsy room?

417
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,519
We put that...

418
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,759
in the corpses' rectums.

419
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,130
What?

420
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,359
I wiped it.

421
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,970
With a wet wipe.

422
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,269
- Darn it.
- I was kidding.

423
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,170
Everything's sterilized.

424
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,680
The one we stick in
dead people's rectums...

425
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,009
That's enough.

426
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,049
Stop it.

427
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,660
38.5°C.

428
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,430
I have a fever, don't I?

429
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,660
It's because of the cut.

430
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,099
It can cause a fever.

431
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:41,099
Can't you be a bit more serious?

432
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:44,099
Something's wrong with me, right?

433
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,369
Blood poisoning.

434
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:47,369
(A virus in the bloodstream)

435
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:48,569
That's what you suspect, right?

436
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:56,109
It's possible.

437
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,180
Blood poisoning?

438
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:01,250
There's still time until
her cells start to collapse...

439
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,450
You scumbag!

440
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,130
You might not care about this,

441
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,690
but I do.

442
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,829
I studied for years and
only just became a prosecutor.

443
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:17,069
There's still a lot that I must do
and want to do.

444
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,410
I can't do this.

445
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:24,109
- I need to get out. I can't stay.
- Eun Sol!

446
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,880
- Get me out.
- Calm down.

447
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,480
Calm down. You'll be fine.

448
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:30,220
Hyun, I can't do this.

449
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,049
It's okay. Calm down.

450
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:34,190
- I'm not okay.
- You will be!

451
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,319
I can't stay here. Get me out!

452
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,960
Open the door.

453
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,859
- Get me out.
- Wait.

454
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,269
Open up! Open the door!

455
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:52,140
- Sir, you can't go inside.
- It's fine. I'll be with her.

456
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,740
Open this door!

457
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,710
I'll stay with her instead!
