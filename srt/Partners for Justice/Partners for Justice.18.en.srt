1
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:32,299
Sung Jae, I told you to lift
the toilet seat when you go.

2
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,670
Make sure you zip up your fly
when you come out.

3
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,049
Sung Jae, great job.

4
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,049
You came in first again, right?
Congratulations.

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,820
Mom, what about my parcel?

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,420
Oh, right. It didn't come today.

7
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,259
It'll be here soon.

8
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,289
Let's eat first.

9
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,729
- Can I sleep for a bit and eat?
- You must be sleepy.

10
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,130
Sure. Why don't you just
go to bed today?

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,939
- Really?
- Yes.

12
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,569
Can I really sleep?

13
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:09,310
You're at the top of your class.
Do whatever you want today.

14
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,510
- I'm really going to bed.
- Sure.

15
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,980
Yes!

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,409
I'll jump onto my bed
just like this.

17
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,819
Sung Jae,
stop jumping onto your bed.

18
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,469
Sung Jae.

19
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:42,109
Sleep tight.

20
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,109
Prosecutor Eun.

21
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,219
Wake up.

22
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,790
(Episode 18)

23
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,019
Prosecutor Eun.

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
My gosh.

25
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,800
If I don't call you after an hour,

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,199
please come to my house.

27
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,939
I might be in need of a doctor.

28
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,610
The passcode is 1234.

29
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,580
What is this?

30
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,650
Prosecutor Eun. Prosecutor Eun.

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,460
Are you all right?

32
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,669
I know now.

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,669
- I know what happened to Sung Jae.
- Are you crazy?

34
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,539
How many of those did you take?

35
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,009
I was reminded of my past.

36
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,210
We had those pills too.

37
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,650
Pills we took during the exam week
when we fell sleepy.

38
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,189
My parents...

39
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,729
only favored my older brother.

40
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,759
They didn't pay
any attention to me.

41
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,900
That's why...

42
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:15,000
I obsessed over getting good grades
so they would notice me.

43
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,439
Now, I get it.

44
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,009
- How Sung Jae must've felt.
- Good job.

45
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,439
Next time, get stabbed,
fall, and do everything.

46
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,479
Of course, it hurts. My gosh.

47
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,520
Don't take pills for migraines.
It will damage your liver. Here.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
(Case study on synergistic action
of stimulants)

49
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,629
What... What is this?

50
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:45,129
It's a case study about synergistic
action of amphetamine...

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,870
and visible and auditory
hallucinations from the side effect.

52
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,469
Then can we prove
that he hallucinated?

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,840
We found the empty bottle
in the garden.

54
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,009
The leftover powder was amphetamine.

55
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:03,050
Did you have to take the pills
to identify what they were?

56
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,919
That's weird.

57
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,419
My head hurts, but...

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
What's wrong with me?

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,189
It's because dopamine and
noradrenaline hiked in your body.

60
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,759
(Noradrenaline excites
the sympathetic nerve system.)

61
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,529
When you feel good, just
sleep it off. Sleeping is the best.

62
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,600
What did you say?

63
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,870
What are you talking about?

64
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:26,769
What...

65
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,779
Is it because you're twisted?

66
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,019
Seeing you sideways is
slightly better.

67
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,889
You know that Jin Dol is...

68
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,259
the only one who likes you, right?

69
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,170
Wait. Hold on a second, Dr. Psycho.

70
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,740
- What?
- Let me ask you a question. Okay?

71
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,610
- What is it?
- Let's be honest here.

72
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,120
Do you really think I'm a joke?

73
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,750
I know that you really hate me,

74
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,290
patronize me,

75
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,290
and look down on me.
I know all of that.

76
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,430
So what?

77
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,000
At times, you're
such a selfish jerk.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,569
But at times, you can be so humane.

79
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,610
I can't figure you out.

80
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,209
Did you really kill a person?

81
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,449
- No, I didn't.
- It wasn't an intentional accident?

82
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,420
- I don't know about that.
- Why don't you?

83
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,579
I don't remember.

84
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,990
I remember before and after
the accident, but not the accident.

85
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,519
Fool.

86
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,990
You forgot the most
important part. My gosh.

87
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,529
Yes, I forgot
the most important part.

88
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,870
By the way, why are you...

89
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,139
answering all of my questions
honestly? Why?

90
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,209
You're known to be sharp-tongued.

91
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:13,110
When the drugs wear off, you
won't remember this conversation.

92
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,550
Go to sleep.

93
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
What?

94
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,420
What did you...
You're writing a novel.

95
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,689
- Hey, get out. Get out.
- Goodness.

96
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,660
He put something on the door...

97
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,529
(Read the case study about
amphetamine and its side effects.)

98
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,300
(If you need more information,
consult the NFS.)

99
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,569
Are you ready to order?

100
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,569
Yes. Stella,
do you want to get the rib eye?

101
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,639
When it comes to marbling,
rib eye is the best.

102
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,980
Give us 150g of the sirloin
from the lower part,

103
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,350
130g of each flank and flat iron,

104
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,220
and 100g of each outside
round steak and the tri-tip.

105
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
Okay.

106
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,850
There are
different kinds of sirloin.

107
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,160
The lower sirloin is from
number 10 to 13 of the backbone.

108
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,930
That part is the best grilled.

109
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,600
Wow. Fantastic.
You're absolutely perfect.

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
It's nothing.

111
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,569
- All right.
- Should we try the tri-tip first?

112
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:14,939
Tri-tip? Sure. Tri-tip...

113
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,509
- Let me. That's not it.
- What?

114
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,579
I know that.

115
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,910
No, you don't. It's hidden here.
Here's tri-tip.

116
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:23,449
Tri-tip.

117
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,399
It's time.

118
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,110
Great.

119
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,689
Try it.

120
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,730
Excellent.

121
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,540
It's cooked.

122
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,139
Okay.

123
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,839
Have some.

124
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,220
None for me, I guess.

125
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,970
Perfect.

126
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,909
Stella, don't you remember
the fixed amount?

127
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:02,809
We had that the other night.
2 to 8 and 7.2 percent alcohol.

128
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,649
Soju, 9.8cc.

129
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,090
Beer, 3.2cc.

130
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,559
Alcohol proof, 7.25

131
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,960
That's the perfect point.

132
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:16,090
You got me fascinated.

133
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,600
That's the formula.

134
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,100
Go. Next round.

135
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,570
Then I'll mix one this time.

136
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:28,669
No.

137
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,379
One more shot, please.

138
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,580
I can do this easily
without measuring it.

139
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,350
It's easy. Do it like this.

140
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:40,690
Good.

141
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:45,820
- Cheers?
- Cheers.

142
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,029
I told you that you had
nothing to worry about.

143
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,600
Your son must get into
a good school to do great things.

144
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,940
There should be no stumbling blocks.

145
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,379
Yes, sure. Please send
my regards to him too.

146
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,250
Let's meet up soon.

147
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,179
Yes. Goodbye.

It was supposed to help him stay up.

What have you done to our child?

159
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,169
They said it would help
with his studies.

160
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,179
Sung Jae liked it because
it helped him focus too.

161
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,750

162

No, what have I done?

What about you?

165
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,090
All you've done was brag about
how he's the top of his class.

166
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,590
You haven't done a thing.

167
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,470
Did you ever care about
how hard he had to work...

168
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,570
to live up to your expectations?

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,240
What am I going to do?

170
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,610
Goodness.

171
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,950
Here.

00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,519
That drug...

173
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,289
is banned in Korea.

174
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,820
Please tell us...

175
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,289
how you got them.

176
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,759
What am I going to do?

177
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,970
In order to prevent other kids
from being victimized,

178

open your locker now?)

What is this?

189
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,039
Hi.

190
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Darn it.

191
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,039
You're under an emergency arrest

Darn you.

194
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,299
Darn it.

195
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,279
Let go of me!

196
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,710
Stay still.

199
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,070
That's his favorite.

200
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,309
I saw that...

201
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,509
in Sung Jae's...

202
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,350
school locker.

203
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,980
I'm sorry for everything.

204
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,820
And thank you.

205
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,159
I hope...

206
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,090
you two will be better soon.

207
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,389
Sung Jae did nothing wrong.

208
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,299
He just had whatever I gave him.

209
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,799
It's all my fault.

210
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,740
Sung Jae was such a good kid.

I'll be waiting.

00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,330
I'm sorry.

216
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,570
All I ever said to him was
to be a good student.

217
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,240
I never told him...

218
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,940
that I loved him...

219
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,879
or that I was so proud of him.

220
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,019
I never said that to him
until the day he died.

221
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,190
I had...

222
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,220
I had no idea
I'd regret it so much.

223
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,259
Sung Jae.

224

Dad's so sorry.

229
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,960
It's me.

230
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,000
I just thought...

231
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,400
we could eat together,

232
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,170
Dad.

233
00:17:58,349 --> 00:17:59,349
Have some.

234
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:03,559
And try this one too.

235
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:05,819
- Okay.
- Eat up.

236
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:09,029

- Yes.

- Mommy.

- Give Mommy a kiss.

- Dad.
- Yes?

244
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,549
Can you step away a little?

245
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,980
Some might think that
you've lured a minor.

246
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,819
Right?

247
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,559
And at the same time,
they can be the most selfish.

Yes, I think that will do.

258

Is Mom well?

261
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,799
Why are you here?

262
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:34,839
I'm getting married.

263
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,410
- So what?
- I wanted to tell you first.

264
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,380
You said you'd work
for charity your whole life.

265
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,619
You said you think more of strangers
than your own family.

266
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,289
Don't talk about Mom now.
You disgust me.

- Hyun.
- She still...

cries herself to sleep,
thinking of you.

269
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,990
Don't show up in front of us again.

270
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,440
I shouldn't have left you like that.

271

Let's meet up with Mom one day.

272

Guess what?

275
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,809
You changed my life.

276
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:48,279
Look. My lifeline is longer.

This is what they call
a handmade line on the palm.

- Don't drive so roughly.

Do you think
you're a race car driver?

280

- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

281
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,920
We have a body of
a middle-aged male.

282
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,259
A neighbor called,
but he didn't pick up,

283
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,730
so security went to check
and found his body.

284
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,730
Any ID?

285
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,200
We just got here.
We'll check when we get upstairs.

286
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,859
Okay. Oh, wait, wait.

287
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,730
How is Lieutenant Cha? Is he okay?

288
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,140
He's off for the rest of the week.

289

Our chief told him to take a break.

290
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,009
I see. Thanks.

Hello.

292
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:06,990
- Welcome.
- You came yourself?

293
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,130
I'm filling in for Dr. Ma.

294
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,359
Let's all go upstairs then.

295
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,269
Let's see.

296
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:26,480
What's that? Come over here.

297
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,779
Seoul Eastern District...

298
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:35,220
Just a moment. We need to
check something first.

299
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,519
What's the problem?

300
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,019
You can see the body later.

301
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,089
What's the matter?

302
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,559
The thing is...

303
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,730
What thing is what?
Get out of our way.

304
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,000
- Can't you just...
- Let go of me.

305
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Why...

306
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,970
It's...

307
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,279
It's... It's Mr. Seo.

308
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,829
Prosecutor Kang. Prosecutor Kang!

309
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:23,599
- Move!
- Not yet. The scene's not clear.

310
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,640
- I said, move!
- Wait a bit. They're almost done.

311
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,269
No, I have to see him.
I have to check.

312
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,210
Wait, Hyun. Calm down.

313
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,549
My investigator's in there!
Jeong Min's in there!

314
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,049
- I said, move!
- Please don't.

315
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:39,180
Move! Jeong Min!

316
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,019
Jeong Min, it's not you, right?
Jeong Min! Jeong...

317
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,359
Jeong Min!

318
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Prosecutor Kang.

319
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,069
Other than the head injury...

320
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:37,039
and the injection mark,
we found no external traumas.

321
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,579
We'll know more
once we do an autopsy.

322
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,549
- An autopsy?
- No signs of struggle...

323
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:47,650
or forced entry
through the windows or door.

324
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,319
Was he alone?

325
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,119
He could've known the attacker.

326
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
You're right.

327
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,569
I think he was with someone. Look.

328
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,140
There's only one smashed glass,

329
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,180
but two are missing.

330
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,210
There's a security camera
in the parking lot.

331
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,849
- Could we find out who...
- The camera's a fake.

332
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,589
It's just a model of a camera.

333
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,660
I was hoping to find something.

334
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,460
(Sodium pentothal)

335
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:34,299
Succinylcholine?

336
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:36,740
Sodium pentothal?

337
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,809
Cause of death. Injection of sodium
pentothal and succinylcholine...

338
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,740
which caused
respiratory organ failure.

339
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,849
Is an ordinary person capable of
injecting these drugs?

340
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,150
Injecting into the vein is tough...

341
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,650
unless you're
a medical professional.

342
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,990
You could cause death by
injecting these drugs into muscles,

343
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:01,359
but then death would be
very slow and painful.

344
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,430
We can't be sure about anything yet.

345
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,470
We'll consider every possibility...

346
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,509
and get to the truth with scrutiny
and thorough investigation.

347
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:17,710
Get me Mr. Seo's call history
from yesterday immediately.

348
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,680
His call history going back three
months and social media details.

349
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,250
Please go through everything.

350
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
Yes, sir.

351
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,750
The dashboard cams in parked cars
might have caught something.

352
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,759
Check all the cars that were
parked there yesterday and today.

353
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,890
Yes, sir.

354
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:35,960
Go over all the cases that
Mr. Seo was investigating.

355
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,029
We must check if anything happened
to make someone...

356
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,170
want to kill him.

357
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:42,200
Okay, I'll do that.

358
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:44,970
What a mess.

359
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,339
Everything we do
tends to upset people.

360
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,690
I have Mr. Seo's
call history from yesterday.

361
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,490
Current time is 09:10.
We'll begin the autopsy.

362
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,759
You can't come in here.
There's a viewing room...

363
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,700
You cannot continue
Seo Jeong Min's autopsy.

364
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,369
- What?
- As of this moment...

365
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,170
until his autopsy is complete,

366
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,880
all NFS personnel are banned from
the autopsy room and viewing room.

367
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Please leave.

368
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,680
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

369
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,309
(Judge Choi Bong Kyu)

370
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,289
- Based on what grounds?
- Destruction of evidence.

371
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,220
You can't perform the autopsy...

372
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,619
since you killed him.

373
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,170
The last person Mr. Seo called...

374
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,869
was you!

375
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,609
(Call History)

376
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,900
(Partners for Justice)

377
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,740
Mr. Baek Beom,
you're under arrest...

378
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,910
for the murder of Seo Jeong Min
as of now.

379
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,769
This is too hard, Hyun.

380
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,609
Baek Beom doesn't have an alibi,
and we have definite proof.

381
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:08,309
What are you talking about?
Who killed whom?

382
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,380
I brought everything
upon myself, Dad.

383
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,720
It's not a house that belongs to
someone with normal mentality.

384
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,319
It's the same drug
that killed Mr. Seo.

385
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,319
We found the decisive evidence.

386
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,390
You lost your mind
when you saw this photo.

387
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,789
You decided to kill him because
you were scared that...

388
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,789
we might find out
about your crime 10 years ago.

389
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,700
Fine. I did it. Are you happy now?
