1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,509
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,519
Arrest him again.

3
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,160
The body was cremated.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,609
- What?
- The process has begun.

5
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,539
The body's all burnt.

6
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,740
How much of it was burnt?

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,350
We're from Seoul Eastern District
Prosecutor's Office.

8
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,689
- Stop the machine.
- Pardon?

9
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,920
This is the warrant that allows us
to seize the body in there.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,490
Turn off the power.
Please do it now.

11
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,329
- What are you talking about?
- Please turn off the power. Hurry.

12
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,000
Hyun, it's me.

13
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,000
I stopped the machine midway,

14
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,629
but it's all burnt.

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,340
- Okay.
- Bring the body.

16
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,870
I don't think you understand
what's going on here.

17
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,109
- It's all over now.
- It's not over yet.

18
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:47,109
I can still perform the autopsy
with a piece of the body.

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,950
- What?
- A piece of a bone is enough.

20
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,319
What can you achieve
with the half-burnt body?

21
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,620
I must perform the autopsy.

22
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,349
Don't you want to prove
that it was a murder?

23
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,659
Hyun.

24
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,930
Transfer the body to the NFS.

25
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,270
All right then. Go ahead.

26
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,210
Get ready for the autopsy.

27
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,439
Did he really ask you to
bring the body?

28
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,409
It's completely burnt.
Will the body give him a lead?

29
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,180
Let's head over there
for the time being.

30
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,449
By the way,
what's wrong with Dr. Psycho?

31
00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:01,319
If it turns out to be homicide, he
will return to the detention center.

32
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,090
My goodness.

33
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,460
Start the car. Let's go.

34
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,560
- We should go.
- Okay.

35
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:16,569
Prosecutor Kang,
what do you think you're doing?

36
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,169
- I'm sorry.
- Do you not trust me?

37
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,770
The autopsy is a part of
the investigation.

38
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,039
And the investigation falls
under my authority.

39
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,250
Then will he really redo the autopsy
with the burnt body?

40
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,949
Sir, Dr. Baek will take
a thorough look again.

41
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,520
Director, the tissues are
all ruined from the first autopsy.

42
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,860
Besides, do you believe he can do
an autopsy with a burnt body?

43
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,860
Do you think that will
restore the burnt tissues?

44
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:47,669
If the protein gets denatured
from the heat, it's irreversible.

45
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,430
You do have a point, but...

46
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,539
If you know,
how could you allow this?

47
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,810
I can't find a reason to stay
and watch this autopsy.

48
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,009
Prosecutor Kang,
I'm pulling myself off this case.

49
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,979
Sir.

50
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,339
The body is here.

51
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,920
Current time, 2:16pm.

52
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,350
I'll begin the autopsy.

53
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,600
Wait, what happened?
Did the body move?

54
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,170
His hands and feet didn't look
like that after the first autopsy.

55
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,370
It's the pugilistic posture.

56
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,069
It's due to high heat.

57
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,040
The tissues in his muscles
have been denatured.

58
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,410
Our muscles that get swollen up are
more developed than other muscles.

59
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,709
That's why every muscle has
become denatured to swell up.

60
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,279
Did that happen after his death?

61
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,350
The fact that muscles are
made of protein is immutable.

62
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,529
- All of his hair is destroyed.
- "All of his hair is destroyed."

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,430
- 90 percent of skin is ruined.
- "90 percent of skin is ruined."

64
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,939
Will we be able to find anything?

65
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:35,639
Only his muscles are left.
We can't see any external injuries.

66
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,009
I need blood. Blood.

67
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,310
Can I have blood, please?

68
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,949
Scalpel.

69
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,730
I think the organs are
burnt as well.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,230
I just need his heart.

71
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,930
Where's the heart?

72
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,639
Since it was situated in the inner
part, it wasn't completely burnt.

73
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,740
Syringe.

74
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,250
Will there be any blood?

75
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,100
Come on.

76
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:41,370
Yes. Fantastic.

77
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,180
We can put this through
LC-MS at least once.

78
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,649
(LC-MS: Liquid
chromatograph-mass spectrometer)

79
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,850
One and only chance.

80
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,889
It's urgent.

81
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,389
Roger.

82
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:05,230
Show me the pictures from the first
autopsy. Let me compare them.

83
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,300
Okay.

84
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,310
- There's no vital reaction.
- What does that mean?

85
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,480
They cut off his nails
after his death.

86
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,550
Nails leave the most evidence...

87
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,589
when one gets into a fight
or comes in contact with someone.

88
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,790
That must be why
they cut it off on purpose.

89
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,230
His nails probably scratched
the culprit's body as he fell.

90
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,899
If the culprit cut his nails,

91
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,639
there could be traces left
on the cut nails.

92
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,410
It's no use.
His fingers are burnt.

93
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,449
Goodness. Only if
we were an hour early.

94
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,389
Which is the first?
The head injury or the injection?

95
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,529
Professor Pyo said
the injection was first.

96
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,769
You have the result, don't you?
What came first?

97
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:19,170
What is it?

98
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:23,009
I will refrain from judging
until we have his blood analysis.

99
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,540
You're right. What can he find out
with a body that's burnt up?

100
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,879
- Is the site preserved?
- Yes.

101
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,120
A strand of hair and a piece of nail
are all parts of his body.

102
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,490
Soo Yeon, go to the field.

103
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,690
- Yes.
- I'll see you.

104
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,029
Ms. Cheon. It's me.

105
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:45,799
I'll text you.

106
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:56,940
Do you think we'll find
a piece of nail that he clipped off?

107
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,740
The pride of
National Forensic Service...

108
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,279
rests upon that piece of nail.

109
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,820
But we might find the nails
which he clipped off himself.

110
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,850
How can you know which is which?

111
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,019
We can look into its components.

112
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,419
Old nails have a different level
of water content.

113
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,659
We don't know where it could be,

114
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,059
- so please go through every inch.
- Okay.

115
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,190
Hey, good to see you.

116
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,659
Jang Tae Joo stole
succinylcholine a few days ago.

117
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:49,659
Give that to me.

118
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,730
And not just 1 bottle, but 3.

119
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,529
You can never tell
what this idiot is up to right now.

120
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,970
He has yet another target
after Mr. Seo.

121
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,840
Is there a possibility of his
committing another crime?

122
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,509
Prosecutor Kang, this is
a serial murder case.

123
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,190
Someone suspicious had been
lurking around Mr. Seo as well.

124
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,059
Was that Jang Tae Joo?

125
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,360
He looks quite similar.

126
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,629
It looks like this was planned.

127
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:29,769
I'll write up a list of people that
Jang might hold a grudge against.

128
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:31,769
Invalidate his passport immediately,

129
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:33,539
and put him on
the most wanted list nationwide.

130
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,470
Let's take all the measures
which we can take...

131
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,240
to find Jang Tae Joo.

132
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,279
Yes.

133
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,610
I'll go back to the office to
form a team to arrest him.

134
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,049
Let me know
when the autopsy result is out.

135
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,179
Okay, Hyun.

136
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,320
Keep tracking Jang
and let me know how it goes.

137
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,389
All right.

138
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
- Lieutenant Cha.
- Yes?

139
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,120
I'm sorry for everything.

140
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,799
You're back.

141
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,799
Prosecutor Kang.

142
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,259
What will happen to us
if we don't find that nail?

143
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,360
If he clipped 1 nail 3 times,
that makes a total of 30 pieces.

144
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,830
I'm sure we'll find one.

145
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,309
Found it.

146
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,470
His name is Park Byeong Goo.

147
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,639
He used to provide Jang
with drugs five years ago.

148
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,179
He got locked up first,
then ratted on Jang.

149
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,679
Thanks to that, he got
his sentence reduced to two years.

150
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,620
That sounds like a good reason
to hold a grudge.

151
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
We're here.

152
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,730
What is this?

153
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,100
Are you sure this is his place?

154
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,200
I am.

155
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,639
Do you think he killed him already?

156
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,139
Then we should at least
see a dead body here.

157
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,779
Did something happen
in this house again?

158
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,110
Pardon?

159
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,990
Who are you?

160
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,690
Young man.

161
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,759
I called the ambulance for
the young man who lives here...

162
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,929
when he was about to die.

163
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,129
Stay with me.

164
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,759
The ambulance?

165
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,669
We performed CPR on him
in the ambulance.

166
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,740
Then we left him on the bed,
but he disappeared soon after.

167
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,240
I got the security footage.

168
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,509
Good.

169
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,250
There are many people who run away
because they can't pay the bill.

170
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,679
No, he didn't run away
because of money.

171
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,190
There is someone
who can find his whereabouts.

172
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,190
Take a left here.
No, take a right.

173
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,289
- A right?
- Yes, to the right.

174
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,230
Go straight.

175
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,730
This place looks exactly the same.
Go straight.

176
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,000
Are you sure we'll find something
if we keep going?

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,169
Just keep going. Go straight.

178
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:52,240
That's all that you've been saying.

179
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,210
I can't believe this place.

180
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,470
This neighborhood
hasn't changed a bit.

181
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,009
I can't believe it.

182
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,580
- Where are we going?
- Just go straight.

183
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,210
Keep going. More.

184
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,149
Keep going. Yes.

185
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:08,519
Okay, that's it. Hey, wait.
That's it. Stop.

186
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,990
Good job. We're here.

187
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,360
You'll see a person
named Doctor Park up there.

188
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,830
She's the godfather
of all druggies.

189
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,899
Say that I sent you two,
and she'll know what to do.

190
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,559
- Hurry up and go.
- Okay.

191
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:25,669
Come on, you know
who Park Byeong Goo is.

192
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,840
Don't do this.
We already know everything.

193
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,980
There's no one like that here.
You're at the wrong hospital.

194
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,350
Come on, we both know
what we're talking about.

195
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,519
I really know everything.

196
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,879
- Go.
- What?

197
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:44,620
Okay, fine.

198
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,190
You don't seem to have
a medical license.

199
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,230
Do you want me to do
a background check on you?

200
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,799
Just leave, detective.

201
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,429
This place has
more flies than patients.

202
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,899
All you'll find is fly dung
if you run a background check.

203
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,840
If you continue
being so uncooperative...

204
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,039
Article 317 of the Criminal Code.

205
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,639
"A doctor must not disclose..."

206
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,240
"any confidential information
they obtain on their duty."

207
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,679
I guess detectives nowadays
don't study law.

208
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,049
Did you get that off the internet?

209
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:14,149
I practically fed you,
yet you still can't eat.

210
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:16,419
Darn it. It's him.

211
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,789
- Goodness.
- Hello, Detective Kang.

212
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,190
Have you been well?

213
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:26,059
Doctor Park, you're the same.

214
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,399
No, you got prettier.

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,440
- Do you still do drugs?
- Come on.

216
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,370
Don't say that.

217
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,440
Say hello to them.
They're my juniors.

218
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,210
I really adore them.

219
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,909
And we're looking for someone.

220
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,379
Dong Sik.

221
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,320
I'll go out of business...

222
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,649
if I lose my credibility
in this industry.

223
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,919
And your juniors
are unbelievably rude...

224
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,289
Wait. Rude?

225
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,460
Are you trying to tell me...

226
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,730
that I need to do a better job
in bringing my juniors up?

227
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,200
- It's okay. I'll get this.
- Let go of me.

228
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Doctor Park.

229
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,240
Guess why I let you be?

230
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,610
Drug addicts.

231
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,980
They need help
when they're sick or hurt.

232
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,019
I can't let them die in the streets
because they can't go to a hospital.

233
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,120
But then, I can't let my juniors...

234
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,620
see me let you off, can I?

235
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,289
How about it? It's been a while.

236
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,299
Shall we have some fun?

237
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:37,799
Okay.

238
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,669
Fine.

239
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,580
(Room 302)

240
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:48,950
I didn't say a word.

241
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,279
Right?

242
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,720
He strangled me,
then I felt a poke from behind.

243
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,690
My reflexes took over and
I flipped him over my shoulder.

244
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,129
I really thought I was going to die.

245
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:04,299
Do you mean he may have
a grudge on someone else too?

246
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,299
Well...

247
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,869
The thing is...

248
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,240
Mr. Kang, we identified
Jang Tae Joo's next target.

249
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,869
It's Prosecutor Do Ji An.

250
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:16,710
He was the one who apprehended
Jang Tae Joo with Mr. Seo.

251
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,710
What?

252
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,839
He killed Mr. Seo first,

253
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,180
then tried and failed to
kill the snitch.

254
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,220
Now he's after Prosecutor Do.

255
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,890
He just got back from
an overseas business trip yesterday.

256
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,460
I'll send an arrest team over now.

257
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,299
Do you see the peaks?
It's not just for SMC.

258
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,500
We even got SUX.

259
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,869
Fantastic.

260
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,509
What? SUV? Fantastic?

261
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:49,369
What's fantastic?

262
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,880
It's SUX, not SUV.

263
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,039
Listen carefully.

264
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,509
Every drug, once it enters a body,

265
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:59,380
enters the bloodstream and
reacts with enzymes to metabolize.

266
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,549
In the blood, we find metabolomes,
the result of metabolization.

267
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,119
So called the miracle of metabolism.

268
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,930
Can't you just tell us
the conclusion?

269
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,059
Okay, cool.

270
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,930
The metabolome of succinylcholine
is called SMC.

271
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,670
When succinylcholine, SUX,
enters a body,

272
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,400
it turns into SMC.

273
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,039
But in Seo Jeong Min's blood,

274
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,109
we didn't find much SMC.

275
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,450
We found more of the original SUX.

276
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,619
Metabolization didn't happen much.

277
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,390
Why is that?

278
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,890
He was already dead.

279
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,960
Bingo.

280
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,130
Metabolization stops with death.

281
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,089
Rapid degradation.

282
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,700
The order of damage is...

283
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,869
Scalp hemorrhage.

284
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:50,640
(Bleeding from torn scalp)

285
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,210
Linear fracture.

286
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,170
(Fracture in a straight line)

287
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,339
Subdural hemorrhage.

288
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,480
Injection after death.

289
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,920
Type of death, homicide.

290
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,319
The succinylcholine and sodium
pentothal were injected after death.

291
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,490
To cover it up as suicide.

292
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,099
We found nothing on the fingernail.

293
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:21,299
We tested the water content
and it's over a week old.

294
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,470
Whoever the killer is
made sure to take everything.

295
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,109
(Kang Hyun)

296
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,009
Eun Sol speaking.

297
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,980
Okay. I'll go to
the office right now.

298
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,589
They identified
Jang Tae Joo's next target.

299
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,119
- Let's go.
- Okay.

300
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:11,849
Doctor, take a break.

301
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
We just need to catch him now.

302
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,220
We brought
all this dust for nothing.

303
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,559
It'll take ages to clean up.

304
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,589
(Crime Scene Report)

305
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,599
The scene was clean?
No finger or footprints?

306
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,299
Just the living room. The other
rooms were filthy and dusty.

307
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:28,430
It was cleaned up?

308
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,440
- Yes.
- And evidence destroyed.

309
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,410
Where's the tape?

310
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,549
- What do you need it for?
- Get it.

311
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,890
Just a moment.

312
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,839
- Hello.
- Who are you?

313
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,869
Are you surprised?

314
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,190
Darn you, now I need a tetanus shot.

315
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,819
Come here. I can
give an injection too.

316
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:04,599
What?

317
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,539
What's wrong? Get up.

318
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,009
He got away. Get him.

319
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,109
Where do you think you're going?

320
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,589
Come on.

321
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:42,700
Let go. Let go of me.

322
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,400
Jang Tae Joo, you're under arrest
for the murder of Seo Jeong Min.

323
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,839
- What?
- And attempted murder of...

324
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,309
Park Byeong Goo and Do Ji An.

325
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,809
Get up!

326
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,109
Let's go.

327
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,599
Jeans and hoodie. 182cm tall.

328
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,700
285mm shoe size.

329
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,500
This is you.

330
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:24,309
So is this.

331
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,250
You dare attack
a prosecutor's investigator?

332
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,990
Someone like you?

333
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,519
Have you ever seen
the face of death?

334
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:44,500
It's thousands of times
more addictive than any drug.

335
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,769
What?

336
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:48,130
The barkers.

337
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,769
Dogs.

338
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:53,640
A shot of succinylcholine
is all it takes.

339
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,349
I should've just shot him.

340
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,900
Doctor.

341
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,460
Look at this.

342
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,569
The Prosecutor's Office.

343
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,980
- What?
- I need to be there.

344
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,220
Doctor.

345
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,559
Put me through.

346
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,759
- What?
- It's urgent.

347
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:49,329
Okay.

348
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,400
Here you go.

349
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,140
It's not him.

350
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,579
- What do you mean?
- He's not the killer.

351
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:07,609
What?

352
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,119
Why isn't it him?

353
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,859
What's going on?

354
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:31,700
What's that?

355
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,569
A piece of tape found on
the floor of Mr. Seo's home.

356
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,279
The crime scene there.

357
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,579
Do you remember how
the floor was spotless?

358
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,410
Yes. You found nothing there.

359
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,920
He used that.

360
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,019
That's why we found nothing?

361
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:52,359
We found the tape.

362
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:56,289
If you see here,
the torn edges are uneven.

363
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,200
It was ripped by teeth.

364
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,440
Saliva contains DNA.

365
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:13,039
Then we can compare that
to Jang Tae Joo's.

366
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,109
- There's no need.
- What are you talking about?

367
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,250
It's a woman.

368
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:22,089
We also found substances
of lipstick in the saliva.

369
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,589
The murderer is a woman?

370
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:25,759
- What?
- What? A woman?

371
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,700
But Jang Tae Joo stole the drugs.

372
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,230
We have him on the dash cam footage.

373
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,230
Two people went
into that house that night.

374
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:37,099
The first one is the real murderer
who is a woman.

375
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,940
The second one is that jerk.

376
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:04,430
Darn it.

377
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,000
You're saying that...

378
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,799
Mr. Seo was already dead
when he walked in.

379
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,509
Then who is the real murderer?

380
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,470
Prosecutor Kang.

381
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,940
Mr. Seo's call history
for the last three months.

382
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:21,150
Thanks.

383
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,779
(Call history)

384
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:33,630
(Abduction Case)

385
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,529
I think I know...

386
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,769
who the real murderer is.

387
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,240
I...

388
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,009
omitted a part of his call history.
