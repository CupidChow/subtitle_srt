1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,640
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,839
I gave birth to Deuk Nam's baby.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,349
See?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,720
You three accused me
of being a con artist.

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,190
It is Deuk Nam's baby.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,920
The inheritance.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,460
It's all mine!

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,399
Defendant.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,929
Defendant.

10
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,699
If you murder an inheritee,

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,969
according to Article 4
of Civil Code,

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,740
you're ineligible
for the inheritance.

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,240
You will forfeit
the right to inherit.

14
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:39,640
What do you mean?

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,750
It means
you cannot inherit the money.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,719
You cannot be an inheritor.

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,460
Why not?

18
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,229
Why not? He is Deuk Nam's son.

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,759
Why not?

20
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,000
Why not? I'm the kid's mother!

21
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:02,070
I'm the kid's mother!

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,439
- Please calm down.
- I'm the mother!

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,099
Why can't I?

24
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,439
- Please compose yourself.
- Why can't I?

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,049
The defendant murdered the father
of her child, Jang Deuk Nam.

26
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,250
According to Clause 1,
Article 924 of Civil Code,

27
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,650
it qualifies as a reason to
terminate her parental rights.

28
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,019
I will request a termination of
parental rights as a prosecutor.

29
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,060
(Judge's Seat)

30
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,260
What now? What will you do?

31
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:34,930
You said you'd get...

32
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,400
all of his assets
once you killed him!

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,709
I had no idea that he was an orphan.

34
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,439
He had nothing on him.

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,939
They aren't going to give him
anything because he was adopted.

36
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,579
What do you want me to do?

37
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,180
How dare you?

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,250
Darn you.

39
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,760
You brat. You...

40
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,730
I don't need you anymore.

41
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,859
The defendant was...

42
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,629
only after the victim's inheritance.

43
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,469
In the process,
she killed her victims...

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,039
and even stole his dead body
in her shameless scheme.

45
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,110
Let go of me! No.

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,110
And even now, after all of
her wicked deeds were exposed,

47
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,080
she is showing
absolutely no remorse.

48
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,159
Therefore, I believe
the accused must be...

49
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,590
isolated from our society for good.

50
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,189
I demand...

51
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,500
I demand...

52
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,969
the death penalty for the accused.

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,599
The death penalty...

54
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,870
Why did I do that?

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,699
I should...

56
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,740
I should've just stayed still.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,949
- You will be cursed!
- How do you call yourself a human?

58
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,110
Bring back my brother.

59
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,949
You wicked thing!
How do you call yourself a human?

60
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,349
- Bring back Deuk Nam.
- How can you do this?

61
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,250
A human being couldn't do that.

62
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,949
- Deuk Nam!
- Unbelievable.

63
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,159
I knew you were the one
who did everything!

64
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,759
What a wicked beast.

65
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,689
Goodness, Deuk Nam. You poor thing.

66
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,729
Prosecutor Eun, great job.
Everything is over.

67
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,300
We'll have to wait for the ruling,
but she's obviously guilty.

68
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,099
Congratulations. Great job.

69
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,340
Are you not feeling well?

70
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,740
Do you have to use the restroom?

71
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,879
Prosecutor Eun, we'll go ahead.

72
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,009
- This way.
- You can take your time.

73
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,310
- Hurry up and come.
- Why? What? What about this?

74
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,189
I demanded the death penalty
for Choi Hwa Ja.

75
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,660
The DNA testing result.

76
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,029
That was too brutal for the truth.

77
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,459
A father of two suddenly died
in a restroom.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,329
His family was wailing over him
when I got to the scene.

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Then...

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,470
a syringe covered in blood
dropped out of his pocket.

81
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,569
A drug addict.

82
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,509
A brutal truth has
an even more brutal ending.

83
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,910
That suits the brutal truth.

84
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,019
Why did you steal the body?

85
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,350
Because I was curious
about the cause of death.

86
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,689
Do you not care...

87
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:19,220
about his life or what will happen
to the rest of his family?

88
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,930
Is that all you need to know?

89
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,430
That's my job.

90
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,329
I thought you were a bit different.

91
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:29,269
I thought you stole his body to help
find the truth for the deceased.

92
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:32,000
That you felt the responsibility
to find out the truth.

93
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,910
But I was wrong. Wasn't I?

94
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:38,209
You told me before...

95
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,480
not to trust anyone.
Not even the deceased.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,610
Is that your true color?

97
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,649
You don't trust anyone,
you care about no one,

98
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,120
and you're just obsessed.

99
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,389
- So what?
- That's an illness.

100
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,290
That's paranoia,
an obsessive compulsive disorder,

101
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,990
neuropsychiatric obsessiveness,
and suspicion.

102
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,089
You dig up a body and go through it
only to satisfy...

103
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,930
your own intellectual curiosity.

104
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,459
- Then you cut him up...
- Is that wrong?

105
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,029
Of course, it is.
How do you call yourself a human?

106
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,699
Have you had an interaction
with a fellow human recently?

107
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,240
- An autopsy is an interaction too.
- How can an autopsy...

108
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,870
How can you call an autopsy
a human interaction?

109
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,209
They don't hide anything,
they expect nothing from me,

110
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,509
and they don't complain
even as I go through their bodies..

111
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,279
and their heads.
What's wrong with that?

112
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,050
There are people who are
honest and genuine.

113
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,089
- Someone who's alive?
- Yes.

114
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,420
I wonder what you're traumatized by.
I'm sure there's something.

115
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,660
If not, there is no way
someone can be this abnormal.

116
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,149
There's a problem with
your right hand, isn't there?

117
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,649
Was it a medical malpractice?

118
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,319
A chest surgeon can't have
their hands tremble.

119
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,120
Is that why
you only deal with the dead?

120
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,160
Stop writing up a novel
with my life.

121
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,759
It's got something to do
with an infant, doesn't it?

122
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,560
Everyone has a history
and old wounds.

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,699
That's what people are.

124
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,600
You may look like this
on the outside,

125
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,040
but Dr. Baek, you're a human too.
That's why you built that dog house.

126
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,139
Right.

127
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:17,579
That means you can
be empathetic toward a dog.

128
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
It's the only life that came
to the National Forensic Service.

129
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,879
- The only?
- After the Sewol Ferry incident,

130
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,480
we got that dog as a present
from Jin Island. That's Jin Dol.

131
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:29,720
Everyone at the forensic service
has been to Paegmok Port.

132
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,089
Happy now?

133
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,110
(Kang Hyun)

134
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,279
Did you get off work?

135
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,160
Let me ask you one thing.

136
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,459
You went there knowing
that Hwa Ja was the murderer, right?

137
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,529
Yes.

138
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,459
Dr. Baek told me.

139
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,800
Sol, are you insane?

140
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,639
I don't want to see you get hurt
while I work with you.

141
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,240
Is this only about
finding someone guilty?

142
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:24,709
No.

143
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,579
It didn't feel great to see
someone get convicted.

144
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,480
During mock trials,

145
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,990
I made it look so cool
when I demanded the death penalty.

146
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,820
But in real life,

147
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,220
it felt...

148
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,330
- awful.
- It's not easy...

149
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:42,730
to punish someone.

150
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,000
How do you demand punishment
on the accused?

151
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,570
I look back on myself.

152
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,899
I wonder if I have the right
to punish someone.

153
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,679
But I don't have such a right.

154
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,980
No one does.

155
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,539
However,

156
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,250
this is something
that some people must do.

157
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,350
Hyun.

158
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,149
I never knew back in college,

159
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,919
but you became pretty cool.

160
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,990
Gosh, you've changed so much.
It's unbelievable.

161
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,429
- In college?
- Yes.

162
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,000
- Did you even know that I existed?
- Of course, I did.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,899
You had those nerdy glasses,

164
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,799
and you always wore
the same clothes.

165
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,440
I sound like a mess.

166
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,809
You're the icon of metamorphosis.

167
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,539
- I'll go get some more stuff.
- Okay.

168
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,120
It's really great to have you here.

169
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,190
It's really great,

170
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,289
but...

171
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,230
I've changed too much.

172
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,580
It's lunch. Let's go eat.

173
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,149
- I'll buy.
- Really?

174
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,519
Yes, I'll buy.

175
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,889
Okay, then.

176
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,490
Let's go.

177
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,190
- Are you buying?
- Yes, I'm buying.

178
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,129
Hyun.

179
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,240
You must be Kang Hyun.

180
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,169
Yes. What? What is it?

181
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,210
I heard you have a study group
for the Criminal Code.

182
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,679
Yes, right.

183
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,309
Every Wednesday.

184
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,210
At my place.

185
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,850
I'm really interested
in the Criminal Code.

186
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,350
- May I join?
- Sure.

187
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,389
What?

188
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,220
- You?
- Yes.

189
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,899
You are charged with...

190
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,750
Hey! Guys, get up.

191
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,389
It's time! Hurry!

192
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,990
Hurry. Get up and clean up!

193
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,690
I said get up. Get up.
Get up and wash your feet.

194
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,330
This will take ages.

195
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,299
Hey. She's here.

196
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,769
She's here, she's here.

197
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,690
Hello.

198
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,129
- Can I come in?
- Yes, come in.

199
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,370
This is for you.

200
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:09,100
What's this?

201
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,370
My mom's kimchi. It's really tasty.

202
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,769
Thanks.

203
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,710
Tada.

204
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,710
Cup noodles and kimchi
are the best hangover cure.

205
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,779
Hey.

206
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,350
You brought me kimchi again.

207
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,250
What? Again?

208
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,720
It's nothing. Let's eat.

209
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,429
Hello?

210
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,740
Aren't you going to move in?
It's your moving day.

211
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,039
Oh no, I forgot.
Can I go now?

212
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:49,940
Thank you.

213
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,610
I completely forgot that
I was supposed to move today.

214
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,950
Hyun, see you tomorrow.

215
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,789
- I have to go.
- Okay... Take care.

216
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,789
Eun Sol, don't run.

217
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,070
I'm late.

218
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,269
- Hello, this is Eun Sol.
- Hello, this is Baek Beom.

219
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,509
Yes.

220
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,110
- Okay, I'll be there.
- I'll come right over.

221
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,750
- Give me the address.
- Where should I go?

222
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,350
- Macheon-dong, Songpa-gu.
- Macheon-dong, Songpa-gu.

223
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,220
- 1373-1?
- 1373-1...

224
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,159
Okay.

225
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,059
Yes.

226
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,360
Going down.

227
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,149
- Do you live here?
- No private questions.

228
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,649
Door is opening.

229

(Preceding cause:
The initial cause of death)

231
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,639
Hello and welcome.

232
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,730
It's so hot.

233
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,559
Check the temperature.

234
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
28℃.

235
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,370
- The heater's on in early summer?
- Don't even ask.

236
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,940
The blackout curtains
were drawn when we got here.

237
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,840
Who told you to touch them? Who?

238
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,779
No exact time of death, right?

239
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,279
With the curtains and heater.

240
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,350
They accelerated the decomposition.

241
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,289
I think you can request
an autopsy right away.

242
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:48,350
Okay.

243
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,919
Murder, right?

244
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,059
We need to take the bedsheets too.

245
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,559
As she is now.

246
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,659
- Yes, sir.
- Seal her hands and feet.

247
00:15:58,759 --> 00:15:59,960
Hello.

248
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,830
- Hi.
- Hello.

249
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,870
It's a female body. Her name is
Yeom Mi Rae, age 21.

250
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,240
She moved to Seoul and lived alone.

251
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:12,340
Last year, she sued
a courier for stalking.

252
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,350
- Can I look around?
- Sure.

253
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,519
- Thank you.
- Have a look.

254
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,080
- Something moved!
- What?

255
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,210
What's wrong with you?

256
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,149
She hasn't been
sleeping well. What's wrong?

257
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,120
Something in there moved.

258
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,529
They're maggots.

259
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:06,200
- Shall I collect a few?
- Yes, don't kill them.

260
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,930
Maggots.

261
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,359
Don't damage the scene.

262
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,190
Pardon?

263
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,730
Prosecutor Eun.

264
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,529
Did you close the drawer?

265
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,329
I saw her underwear.

266
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,029
Can't I do that? I'm wearing gloves.

267
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,769
- Who opened it?
- I don't know.

268
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,670
That's damaging the scene.

269
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,640
This drawer was open.

270
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,849
- I closed it. Record that.
- Okay.

271
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,180
Why don't you put a coat
on her and bathe her?

272
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,650
Are you here to investigate
or to pity the victim?

273
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,589
He's so mean.

274
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:13,000
Where are you going?

275
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:15,529
What?

276
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,039
What do you think
you're doing? Let go of me.

277
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,910
- You can't...
- Hey!

278
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,180
Do you think you're
that great, Dr. Psycho?

279
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,079
Darn you.

280
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,029
Sir, we'll transport the body
straight to the NFS.

281
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:50,170
- Dr. Ma will do this one.
- Okay.

282
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's go to the next scene.

283
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,819
Was there only one shoe here?

284
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,730
There's no way...

285
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,430
a killer would've taken off
his shoe and left it.

286
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,700
How strange.

287
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,470
I'll bring the car around. See you.

288
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,369
- An informant.
- What?

289
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,740
Give me that.

290
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,980
Hello? Yes.

291
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,880
Chungho Officetel. Yes, go ahead.

292
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,750
Yesterday, early morning.

293
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,549
A man wearing just one shoe?

294
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,150
Yes. He ran to a car
in the parking lot in the back?

295
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,819
Blood on his hands?

296
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,259
Then do you remember...

297
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:51,130
the car's model or number?

298
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,170
Okay, a gray Starex.

299
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,829
License number...

300
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,569
An eight in the middle.

301
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,509
Last number was a 2 or 3.

302
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,509
You got something very important.

303
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:08,250
Why are there no security cameras?

304
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,220
I don't know.
I think this is the place.

305
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,819
Hey, there's blood.
I see blood over here.

306
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,430
By the way, who was the informant?

307
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,029
I'd like to meet the person.

308
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,000
It was a woman,
but she hung up right away.

309
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,400
She didn't leave a number.

310
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,069
Excuse me.

311

312
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,150

Starex cars that fit the criteria...

313
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,490
in Seoul and Gyeonggi alone.

314
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,490
We can't check them all.

315
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,859
Are there that many?

316
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,329
Hey. That's funny.

317
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:56,329
- Our car showed up too.
- Really?

318
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,130
Did someone drive
our Starex last night?

319
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,700
- Lieutenant Cha.
- Soo Ho?

320
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,539
- Why isn't he here?
- It's his day off.

321
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,470
- He'll be at home asleep.
- He'll be in bed.

322
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,509
Hey, you, stop, stop.

323
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,650
Yesterday, early morning.

324
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,450
A man wearing just one shoe?

325
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,059
- No. Mr. Kang. A moment, please.
- What?

326
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,559
What is it?

327
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,769
What is this about?
Where are we going?

328
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,069
- Do you know where Mr. Cha lives?
- Of course, I do.

329
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,400
- Let's go to his house.
- Okay.

330
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,269
Hold on. He can't cut me in.

331
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,980
Yes, this is Baek Beom speaking.

332
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,089
I'd like you to perform the autopsy
for the officetel case.

333
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,119
Why?

334
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,619
The victim might be
someone we know.

335
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,160
- Run the database for the victim.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:05,299
She was involved in a case before.

337
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,529
(Courier Stalking)

338
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,970
She did file charges
against a courier for stalking.

339
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,400
Yes, that.
Who was the detective in charge?

340
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:13,869
It's Lieutenant Cha Soo Ho.

341
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,880
(Lieutenant Cha Soo Ho)

342
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:44,539
- My goodness.
- Hey, Dong Sik.

343
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,099
Prosecutor Eun.

344
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,940
What brings you here?

345
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,210
- Move aside.
- What is it?

346
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,279
What is it? What's going on?

347
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,319
This pair. Where's the other shoe?

348
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:10,329
I'm not sure. Isn't it in there?
What? What is this about?

349
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,890
Let's do a luminol test.

350
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,319
What did you do last night?

351
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,359
Last night...

352
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:40,730
I slept at home.

353
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,430
What is it? What's going on?
Dong Sik, tell me what it's about.

354
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,970
Lieutenant Cha,
you must come with us now.

355
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,269
Prosecutor Eun.

356
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,700
It'd be better than being arrested
by your colleagues.

357
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,410
What? Arrested?

358
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,269
(Partners for Justice)

359
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:59,940
Prosecutor Eun,
how could I kill someone?

360
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,210
Why are you lying?

361
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,240
This is a murder case.

362
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,339
Is it you or not?

363
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,009
I.. I don't know. I...

364
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:09,250
I don't remember.

365
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,250
You lunatic. You jerk.

366
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,849
Aren't you here to represent me?

367
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,849
If I believe everything
my client says,

368
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,890
I'd be your wife, not your attorney.

369
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:18,920
We will reveal the whole truth...

370
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,660
through an investigation
that's not tied to social status.

371
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,960
Even if so, you're still a criminal.

372
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,559
Your novel still stinks.
