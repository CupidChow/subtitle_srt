(Episode 31)

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,859
I told Mr. Baek that Han So Hee...

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,089
is alive.

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,760
I thought that was the least
I could do to ask forgiveness...

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,629
for what I had put him through.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,170
Mr. Baek will find Han So Hee soon.

7
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,109
You must make your decision.

8

(National Forensic Service)

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,679
Dr. Baek, are you sleeping
in here again?

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,320
You'll really freeze to death here.

11
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,060
What? He's not in here. Where is he?

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,990
The number you have dialed
is not available at this moment.

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,130
What's going on? Where did he go?

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,460
- Hello.
- Wait.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,929
Have you seen Dr. Baek?

16
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,799
He's probably sleeping
in the autopsy room.

17
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,700
No, he's not in the autopsy room
or his office. Something is off.

18
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,939
Great, he's not in here either.
Have you seen Dr. Baek this morning?

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,510
Sure, I'll be visiting you
this summer.

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,180
- We'll look forward to it.
- Are they your parents in the US?

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,920
- We'll look forward to it.
- Are they your parents in the US?

22
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:22,450
Mom. Dad. This is my colleague,
Mr. Jang. Say hello to him.

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,120
Hi, Mr. Jang. Thank you.

24
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,030
- Nice to meet you.
- What's going on?

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,530
It's a great honor for me to
work with Dr. Stella Hwang.

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,769
She's the toxicologist in Korea.

27
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,540
She's still a little girl to us,
but thank you.

28
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,180
You must be very proud of her.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
Mom. Dad. I miss you.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,750
- "Mom"? "Mom"?
- We miss you too.

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,049
You should go to sleep now.

32
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,750
- We love you.
- Good night.

33
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,620
Good night.

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,459
Pretty impressive.

35
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,329
No, no. I was so nervous
to speak in English.

36
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,969
Your father is involved in this.

37
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,800
Han So Hee...

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,800
is alive.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,009
(Dad)

40
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,150
Where's So Hee, Dad?

41
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,580
It's all over.

42
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,120
They already had a funeral for her.

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,759
After that accident
with that girl, So Hee,

44
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:34,030
I shouldn't have let
you be like that.

45
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,330
I should've done everything to...

46
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,610
(Partners for Justice)

47
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,449
(Lack of evidence: it refers to
inadequate evidence for test sample)

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,419
- Good morning, Stella. How are you?
- Morning.

49
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:07,289
Stella, are you doing anything...

50
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,289
for summer vacation?

51
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,330
I think I'm going to
visit my parents.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,129
To America.

53
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,370
As a matter of fact, I'm going to
a criminal reference in LA.

54
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,669
As a matter of fact, I'm going to
a criminal reference in LA.

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,099
- Reference?
- Yes.

56
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,539
You mean conference?

57
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,909
Yes, so...

58
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,439
It's an international criminal
conference that's like a reference.

59
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,909
How about this?
Since I'm going to the US,

60
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,050
should I say hello to your parents?

61
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,189
Say hello?

62
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:37,020
- To my parents?
- I can say hi to your mom and dad.

63
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,259
No.

64
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,530
- "No"?
- No. Why do you want to...

65
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,560
meet my parents?

66
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,330
- "Why"?
- I'm not looking...

67
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,500
for anything serious.

68
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,259
Sorry.

69
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,800
Goodness, what a nosy parker.

70
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,099
I went too far again. Goodness,
I overstepped my boundary again.

71
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,169
Gosh, you and I are nothing.

72
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,979
Meet your parents?

73
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,150
Okay. Have a good day.

74
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,349
Enjoy your summer vacation.

75
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,580
Stupid.

76
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,289
We will continue
the criminal trial...

77
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:13,460
in the Criminal Collegiate Division
for case number 218382.

78
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,990
Prosecution.
You may question the witness.

79
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,569
Did you talk to the victim,
Seo Jeong Min,

80
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,670
on the day of the incident?

81
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,810
- Yes.
- What was the call about?

82
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,480
He had something to tell me about
Han So Hee. He wanted to meet.

83
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,180
However, you didn't have a chance
to hear what it was about.

84
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,819
I found out later...

85
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,589
what Seo Jeong Min
was trying to tell me.

86
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,160
Han So Hee is alive.

87
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,790
That's what he wanted to say.

88
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,829
So Hee is alive?

89
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,970
That's nonsense.

90
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,240
She died 10 years ago.

91
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,019
Goodness, Prosecutor Kang.
Have you been well?

92
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,089
- Let me hug you. I missed you.
- Goodness.

93
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,589
Gosh.

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,160
- I missed you too.
- Okay.

95
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,889
You should come
by the office some time.

96
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,759
We really missed you around there.

97
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,399
Sure, I'll do that.

98
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,759
- How are you doing, Hyun?
- Well, you know.

99
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:27,470
I put my studio on the market.

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,300
I'm going to stay
with my mom for a while.

101
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,240
I see.

102
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,670
Oh, right.

103
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,579
Did you know too?

104
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:40,480
That Han So Hee was alive?

105
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Right, exactly.
Is... Is that even possible?

106
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,319
Didn't Mr. Baek's girlfriend die
in a car accident 10 years ago?

107
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,550
Well, I found out...

108
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,959
she had been in a vegetative state
for 10 years.

109
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,490
Oh, my.

110
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:55,730
How could...

111
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,759
that be?

112
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,930
Then what about Dr. Baek?

113
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,370
He found out only recently.

114
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,410
Don't do this here, and go back.

115
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,620
It's all my fault.

116
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,389
After my wife had passed away,
I was in pure torment.

117
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,290
I deserve to be called trash.

118
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,189
I shouldn't have done
what I did to you.

119
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,689
Why are you doing this now?
Whom are you trying to show this to?

120
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,459
No one.
No one has to watch what I'm doing.

121
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,769
I just want to soften your anger.

122
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,069
I still have nightmares...

123
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,600
whenever I think of you.

124
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,670
Just go.

125
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,139
I'm so sorry for what I've done.
Please forgive me.

126
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,980
- Just go.
- I'm so sorry.

127
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,879
- Go.
- Please, forgive me.

128
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,980
Go!

129
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,920
Sir!

130
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,449
I'm so sorry!

131
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,360
- Please forgive me.
- Just go.

132
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,529
- Let go of me.
- I'm so sorry. Forgive me.

133
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,000
Sir, please.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,060
Sir!

135
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,769
Go!

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,100
(Comments)

137
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,199
His driver is pretty feisty too.

138
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,699
You should just let him off.
I'm sure he paid you a lot.

139
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,870
I guess there are many ways
to rip money off of people.

140
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,939
I'm glad you held back.

141
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,839
Stockholders will cast their votes
without feeling too conscious.

142
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,709
Those pests.

143
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,620
Hey, drive properly.

144
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,850
Did you take his phone?

145
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:32,360
Yes. He has to put his phone
in the trunk while he drives.

146
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,959
I added that to the contract too.

147
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,790
Make sure you drive well, you idiot.

148
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,370
You should've behaved.

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,300
Pardon?

150
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,110
It happened between adults.

151
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:48,970
Lawyer Han.

152
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,680
Let's take care of this
like experts.

153
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,740
You can go out and get some air.

154
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,310
I'll remove you from
Sungjin Group's counsel.

155
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,050
Are you saying it'll be fine
as long as I stay quiet?

156
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,649
It's like bringing a knife
to a gun fight anyway.

157
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
You know that very well.

158
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,560
It'll only hurt you.

159
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
You can take a vacation.

160
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,470
Thank you.

161
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,370
I'll put my trust in you.

162
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,899
And let's grab dinner
after the general meeting.

163
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,509
My treat. Sure.

164
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,509
(Director Oh Man Sang)

165
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,850
Who else should I call?

166
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,610
Okay. Next...

167
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,980
Excuse me. You cannot come in here.

168
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,250
I have something to tell you.

169
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,159
You may leave.

170
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,059
Lawyer Han. What are you doing?

171
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,460
I'm here to see Director Oh,
not you.

172
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:52,299
What? What do you want to say?

173
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,210
- Apologize.
- For what?

174
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,940
Do you want me to state
what happened on that day?

175
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,950
So what?

176
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,620
Apologize and get your punishment.

177
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,620
You people...

178
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,289
really love an apology.

179
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,690
Okay, fine. I'll apologize.

180
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,899
I'm so sorry.

181
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,269
But I thought you wanted it too.

182
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,899
Anyway, how should I express...

183
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,769
my apology to you?

184
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,809
We're used to seeing
people like you.

185
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,240
Okay, fine. I made a mistake.
I'll give you what you want.

186
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,909
What did you say?

187
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,049
Director Oh,
this must be a misunderstanding.

188
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,250
Lawyer Han, don't be like this.

189
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,919
Do you love money that much?

190
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,519
How much did you expect to get?
Tell me.

191
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,820
I don't need your money.

192
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,289
Oh, really?

193
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,860
Then do you want me
to just apologize?

194
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,799
What should I do?
Should I kneel down?

195
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,929
Hold a press conference...

196
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,440
and apologize
within tomorrow morning.

197
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,870
Tell everyone...

198
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,509
what you have done
and turn yourself in.

199
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,879
- What?
- If you don't,

200
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,639
I'll do it myself.

201
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,649
But...

202
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,320
I thought you wanted it too.

203
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,330
Anyway, how should I express...

204
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,029
my apology to you?

205
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,440
I'll take care of her.

206
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,750
(Seoul Eastern District
Prosecutor's Office)

207
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,129
Hello.

208
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,960
- They're here.
- Hello.

209
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,659
Hello. Come in.

210
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,070
It's inside.

211
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,740
Hello.

212
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,509
Hello, Chief Ma.
You came out here yourself?

213
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:12,480
- Yes.
- Where's Doctor Baek?

214
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,509
He suddenly took the day off.

215
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:15,779
He never does that.

216
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,879
He took a day off
in the beginning of this month.

217
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,850
That was a business trip
to Jeju Island.

218
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,019
National Forensic Service
isn't stationed in Jeju Island,

219
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,960
so he has to go there for an autopsy
whenever something happens.

220
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,730
It's not like criminal cases will
wait for him to be back at work.

221
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,860
We'll have to keep working.

222
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,600
- Right.
- Yes.

223
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,269
How does she look?

224
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,970
What's wrong?

225
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,070
I...

226
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,409
know her.

227
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,649
(Defense Counsels' Bench)

228
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:51,720
Hello.

229
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,789
She was a lawyer
on Oh Man Sang's counsel.

230
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,360
Yes, you're right.
She was in the courtroom.

231
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,889
Don't you remember her?

232
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,230
It is her.

233
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,000
How does her body look?

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,500
We can know for sure
after we conduct an autopsy.

235
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,809
Current time, 10:05am.
I will begin the autopsy.

236
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,590
No injury found on the face.

237
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,559
No injury.

238
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,409
(Name: Han Ji Won)

239
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,289
Dermal necrosis.

240
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,759
There's a blister.

241
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,330
Looks like a burn.

242
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,659
Left arm, a burn.

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,059
Jang.

244
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,250
It's 325g.

245
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,149
Heart, 325g.

246
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,120
Scalpel.

247
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,029
Her heart is clean too.

248
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,259
I don't see any arteriosclerosis.

249
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,600
She was very healthy.

250
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,879
We found nothing.

251
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,509
She has a burn on her arm,

252
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,519
but it's a small burn that has
nothing to do with her death.

253
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,049
And she has no injury
anywhere on her body.

254
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:08,389
And I see nothing weird
in her internal organs.

255
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,190
Then what's her cause of death?

256
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,460
We'll know more in detail after
we go through chemical tests,

257
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,460
but for now,

258
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,700
there is a possibility
that it'll be unknown.

259
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,360
An unexplainable death?

260
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:20,330
Goodness, that's bad.

261
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,100
There's nothing
we can find on her physically.

262
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,500
Then why did she die?

263
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,870
We don't always find the cause
through an autopsy.

264
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:30,940
Goodbye.

265
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,220
I'm sure there's more.

266
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,490
What do you mean,

267
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,190
So Hee is alive?

268
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,529
She was in a PVS...

269
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,730
(PVS: Persistent vegetative state)

270
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,230
for the last 10 years.

271
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,600
(PVS: Persistent vegetative state)

272
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,200
Then she's hardly alive.

273
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,169
How much do you know
about that case from 10 years ago?

274
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,970
Do you want to know what happened?

275
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,409
At this point? Why?

276
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,679
It was fun to see you get wrecked...

277
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,039
without knowing anything.

278
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,049
Just live on...

279
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,519
without knowing a thing.

280
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,789
Live with that pain.

281
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:15,919
Yes.

282
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:19,690
Why do I want to know now?

283
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,799
You're arrogant to the end.

284
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you think you're so great?

285
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,370
Is that why...

286
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,340
you took the blame for
my malpractice 10 years ago?

287
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,269
I just wanted to
give you an opportunity.

288
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,840
I knew that you liked Yong,

289
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,580
and that his death tortured you.

290
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,019
I can take the punishment alone.

291
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:48,820
Beom.

292
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,259
If I tell you,
are you sure you can take it?

293
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,169
I detected a change
in her brainwave.

294
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,809
I want to run another brain PET-CT,

295
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,570
but I need her guardian's consent.

296
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,340
(PET-CT: Positron emission
tomography-computed tomography)

297
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,110
(Consent for Brain PET-CT,
Guardian's signature)

298
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,919
I was never going to tell you...

299
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,830
about the stupid scheme...

300
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:31,330
that Yong came up with.

301
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,070
Where are you going?

302
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,440
What's all this?

303
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,379
You resigned?

304
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,580
Just...

305
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,480
let me leave quietly.

306
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,120
What are you talking about?

307
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,279
Thank you...

308
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,190
for everything.

309
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,419
You.

310
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,360
You're pregnant.

311
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,400
How did you know?

312
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,799
You thought I wouldn't?

313
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,269
Beom.

314
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,670
Does he know?

315
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,869
Does his father object?

316
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:16,109
No.

317
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,279
It's not like that.

318
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,980
It's just...

319
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,380
I made my mind up.

320
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,579
If you leave like this,

321
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,549
Beom will chase you
to the end of the world.

322
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,190
Do you love him enough...

323
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,359
to leave him for him?

324
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,230
For him,

325
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,200
can you do anything?

326
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:45,670
Yes. I can.

327
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,839
Then tell Beom that...

328
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,910
it's my baby.

329
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,819
- What?
- That's the only way.

330
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,460
Yong was greedy to the very end.

331
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,890
He couldn't stand the result...

332
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,029
and killed himself.

333
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,869
Yes. So Hee's fetus that died...

334
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,700
10 years ago...

335
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,900
in the car accident.

336
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,240
It was yours.

337
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:35,220
(National Forensic Service)

338
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,059
Beom.

339
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,170
I...

340
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:53,970
Where's So Hee?

341
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,440
She's at a nursing hospital.

342
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:57,779
Let's go.

343
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:38,119
You cared for her for all this time?

344
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:43,990
I thought that would be the way
to make up for my sins.

345
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,230
I'm sorry, Beom.

346
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:51,660
It all happened because of me,

347
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,670
because of my foolish greed.

348
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,299
I ruined everything.

349
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,299
So Hee's like this...

350
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,079
because of me.

351
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,539
Beom.

352
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,150
Are you okay?

353
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,779
It means nothing now.

354
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,259
I died 10 years ago.

355
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:36,539
(Death Due to Multiple Assaults
of Rich Housewife)

356
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,960
You killed your wife.

357
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,789
Who are you making a killer?
How dare someone like you...

358
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,630
Is this how you hit your wife?

359
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,869
Live by the law,
or we'll meet again.

360
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,849
I checked Han Ji Won's call history.

361
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:15,880
- I found something strange.
- What is it?

362
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,150
She spoke to a producer
who works in the newsroom.

363
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,950
I called the producer,

364
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,019
and she had an important tip.

365
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,559
She said it was on Sungjin Group's
Director Oh Man Sang.

366
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,299
See? I told you that
Oh Man Sang would be involved.

367
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,230
What was she going to tell?

368
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,700
The producer doesn't know.

369
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,529
She died before they could meet.

370
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,630
Let's bring...

371
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,599
Oh Man Sang in and get a statement.

372
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,809
You really are an outcast.

373
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,150
- Kids these days are funny.
- A member of...

374
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,380
a team of lawyers
that defend Sungjin Group,

375
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,619
one of Korea's largest companies
was found dead.

376
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,559
Investigative authorities...

377
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,519
ordered the NFS do an autopsy
to identify cause of death.

378
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:03,960
As the team managed information
with a very sensitive nature...

379
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,460
The daughter-in-law
of a serving congressman...

380
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,170
was found dead in her home.
The prime suspect...

381
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,509
The title of Sungjin's chief legal
counsel is yours when you retire.

382
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:15,269
You're the only one who can manage.

383
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,839
Yes, sir, I understand.

384
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,750
I know just the right person.

385
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,220
Employees at her legal firm
voiced great sorrow and sympathy...

386
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,920
at the plight of their colleague.

387
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,720
Yes. It's about time that he called.

388
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,220
They say it's unconnected.

389
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,759
Hello, sir.

390
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,059
How have you been?
It's been a while.

391
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,269
You retire soon, don't you?

392
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:43,400
You remember all sorts of things.

393
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,670
Thank you.
I retire in about three months.

394
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,410
I should get ready to move.

395
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,349
Yes, yes.
Would you like a view of the river?

Prosecutor's Office)

397
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,470
Hurry up.

398
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,700
Ms. Eun. Oh Man Sang's here.

399
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,740
Is he?

400
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,579
The problem is...

401
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,849
That's why we play golf.

402
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,880
- I'll take you out one day.
- Thank you.

403
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:35,150
Would your deputy chief
like to join us too?

404
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm so sorry.

405
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,289
I'd love to tag along but
I don't know how to play.

406
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:42,990
- I'm into soccer.
- I'll hire you a professional.

407
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:47,069
A woman.

408
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:49,329
A month of lessons
and you'll be a pro.

409
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,569
That's right.

410
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,640
A woman?

411
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:56,109
You need to be careful around women.

412
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,380
You always end up here
because of them.

413
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,180
You're quite funny, Mr. Do.

414
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,400
Chief.

415
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:27,569
You're keeping my reference
witness a little too long.

416
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,170
It's been a while, Ms. Eun.

417
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,109
You know where
the interview room is.

418
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,779
Why are you here?

419
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,650
You're still as passionate.

420
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,049
Okay then.

421
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,250
Shall we go?

422
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,119
Yes, of course.

423
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,559
Ms. Eun, you stay.

424
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,690
Pardon?

425
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:53,259
Chief, what are you...

426
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:55,200
They gave me this.

427
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:03,380
He brought photos taken
the day before and...

428
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,680
the day Han Ji Won died.
His alibi is airtight.

429
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:09,509
We need to investigate to see.

430
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,049
Ms. Eun. Drop this case.

431
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,349
I reassigned it to Mr. Do.

432
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:17,990
I followed this case
starting at the crime scene.

433
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,519
Now you're reassigning the case?

434
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,029
See, that's why it can't be you.

435
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,299
You hold a grudge.

436
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,529
If you're like this, people will say
we're targeting Mr. Oh...

437
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:28,670
or that we want revenge.

438
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,970
I can stay objective.

439
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,809
Ms. Eun, the chief's right.

440
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:36,470
Let's be cautious.
Cases involving conglomerates...

441
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,009
aren't that easy.

442
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,180
They're complicated
and hard to prove.

443
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,049
They have so many resources.

444
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:43,980
Yes, that's right.

445
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,819
I'll be the lead prosecutor
of the case,

446
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:48,450
but let me keep her on.

447
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,660
I'll use her information
and leave out the grudge.

448
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,430
This is why I like you, Ji Han.

449
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,529
Go ahead. Do what you can.

450
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,650
Dr. Baek.

451
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,150
I've never seen you drink alcohol.

452
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,519
Han So Hee.

453
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,059
Did you see her?

454
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,660
Is something wrong?

455
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,230
No private conversations.

456
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,230
Stop.

457
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:36,099
Oh, no. Not you too.

458
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,240
I already had a though day as it is.

459
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,940
Gosh. Ma'am, give us
another shot glass, please.

460
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,710
It's definitely Oh Man Sang.
It has to be him.

461
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,180
But it's worse than
Kwon Hee Kyung's case.

462
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,319
I think Dr. Ma will conclude
the cause of death is unknown.

463
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,960
Dr. Baek. Are you listening?

464
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,559
See that couple over there?

465
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,859
What a cute couple.

466
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:06,259
Did they just start dating?

467
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:10,440
What a surprise.
You're pay attention to the living.

468
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,200
What do you think will happen
if the truck behind them hits them?

469
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,210
What?

470
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,740
That's what I see.

471
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,009
I see which bones will be damaged,

472
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:23,880
which bones will be fractured,
and how they'll die.

473
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,420
That's the life I led for 10 years,
and it became a part of me.

474
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,890
I didn't feel anything...

475
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,160
when I saw So Hee again.

476
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:39,200
No. That's a lie.

477
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,970
You're lying to yourself.

478
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,900
The Dr. Baek whom
I've seen so far isn't like that.

479
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,839
Whenever you open your mouth,
you spit out harsh words,

480
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,940
and you don't know
how to be social at all,

481
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,640
but that's not the real you.

482
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,309
- Don't write a novel.
- I'm not writing a novel.

483
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:59,119
To me, the last two months
have been real like documentaries.

484
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,289
Before I met you,

485
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:03,819
I thought it was all over
after we die.

486
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,730
Corpses. Autopsies.

487
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,059
Just the very thought was scary,
and I wanted to avoid it.

488
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,630
But after seeing you,
I realized that...

489
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,430
I shouldn't avoid it.

490
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,640
Someone's life can be seen
through the corpse.

491
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,170
And there's someone
who can recognize it.

492
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,109
Don't avoid it.

493
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,180
Keep trying until the end.

494
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,450
This is what you taught me.

(National Forensic Service)

496
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,240
The National Forensic Service...

497
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,710
has taken keen interest
in this very case.

498
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,009
That's why I, the chief, am
in charge of this case.

499
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,539
I see. I'm sure of it.

500
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,079
- Last time...
- Dr. Ma...

501
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,720
has become more enthusiastic
than before.

502
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,920
We have found out the cause.

503
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,049
- Yes, I can see what you mean.
- As you can see,

504
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,920
we only proceed our procedures
based on accurate scientific claims.

505
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,490
Did you find anything?

506
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,359
Nothing, nothing. Total nothing.

507
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,660
What should we do?

508
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,859
- What? You found nothing?
- No.

509
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:22,470
I didn't find any drugs
or any toxic substances.

510
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,740
She's completely clean.

511
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,240
Except for the drugs or toxic
substances, there's no other lead?

512
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,309
First of all, we don't see
any external injuries...

513
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,210
that could lead to death.

514
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,279
Secondly,

515
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,680
we didn't find any fatal diseases
from her organs.

516
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,119
That's why we checked
for toxic substances.

517
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,119
Then is the cause of death unknown?

518
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,789
An autopsy doesn't always lead
to a cause of death.

519
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,799
He has an ironclad alibi.

520
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,000
If the cause of death is unknown,

521
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,470
we'll get nowhere
with our investigation.

522
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,880
Where's Dr. Baek? Where did he go?

523
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,880
I think Dr. Ma and Dr. Baek seem
to have switch places.

524
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,519
Dr. Ma always works late,
and Dr. Baek has fell off the radar.

525
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,450
And today, he took the day off.

526
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,049
It's his 1st day off ever since
he started here 10 years ago.

527
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,460
- I see. A day off?
- Yes.
