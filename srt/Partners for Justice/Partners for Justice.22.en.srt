(Episode 22)

2
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,789
Heart diseases are the second
leading cause of death in Korea.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,489
It is common...

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,660
but is also dangerous
at the same time.

5
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,070
As the average number of years
increased, the prevalence rate...

6
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,750
The prevalence rate has been
increasing rapidly.

7
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,359
Patients who have coronary artery
disease and renal failure...

8
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,390
may recover quickly...

9
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,270
What's going on? Can't you see
that I'm giving a lecture here?

10
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,810
We meet again, Dr. Lee Hye Seong.

11
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,450
- What's this about?
- On June 11, 2018,

12
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,120
did you meet with Mr. Seo?

13
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,549
I don't know him.

14
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:29,189
On June 2, 4, and 5, 2018...

15
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,170
at 3:24pm, 8:17pm,
and 6:50pm respectively,

16
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,370
you and Mr. Seo talked on the phone.

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,670
Should I continue and explain
why you two talked?

18
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,239
It was to trade the security camera
footage of the drug supply room...

19
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,680
in Seon Hospital with the record
that you punched into...

20
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,519
- that room 10 years ago.
- You made me do it.

21
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,219
Let's talk in private
before it gets messier.

22
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,620
I have everything.

23
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,489
Everything? What do you have?

24
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,329
The box tapes.

25
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,000
- What?
- To cover up your crime,

26
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,370
you cleaned the place spotlessly...

27
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,199
with box tapes.

28
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,169
But a piece of the tape...

29
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,240
was found on the scene...

30
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,909
with saliva.

31
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,710
Darn it.

32
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,870
You can't hide anymore.

33
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,719
Ms. Lee Hye Seong, according to
the Article 250 of Criminal Code,

34
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,219
you're under arrest for
the murder of Seo Jeong Min.

35
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,689
- What's going on?
- She's arrested?

36
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,460
You may refuse to make a statement
and consult to an attorney.

37
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,060
You may also file to review
if the arrest was lawful or not.

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
- Round her up.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,500
It's been you...

40
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,539
all along.

(The subject's DNA matches
with the suspect's DNA.)

43
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,769
The DNA from the tape
in Mr. Seo's house floor.

44
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,000
The DNA matches with yours, Ms. Lee.

45
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,410
You won't be able to
lie anymore now.

46
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,009
On the night of June 11, 2018,

47
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,079
you visited the victim.

48
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,870

00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,939
Why did you...

51
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,579
have to go that far?

52
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,910
Why?

53
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,279
I couldn't hold it back anymore.

54
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,959
This was from 10 years ago,
so it was difficult to find.

55
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,589
I also pass along
Prosecutor Kang's advice.

56
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,730
He wants you to stop doing this.

58
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,769
Mr. Kang's instructions end here,

59
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,910
but I won't let you walk away
until we catch Baek Beom.

60
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,050
- See you later.
- You said this was the last time.

61
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,850
Don't get the wrong idea
just because we made a trade.

62
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:19,850
I'm an investigator
at the prosecutors' office.

63
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,560
I heard you're aiming to become
the hospital's director.

64
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:27,459
Your license will be revoked.
You think that'd be possible then?

(Zolpidem)

67
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,420
What brings you here
all of a sudden?

68
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,519
I did everything you asked me to do.

69
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,420
- Let me walk away now.
- Have you gone mad?

70
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,160
For whose benefit?

71
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Do you know how much
it took for me to get here?

72
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,860
You got here
thanks to money and power...

73
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,600
while covering up
your medical malpractice.

74
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,069
What?

75
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,269
You blamed Baek Beom for
your malpractice 10 years ago.

76
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,009
Did you think I had no idea?

77
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,480
But I have no idea...

78
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,180
why he took the blame
for what you've done.

79
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,279
What?

80
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,250
You shouldn't even
be called a doctor.

81
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,550
You're just a criminal.

82
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:29,920
Wait, no.

83
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,889
Are you a murderer?

84
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,029
You killed someone with your hands.

85
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,290
Who do you think you are?

86
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,829
Who do you think you are
to talk to me like that?

87
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,939
Don't say another word
and just do as I tell you...

88
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,240
if you don't want to get locked up.

89
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,509
I'm glad you're here.
Give me a second.

90
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,290
He brought it upon himself.

91
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,570
You injected two shots
you prepared into him,

92
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,879
then rubbed Mr. Seo's
fingerprint on the syringe...

93
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,509
to make it look like
he killed himself.

94
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,750
Then you destroyed evidence.

95
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,840
Your lies...

96
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,980
have come to an end.

97
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,659
I killed...

98
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,799
I'm a doctor.

99
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,230
I save people.

100
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,100
But...

101
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,299
But what...

102
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,210
have I done?

103
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,340
You can stop pretending.

104
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,350
You may have escaped...

105
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,610
taking the responsibility after
killing someone in an operation.

106
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,220
But not anymore.

107
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,190
Your eyes look similar...

108
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,360
to Yong's.

109
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:32,070
I used to like him 10 years ago.

110
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,169
But everyone had their eyes
on Han So Hee.

111
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,779
Both Yong and Beom.

112
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,350
They both liked her.

113
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,750
What was so special about a nurse...

114
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,850
who was from an orphanage?

115
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,789
When I heard...

116
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,159
she was on the verge of death
because of a car accident,

117
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,370
I hoped that Yong would
finally notice me.

118
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:05,539
My life ended...

119
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,039
when he died.

120
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,710
I couldn't sleep a day
without pills.

121
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,610
I couldn't live.

122
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,850
I mean it.

123
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,490
My life could have been
better than this mess.

124
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,929
It's all because of Baek Beom.

125
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:28,960
No.

126
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,460

132
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,610
I didn't. It smells awful.

133
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,809
You don't even put a mask on...

134
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,820
because the scent provides
information. Didn't you miss this?

It's the smell of your home.

become so talkative?

165
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,690
This person has 4 needle marks
on their body, not 2.

166
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,590
Look.

167
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,840
Even a left-handed person
could inject themselves there.

168
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,639
Then did this person commit suicide?

169
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,039
Wrong question.

170
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,610
It should be, "Which one of them
was injected by themselves?"

171
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,490
2007...

172
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,389
2007... 2008...

173
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,429
2008.

174
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,639
Let's see.

175
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,710
Found it.

176
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,980
Yes?

177
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,789
Prosecutor Eun, I found
Kang Yong's medical records.

178
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,590
It was May 26, 2008.

179
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,490
He was prescribed with antibiotics
and a tetanus shot.

180
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,000
He was pricked by a needle
while operating.

181
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,509
Doctor Kang.

182
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,009
Two injections.

183
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,369
(Prescription Record)

184
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,369
Your older brother...

185
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,569
was left-handed, right?

186
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,880
Look.

187
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,680
On the back of his right hand
were two more injection marks.

188
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,690
These are records of the injections.

189
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,049
(Injection marks)

190
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,819
(Prescription Record)

191
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,130
(Injection marks)

192
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:38,529
Those were injectable
with his left hand.

193
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,000
Your brother.

194
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,869
Type of death.

195
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,769
Suicide.

196
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:54,049
As the lead prosecutor
on the 10-year-old case,

197
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,250
that is my conclusion.

198
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:25,710
(Injection marks)

199
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:56,410
It's all my fault.

200
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,680
Prosecutors are human too.

201
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,220
We make mistakes.

202
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,349
No, sir.

203
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,789
I'll take responsibility.

204
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,519
And do what?

205
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
Will you really resign?

206
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,200
If we resigned over one mistake,

207
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,130
how many of us
do you think would still be here?

208
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:26,640
You're supposed to
take this office after me.

209
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,339
Let's say I didn't hear this.

210
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,109
No, sir. I have...

211
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,079
no right...

212
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,250
to prosecute.

213
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:14,950
The injection marks...

214
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,460
on my brother's right hand.
Did you find them?

215
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,630
What?

216
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,799
Did you think I wouldn't recognize
a photo of my best friend?

217
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:31,500
Mr. Seo.

218
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,809
I was going to see him that day.

219
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,710
I'm Seo Jeong Min from
the Prosecutor's Office.

220
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,380
Do you know what day it is today?

221
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,220
It's Han So Hee's birthday.

222
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,349
He wanted to tell me
something about So Hee,

223
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,289
so we arranged to meet at
the orphanage they were from.

224
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,130
He didn't show up.

225
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,500
He had met So Hee at the orphanage.

226
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,140
She was like a mom to him.

227
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,839
He never lived far from
the orphanage.

228
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,309
Does Mr. Seo's grudge...

229
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,849
against Lee Hye Seong
have something to do with me?

230
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,190
It's 10 years old.
It was hard to find.

231
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,859
He got something on her.

232
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:32,900
He threatened her with it
to get the security footage...

233
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,569
of outside the drug cabinet...

234
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,000
on the day my brother died.

235
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,670
He thought it was
decisive evidence that...

236
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,809
you had killed my brother.

237
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:54,289
We found this
when we searched your place.

238
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,119
If you'd killed my brother,

239
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,890
you wouldn't have
kept it for so long.

240
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,200
Why did you steal the drugs?

241
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,599
I regained consciousness
a week after the car accident.

242
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,319
That's when I realized
So Hee was dead.

243
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,460
I wasn't in my right mind.

244
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,839
What have you done?

245
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,140
Why are you the only one back?

246
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,880
- Let go of me.
- Where's So Hee?

247
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,680
How... How could you...

248
00:22:57,849 --> 00:22:59,079
I'm pregnant.

249
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,750
It's Kang Yong's baby.

250
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:08,089
It had to be you, didn't it?

251
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,859
You selfish jerk. So...

252
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,430
So you killed her?

253
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,099
Tell me. Is that why you killed her?

254
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,410
Yes.

255
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,480
It's all my fault.

256
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,480
I should've stopped her.

257
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:34,490
I should've stopped her
from the start.

258
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,420
I got too greedy.

259
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,160
So I...

260
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,329
There's no point, Yong. It's over.

261
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:55,069
Her fetus.

262
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,509
It was a girl.

263
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,220
You don't know anything.

264
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,029
That was the last I saw of him.

265
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,559
Then...

266
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,400
what were these?

267
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:36,009
(Succinylcholine, sodium pentothal)

268
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,829
It was for myself.

269
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,849
I couldn't do it.

270
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:14,990
I turned into a coward.

271
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,900
That's it.

272
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,680
Now I get it.

273
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:46,279
It took me 10 years...

274
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,490
to find out the truth.

275
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,980
(Partners for Justice)

(Ligature Marks:
Marks left by tying)

277
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,569
Dad!

278
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,299
Goodness, again?
This is driving me crazy.

279
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:22,609
Dad.

280
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:31,359
Dad.

281
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:36,460
Dad. Dad?

282
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:50,880
Gosh, no way.

283
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,140
(June 18, 3:04am,
discovery of Yeom Sang Goo's death)

(Yeom Dae Sik,
Yeom Sang Goo's second son)

00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,420
Gosh, why isn't he answering?

(Dae Sik)

287
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,789
Hey, come on. Answer the phone.

(Yeom Dae Chul,
Yeom Sang Goo's first son)

289
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:12,500
You answer it. You know
I worked until late today.

290
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,569
I just came back
from my shift at the restaurant.

291
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:24,910
Gosh, why is this brat calling me
in the middle of the night?

292
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,849
- Hello?
- Dae Chul.

293
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:32,549
Wake up. Dad passed away.

294
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:33,589
What?

295
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,089
- What did you say?
- Dad is dead!

296
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,549
There's something you don't know.

297
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,430
Director, you're here.

298
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,799
Was there anyone
who came for a visit?

299
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:21,869
No, no one came to
visit the patient.

300
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,500
Right. A while ago,
a prosecutor visited.

301
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,599
A prosecutor?

302
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:34,079
About what happened 10 years ago,

303
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,319
that wasn't the whole story.
