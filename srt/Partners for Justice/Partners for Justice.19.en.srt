1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,810
It's Mr. Seo.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,879
My investigator's in there!
Jeong Min's in there!

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,880
Other than the head injury
and the injection mark,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,519
we found no external traumas.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,480
Sodium pentothal?

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,990
I have Mr. Seo's
call history from yesterday.

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,420
You cannot continue
Seo Jeong Min's autopsy.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,589
- Based on what grounds?
- Destruction of evidence.

9
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,429
You can't perform the autopsy...

10
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,129
since you killed him.

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,240
The last person Mr. Seo called...

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,909
was you!

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,149
(Call History)

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,060
Mr. Baek Beom,
you're under arrest...

15
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,189
for the murder of Seo Jeong Min
as of now.

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,329
You have the right
to remain silent...

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,899
and to deny saying anything
that can be used against you.

18
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,469
You have the right to an attorney.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,429
And you may request a review
of legality for confinement...

20
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,200
to the competent court.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,780
What's going on?

22
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,950
Prosecutor Kang,
what are you talking about?

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,549
Who killed whom?

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,219
Please leave, you two.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,019
What about the autopsy?

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,310
It's been a while, Dr. Baek.

27
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:42,739
Let us go.

28
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,959
Let's get ready.

29
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,669
You must remain in the office
until the autopsy is over.

30
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,310
Get out. This is my office.

31
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,439
He might destroy evidence,
so don't let him touch anything.

32
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,479
Okay.

33
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,360
What happened, Hyun?

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,930
The last person Mr. Seo talked to
before he died was...

35
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,530
- Baek Beom.
- What?

36
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,460
Dr. Baek doesn't have
an alibi for last night,

37
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,069
and we found sound evidence too.

38
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,699
The autopsy probably started.
Let's go.

39
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,979
(Medical Examiner Baek Beom)

40
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,930
Thank you for coming over
in such a short notice.

41
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,069
Current time, 10 o'clock on the dot.

42
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,770
I will begin the autopsy.

43
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,419
Right side of the forehead,
laceration.

44
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,949
"Right side of the forehead,
laceration".

45
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:46,659
Two needle marks on
the brachial artery of left arm.

46
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,870
"Two needle marks on
the brachial artery of left arm".

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,639
How old do these look?

48
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,870
I'm not sure.
But they don't seem too old.

49
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,810
- Take a good picture.
- Yes.

50
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,139
Do a close-up too.

51
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,289
Overall, I don't see
much external injury...

52
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,729
or any damages done
by an external force.

53
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,560
He has short nails too.

54
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,069
Okay. Let's cut him up.

55
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,910
Rib cutter.

56
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,680
(Rib cutter: equipment used
to cut through ribs)

57
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:36,949
Scalpel.

58
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,089
Send this down to
Toxic Substances Division.

59
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,990
Let's shave his head.

60
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:59,339
This is too much, Hyun.

61
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,470
I know.

62
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,579
But you have to watch it.

63
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:05,939
You must keep your eyes on this...

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,279
to reveal the truth.

65
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,620
This is the last story...

66
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,420
that Mr. Seo is telling us.

67
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,660
Around the laceration of
his right forehead,

68
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,360
I see bleeding under his scalp...

69
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,829
and linear fraction of skull.

70
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,430
(Bleeding under scalp:
Caused by scalp skin damage)

71
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,970
(Linear fraction: A fraction that
causes lines on the bone)

72
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,079
I also see subdural hemorrhage
where he bled under the scalp.

73
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,750
Does that mean
he was severely injured?

74
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,050
(Subdural hemorrhage:
Epidural bleeding)

75
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,449
It's too early to say so.

76
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,589
Let us wrap up.

77
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,810
Thank you, Professor Pyo.

78
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,209
Prosecutor Eun Sol of
Seoul Eastern District.

79
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,819
I've heard a lot about you.

80
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,350
Nice to meet you, Prosecutor Eun.

81
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,420
- What do you think?
- First off,

82
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,560
I don't see anything else
other than the head injury...

83
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,720
and the needle marks.

84
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,860
If there was a physical fight,

85
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,160
there should be assault marks
or oppression wounds...

86
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,230
that can show how someone else
was involved in his death.

87
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,529
But there's nothing like that.

88
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,600
I'll have to refrain from
sharing my thoughts...

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,339
until we have the result from
the Toxic Substances Division.

90
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,310
Yes. I understand.

91
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,240
You said everything was done.

92
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,209
Where else will we find
better evidence than this?

93
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,740
- Hyun.
- No, it's still not enough.

94
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,079
If we get into this in a hurry
and then end up losing him,

95
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,050
- we'll never be able to get him.
- There's no way we'll lose him.

96
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,819
The security footage shows that
he stole the drugs.

97
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,420
Jeong Min, we're almost there.

98
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,259
Trust me and give me
just a little more time.

99
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,259
Take this.

100
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,670
Tomorrow's your birthday.

101
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,100
It's So Hee's birthday already?

102
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,339
Right, you said your birthday is
the same day as Ms. Han.

103
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,470
You gave her the same birthday
at the orphanage...

104
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,079
because you didn't want her to be
made fun of for not knowing the day.

105
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,209
You remembered that?

106
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,350
Jeong Min, I can never give up
on Ms. Han's case...

107
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,290
and my brother's case.

108
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,060
I will find out the truth
no matter what happens.

109
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,459
Baek Beom, that jerk.

110
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,889
I thought this was
enough to get him.

111
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,000
I couldn't protect him.

112
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,240
It's not your fault.

113
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,240
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
- It is my fault.

114
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,350
I was too indecisive.
I just kept him waiting.

115
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,690
I'll never make
the same mistake twice.

116
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,299
Make sure you change
the formalin for the fixed tissues.

117
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,070
(Fixed tissues:
tissues fixed with formalin)

118
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,799
(Formalin: a type of preservative)

119
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,450
This is so wrong.
It's not like he's a criminal.

120
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,019
What's going on?
What are we going to do?

121
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,590
Dr. Baek will be turned into
a suspect for this case...

122
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,919
and will be escorted
to the prosecutor's office.

123
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,200
He could've gone to the office
himself to be questioned.

124
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,330
He is a public official...

125
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,070
who's been working here
for 10 years.

126
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,799
Actually, that is exactly why
we need to detain him.

127
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,000
He's an expert who has worked
at the National Forensic Service...

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,539
for over 10 years. He knows
everything about forensics.

129
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,179
He may not run away,

130
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,840
but he surely can
attempt to destroy evidence.

131
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,950
What?

132
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:53,370
We should get going too.

133
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,629
Okay.

134
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,570
You two.

135
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,870
Are you really going to
do this to Dr. Baek?

136
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,570
This is so wrong.

137
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,309
Well, we are also...

138
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:07,279
Prosecutor Eun, I'm so sorry
that you got hurt last time...

139
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,519
and got stuck in the autopsy room
because of me.

140
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,379
But that's my fault.

141
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,019
Dr. Baek even stitched up your hand.
Don't you think this is too much?

142
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Prosecutor Eun.

143
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,159
Investigate thoroughly
and objectively,

144
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,029
and please reveal the truth.

145
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,399
I promise to do that.

146
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,639
Darn it.

147
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,539
Do you have some lab-made alcohol?

148
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,309
Here it is.

149
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,889
Aren't you angry too?
This is just wrong.

150
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,690
Of course. This is
an insult to the lab.

151
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,960
This is so insulting.

152
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,029
Exactly.

153
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:57,100
They shouldn't do this to Dr. Baek.

154
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:58,559
Total nonsense.

155
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,529
They don't trust my lab results
and take all the samples?

156
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,600
- What?
- They even took the blood samples.

157
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,399
They did. Those and
the tissue samples.

158
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:08,409
They even cleaned the autopsy room.

159
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:10,740
As if we'd collect
whatever they dropped.

160
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,549
Doctor, stop drinking.
I think you had enough.

161
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,090
This?

162
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,750
Oh, no, it's not alcohol.
It's mineral water.

163
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,120
Can I have some?

164
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:29,590
Darn it, it's alcohol.

165
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,899
Mr. Kang.

166
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,370
Mr. Seo's call history
for the last three months.

167
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:37,669
Thanks.

168
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:43,740
(Call history)

169
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,379
Hyun, do you really have to do this?

170
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:25,779
There's something you don't know.

171
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,129
June 11, 2018.

172
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,690
2pm.

173
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
You talked to Mr. Seo.

174
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,570
(Call history)

175
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,899
7:30pm.

176
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:45,399
You left your home.

177
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,679
You took a taxi...

178
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,149
to Gangil-dong
where Mr. Seo lives.

179
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,549
At 8:35pm...

180
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,919
at Gangil Junction,

181
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,149
you got out of the taxi.

182
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,090
(Taxi meter charges)

183
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,730
(Direct debit)

184
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,129
Then at 9:05pm,

185
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,330
you entered his apartment block.

186
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:16,370
There's no security camera
on that block.

187
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,269
You must have known already.

188
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,669
But a dashboard camera
in a parked car...

189
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,639
was recording at the time.

190
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,179
Jeans and a hoodie.

191
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,980
Based on a comparison
with the base of a traffic cone,

192
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,379
the man's shoe size is 285mm.

193
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,789
Isn't that your size?

194
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,690
Mr. Seo opened the door,
and you went inside.

195
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:54,610
I bet that...

196
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,340
you had an argument.

197
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,279
What's the reason?

198
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,679
My sister died because of you!

199
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,750
Tell me! Just tell me.

200
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,919
A medical examiner?
You're a medical examiner?

201
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,120
You're a necrophiliac.
That's what you are! A necrophiliac!

202
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,659
How many lives did you take?

203
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,159
How many? Tell me yourself.

204
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,330
- Tell me yourself!
- Is there evidence?

205
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,460
Evidence?

206
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,799
You're done for. Do you get that?

207
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,370
You're done for.

208
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,299
You pathetic fool.

209
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,409
Wait.

210
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,809
You pushed him from behind
when he was distracted...

211
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,909
and slammed
Mr. Seo's head on the floor.

212
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:39,279
Then you injected him
to disguise it as suicide.

213
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:51,799
Then you took the glass
to destroy evidence.

214
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,299
Then at around midnight,

215
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,669
you returned home.

216
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,039
Don't write a novel
based on my life.

217
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:07,850
I'll see how long
your hypocrisy holds up.

218
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,919
Mr. Baek, why did you
meet with Mr. Seo?

219
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,950
I didn't see him.

220
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,919
Shall we talk about
motive for murder?

221
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,590
Mr. Seo recently procured
some evidence.

222
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,990
10 years ago,

223
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,629
at 11:02pm on June 4, 2008,

224
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,830
Seon Hospital's drug storage room.

225
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,470
You couldn't have forgotten.

226
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:29,330
On that day too,

227
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,840
someone died.

228
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:36,169
Kang Yong, a thoracic surgeon
at Seon Hospital.

229
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,379
My older brother.

230
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,149
Do you remember?

231
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,490
Wasn't he your best friend?

232
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,860
I bet it's the one day
you want to erase from your life.

233
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,090
Since that day,
you quit practicing medicine...

234
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,259
and chose to deal with dead people.

235
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,759
Did you think that...

236
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:01,830
you could hide the truth
of that day by killing Mr. Seo?

237
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:07,440
I investigated this case
for 10 years.

238
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:10,639
Now, I will wrap it up.

239
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,850
Do you know...

240
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,590
what grudge a person holds
when they are killed?

241
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,990
It's the fact that
the last thing they saw...

242
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,159
before they died was
the face of their murderer.

243
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,669
While doing autopsies,

244
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,740
you looked into the eyes
of many dead people.

245
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,610
The fear left in their eyes.

246
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,210
The hatred,

247
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,539
the resentment,

248
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,210
the grudge.

249
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,080
You saw them all.

250
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,210
You killed my brother, didn't you?

251
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,549
With the same drugs as these!

252
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,289
While performing autopsies,
you wondered...

253
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,829
who did it, how,
and who could be so evil!

254
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,799
But the real root of evil...

255
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,500
is you who's sitting here!

256
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,480
Why did you do it?

257
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,309
Why did you kill him?

258
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:56,849
Were you that afraid...

259
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,880
that the truth about Han So Hee
and my brother would come out?

260
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:02,220
Is that why you killed him?

261
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,160
Tell me.

262
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,430
Hyun.

263
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,089
- Open the door.
- Mr. Kang.

264
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,299
Let go. Stop it.

265
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
Do you know
how many people you killed?

266
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,099
Get the master key!

267
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:15,170
Kang Yong.

268
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,430
Han So Hee.

269
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:17,769
Seo Jeong Min!

270
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,140
- Let go!
- You can't play me!

271
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:21,710
I will not...

272
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,480
let you off.

273
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,380
This is the end of your life.

274
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,519
Mr. Seo's death...

275
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,119
will not go in vain.

276
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,930
I will investigate this case
jointly with the murder of...

277
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,500
Seon Hospital's surgeon, Kang Yong.

278
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,829
Same perpetrator, same MO.

279
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:50,369
You hid it for 10 years,

280
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,869
but not anymore.

281
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,880
I'll ask you one last time.

282
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,980
Will you confess?

283
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,819
I refuse to give a statement.

284
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:08,319
Okay.

285
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,390
Do whatever you want.

286
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:13,730
Put him in detention.

287
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,450
- Hyun.
- I'm sorry.

288
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,789
I couldn't tell you.

289
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,690
The secret you kept for 10 years...

290
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,759
was this?

291
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,259
It must've been so hard...

292
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,970
for you.

293
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,599
Guess what?

294
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:01,440
Knowing there's a truth
that I had to uncover...

295
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,240
kept me going.

296
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,410
That's why I must...

297
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,250
close both of these cases.

298
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,920
Poor Mr. Seo.

299
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,029
My heart breaks for him.

300
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,630
Poor Mr. Seo.

301
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,970
Calm down, Mi Young.

302
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,170
By the way, how could he die
so suddenly like this?

303
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,470
How?

304
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,079
Are you all right? Don't cry.

305
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,279
What on earth is going on?
Did they really arrest Dr. Psycho?

306
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,519
But how is he related
to Mr. Seo's case?

307
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,480
- It doesn't add up.
- You know how Dr. Psycho...

308
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,490
turns crazy when it's a homicide and
goes all out during the autopsy?

309
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,890
He can guess how
the victims were murdered.

310
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,930
- It's all based on his experience.
- Gosh.

311
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,130
Don't try to force
the pieces together.

312
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,400
But something is fishy.

313
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,730
Why was he the last one to talk
to Mr. Seo on the phone?

314
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,440
On top of that, there are security
camera footage and taxi routes.

315
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,269
Evidence against him is
more than enough.

316
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,170
Why are you reading that?
We already arrested the suspect.

317
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,509
A long time ago, Mr. Seo worked...

318
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,880
in the specialized narcotic unit
at Seoul Central District Court.

319
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,549
- Really?
- Yes.

320
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:23,990
Quiet.

321
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,359
Hey, be quiet.

322
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,599
I don't want to inject you guys.

323
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,359
You're a medical examiner. What do
you think about being a suspect?

324
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,859
Do you admit to all the charges?

325
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,859
Why did you murder an investigator
of the prosecutors' office?

326
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:02,289
Say a word to the deceased's family.

327
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:05,200
The arrest of a medical examiner
for the murder of an investigator...

328
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,869
has put the public in shock.

329
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,839
Both the prosecution and the NFS
are flustered by the incident.

330
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,869
The prosecution...

331
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:14,640
announced that they plan to file for
the arrest warrant this afternoon.

332
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,509
The prosecution directed all of
its resources to prove the case.

333
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,410
They announced
that they will investigate...

334
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,210
What now? What will happen to him?

335
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,349
Did you hear from Dr. Pyo Yoo Seong?

336
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,289
I don't think he's going to
take any calls from the NFS.

337
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,289
What?

338
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:33,059
We must do something
to help Dr. Baek. Please, sir?

339
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
We can't just sit here and watch.

340
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,230
("Suspect A Exercises
His Right to Remain Silent")

341
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:42,470
(Public Servant's Murder at Home)

342
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:48,710
It happened 10 years ago.
It was concluded as suicide.

343
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,710
But you want to bring
that up all over again?

344
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,349
Mr. Seo was investigating
the case from 10 years ago.

345
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:57,420
This is his second crime
after finding out about...

346
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,849
Mr. Seo's investigation
with the same MO.

347
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:00,450
We need to combine these two cases.

348
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,490
The victim was my older brother.

349
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,589
What?

350
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,059
What are you trying to say?
You're a prosecutor.

351
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,869
How can a prosecutor connect
his brother's case with another one?

352
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:16,269
To us, this will be considered
a personal revenge. Got that?

353
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,640
The suspicion is well-grounded,
and I have been gathering evidence.

354
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,009
Hyun, this isn't like you.

355
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,380
The day I put on my gown,

356
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,750
I kept this case
in a corner of my heart.

357
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,480
You became a prosecutor
with that intention in mind?

358
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,680
You did a very good job
concealing your true intention.

359
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,220
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,460
Are you going to carry this out
no matter what?

361
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,960
If this goes wrong,
you'll lose your job.

362
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,059
I'm prepared to do so.

363
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,099
You can't lead the case since it's
your brother's. What now?

364
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:49,569
I was hoping
you'd lead this investigation.

365
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:52,200
Me? You want me
to lead the investigation?

366
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:56,980
This act of nonsense...

367
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,440
should end with you.

368
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,750
What do you think about this,
Prosecutor Eun?

369
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,950
With this case,

370
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:09,150
either Prosecutor Kang
or Dr. Baek...

371
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,390
will end up facing the bitter end.

372
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,390
I'm aware that
this is a difficult case.

373
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,960
Do you think you can do this?

374
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,269
If you don't want to take this on,
be honest, and tell me.

375
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:28,339
No.

376
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,140
I'll do my best on this case.
I'll reinforce impartiality...

377
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,579
and investigate the case together.

378
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,549
- You're confident, right?
- I can prove his crime.

379
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:42,289
Okay.

380
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,420
A medical examiner from the NFS
murdered two people in total.

381
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,190
And like nothing happened,
he's been performing autopsies...

382
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,029
and worked there for 10 years.

383
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,529
Baek Beom.
His eyes did look unusual.

384
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,269
How dare he murder
an investigator from my office?

385
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:01,339
(Public Servant's Murder at Home)

386
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,609
Why are you here?

387
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:11,950
Did you watch the news?

388
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:16,890
Hey.

389
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,329
Why did you have to take Beom? Why?

390
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:24,529
Look what happened to him after
working with corpses all his life.

391
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,099
I'm sorry.

392
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:29,269
Don't let me catch
a sight of you ever again.

393
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,210
And seeing what has happened to him,
he'll never return to the NFS.

394
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,450
Uncuff him, please.

395
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,799
Why are you lying?

396
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,569
There's more, isn't there?

397
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:11,279
- You're hiding something.
- I refuse to answer.

398
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,250
Do you not realize
what's happening to you?

399
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:16,349
You shouldn't be taking
this stance right now.

400
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,750
I don't care.

401
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,890
If you keep this up,
you'll be indicted for murder.

402
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,990
Do you not care
about your future, Dr. Baek?

403
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,019
My future?

404
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,490
Nothing is certain in our future.

405
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,430
Except for the fact that
everyone will die one day.

406
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,630
What about the autopsy?

407
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,440
- What?
- Do you have the initial report?

408
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,809
What about the head injury
and the injection mark?

409
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:43,579
- What else did he find?
- It hasn't come out yet.

410
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,140
Is that what
you're curious about now?

411
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:48,210
Forget it then.

412
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,980
The arrest of a medical examiner...

413
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,119
- What's that?
- for the murder of...

414
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,690
an investigator
has put the public in shock.

415
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,390
- The prosecution and the NFS...
- Things must be hard at the NFS.

416
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,529
The prosecution...

417
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:03,460
announced that they plan to file for
the arrest warrant this afternoon.

418
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,269
The prosecution directed all of
its resources to prove the case.

419
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:09,900
As a proud investigative agency
of Korea,

420
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,200
they revealed their determination
to solve the case.

421
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,140
(Stella)

422
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,240
Forget it.

423
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,279
Mr. Jang.

424
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,849
Wait. Did you come here alone?

425
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,650
Yes, I brought fried chicken.

426
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,720
Fried chicken?
I can't even eat that.

427
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,589
It must be hard.
Gosh, you're going through a lot.

428
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,960
This is nothing.

429
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,230
Things happen when detectives
are working on the field.

430
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,730
It's all part of the job.

431
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:46,299
- You saw the news, right?
- Yes. Just now.

432
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:49,210
But what's going on?

433
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,339
Do you remember
when you were framed for murder?

434
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:54,980
Dr. Baek didn't even sleep
and raised the maggots.

435
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:56,150
You remember, right?

436
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,619
Yes, of course.
I'm always thankful for that.

437
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,259
Dr. Baek has a terrible personality,
but he wouldn't kill anyone.

438
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:08,160
Of course, I know he's terrible.
I know all about him,

439
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,500
but I also know that
he wouldn't do such a thing.

440
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,200
Then can you take action this time?

441
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,470
Take action? Me?

442
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:21,009
No, I need to recover.
It hurts here.

443
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:22,039
Please help us.

444
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,480
"Us"? "Us"?

445
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,680
- Stella is on our side.
- What?

446
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,289
- Are you getting discharged? Okay.
- I must get going now.

447
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,019
- Hurry.
- Okay.

448
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,809
Darn it. Who are you? No.

449
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:00,450
Who are you?

450
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,359
You scum. You little...

451
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,829
Who's there?

452
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:21,569
Hey, hey. Hey, you. My goodness.

453
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:23,700
Are you all right?

454
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,900
(Lieutenant Cha Soo Ho)

455
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,769
Gosh, this wound is bothering me.

456
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Hey.

457
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:37,049
Are these the convicts Mr. Seo
arrested at the narcotics unit?

458
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,349
Yes. Gosh, those are
some nasty criminals.

459
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:42,019
Most of them are still serving time.

460
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,390
- What about the ones that got out?
- There are only a few of them.

461
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,359
One of them seems fishy.

462
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,029
He was released on parole
for being an exemplary prisoner.

463
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,269
He lost touch
with the parole officer.

464
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,230
"Jang Tae Joo".

465
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,710
Tae Joo, that jerk.

466
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,009
He was getting ready to "fix
some people up" once he got out.

467
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,279
Fix them up how?

468
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,720
He said that he at least
killed hundreds of dogs so far.

469
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,880
He told me that killing people
wasn't that much different.

470
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,750
He's a total psycho.

471
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,789
Wait.

472
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,559
He killed dogs?

473
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,990
All the evidence so far
points to Dr. Psycho...

474
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,829
I mean, the suspect.

475
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:26,599
Do we have a report of the scene?

476
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:30,400
They didn't find any noticeable
footprints or fingerprints.

477
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,769
There wasn't even
a speck of dust in the house.

478
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,940
Did Mr. Seo's call history
show anything odd?

479
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,279
Nothing much.

480
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,809
Why do you think Mr. Seo
called him to come over?

481
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:44,220
Think about it.

482
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,920
Even we have never been
to his place.

483
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:51,819
What do you think
went on between them?
