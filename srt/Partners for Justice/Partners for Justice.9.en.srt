The curtains and the heater
accelerated the decomposition.

There's no way...

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,250
a killer would've taken off
his shoe and left it.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,750
This pair. Where's the other shoe?

- What?
- Give it to me.

11
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,439
The other one.

12

this is regarding?

20
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,030
Do you remember...

21
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,870
Ms. Yeon Mi Rae?

22
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,500
Yeon Mi Rae... Yeon Mi Rae...

23
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,909
Yes, yes. I do remember her.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,210
I think it's been about a year.

25
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,710
She sued a delivery man...

26
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,849
for stalking her. Yes, that's it.

27
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,020
- After that?
- Well...

28
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:28,650
The guy was put on probation...

29
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,259
- and had to do community service...
- No.

30
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,729
- I'm asking about Ms. Yeon.
- What?

31
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,530
I'm sure she's doing fine.

32
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,870
- Haven't you been seeing her?
- What?

33
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,939
Why would I meet someone
who's involved in a case?

34

What were you doing last night?

35
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,680
It was my day off yesterday.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,919
I had a drink at home,

37
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,490
- then slept.
- Were you all by yourself?

38
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,120
Yes.

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,960
But why? Did something
happen to Ms. Yeon?

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,430
Why are you lying?

41

Ms. Yeon.

44
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:29,349
I lied because I didn't want to
cause any trouble. I'm sorry.

It really seems like he has no idea.

What do I not know?

- What?

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,990
Lieutenant Cha.

50

found dead.

What?

54
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,840
What did you just say? Found dead?

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,310
Are you saying Mi Rae is dead?

57
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,750
It's not me. I didn't do it!

- Please, Soo Ho!
- Dong Sik.

we need his blood sample.

Yes, all right.

64
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,339
- Go ahead.
- What? Go ahead with what?

65
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,649
Hey.

66
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,550
What?

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,990
- Dong Sik.
- Oh, my. Excuse me.

68
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,420
Deputy Kang, what's going on?

69
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,930
Why is he a suspect for murder?

70
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,759
- What?
- Gosh, darn it.

71
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,129
Isn't it odd?

72
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,769
He's been using two cell phones,

73
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:58,399
- and he lied about not meeting her.
- That's his habit.

74
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,040
He cheats on women all the time,
so he didn't want to get caught.

75
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,410
So he's careful.

76
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,410
Prosecutor Eun, are you
suspicious of Lieutenant Cha?

77
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,379
- Stop it. You're jinxing this.
- I just...

- Darn it.
- Goodness.

00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:28,300
What happened?

81
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,439
Dong Sik, something has
gone completely wrong here.

82
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,970
- I didn't do it.
- Then why on earth...

83
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,410
What is it?

84
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,779
Will you give us a second?

85
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,079
Let me talk to him, okay?

86
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,949
Tell me the truth.

87
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,120
- Is it really not you?
- It's not.

88
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,829
Dong Sik.

89
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,800
You trust me, right?

90
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,670
Yesterday, I just had a drink
and fell asleep.

91
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,569
Do you remember everything?

92
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,670
Well, I... I was drinking yesterday,
then...

93
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,009
Then I... Well...

94

Come to your senses,

96
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,879
and look straight into my eyes.

97
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,949
Did you do it or not?

98
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,029

I'm not really sure.
I can't remember.

You crazy idiot.
How much did you drink?

103
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:20,879
I don't know.

104

You have to help me. I'm scared.

107
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,660
Please, Dong Sik. I can't.

108
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,889
Please help me. I didn't...

109
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,629
- What have you done?
- I didn't do it.

110

You're his senior.

113
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,470
How can you tell me to calm down
when your junior is like this?

114
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,579
I'm frustrated as it is too!
I'm just here to...

115
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,149
- It's driving me crazy too.
- Forget it!

116

117

You.

118
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,089
Make sure you do everything right.

119
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,560
And stop crying!

120
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,399

- 16 times.

Yes, sir.

134
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,169
The blade was on the top.
Was he holding it upside down?

135
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,220
No.

What do you think?

141
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,070
She died from suffocation
due to pressure.

142
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,500
And she was strangled.

143
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,340
- Strangled with hands.
- But he stabbed her 16 times.

144
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,039
None of the wounds were critical.

145
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:09,669
He toyed around with her
while stabbing.

146
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,539
And she was also hit on the face.

147
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,809
Her face decomposed quickly...

148
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,549
because she bled a lot.

149
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,350
Flies usually lay eggs
in open wounds with blood.

- Maggots. You remember, right?
- Yes, sure.

151
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,620
So who is this suspect
that you said we know?

152
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,000
Lieutenant Cha Soo Ho.

153
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,129
Good.

154
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:40,509
- What?
- I won't see him for a while.

155
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:43,039
How can you say that?

156
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,340
She was obviously murdered.

157
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,480
You were always
so considerate of the victims.

158
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,950
Now that you know the suspect,
do you not care about the victim?

159
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,120
What about you? You care nothing
about the pains of the victims.

160
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,620
I need to think like a suspect
when I perform autopsies.

161
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,659
That's how you can figure out
how their bodies were damaged.

162
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:02,730
If the culprit stabbed her
that much,

163
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,100
isn't it a crime of passion?

164
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,159
You usually do see
many open wounds...

165
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,769
- in cases with serious grudges.
- Don't jump to conclusions.

00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:11,899
And...

167
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,710
Never mind. Forget it.

168
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,149
Wait. Dr. Baek.

169
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,759
- Hello.
- Hi.

170
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,299
Do you have anything?

171
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:45,440
We're collecting evidence
to compare to what we have.

172
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,940
- He drank a lot...
- Get to work!

173
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:51,210
Are you wearing gloves?

174
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,710
- We are.
- Yes.

175
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,059
I'm done.

176
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,389
I'm done.

177
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,929
- You're done?
- Yes.

178
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,059
- Were you thorough?
- Yes.

179
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,100
Step aside.

180
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:11,990
What's this?

181
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,960
- What's that?
- "What's that?"

182
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,059
Covering up on site.

183
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,929
Shall I recite the manual?

184
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:20,000
- I saw...
- Shall I recite it?

185
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,429
- Sorry, sir.
- Pack it up.

186
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:30,679
Pack up.

187
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,779
What are the security cameras
for then? Accessories?

188
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,450
Why are you yelling at me?
I just man the office.

189
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,250
How long were they broken for?

190
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,789
For a few days.

191
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,289
The whole server was wiped out.

192
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,330
The repair guy's coming next week.
It breaks down often.

193
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,269
We have nothing on that night.

194
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,370
This is driving me insane.

195
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,210
Let's meet the reference witnesses.

196
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,379
Kim Joon Tae, 22.

197
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,450
Yeon Mi Rae's boyfriend
of three months.

198
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:16,960
Mi Rae...

199
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:19,759
I miss her so much.

200
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,490
It's hard, I know.

201
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,399
It doesn't feel real.

202
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,570
Her not being here...

203
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,840
A funeral is
a tough thing to manage.

204
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:33,539
My condolences.

205
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,039
Before her death,

206
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,850
did you notice anything odd
or out of the ordinary?

207
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,720
I was studying for an exam,

208
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,149
- so we didn't meet often.
- What about the day she died?

209
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,789
I was at the library.

210
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,389
I should've forgotten about...

211
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,460
the exam to stay with her.

212
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,830
It's my fault. This is all on me.

213
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,230
Did she...

214
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,970
recently tell you about
any concerns...

215
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,539
or worries?

216
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,710
That stalker.

217
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,080
That bothered her a lot.

218
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:17,350
She would jump and tremble
whenever her doorbell rang.

219
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,649
She'd say she was
too scared to go home alone,

220
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:21,950
but I didn't walk her back.

221
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,159
The courier who stalked her?

222
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,620
Yes.

223
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,990
(Seok Do Hoon, courier)

224
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,159
Courier Seok Do Hoon, 25.

225
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,299
Sentenced to community service
for stalking.

226
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,100
Did you hear about Yeon Mi Rae?

227
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,539
Who's that?

228
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,009
You're asking us?

229
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,480
You stalked her for months
and broke into her place.

230
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,039
You don't remember?

231
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,480
Oh, her?

232
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,620
She's the reason I'm in this mess.

233
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,450
Do you remember her?

234
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,590
- So what?
- You don't know?

235
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:58,019
The trial about how
I stalked her is over.

236
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,559
You don't take me seriously
because I'm a courier,

237
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,889
but she was interested in me too.

238
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,799
Why else would she smile
and give me coffee...

239
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,700
- when I came over?
- Okay.

240
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,670
You can dream all you want.

241
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,470
But stalking is a crime, okay?

242
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,009
You must've hated her.

243
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:20,210
To be honest, I was utterly shocked.

244
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,650
- I don't care what's going on...
- She was murdered.

245
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,420
Poor Mi Rae.

246
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,089
What?

247
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,019
She's dead?

248
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,890
Are you suspecting me?

249
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:39,700
What did you do on May 27?

250
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,630
May 27?

251
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,339
I played games at an internet cafe.

252
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:06,789
An internet cafe is a clear alibi.

253
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:10,859
Please check the time
he logged in...

254
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,759
- and the security cameras.
- Sure.

255
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,019
(Temperature at scene: 28℃)

256
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,619
Door closing.

257
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,460
Wait for me.

258
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,200
Sorry...

259
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,000
Going up.

260
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,710
I guess you're coming back
from work.

261
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,980
No private conversations.

262
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,190
You must be the assailant
during the autopsy.

263
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,150
Do you get that?

264
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,170
Mom.

265
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,369
Miss, I need some water.

266

(Chain of Custody)

269
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:23,390
This is a mess. What will we do
about Lieutenant Cha?

270
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,720
We shouldn't treat him like this.

271
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,059
What, then?

272
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,730
Should we blow up all the evidence?

273
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:32,700
That stupid idiot.

274
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,970
(Cha Soo Ho)

275
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,369
It's just too strange.

276
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,970
The blood stains on the wheel
are Yeon Mi Rae's.

277
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,539
Her hairs were also found among
those from the passenger seat.

278
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,779
The same goes for the blood on
the towel under the driver's seat.

279
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:51,250
The towel was the same kind
we found at the victim's home.

280
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,480
Get to the point.

281
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,460
The shoe we found
at the victim's house...

282
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,829
had Cha Soo Ho's DNA.

283

(A match with Cha Soo Ho's DNA)

285
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,500
DNA?

286
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,839
We find a lot of dead skin cells
from the wearer's feet and socks.

287
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,140
That's one more for your list.

288
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:23,250
Do you really believe
Lieutenant Cha murdered her?

289
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,119
I looked through his phone.

290
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,019
His wallpaper for his phone
was a photo of his badge.

291
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,160
He was serious about his career.
He wouldn't do something like this.

292
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,930
Do you know that well
what goes through a criminal's head?

293
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,730
You know those families who weep
for their dead children?

294
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,670
I sometimes find signs
of domestic abuse during autopsies.

295
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,670
Their stomachs are empty,
and their bones are broken.

296
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,900
- They've been bleeding for long.
- How long have you known...

297
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:47,710
Lieutenant Cha?

298
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,640
- Has it been about three years?
- Do you believe that the man...

299
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,710
you'd known would do
something like this?

300
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,119
My opinion isn't important.

301
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,519
He wouldn't kill someone.
Can't you see that?

302
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,859
How can we believe anything
a guy who can't remember said?

303
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,829
All the evidence is pointing
toward Lieutenant Cha.

304
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,759
I usually had suspicions
while having not enough evidence.

305
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,559
Never the vice versa.

306
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,130
It looks like... It looks like
a perfectly completed puzzle.

307
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,039
That's why this seems
even more suspicious.

308
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:19,940
Then find a piece that
no one can plant into the puzzle.

309
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,970
What?

310
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,779
- What's that?
- I don't know.

311
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,849
What is he talking about?

312
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:18,130
A shocking incident where an active
cop was involved in the murder...

313
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,069
of a college student
has taken place.

314
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:22,400
Cha, a detective in Violent Crimes
of Gangdong Police Station,

315
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,140
approached the plaintiff
of the case he was in charge of.

316
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,079
They already got wind of this.

317
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,650
Prosecutor Eun.

318
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,720
This can't be.

319
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:44,619
- I heard you wanted to see me.
- Yes, come take a seat.

320
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,799
- About Lieutenant Cha's case...
- Yes.

321
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,299
You should take over.

322
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:02,440
Have a press conference
with the reporters this afternoon.

323
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,109
Sir, this is my case. I can do this.

324
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,009
Deputy Chief Kang,
what do you think?

325
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,720
I'll take over, sir.

326
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:15,319
Prosecutor Eun worked closely
with Lieutenant Cha...

327
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:18,460
for the cases she had taken
on so far.

328
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,690
She might lose objectivity.

329
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,160
I've been investigating objectively,
and I've been objective for this...

330
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
- Prosecutor Eun.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,130
Do you know why our division is...

332
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,529
also known as Criminal Division 18?

333
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,339
Prosecutors, investigators, clerks,

334
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,970
and even the cleaning staff.

335
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,480
There's a total of 18 people...

336
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,480
who work at our division.

337
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,049
Don't try to stand out.

338
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,920
Then...

339
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:51,359
please let me join
the investigation.

340
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,589
I won't try to stand out,

341
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:56,430
and I'll help the deputy chief.

342
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,930
I'll investigate...

343
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,900
with Prosecutor Eun.

344
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:07,170
This is an interesting mix.

345
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,579
This is a press conference...

346
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,980
regarding the college student murder
at Cheonghong Officetel.

347
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:15,650
We have found out that A, who was
apprehended as a suspect,

348
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,779
was the detective in charge of the
victim's lawsuit against a stalker.

349
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,690
We have found out an active-duty
cop was involved in the incident.

350
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,460
We're trying our best to obtain
evidence to prove his involvement.

351
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,529
And a thorough investigation is
being carried out.

352
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,500
We will reveal the whole truth...

353
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,099
through an investigation
that's not tied to social status.

354
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:46,339
(Prosecution)

355
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,390
I'm Prosecutor Kang Hyun
from Seoul Eastern District.

356
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:03,460
- Are you Cha Soo Ho?
- Yes.

357
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:07,599
You're aware of
why you're here, correct?

358
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,630
Sir.

359
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,200
I really didn't kill her.

360
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:12,740
It's... It's true.

361
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,609
Your blood alcohol concentration
was at 0.3 percent this morning.

362
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,240
The night before,

363
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:21,609
- you must've been wasted.
- I only slept at home.

364
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:22,779
Are you certain?

365
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,089
What? Blood?

366
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:32,460
Yes, I think so.

367
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,059
You "think so"?

368
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,430
Do you remember or not?

369
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,930
To be honest,

370
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,240
I'm not sure.

371
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:47,369
You forced the victim to date you
with the information...

372
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:50,180
you acquired
while investigating your case.

373
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,710
Are you aware that the nature
of the offense is quite grave?

374
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,609
- Forced? I didn't do such a thing.
- Why did you meet her then?

375
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:59,019
We restored all the messages
and the call records.

376
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:01,650
You met 5 or 6 times
after she filed against her stalker.

377
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,559
And you met her again 2 or 3 times
recently. Isn't that right?

378
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,519
That... That was...

379
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,029
She was scared to death.
I only met her to comfort her.

380
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:11,730
She didn't have
any family members in Seoul either.

381
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,549
You should've only comforted her.
Why did you kill her?

382
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:31,950
What do you mean?

383
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,319
I'm telling you. I didn't kill her.

384
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,390
- You're lying.
- What?

385
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,460
If you didn't do anything to her,
why did you wash your hands?

386
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,559
You washed off Yeon Mi Rae's blood!

387
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,000
We only checked the basin
during the initial investigation.

388
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,430
We went back and
checked the sink afterward.

389
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,299
We found the victim's blood there.

390
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,140
(Blood Report)

391
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,369
(99.7 percent likely that it matches
with the victim's.)

392
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,279
That... That...

393
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:02,480
When I woke up,
I had blood on my hands.

394
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,180
I washed it off
without thinking much.

395
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,750
I don't know anything about this.

396
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,170
Sir.

397
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:27,140
How could I kill someone?

398
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,809
I really didn't do it.

399
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,809
I... I really didn't do it.

400
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:33,680
It wasn't me.
I'm telling you the truth.

401
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,279
Sir, please.

402
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,680
Please! I didn't do it.

403
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,829
I can't believe you.

404
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:52,329
You startled me.

405
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,029
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

406
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,799
You didn't find anything odd
about the corpse?

407
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,339
Usually, you show up
right about now...

408
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,339
and present
new, critical evidence.

409
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,509
What evidence?
Did you give me one to keep?

410
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,809
Do you not care if Lieutenant Cha is
convicted of the murder?

411
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,450
My gosh, you're heartless.

412
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:10,220
You worked with him for three years.
How could you be so heartless?

413
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,750
Just be honest.

414
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,019
Admit that you're not interested
because this case is too obvious.

415
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:18,519
Gosh, I was surprised to think
that a corpse lover...

416
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,690
like yourself
was taking care of a pet.

417
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,700
So you didn't find anything that
raised your suspicions this time?

418
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,160
Get out.

419
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,329
You are supposed to say that you
can't believe everything you see...

420
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:29,400
then incise, take photos,
and dig out stuff from the bodies.

421
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,539
This case isn't fun for you, right?

422
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,240
What? What is it?
What are you keeping in here?

423
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,569
My gosh!
