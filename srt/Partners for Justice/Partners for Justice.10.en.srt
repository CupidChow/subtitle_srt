1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,009
What? What is it?
What are you keeping in here?

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,049
Maggots?

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,449
Why are there maggots
in your office?

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,080
Goodness.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,150
(Episode 10)

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,660
You can guess how old a kid,
a dog, or a cat is at a glance.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,390
Yes. So what?

8
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:21,690
Just saying.

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,600
Have you been
feeling lonely recently?

10
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,839
Goodness. This is so frustrating.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,409
You didn't even knock.

12
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,030
Wow, are these your new pets?

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,829
So cute.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,770
They're perfect for you.

15
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,869
It was hard to bring them up,
so be nice to them.

16
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:05,099
- And do what?
- Find out its species.

17
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:09,609
Are you asking me to do a DNA test
to find out their species?

18
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:10,840
It's urgent.

19
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,680
I'll have to kill you
to run a test on you.

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,890
I'm so sorry, but I love you,
these are all lies

21
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,549
This is a press conference...

22
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,689
regarding the college student murder
at Cheonghong Officetel.

23
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,189
We have found out that A, who was
apprehended as a suspect,

24
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:31,599
was the detective in charge of the
victim's lawsuit against a stalker.

25
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,269
We have found out an active-duty
cop was involved in the incident.

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,400
We're trying our best to obtain
evidence to prove his involvement.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,310
And a thorough investigation is
being carried out.

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,209
- What?
- Come out here.

29
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:46,480
You can't go into a woman's house
even if it was empty.

30
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,379
You're human garbage.

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,650
Hello. Don't worry about it.

32
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,189
I'll give you a call.

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,230
What are you looking at? Walk.

34
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:17,740
I thought you hated
working outside the office.

35
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,210
You surprised me.

36
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,680
He was so obsessed with her.

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,180
Do you think he immediately
stopped caring about her?

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,819
That's what I mean.

39
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,620
Oh, there's a record of him
on the security footage...

40
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,159
logging in and out on the 27th.

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,860
The hours of the game he played
on that day has been confirmed.

42
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,430
He has a solid alibi.

43
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,469
- What about Kim Joon Tae?
- He's always in the public library.

44
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,740
He goes there in the morning
and comes home at night.

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,169
And on the 27th, he was
caught on the security camera.

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,110
They both have solid alibis.

47
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,580
Yes.

48
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,949
Let's go.

49
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,889
- There he is.
- How do you feel?

50
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,159
How did you kill her?

51
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,289
A police officer should not
do something like this, should he?

52
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,599
- Anything to say?
- Why did you kill her?

53
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,199
Do you have any accomplices?

54
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,930
- Why did you kill her?
- Excuse me.

55
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,969
- Please say something.
- Do you not regret this?

56
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:18,569
- Say something.
- Move aside.

57
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,110
Share something.

58
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,169
You know how things are, right?

59
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,979
The media is trampling all over you,

60
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,979
and don't get me started
on the public sentiment.

61
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,110
You can't get out of this.

62
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,520
Let's plead guilty and ask them to
consider that you were impaired.

63
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,020
Did you ever suffer from
panic disorder or depression?

64
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,060
What?

65
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:39,389
I didn't even do this.

66
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,530
The evidence is pointing toward you.

67
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,099
It's a bad idea
to keep denying this.

68
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,500
I thought you were here
to defend me.

69
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,270
So why won't you believe me?

70
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,610
If I trusted everything
that my clients said,

71
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,770
I'd be their wife, not their lawyer.

72
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,610
I'm sure you'd want to deny this.

73
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,879
But that won't last very long.

74
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,750
I've seen many guys like you...

75
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,150
while I worked as a public defender
for police officers.

76
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,090
Your life is over.

77
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,870
(A case report for the murder
of a university student...)

78
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:28,970
Yes. Okay.

79
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,209
Yes?

80
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,009
Yes, we will report on
the investigation tomorrow morning.

81
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,649
We inspected all the evidence
that we obtained thus far.

82
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,120
The result will be
announced tomorrow.

83
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,850
He's not there to protect and serve,
but rather to attack.

84
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,189
The murder suspect is
an incumbent police officer.

85
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:45,720
- You're a jerk.
- He's such human garbage.

86
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,629
These people are scary.

87
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,459
It's like a witch-hunt.

88
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:55,970
Deputy Kang, this is bad.

89
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,500
- Everyone's after Lieutenant Cha.
- Prosecutor Eun.

90
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,970
Seok Do Hoon had been fired
from his delivery company...

91
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,810
because of Yeon's lawsuit.

92
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,240
And it seems like he was
humiliated by Lieutenant Cha...

93
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
when he was arrested.

94
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,949
That sounds like
a legitimate motive.

95
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,449
What if there are dozens of
evidence against Soo Ho?

96
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,759
There are hundreds of suspicious
circumstances against him!

97
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,329
Prosecutor Eun.
Will you just sit around like this?

98
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,129
This is so wrong.

99
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,029
Soo Ho would
never do something like this.

100
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:27,129
He pretends like he's a big shot,

101
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:30,939
but he's just bluffing.
Honestly speaking, he is a guy...

102
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,310
who can't even kill an ant.

103
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,240
Prosecutor Eun, please!

104
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,319
Send them a note asking for
a cooperation, or give them a call.

105
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,420
We have no time.

106
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,959
Excuse me. Why are you coming?

107
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,860
You always need the front seat
to watch a fire or a fight.

108
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,069
I can't miss it. Hurry up.

109
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,410
Hwang, put that arm back in.

110
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,180
What? Why?

111
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,649
Your arm will get ripped off
if we get into an accident.

112
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:16,920
Oh, my.

113
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,990
- Legs down.
- Why?

114
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,029
Your legs will break in an accident.
And your spine.

115
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,769
Don't cross your legs.
Your thighbones will get smashed.

116
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,439
How do you tolerate him?

117
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,040
- Yes.
- Let's get going already.

118
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,660
- I'm not convinced.
- What?

119
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,490
With what?

120
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,529
Lieutenant Cha does not seem
like the murderer.

121
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,430
- Why not?
- He has no motives for murder.

122
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,139
- Let's interview more testifiers...
- I don't want your suspicion.

123
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,470
I need evidence.

124
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,110
Is it based only
on your gut feelings?

125
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,379
Yes.

126
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,350
For now, that's all.

127
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,509
Sol.

128
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,480
We're prosecutors.

129
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,819
We make decisions
and discern cases...

130
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,220
based on evidence.

131
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,120
I know you have
a sharp eye for people.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,290
But that doesn't work here.

133
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,100
Lieutenant Cha has been working with
Violent Crimes for over five years.

134
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,829
Even if he did kill someone,

135
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,870
he did such a poor job
to cover up for what he's done.

136
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,470
It could happen
if he was completely drunk.

137
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,470
Would you still do this
if I were the suspect?

138
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,139
Even if I was the suspect,
we must discern the case...

139
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,709
based on the evidence
that we can see.

140
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,449
No, I wouldn't do that
if it were you.

141
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,750
Even if all the evidence
pointed at you,

142
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,120
I wouldn't believe them.

143
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,319
Because I know you.

144
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:02,949
Don't.

145
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,120
That's the more reason for you
to never judge me.

146
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,430
I wouldn't take a case
where you're the suspect.

147
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,329
I don't want my judgment to be
shaken. That's a prosecutor.

148
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:15,100
Hyun.

149
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,870
You haven't seen
her autopsy, have you?

150
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,470
It looked like
it was done by a demon.

151
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,040
Lieutenant Cha may have been
completely drunk,

152
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,149
but he's not a demon.

153
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,620
(Prosecutor Kang Hyun)

154
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,220
What brings you here?

155
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,360
You cannot go in there
without an appointment.

156
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,370
You need to release Cha Soo Ho.

157
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,409
- What do you mean?
- He's innocent.

158
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,340
What are you doing?

159
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:35,679
These are maggots.

160
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,019
They need over 50 hours
to become this big.

161
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,620
- Maggots?
- The same ones found in her neck.

162
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,620
Take a look.

163
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,360
Okay?

164
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:46,220
- Release him.
- I can't do that.

165
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,360
There are enough evidence that says
he killed her.

166
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
And you bring some maggots to say
what? He's innocent?

167
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,629
Bodies lie when they get decomposed,
and people lie too.

168
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,799
But maggots can't lie.

169
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,009
Fingerprints found at the scene.
The DNA found in the blood.

170
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,879
You found these
clear evidence yourself.

171
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,809
What are you saying at this point?

172
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,509
You're still good at writing novels.

173
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,830
You caused the accident on purpose.

174
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,200
It was deliberate!

175
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,940
You're sorely mistaken.

176
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,309
Your job is to dig through corpses
to figure out why they died.

177
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,019
We're the investigators.

178
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,549
I didn't investigate.
I tested the maggots.

179
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:52,120
This isn't about cause of death.
It's about Cha Soo Ho's alibi.

180
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,529
- That's why he's not guilty.
- And who are you to judge?

181
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,330
I'm the lead prosecutor!

182
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,070
Don't you make decisions
based on our reports?

183
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,070
Prosecutor Eun.

184
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,769
Prosecutor Eun,
there's a huge commotion.

185
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,440
- What?
- The psycho doctor...

186
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,340
is fighting with the deputy chief.

187
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,779
It's bad.

188
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,549
What now?

189
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,779
The testing was done
without prior agreement.

190
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,679
I can exclude it.

191
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,789
Every specimen extracted
from the body during an autopsy...

192
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,320
falls under my jurisdiction!

193
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,190
- What are you up to now?
- I'm here to inform you!

194
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:29,559
In case a half-wit prosecutor
like you makes another mistake!

195
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,700
You're still...

196
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,539
just a criminal.

197
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,179
Your novel's still boring
after all this time.

198
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:50,879
Let me explain.

199
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:55,320
The maggots found in Yeon Mi Rae.

200
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,519
Black blowfly larvae
in the third larval stage.

201
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,090
This is the growth curve.

202
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,529
It takes over 70 hours to reach
the 3rd larval stage.

203
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,029
But the show starts here.

204
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,500
At 25°C, it's 60 hours.

205
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,799
At 28°C, it's 50 hours.

206
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,440
It takes 50 hours.

207
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,009
What?

208
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:19,279
The room temperature was 28°C.

209
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,379
If you compare it
to the growth curve,

210
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,250
she'd been dead
for at least 50 hours.

211
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,090
But the night before she was found,

212
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,350
a witness said that she saw
a bloody suspect.

213
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,460
Nonsense.

214
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,659
To figure that out,

215
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,460
Dr. Baek grew the maggots
in different temperatures,

216
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:35,990
feeding it rotten meat.

217
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,629
Mission impossible.

218
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,730
Then Yeon Mi Rae
didn't die on May 27.

219
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,200
She died on the 25th.
Soo Ho has an alibi now.

220
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,340
He does.

221
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,879
- The maggots were the witness.
- Maggots can't lie.

222
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:56,009
What? One more time, please.

223
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,620
Maggots can't tell a lie.

224
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,720
These squirmy things got us
when we least suspected it.

225
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,629
What happened?

226
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,759
I'll start over, sir.

227
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,100
Did the maggots really beat you?

228
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,539
The victim died on May 25,
not May 27.

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,539
Cha Soo Ho took the night shift
for a colleague.

230
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,740
He has an alibi.
The killer is someone else.

231
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:29,049
A trap was made
to frame Cha Soo Ho.

232
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,980
The killer was careful enough...

233
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,289
to raise the room temperature
to damage the body...

234
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,590
and blur time of death.

235
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,059
I put both of you on it
because it was a big case,

236
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,029
and it looks like you two combined
did less than the maggots.

237
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,169
I'm sorry, sir. It's my fault.

238
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,129
- Tomorrow's briefing?
- Canceled, sir.

239
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,039
Wrap it up, and move quietly.

240
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,269
Yes, sir.

241
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,110
Do you want to be the director?

242
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,309
Why would I want
that bothersome job?

243
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,580
There's a right way
to deliver the facts.

244
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,620
We issue formal requests for
cooperation to prevent such fights.

245
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,590
Who fought whom?

246
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,350
The prosecutors' office
was in an uproar.

247
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,590
You went over there with maggots?

248
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,600
(Director Park Joong Ho)

249
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,970
What's going on?

250
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:26,639
Hello.

251
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,169
It's nothing.

252
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,740
It's not nothing. Something reeks.

253
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,480
You fool.

254
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,320
Talk to me before
I use another skill on you.

255
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,649
Talk to me.

256
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:42,490
Director Park, you can't miss out on
such an opportunity.

257
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:47,129
That's true.

258
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,200
It is. Let's take
the credit for this.

259
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,399
Let the prosecutors sort out
their own mess.

260
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,970
"Truth-telling maggots".
It's a sensational case.

261
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,769
I'm not interested. Are we done?

262
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,740
We aren't done. Where are you going?

263
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,179
What an idiot.

264
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,720
Well...

265
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,389
I'm his superior.

266
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,220
I'll see what I can do with this.

267
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,299
The real killer is
meticulous and smart.

268
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,000
They set a perfect trap
that even the police all fell for.

269
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,940
- Seok Do Hoon's alibi?
- Not for the 25th.

270
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,440
Shall we have him followed?

271
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,940
If Yeon Mi Rae
was killed on the 25th,

272
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,779
what did the witness see
on the 27th?

273
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,549
That's right. We were on this wild
goose chase because of that call.

274
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,649
No.

275
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,649
She remembered Cha Soo Ho's
car and license plate number.

276
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,460
Cha Soo Ho didn't even go near
that place that day.

277
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,490
- Then...
- That phone tip...

278
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,190
was fake.

279
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:00,269
- It was staged?
- We fell for a fake call.

280
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:01,970
All of us.

281
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,100
Hello.

282
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,340
I'm Chief Ma Do Nam,
a medical examiner at the NFS.

283
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,940
At the National Forensic Service,

284
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,779
we analyzed maggots
found on the victim's corpse...

285
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,220
and was able to conclude that...

286
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,419
the victim had been dead
for two days.

287
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,919
We provided the turnaround
for the investigation...

288
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:28,690
and cleared the name of
an innocent police officer.

289
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,429
He's practically groveling.
He's taking scraps that we left.

290
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,870
Does he really want to do this
when he did nothing?

291
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,000
Exactly.

292
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:39,000
Does he think becoming famous
will get him promoted?

293
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,769
We will do our best...

294
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,379
to improve and elevate
scientific investigation.

295
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,009
Sit back down.

296
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,019
Cleared the name of...

297
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:51,850
an innocent police officer.

298
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:55,490
This was a great example of
forensic medicine...

299
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,860
and forensic entomology
revealing the truth.

300
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,129
We at the National
Forensic Service...

301
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,299
will strive to provide more precise
and swift results...

302
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,369
This is how PR should be done.

303
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:11,569
"The prosecutors are useless,
and the NFS is great."

304
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,769
Comparison makes them
look even better.

305
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,880
Thanks to you, I had to
see my boss in private.

306
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,450
Why would he call someone
who'll retire in six months?

307
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,619
To tell me...

308
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,190
not to make a mess and wrap up
nicely before I exit.

309
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,720
I apologize.

310
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,220
Solve the case within 24 hours.

311
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:35,259
Those are his orders.

312
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:37,200
24 hours?

313
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,970
Now that the press knows,
the killer will plan an escape.

314
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,299
It's a battle of time.

315
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,869
The killer will try to disappear
within 24 hours,

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,940
and we must find them before then.

317
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,549
That psycho doctor acted like
he didn't care about fame.

318
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,049
He used us.

319
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:02,720
What's left is Seok Do Hoon
who doesn't have an alibi...

320

confused us with the fake tip.

321
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,759
Ms. Park, locate Seok Do Hoon.

322
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,059
- Did we analyze the call?
- Yes.

323
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,160
Let's go.

324
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,329
- Yesterday at dawn.
- Yesterday at dawn.

325
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:19,539
I saw a man coming from that corner
wearing just one shoe.

326
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,240
A man in just one shoe?

327
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:24,180
- Yes, in the alley in the back.
- Okay.

328
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,880
There are a lot of cars
parked there at night.

329
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,480
He ran toward the parked cars.

330
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,049
Oh, he had blood on his hands.

331
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,750
They used a voice manipulator.

332
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,190
It's not clear.

333
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:39,089
Is there any noise
other than her voice?

334
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,930
Do you want to hear the amplified
background noise minus the voice?

335
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,960
Yes.

336
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,539
Just a moment.
Can you make it louder?

337
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,680
It didn't rain that day.

338
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,470
A water tanker.

339
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,640
- It's a water tanker.
- What?

340
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,339
It cleans the curb.
I saw one that morning.

341
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,009
All tankers monitored
by the government...

342
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:32,240
will have dashboard cameras.

343
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,410
Locate the public phone
where the call was made from.

344
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:37,119
Get the camera footage
from the truck in that area.

345
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,180
Okay.

346
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,349
Here you go.

347
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:45,119
All these are water tankers?

348
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,789
- Yes.
- There are so many.

349
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,099
We'll have to check
every one of them.

350
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:51,299
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

351
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,430
I'll go this way.

352
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,579
I found it!

353
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,950
Okay.

354
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:52,960
This is the one, right?

355
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,359
- She just needs to turn. Turn.
- Turn, turn.

356
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,569
- Turn, turn. Come on, turn.
- Turn.

357
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,640
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

358
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:06,000
Had she turned,
we would've gotten her face.

359
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,210
- We would've seen it right away.
- This is driving me crazy.

360
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,269
Your phone's ringing.

361
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,680

- Sir,

362

Seok Do Hoon just went
into Cheonghong Officetel.

- Stop it!
- Don't move!

Mr. Seok Do Hoon,

368
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,059
you're under arrest
for the murder of Yeon Mi Rae.

369
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,190
You, scumbag.

370
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,700
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

371
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,329
Do you admit killing Yeon Mi Rae?

372
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:09,769
What? Kill her?

373
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,910
My gosh, no.
I really didn't kill her.

374
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,769
I'll tell you the truth.

375
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:18,339
The court issued
a restraining order,

376
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,210
so I couldn't even
go near her house,

377
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,210
but I really missed her.
That's why...

378
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,519
That's why you installed
a surveillance camera?

379
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,579
Yes.

380
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,920
All the cops had left the house.

381
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,359
I only went back to retrieve it.

382
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,259
That's absurd.
I really didn't kill her.

383
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:37,460
- When did you install the camera?
- Has it been two weeks?

384
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,200
Yes, I installed it two weeks ago.

385
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:43,640
Then the camera might
have the footage for the 25th.

394
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,569
- Goodness.
- That dirtbag, Kim Joon Tae.

395
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:21,170
- I can't believe it.
- That little scumbag.

Hey, hey. He's coming out.

401

Darn it. I think
he already skipped town.

402
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,630
I'm sure he didn't go far.

00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:24,269
he predicted the line of
