1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,970
What are you trying to pull?

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,110
(Episode 17)

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,009
Why would my son kill himself? Why?

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,419
What do you know?

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,089
What... What do you know?

6
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,269
My son wouldn't
commit suicide, you jerk!

7
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,670
Stop talking nonsense!

8
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,100
Why would my son kill himself? Why?

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,369
Please calm down.

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,210
Calm down? Do you think you could
if this happened to you?

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,380
You never think
about the others, do you?

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,750
You're one selfish scumbag
by nature!

13
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,649
- Stop it.
- Why should I stop?

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,789
You concluded that it was suicide
based on...

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,090
- the estimated time of death?
- It's estimated time of death.

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,719
Gastric emptying time is
different for everyone.

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,090
How can you conclude
only based on that?

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,630
He was a 16-year-old boy.

19
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,060
He had 180g of
white rice cake and 200cc of milk.

20
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,899
The margin of error is
within 30 minutes.

21
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,030
- He was alone when he fell.
- Did you witness it? Did you?

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,769
We checked it with the CT scans
after eating the same meal.

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,109
You stay out of this.

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,010
Dr. Ma, please calm down.

25
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,680
How could I calm down, sir?

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,079
It's not true. This is all rubbish!

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,680
You should just file
a negative autopsy, you jerk.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,250
But you don't want that, do you?

29
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,290
That's why you're forcing it
to be a suicide!

30
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,689
- Let's trust Dr. Baek for now.
- Trust him? Why would I?

31
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,030
You always side with that jerk!

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,659
But I cannot trust a single word
from that jerk!

33
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,540
Go back to work.

34
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:53,989
My goodness. Seriously.
What's going on?

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,719
What happened?

36
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,760
The lunch Sung Jae had...

37
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,560
was found in his duodenum,
not his stomach.

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,159
That means that four hours had
passed after the consumption.

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,900
Four hours after his lunchtime?

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,370
That day, Sung Jae had a late lunch.
He had it at 4pm.

41
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,240
So four hours after
his lunchtime is...

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,569
8pm.

43
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,169
He was alone then.

44
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,879
That's why it's presumed
to be suicide.

45
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,460
- This is Eun Sol speaking.
- Prosecutor Eun.

46
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,490
You must come to
Gangdong Police Station now.

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,000
What are you doing?

48
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,430
Hey.

49
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,199
- Hey, hey. Are you Park Jun Ha?
- What are you doing?

50
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,669
Gosh, who are you?

51
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,379
Honey, stop it.
What's wrong with you?

52
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,710
What's wrong with me?

53
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,110
You know that
our son didn't commit suicide!

54
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,710
I'm going to get to
the bottom of this.

55
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,479
I won't let those jerks
get away with this.

56
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,189
- Okay, but we can't do this here.
- No.

57
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:02,689
Honey.

58
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,490
(Park Jun Ha)

59
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,590
Park Jun Ha.

60
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,629
You pushed Sung Jae, didn't you?

61
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,930
- Tell me the truth!
- What are you doing?

62
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,199
Have you gone mad?

63
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,699
Jun Ha, are you all right?
Did he hurt you?

64
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,240
Tell me the truth.
You pushed my son!

65
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,370
He didn't push anyone!
You're unbelievable.

66
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,909
You think only of your son.

67
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,180
How could you be so shameless
after killing my son?

68
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,280
- Your son is a murderer.
- What? "A murderer"?

69
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,550
What did you say?
How dare you call my son a murderer?

70
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,650
You must've lost your mind!

71
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,349
Jun Ha had nothing to do
with Sung Jae's death!

72
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,849
- Sir, you can't do this here.
- What? What did you say?

73
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,219
Please don't do this here.

74
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,159
Ma'am, please stop your husband.

75
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,759
How is this a school?

76
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,800
My son died, but no one cares
about my son's death!

77
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,500
How could this be a school?

78
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,430
No one is taking
responsibility for it!

79
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,039
And you call yourselves human?

80
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,169
This is it.
The tenant on the fourth floor...

81
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,710
noticed that someone kept throwing
cigarette butts from the rooftop.

82
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,680
It almost started a fire
when it caught on the laundry.

83
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,110
The tenant installed the camera
to catch the culprit.

84
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,680
After hearing about the incident,
the tenant played the video.

85
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,889
And this was recorded.

86
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,389
- What is it? Let's watch it.
- Okay. Here it is.

87
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,089
- Hey...
- My gosh.

88
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,730
Hey, hey. Play that again.
What was that? I didn't see it.

89
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,930
- Okay.
- Play it again.

90
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,170
Oh, dear.

91
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,480
The NFS' estimated
time of death was correct.

92
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:34,810
Sung Jae...

93
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,550
- fell when he was alone.
- Does it mean this is a suicide?

94
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,790
Now, we have to close
the case as so.

95
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,889
- Calm down? How could I calm down?
- Please calm down.

96
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,290
You don't know anything.
You know nothing!

97
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,129
- You don't know anything.
- We got it.

98
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:53,870
Please calm down.
Why don't you sit down and talk?

99
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,939
A lunatic like him was making
a big scene in front of a school.

100
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,310
Now, I don't feel comfortable
sending my son to school anymore.

101
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,839
A lunatic?

102
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,110
Your son is a murderer.
Do you know that?

103
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,449
Prosecutor Eun.

104
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,819
Please.
Please reinvestigate the case.

105
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,589
My son isn't the type who would
commit suicide. He'd never.

106
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:20,060
I won't let this slide.

107
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:24,000
My husband is furious right now.
We're going to file a lawsuit now.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Dr. Ma.

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,610
For the time being,
we're investigating based on...

110
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,839
the estimated time of death
from the NFS.

111
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,319
I'm letting this go
for Sung Jae's sake.

112
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,959
We could've filed charges
for assault.

113
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,230
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,339
You think
you're the only one suffering?

115
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,540
I'm about to lose my mind too.

116
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,279
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,250
They said Jun Ha and the others
went down before Sung Jae.

118
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,720
It drives me crazy to not know
what had happened to our son.

119
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm sure he didn't commit suicide.

120
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,129
But there's nothing
I can do for him.

121
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,660
I just checked the security camera.

122
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,170
Sung Jae did fall at 7:50pm.

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,139
- Suicide...
- I didn't confirm it as suicide.

124
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,110
- What?
- We can only rule out homicide...

125
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,069
since he fell when he was alone.

126
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,339
But we can't rule out
accidental death.

127
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,579
Then are you saying
he was goofing around on the rail...

128
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,079
- and missed his footing?
- That's not it either.

129
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,490
- If he did, 5m is too far.
- What is it that you want to say?

130
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,829
Hey, you. Talk.

131
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:38,160
Hey, Jin Dol.
Stop eating, and talk to me.

132
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,470
Isn't this your fourth year
at the NFS?

133
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,769
Schooled dogs can recite letters
during their third year.

134
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:46,540
Shouldn't you be able to classify
deaths during your fourth year?

135
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,579
What? I'm just asking him
for an opinion. Am I not allowed to?

136
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,879
We call this a second opinion...

137
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,649
when we seek out an opinion
of another expert.

138
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:56,879
Seek out all you want.

139
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,480
Good luck with that.

140
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,149
I'm doing fine.

141
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,720
In many ways.

142
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,029
My goodness.

143
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,330
It did seem like
he'd gone pretty insane.

144
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:53,370
He managed to solve problems after
staying up all night for a week.

145
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,509
A zombie by day...

146
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,639
and a studying machine by night.
That crazy idiot.

147
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,710
Are you boys done?

148
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,149
- What are you doing?
- Go out now.

149
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,750
I have to clean up.

150
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,220
Little boys.

151
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,389
- It's me.
- You're slacking off...

152
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,730
after making me do
all the work, right?

153
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,529
No, I'm not.

154
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,529
It sounds like Sung Jae was
bullied and left out in school.

155
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,629
Left out?

156
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,799
I can smell something.

157
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,139
- Where are you right now?
- What? Boys' restroom.

158
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,440
That's why it smells.

159
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,779
- That's not what I mean.
- I'm hanging up.

160
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,179
Hello? Hey.

161
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,179
Gosh, he always hangs up on me.

162
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,490
Prosecutor Eun. It's about Sung Jae.

163
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,620
(National Forensic Service)

164
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,830
(Letter of Resignation)

165
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,029
What is this?

166
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,659
I apologize, Director Park.

167
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,870
Chief Ma.

168
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,700
You can go on a leave.
Get some rest and...

169
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,110
Sung Jae wasn't someone
who would kill himself.

170
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,340
I'm going to prove Dr. Baek wrong...

171
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,649
and make sure he never sets
foot in this field ever again.

172
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,570
Yes?

173
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:35,639
Hello.

174
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,509
You said it's about
Medical Examiner Baek Beom.

175
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:42,909
I remembered what you said
at the National Forensic Service.

176
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,450
Will you stop?

177
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,950
You killed with those hands!

178
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:53,490
I was quite upset at that time.

179
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:57,960
I want to prove that
his autopsy result is wrong.

180
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Hello.

181
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,639
This is Professor Pyo Yoo Seong of
Forensics at Hangook University.

182
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,870
I believe you two are acquainted.

183
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,350
It's been a while since we've met
at the symposium last year.

184
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,919
Yes, it's been a while.
Thank you for coming.

185
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:18,580
Have a seat.

186
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,190
I received all the data.

187
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,889
I can't come forward myself.

188
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,259
That's why I need a second opinion.

189
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,970
I will look through
thoroughly and objectively.

190
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,470
My son would never commit suicide.

191
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,750
He bought this with the money
he saved up for a year.

192
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,610
It was delivered
on the day of his burial.

193
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,019
He must've been waiting for that.

194
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,220
Death by falling is...

195
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,159
the hardest to prove
that someone was murdered.

196
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,460
I've seen thousands of bodies
that have died from falling.

197
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,899
I understand it's hard to prove that
he was murdered with a crushed body.

198
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,559
You're correct.

199
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,399
Those jerks came up with
a meticulous plan to kill my son.

200
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:20,009
Prosecutor Eun. It's about Sung Jae.

201
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,179
It looks like he was bullied
and left out in school.

202
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,399
(Ma Sung Jae)

203
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,620
Come in.

204
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,360
Are you staying up
all night again...

205
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,899
with help from
that mixed caffeine drink?

206
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:19,740
That's my seat.

207
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,379
If you mix all 3 of those,
it'll be over 1,000mg of caffeine.

208
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,980
Did you want to be
top of the class that badly?

209
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,019
Or did you want to be like Sung Jae?

210
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,320
You take the same
nutritional supplements as him,

211
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,889
and you study with the same
reference books that he used.

212
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,029
(Modafinil, methylphenidate,
benfotiamine, albumin)

213
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,840
(Modafinil, methylphenidate,
benfotiamine, albumin)

214
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,809
("English", "Economy Concert",
"Math Basics", "Archaeology")

215
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:57,509
("Literature", "Analects of
Confucius", "Society and Culture")

216
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,480
("Workbook", "Second Language",
"Physics 2", "Earth Sciences 2")

217
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,279
You felt inferior to him...

218
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,220
because you always got beaten
by someone younger.

219
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,620
What do you know?

220
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,429
But it wasn't just you.

221
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,000
All the students in this school...

222
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,799
were jealous of Sung Jae.

223
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,840
But you didn't kill him. Right?

224
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,340
I am sorry...

225
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,039
that I suspected you.

226
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:38,450
I just wanted to know
what had happened on the rooftop.

227
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,919
I was upset.

228
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,029
Everyone took his side...

229
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,200
and even cheated just because
he was the top of the class.

230
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,929
(Midterm, period 1)

231
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,840
On that day,
as we were taking the test,

232
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,539
Sung Jae suddenly collapsed.

233
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:04,539
Sung Jae!

234
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:07,879
So I was kind of excited
that I could finally be...

235
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,980
- the number one.
- Hey, you might become the top.

236
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,379
Exactly.

237
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:15,049
Sung Jae's done for.
Why did he suddenly collapse?

238
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,519
- Congratulations in advance.
- Forget it.

239
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,559
Hey, this is huge.

240
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,860
Sung Jae is allowed to take the test
in the nurse's office.

241
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,159
- What?
- Then I suddenly heard that...

242
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
Sung Jae was allowed to take
the test in the nurse's room.

243
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,970
They gave him special treatment
just because he's the number one.

244
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,980
Hey, the guard is gone. Let's go.

245
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,879
Hey, go get Sung Jae.

246
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,850
I got really angry, so I took him
to the rooftop with the guys.

247
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,620
Why do you get special treatment?
Do you think you're a big shot?

248
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,450
Look at how pathetic he is.

249
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,320
What's in that head of yours?
Let's factorize what's in there.

250
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,429
You take drugs every day, right?

251
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,929
Your mom always brings them for you.

252
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,500
Why do you get sick even after
taking so many drugs? Why?

253
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Sung Jae.

254
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,909
Next time, try to play fair.

255
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,450
It's cheating to take the test alone
in the nurse's office.

256
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,919
Okay. I understand.

257
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,220
We just swore at him for a bit,
told him to play fair,

258
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,059
and then came back down.

259
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,330
He's the one who cheated first.

260
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,960
I just wanted to scare him a bit.

261
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,470
Did he really kill himself...

262
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,370
because of me?

263
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,039
No, right?

264
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,110
Was it really because of me?

265
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,220
What are you looking at?

266
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,190
Do you have your car here?

267
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,730
- I do.
- I need to go to the NFS.

268
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,230
You can go, then.

269
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:07,970
Hey.

270
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,769
I'm asking you to come with me.

271
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,039
The result of Sung Jae's
toxic substances test came out.

272
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,089
May I ask you something?

273
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,549
What?

274
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,019
Do you really talk to dead bodies?

275
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,599
Are you hiding something
in your home?

276
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,369
Do you have a dead body
in your fridge or something?

277
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,450
It's so hot.

278
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,980
Hand.

279
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,119
- What?
- Put your hand back in.

280
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,660
It'll get cut off
if you get into an accident.

281
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,589
And when you drive,
wear flat shoes, not heels.

282
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:34,690
(Simultaneous)

283
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,519
What are you doing?

284
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,490
Watch out.

285
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,730
I couldn't wait to hear the results.

286
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,009
Gosh.

287
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:12,450
- What's this?
- Pinpoint pupil.

288
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,619
His pupils are small.

289
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:16,119
Pupils dilate when one dies.

290
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,619
This is the opposite.
His pupils constricted.

291
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,799
That's...

292
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,970
Itchy boils.

293
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,569
They're all symptoms of
a narcotic addiction.

294
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,470
What? Narcotics?

295
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,579
I've never seen this much toxic
in a teenager's body.

296
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,150
I mean, what kind of a high school
student takes this much drugs?

297
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,450
Doctor...

298
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,220
Sorry. I got a bit upset.

299
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,390
Sung Jae had...

300
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,089
toxins the like of what
you'd see in an ICU patient.

301
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,089
We detected over 10 substances.

302
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:58,259
I think it's a mix of western,
Chinese, and folk remedies.

303
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,630
Armodafinil, diazepam,
phenamin, methylphenidate,

304
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,839
atomoxetine, albumin, zinc extract,
and caffeine.

305
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,809
Then the Chinese medicine.
Baekboksi, seokchangpo, ginger.

306
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,569
What's really odd was,

307
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,210
I found seal, loach,
sturgeon extract,

308
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,509
- red ginseng, wild ginseng...
- Wait.

309
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,579
You found all that
in Sung Jae's body?

310
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,650
And many more.

311
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,390
What are you saying?

312
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,819
Most substances were
stimulants, tonics,

313
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,890
or protein supplements.

314
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,220
I found something odd.

315
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:29,089
Methylphenidate and armodafinil.

316
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,059
Wait. What and what?

317
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,099
They're components of
ADHD medicine.

318
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,700
In the past,

319
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,269
some countries gave them
to soldiers or pilots.

320
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:40,140
It improves concentration
when on duty for long periods.

321
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,210
And suppresses fatigue.

322
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,680
Does a high-school senior
stand guard? He's no soldier.

323
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,910
It makes human an aggressive zombie.

324
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,950
And this.

325
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,319
Amphetamine.

326
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,750
(Medicinal substance tests)

327
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,049
It's a narcotic stimulant.

328
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,890
The cause of pinpoint pupil
and the itch.

329
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,690
It's illegal to import
amphetamine stimulants.

330
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,230
Side effects include visual
and auditory hallucinations,

331
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,829
and you build a tolerance
or get addicted.

332
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,529
If it was this bad, it means
he took actual narcotics too.

333
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,369
Some US hospitals use
a tapering drug.

334
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,309
- It could've been smuggled in.
- It would've been worth it.

335
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,180
It's very effective at stimulating
the central nervous system.

336
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,980
1 pill contains 3.13mg.

337
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,819
Sung Jae's samples
showed a reading of 30mg.

338
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:26,180
That means he took 10 pills at once.

339
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,490
Prosecutor Eun, about Sung Jae.

340
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,849
He didn't sleep for a week...

341
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,920
and managed to stay up
and sit the exam.

342
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,859
His nickname was Daytime Zombie
and Nighttime Study Machine.

343
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,960
They were studying for exams.

344
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:43,200
The kids said Sung Jae studied
all the time and never slept.

345
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,069
- He was always zoning out.
- It was the side effect.

346
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:48,769
If he took these kinds of drugs
for an extended period,

347
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,839
his liver would be
severely distressed...

348
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,279
and his central nervous
system would've been a mess.

349
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,980
- The worst side effects are...
- Hallucinations and delirium.

350
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:00,089
The kid was sick.

351
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,289
Did the drugs kill him?

352
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:06,589
We can't say for sure.

353
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:10,329
He took them for a long time,
not just a few times.

354
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,660
It'll be hard to pinpoint
the correlation...

355
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,700
- between the drugs and death.
- It was exam week.

356
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,799
He could've taken more than usual.

357
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,500
How will you prove that?

358
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:25,309
They dragged him with them.

359
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,480
What if he took the drugs with him?

360
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,519
Show me the video of
the kids in the elevator.

361
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,589
Sure.

362
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,769
Look.

363
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,940
You're right. There's
something in his pocket.

364
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,750
He could've taken them on the roof.

365
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,779
There were no pill bottles
among Sung Jae's belongings.

366
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,450
There's a possibility that
he fell willingly,

367
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,319
but we're not sure if it's suicide.

368
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,890
There's evidence that he took drugs,

369
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,690
but we can't prove
the correlation with his death.

370
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,799
Does that mean it's an open verdict?

371
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:23,000
Can you tell his parents that
you don't have a conclusive answer?

372
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,839
Is that your conclusion?

373
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,509
- Lieutenant Cha.
- What?

374
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,880
We have to go to
Sung Jae's crime scene.

375
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,680
What? What for?

376
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,980
To find the pill bottle.

377
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,619
A what? Why?

378
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,390
Call Forensics for their help.

379
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,319
Help? To do what?
Why are you guys...

380
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,230
You can't all get into my car.
Stella, sit up front.

381
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,960
Stella, up front. Not you.

382
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:10,680
I didn't see you.

383
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,220
Sorry, Stella...

384
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,549
Stella, how about...

385
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,819
after we find the bottle,
we get something to eat?

386
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:17,920
Just us two.

387
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,059
How about some meat later?

388
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,359
- Yesterday was slaughter day.
- Was it?

389
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,529
The meat will just have
come out of rigor mortis.

390
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,369
Fantastic. Let's go.

391
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,440
Just have what?

392
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,210
- Let's see...
- Excuse me. Hello?

393
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,980
This side...

394
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Gotcha.

395
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,420
- I found it.
- Over here!

396
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,819
How did you find it?

397
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,430
Hang on, what...

398
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,000
It drives me crazy to not know
what had happened to our son.

399
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:17,519
Can you tell his parents that
you don't have a conclusive answer?

400
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,589
It was exam week.
He could've taken more than usual.

401
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,730
How will you prove that?

402
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,930
I don't care about that jerk.

403
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,500
I hope we scared
some sense into him.

404
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,309
- Did you see how scared he was?
- That should be enough.
