1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,640
(Episode 16)

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,009
What do you think happened on the
rooftop after he was dragged there?

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,279
These days, we can find
everything online.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,919
They tend to brag about it
on their social media.

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,019
I doubt that
he'll even open his mouth.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,059
Seriously. He's a head case.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,559
If not through the kids,

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,260
we must find out
through other means.

9
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,730
I don't know if I should have my son
transferred to another school.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,870
Jae Hoon's room is
right next to his.

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,870
It's suicide, right?

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,670
My gosh, it's the exam week
for Kang Doo.

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,280
You might disapprove of me
if I say this.

14
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:44,420
But our sons' ranks will go
one place higher.

15
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:48,390
So Jun Ha will be
at the top of his class now.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,590
Top of his class?

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,659
That doesn't mean anything.

18
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,060
All I want...

19
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,329
is for Jun Ha to stay healthy.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,399
Everyone is here except for me.

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,079
Hello. I'm Prosecutor Eun Sol
from Seoul Eastern District.

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,890
What is this regarding?

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,420
I wanted to discuss
something with all of you.

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,489
I understand that
you must be heartbroken.

25
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,930
I wanted to comfort you,

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,569
but I didn't reach out because
I thought it wasn't the right time.

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,540
Nonetheless,
ambushing our meeting...

28
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,340
with the prosecutor is
no way to behave.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,109
I heard...

30
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,579
it's the exam week for the kids.

31
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,750
Do you want me to call them out too?

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,090
Or...

33
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,120
will you cooperate
with the investigation?

34
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:04,799
For all these years,

35
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:08,030
your sons followed
the academy schedule I made,

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,469
and you tried hard to put your sons
in the study groups I'd formed.

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,770
You bought me a designer handbag.

38
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,240
You came to my home and made kimchi.

39
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,409
You got me tickets
for the most luxurious massages.

40
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,310
You wanted your sons to
join my study groups.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,919
Don't you remember?

42
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,620
My son, Sung Jae,

43
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,060
was your idol, object of admiration,
and your dream son.

44
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,930
You were good to me as you wanted
your sons to be like mine.

45
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,599
But...

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,830
as soon as my son was gone,

47
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,169
you all jumped ship.

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,099
Do Hee.

49
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,240
You're being rude.

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,080
I no longer have a son.

51
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,379
My son...

52
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,349
died.

53
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,849
Do you think...

54
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,719
my son's death has nothing
to do with yours?

55
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,669
I know that your sons are done
with their academy at 8:30pm.

56
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,430
You're in charge of giving them
a ride today, right?

57
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,969
And I know that you have all
of their cell phones in your bag.

58
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,439
Can you show them to me?

59
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,110
Should I request for
a search and seizure warrant?

60
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,849
I'll get on it right away.

61
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,319
Hold on, please.

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,689
I'll show them to you.

63
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,289
Could you unlock the phones as well?

64
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,909
Do you think they are some kind
of delinquents or thugs?

65
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,979
Ma'am, you're greatly mistaken.

66
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,379
This meeting consists
of the top five students...

67
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,020
from the specialized high school.

68
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,460
All of their fathers are
influential as well.

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,460
I find this kind of
behavior very rude.

70
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,759
I didn't find anything.

71
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,699
- On all of the phones?
- Yes.

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,170
You're suspecting innocent kids.

73
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,339
Are you lawfully executing
your official duty?

74
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,279
You don't have evidence. That's why
you're going through their phones.

75
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,589
He only posted their group photos
on his social media.

76
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,259
It's odd that these best friends
didn't create a group chatroom.

77
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,259
Did you all...

78
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,529
erase it?

79
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,740
Park Jun Ha, Ahn Jae Hoon,
Cha Dong Soo, and Kim Kang Doo.

80
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,339
These four students were
with Sung Jae...

81
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,379
- on the scene of the incident.
- That's not possible.

82
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,579
- Jun Ha was at the academy then.
- So was Jae Hoon.

83
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,519
Then...

84
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,850
who are they?

85
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,720
Five students went up together,

86
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,490
but why did only four of them
come back down?

87
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,300
This is a murder case.

88
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:33,199
Park Jun Ha, Ahn Jae Hoon,
Cha Dong Soo, and Kim Kang Doo...

89
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,839
are suspects
of Ma Sung Jae's murder.

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,439
Thank you for
your cooperation today.

91
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,910
What are you talking about?

92
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,509
What did she just say?

93
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,050
Unbelievable.

94
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:47,949
What's going on?

95
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,089
Can you please explain?

96
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,860
What are we going to do?

97
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,779
What are you doing?

98
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,550
Swab everything...

99
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,019
from there to there.

100
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,399
He didn't ask us
to take just the samples?

101
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,670
He wanted the entire wall.
Including the rails.

102
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,480
(Court)

103
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,610
The cause of death
of the driver, the husband,

104
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,180
is cervical vertebrae fracture.
In other words, his neck broke.

105
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,720
And the cause of death
of the passenger, the wife,

106
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,819
is hemothorax of thoracic cavity
caused by rib fracture.

107
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,060
In other words,

108
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,160
she died because
her chest was filled with blood.

109
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,329
Can we tell
which one of them died first?

110
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,500
When someone's
cervical vertebrae is fractured,

111
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,399
it can cause the person
to die immediately from the injury.

112
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,540
But hemothorax of
the thoracic cavity...

113
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,009
takes at least minutes
to cause someone to die...

114
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,680
since the blood needs to fill up
until it's impossible to breathe.

115
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,740
Hence,

116
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,620
it looks like
the husband died first.

117
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,819
If the husband died...

118
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,089
even a minute before the wife,

119
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,819
that means his assets...

120
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,360
were inherited by his wife
while she was alive.

121
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,160
What are you talking about?

122
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,730
This is nonsense.

123
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,660
Overruled.

124
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,629
Please continue.

125
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,529
Therefore, it is only logical...

126
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,540
for his assets to be...

127
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,310
given to her family, her sister,
which is his sister-in-law.

128
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,540
(Defense Counsel)

129
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,740
The swindling of his inheritance
by the defendant, her mother-in-law,

130
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,610
is illegal.

131
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,980
That is all.

132
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,189
Take it.

133
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,459
I wrote a book.

134
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,459
("Every Murder Leaves a Mark")

135
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,100
I'll have a good read.
Your books are always helpful.

136
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,800
I'm embarrassed to show this
to those who are in the field.

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,399
These books are a must-read...

138
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,439
if you're someone
who works in the field.

139
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,480
If your brother saw you today,

140
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,410
he would've been very proud.

141
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,279
(Hangook University Hospital,
Kang Yong)

142
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,559
There is no damage
caused by an external force...

143
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,730
or any intervention
from another person.

144
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,059
However,

145
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:19,200
I did see two fresh needle marks
on his left arm.

146
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,570
We'd have to run a test
for toxic substances,

147
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,539
but it looks like
a suicide by poisoning.

148
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,539
A suicide?

149
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:29,039
You said your brother was
a doctor, right?

150
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,110
Yes.

151
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,610
Doctors know the kind of poison
that can kill them very well.

152
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,950
For now,

153
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:39,179
I can only conclude
that he injected it himself.

154
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,789
He wouldn't kill himself.

155
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,789
He said he's getting married soon.

156
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,759
His fiancee is pregnant too.

157
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,029
"People who commit suicide..."

158
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,629
"always leave hesitation wounds."

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,659
That's from your book.

160
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:55,799
My brother only had
two needle marks on his left arm.

161
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,139
There were no hesitation wounds.

162
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,740
It was as if someone else
had injected it in him.

163
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,909
Many surgeons are ambidextrous.

164
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:05,809
My brother was left-handed.

165
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,580
He was always more precise
with his left hand.

166
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,120
If he wanted to
inject poison himself,

167
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,279
he definitely would've used
his left hand.

168
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,129
I'm at Seon Hospital right now.

169
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:22,389
- I'll go inside.
- Good work.

170
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,330
The puzzles are
coming together one by one.

You must've gotten pretty rich
from selling off spare drugs.

177
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:59,460
This was from 10 years ago,
so it was difficult to find.

I also pass along
Prosecutor Kang's advice.

- Yes, I'm okay. Thanks.

Do you want to go eat with me?

00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,919
- Hello.
- Going up.

192
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,019

193
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:01,659
- Great work, Lieutenant Cha.
- Oh, it's nothing, Director Park.

- Goodbye.

Stella, I'm asking you out on...

197
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,690
Dr. Baek asks you to analyze...

198
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,830
Ma Sung Jae's case
in the standard dose.

199
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,230
Sure, but that'll take a while.

200
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,330
If you make it quick,
I'll buy you beef.

201
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,600
Really? Beef? Meat?

202
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,769
There's a great place nearby.

203
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,840
Fantastic.

204
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,299
I've been analyzing them
urgently already.

205
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,509
Stella, what about me?

206
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,009
You like beef too, right?

207
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,309
Yes, of course.

208
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,710
- Do you want to join us?
- What?

209
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,779
Good idea.

210
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,950
Ciao.

211
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,419
Wait. Stella. Wait. Stella.

212
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,029
- What are you doing?
- You surprised me.

213
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,600
The doors are closing.

214
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,340
- Do you have your car?
- Yes, what?

215
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,070
Wait, what?

216
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,480
Is your car parked here?

217
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,279
Yes.

218
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,309
Why are you so on edge?

219
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,120
Mr. Jang.

220
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,190
Are you close...

221
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,929
with Stella?

222
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:44,629
We're all family here at
the National Forensic Service.

223
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:50,169
Stella is really good
at grilling meat.

224
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,470
We recently had a meal together.
Just the two of us.

225
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,169
I'm good at grilling meat too.
This time, I'll do that.

226
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,210
What?

227
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,350
Do you really like meat that much?

228
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,179
Yes, I need all I can get.

229

(Vitamins)

230
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,429
Your urine has been
really bright recently, right?

231
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,700
How did you know?

232
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,470
I was about to see a doctor
because I was worried.

233
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,899
If you have too much vitamin B
in your system, it comes out.

234
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,169
"Always take the right dosage."

235
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,639
That's what Stella always says.

236
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,710
Stella?

237
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,409
Fine, I won't eat these.

238
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,019
Dr. Baek, she's the nutritionist.

239
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,389
This was our lunch menu last month.

240
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,730
Do they usually eat lunch at 12pm?

241
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes, it's always at 12pm
unless something comes up.

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,970
The lunch menu on that day was
spicy gochujang pork.

243
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,240
That's odd.

244
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,970
- His duodenum wasn't red.
- Maybe he didn't eat lunch.

245
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,480
Or he might hate spicy pork.

246
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:07,149
Sung Jae didn't eat lunch
on that day.

247
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:08,909
He just had a snack at 4pm.

248
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,679
We served white rice cake with milk.

249
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,779
Something that enters your body
never lies.

250
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,419
You've seen your
bright-colored urine.

251
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,289
It's nothing.

252
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,970
Chief Prosecutor No.

253
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,240
Do you have a favor to ask?

254
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,509
No.

255
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,649
Someone asked me out on a lunch,

256
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,580
but I felt too awkward to
come alone, so I brought you.

257
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,950
Who was it?

258
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,019
Do you know Euddeum Law Firm?

259
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,360
Isn't it 1 of Korea's
top 5 firms?

260
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,029
Hello, I'm a bit late.

261
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,529
Welcome.

262
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,129
This is the wife of
Euddeum's representative.

263
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:05,039
- This is...
- I know very well who she is.

264
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,850
I didn't know that...

265
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,919
Jun Ha was Euddeum's
representative's son.

266
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:19,679
I'm sure you did not.

267
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,259
Now that you do, I hope
I needn't explain the situation.

268
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,259
Sorry. I'd like to be excused.

269
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,860
No one remains a prosecutor forever.

270
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,570
Think carefully.

271
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,139
I will pay for my meal.

272
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,210
- Shall I pay for yours too?
- Sure.

273
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,779
You may.

274
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,279
I'll pay for my meal.

275
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,980
Letting someone else pay for you...

276
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,590
these days could cause
a big problem.

277
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,519
Let's pay separately.

278
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,090
- Where's Prosecutor Eun?
- She's late.

279
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,759
I hope she gets here soon.

280
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,130
- Welcome.
- Hello.

281
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,970
- Let's start the meeting.
- Okay.

282
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,630
Please sit first.

283
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,799
Then we'll begin.

284
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,140
Ma Sung Jae always did
better than Park Jun Ha,

285
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,210
so Park Jun Ha always
came second in his year.

286
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,009
They were famous rivals.

287
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,819
Always coming second
to someone else...

288
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,920
is much worse than
coming last all the time.

289
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,420
Did you ever come second?

290
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,759
I was always second. From the back.

291
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,789
"Exin" is a slang word
teenagers use these days.

292
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:35,329
"Explosion of inferiority".

293
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,589
It's so obvious.

294
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,359
Sung Jae skipped a grade
and was two years younger.

295
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,099
- It must've hurt Jun Ha's pride.
- With Sung Jae out of the way,

296
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,700
- Jun Ha would win?
- That's it.

297
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,410
That's the circumstances mapped out.

298
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,009
Yes, but the thing is...

299
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,609
Take over.

300
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,480
As you see here, at 6pm,
Sung Jae and his friends...

301
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,779
take the elevator upstairs.
An hour later at 7pm,

302
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,349
only his friends come down.

303
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:03,150
The body was found
two hours later...

304
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,490
at 9pm.

305
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,789
Do we have estimated time of death?
There are two hours unaccounted for.

306
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,329
Not yet. Dr. Baek's taking his time.

307
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,730
Prosecutor Eun.

308
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,670
This is no time to
wait for the NFS.

309
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,109
A kid is dead.

310
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:22,509
None of you
seem to get it because...

311
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:23,980
you're single without kids,

312
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,309
but listen.

313
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,380
This feels like a beating heart...

314
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,480
was ripped out of you
while you're still breathing.

315
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,519
No parent can sleep at night.
We must catch the killer.

316
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,759
If it was 3 to 1, they could've
overpowered Sung Jae.

317
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,789
If they wanted to,
they could've pushed him over.

318
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,500
I feel so sorry for him.

319
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,829
He must've been so scared.

320
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,769
Security footages from the apartment
block Sung Jae fell from.

321
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:52,099
We got a verification
request for it.

322
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:54,170
It was from...

323
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:57,609
Euddeum Law Firm.
What's going on?

324
00:18:58,339 --> 00:18:59,839
Did they hire a lawyer already?

Park Jun Ha's father
is Euddeum's highest lawyer.

326
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,549
- What?
- What?

327
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,220
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

328
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,529
Euddeum will be
really tough to deal with.

329
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,490
Everyone's equal before the law.

330
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,200
Was anything ever easy?

331
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,240
The sky he last saw.
His last urine sample.

332
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,740
His last meal. His last...

333
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,920
What are you doing?

334
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:42,950
Do you have time to kill?
We're all really busy.

335
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:49,589
The liquid found on the wall
was Sung Jae's urine.

(Ma Sung Jae)

338
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,430
- The railing.
- We found microfibers.

339
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,799
It matches his pants.

340
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,039
If you were pushed,
you'd fall head-first.

341
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:10,079
He came up at 6pm, and at 7pm,
only the others came down.

342
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,880
His body was found at 9pm.

343
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,920
If we have estimated time of death,

344
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,450
we have the whole puzzle.

345
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,819
- Puzzle?
- Yes.

346
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,329
- Traces of murder.
- Don't write a novel.

347
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:22,960
No. This time I'll write
a masterpiece.

348
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,460
"He died between 6pm and 7pm."

349
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,869
If you can tell us this,
we can close this case.

350
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:30,140
Write your novel.

351
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,019
Is this Ma Sung Jae's residence?

352
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,180
- Yes.
- Delivery.

353
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,559
What is it?

354
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:56,700
It's a delivery made to his name.

355
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:11,779
Oh no.

356
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,220
He saved his allowance to buy this.

357
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,390
(Shipping!)

358
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,859
He waited. He waited, honey!

359
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,920
He did not kill himself!

360
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,789
There's no way he killed himself!

361

Sung Jae. Sung Jae...

365
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:05,799
You're going to go in?
This is for bodies.

366
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,900
- Will you go in then?
- I'll make you look good.

367
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,480
Four hours later. Not yet.

368
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,549
- We must do it again.
- Okay.

369
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:29,289
We must do it again.

370
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,119
Okay.

371
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,500
There's no time.

372
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,349
Eat faster.

373
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,230
Lie down.

374
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,490
I put down a layer of plastic.

375
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,400
There's no time. Hurry.

376
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,599
Will you hurry up?

377
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,160
Do you have estimated time of death?

378
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,529
Dr. Ma and the prosecutors
are all nagging about when...

379
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:42,230
Will you do it? You do it then.

380
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,759
- No, no.
- Get out.

What are you trying to pull?

384
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:49,960
Why would my son kill himself? Why?

385
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,529
What do you know?

386
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:59,440

389
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,539
Tell the truth!
You pushed Sung Jae!

390
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,009
Your son's a murderer!

391
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:43,309
I think Sung Jae was bullied a bit.

392
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,650
Call over Ma Sung Jae.

393
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,819
Why do you get
special treatment? Why?

394
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,890
He cheated first.

395
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,690
You felt inferior to him.
You weren't the only one, right?

396
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,690
Everyone in this school was
jealous of Sung Jae.

397
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,430
He would never commit suicide.

398
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,529
I'll prove that
Dr. Baek was wrong...

399
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:01,500
and make sure that he never gets
to work in this field ever again.
