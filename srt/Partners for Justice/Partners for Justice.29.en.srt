00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,139
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,760
Name, Lee Kyung Ja.

3
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,359
She was the 11th target
and the sole survivor...

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,870
of Wuseong Serial Murder in 1988.

5
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:30,699
She was murdered with the same MO.

6
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:34,439
Instead of going home, she came to
her friend's house, but...

7
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,899
Step aside.

8
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,420
Her teardrops have dried up.

9
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,299
(National Forensic Service)

10
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,280
- Aren't you going to wear a mask?
- I need to smell this.

11
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,180
If you're going to assist me, stay.
If you aren't, leave.

12
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,920
This is my autopsy room.

13
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,790
Go ahead. I'll assist you.

14
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,329
Current time is 9:37am.

15
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,590
I will begin the autopsy.

16
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,539
Depressed fracture
on the back of the head.

17
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,939
"Depressed fracture
on the back of the head".

18
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,110
(Depressed fracture:
A broken bone with a depression)

19
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,110
Take close-up pictures.

20
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,650
Teeth marks...

21
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,280
on the right side of the neck.

22
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,849
"Teeth marks
on the right side of the neck".

23
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:24,849
(Teeth marks: Bite marks)

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,259
Right shoulder blade,
a stab wound.

25
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:34,990
"Right shoulder blade,
a stab wound".

26
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,330
(Stab wound: Wound from a stab)

27
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,099
Probe.

28
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,000
Right here.

29
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,710
Depth, 15cm.

30
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,479
"Depth, 15cm".

31
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,550
Length, 4.2cm.

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,719
"Length, 4.2cm".

33
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,430
Width, 0.5cm.

34
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,030
"Width, 0.5cm".

35
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,229
I see ligature mark on the wrist.

36
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,830
"Ligature mark on the wrist".

37
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,669
The fingerprints are all intact.

38
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:20,340
Since everyone knows who she is,
there was no need to damage those.

39
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,139
Scalpel.

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,379
Right here.

41
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,310
Wait, one second.

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,750
I need to check something
before you open her up.

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,250
One second.

44
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,870
One second.

45
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,370
What is he doing?

46
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,240
What are you doing, Doctor Baek?

47
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,680
I can smell oil.

48
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,919
Did she ever smell like oil
while she was alive?

49
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,020
No.

50
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,520
I don't remember
smelling oil on her.

51
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,939
Request a chemical analysis.

52
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,009
- It's an emergency.
- Okay.

53
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,310
You can go ahead.

54
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,600
The MO is exactly the same...

55
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,300
as Seong Hye Bin's case
except for the depressed fracture.

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,800
About the depressed fracture,
where was she hit?

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,939
She was hit exactly
on the cerebellum.

58
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,180
The cerebellum is
in charge of human movements.

59
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,079
She probably couldn't move
any longer.

60
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,449
Why do you think
he suddenly changed his MO?

61
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,579
To kill with ease...

62
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,290
after immobilizing his victims.

63
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,959
He was a young man in his 20s
30 years ago.

64
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,160
But he's now
a middle-aged man in his 50s.

65
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,860
We can't conclude
that he's in his 50s.

66
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,329
His profile from the past case
may have been erroneous.

67
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:28,300
Why do we do an autopsy
if we can't come to any conclusions?

68
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,170
What did you do?

69
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,540
What did you do with
the victim's body before you?

70
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,439
I smelled it.
I looked for any weird smells.

71
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,540
All the smells were gone
after Seong Hye Bin was buried,

72
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,310
but this time, it remained.

73
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,379
Are you saying you'll catch
the murderer with the smell?

74
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,379
Wait.

75
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,990
What can you figure out with smell?

76
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,319
Anything is fine. Tell me.

77
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,459
I don't know yet.

78
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,759
We need to find out
what that smell is.

79
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,930
What kind of nonsense is this?

80
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,060
Why do you even bother to say
something so vague?

81
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,430
He started leaving
depressed fractures.

82
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,569
This is an evolvement of his MO.

83
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,240
He's looking for
easier ways to kill.

84
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,680
They're here.

85
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,920
Prosecutor Do, do you admit
your investigation was unreasonable?

86
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Couldn't you have stopped this
if you requested...

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,420
protective custody?

88
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,560
Please say something.

89
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,389
- Say something.
- Prosecutor Do!

90
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,560
Tell us.

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,290
A survivor of Wuseong
Serial Murder from 30 years ago...

92
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,800
was found dead
due to the prosecution...

93
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,629
and the police's
unreasonable investigation...

94
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,500
which has shocked many.

95
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,509
The victim, Lee,
even changed her name...

96
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,610
and lived in hiding
to run from the murderer.

97
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,410
However, it is believed...

98
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,410
that the victim was found
once again by the murderer...

99
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,220
after this investigation reopened.

100
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,149
Lee went out of contact on her way
back after she gave her testimony...

101
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,089
per the investigation
headquarters' request.

102
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,889
Then she was found dead
the next day...

103
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,959
at her friend's house.

104
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,730
The investigation headquarters
believe that...

105
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,230
the culprit felt threatened
after the investigation reopened...

106
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,670
I told you to take in
the serial murderer,

107
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,110
and you go and let
our only survivor die.

108
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,079
I heard you're the one
who brought her out.

109
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,610
Give me just a little more time.

110
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,420
We specified the core victims,
and we're keeping a 24-hour watch.

111
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,449
What if...

112
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,379
we see another victim?

113
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,189
If this becomes another cold case,
we'll all have to resign.

114
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:34,160
Understand?

115
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,930
What about Kang Chi Soo?

116
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Yes.

117
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:44,670
He's at his studio working
as if nothing has happened.

118
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,269
We can't see any more victims.
Let's arrest him without a warrant.

119
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,279
Invalidate his passport.

120
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,310
We're going to arrest him
immediately without a warrant.

121
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,720
- Lieutenant Cha, please get moving.
- Okay. Let's go.

122
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,850
We need to invalidate
someone's passport.

123
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,129
- What about the victim?
- Yes, thank you.

124
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,129
Prosecutor Eun.

125
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,199
About the possibility of a copycat,

126
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,730
I asked a junior of mine who's
in the cyber investigation team...

127
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,699
to go through the internet.

128
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,939
And they found this.

129
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,180
This website is like
a genealogy of the murderer...

130
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,910
of Wuseong Serial Murder.

131
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,980
Who runs this website?

132
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,620
You know what's funny?

133
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,990
We know him.

134
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,450
What?

135
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,460
The substance found on
Lee Kyung Ja's stab wound is...

136
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,059
rifle bore-cleaner.

137
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,500
Rifle bore-cleaner?
Isn't that industrial grease?

138
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,070
And it's made in accordance
to the military specification.

139
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,570
This rifle bore-cleaner is...

140
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,870
used to clean out leftover gunpowder
from the muzzle.

141
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,779
The bullet can't leave the gun
with extra gunpowder piled up.

142
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,509
It's a must in the army.

143
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,379
You reek of oil
after you clean up your gun.

144
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,820
Something is very strange
about this situation.

145
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,389
Our perpetrator must be
a strange soldier.

146
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:11,789
And the smell was pretty strong.

147
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,190
Good point.

148
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,330
The ones used nowadays
don't smell as strong.

149
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,899
This isn't made according to
the current military specification.

150
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,200
I did some research...

151
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,600
and found out that it was used
in the 60s and 70s.

152
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,970
It was mainly used
for the Vietnam War.

153
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,409
The Vietnam War.

154
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,610
Does anyone use this nowadays?

155
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,980
We can go and find out.

156
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,110
Where to?

157
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,379
Goodness, this place has everything.

158
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,480
You aren't here to shop. Hurry up.

159
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,820
There's a lot of stuff here.
I'm sure we'll find it here.

160
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,519
- Hello.
- Hello.

161
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,059
We have a question.

162
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:49,429
Do you have the M-series
made by Octagon?

163
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:53,029
Octagon?
We don't carry such an old product.

164
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,870
They have a few things here.

165
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,340
Here?

166
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,909
Let's go... Okay.

167
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,450
- Hello.
- Hello.

168
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,389
Excuse me, sir.

169
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:16,919
I'm looking for the M-series
made by Octagon.

170
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,120
- Do you have any?
- I'm not sure.

171
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,690
Right, one second.

172
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,529
Stay seated.

173
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,899
It's been forever, Joon Tae.

174
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,139
I heard the rumor too.

175
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:36,110
It was interesting.

176
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,179
(Kim Joon Tae, 22,
Yeon Mi Rae's boyfriend, in prison)

177
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,110
The culprit of
Wuseong Serial Murder was...

178
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,549
your idol, wasn't he?

179
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:44,279
He's the textbook model
of an evolving murderer.

180
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,879
He killed all 10 of his victims
in different ways.

181
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,950
Isn't that amazing?

182
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,490
I heard you know the best...

183
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,690
about the culprit
of Wuseong Serial Murder.

184
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,860
I followed his formula...

185
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,100
when I framed
Cha Soo Ho for my murder.

186
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,299
Darn it, this jerk.

187
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:05,399
- What's the formula?
- "Never kill on an impulse."

188
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,440
"Keep your eyes on your target,"

189
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,679
"find out their pattern,
and look for the best time to kill."

190
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,480
"Don't leave evidence..."

191
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,450
"or leave misleading evidence
that will derail the investigation."

192
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,149
Aren't you stuck?

193
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,190
How dare you?
Where are your manners?

194
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,289
There are things that
I didn't put on the blog.

195
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:29,190
You look curious.

196
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,500
Shall I tell you?

197
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:34,330
- Or not?
- This little...

198
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,029
Joon Tae.

199
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,399
Let's go with tell.

200
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,610
Investigators trust each other
too much, and that's a problem.

201
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,580
180cm tall, shoe size 260mm.

202
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,879
- What kind of lie is that?
- Hey, come on.

203
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,250
Some men have small feet.

204
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,289
Did he have small feet or...

205
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,320
was he short?

206
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,360
The Wuseong killer's victims...

207
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,500
were all short
below 160cm in height.

208
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,730
If he were 180cm tall,

209
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,539
he could've killed taller women.

210
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,990
Sir, do people still ask for this?

211
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,460
Old people do sometimes.
Old habits die hard.

212
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:36,899
Hello. Right now? Okay.

213
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,000
They're arresting
the Wuseong killer.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,600
They want us on the scene.

215
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,840
Secure a path for retreat
and call in when ready.

216
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,039
If we block here and here,

217
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,909
we should have him.

218
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,450
Baek Beom speaking.

219
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,879
- Where are you?
- Why?

220
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,779
The killer could be shorter.

221
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,490
We can't trust the old profile.

222
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,190
- He could be over 50.
- What?

223
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,220
They're going to arrest
Kang Chi Soo.

224
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,490
Yes, I'm here.

225
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,360
It's not Kang Chi Soo.

226
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,830
The profile that
he's in his 50s is wrong.

227
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,600
- Give me that thing.
- Here you go.

228
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,240
What are you doing?

229
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,639
The murder weapon,
a military M7 bayonet.

230
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,679
Rifle bore-cleaner used to wipe it.

231
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,350
- You found it?
- The smell from the corpse...

232
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:30,080
was from this rifle bore-cleaner.

233
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,490
It really stank because it was made
to 1960s' army specifications.

234
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,320
What does that smell
have to do with the killer?

235
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,690
That's the wrong question.

236
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:41,590
Rifle bore-cleaner's for the muzzle.
Why was it on the stab wound?

237
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,690
Keep going.

238
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,730
The killer's not in his 50s.
He's older.

239
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,600
I say 70s or older.

240
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,830
These were used
by the army in the 60s.

241
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,970
They were low on supplies then...

242
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,470
and wiped their bayonets
with muzzle cleaner.

243
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,639
The killer still maintains
his weapon that way.

244
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,679
The facts on the body don't lie.

245
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,019
We're ready. What should we do?

246
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,460
Bring him in.

247
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,220
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,059
Sorry, but your claim...

249
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,129
is quite interesting.

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,100
Let's go.

251
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,679
We're going in.

252
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,149
Mr. Kang Chi Soo?

253
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,299
Why run away? We're here to talk.

254
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,429
Take him.

255
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,870
- You got him?
- Yes.

256
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:58,899
That's the darkroom.

257
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,570
- Hold him down.
- Okay.

258
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,000
A remodeled bathroom?

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,399
We'll check for blood.

260
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,539
Okay.

261
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,009
Lights off.

262
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,659
It's all blood spatters.

263
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,070
It's over. We have him.

264
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,200
Arrest Kang Chi Soo and
get the NFS to investigate the room.

265
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,600
Yes, sir.

266
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,769
It's done. Arrest him.

267
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:11,909
Kang Chi Soo, you're
under arrest for the murders of...

268
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:13,679
Lee Kyung Ja and Seong Hye Bin.
Let's go.

269
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,490
Thanks for your hard work.
Check the scene carefully.

270
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,669
- Prepare for a briefing.
- Yes, sir.

271
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,409
That'll do.

272
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,250
Swab the bathtub, walls, and floor.

273
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,089
Isn't this familiar?

274
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,119
It's what you did often...

275
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,660
30 years ago.

276
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,839
What did you do
on the 10th and 17th of July?

277
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:55,079
I was out to take photos.

278
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,619
Why did you try to run away earlier?

279
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,250
30 years ago,

280
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,519
you people harassed me the same way.

281
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,660
When I think about that time,

282
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,490
I still shudder.

283
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,900
Why did you come back to Wuseong,
the place that makes you shudder?

284
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,369
Did you miss the old days?

285
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,369
There's no place like Wuseong
to kill, is there?

286
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,740
You know all the shortcuts,

287
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,140
and there are no cameras
in the rundown neighborhoods.

288
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,950
Do you have evidence?

289
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:32,180
- What?
- Bluffing without any proof.

290
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,789
Just like 30 years ago.

291
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,289
When the blood spatter
results come out,

292
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,829
you won't be able to say that, okay?

293
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,630
You illegally remodeled
a bathroom into a darkroom.

294
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,799
- Let him go. It's not him.
- So you could kill again.

295
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,670
- What?
- Old habits die hard.

296
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,140
What are you talking about?

297
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,309
Give me that.

298
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,349
Let's compare.

299
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,079
Isn't that strange?

300
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:05,180
You returned from Canada...

301
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,349
- What are you doing?
- And more died after 30 years.

302
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,849
Right in Wuseong-dong.

303
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,059
Do you see this?

304
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,859
Do you see this?

305
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,099
It's iron dust.

306
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,029
The lens caps of old
film cameras are made of iron.

307
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,829
So what if they are?

308
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,769
Luminol reacts with hemoglobin,

309
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:26,640
in other words, the iron in blood.

310
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,309
It reacted to actual iron dust
as well.

311
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:33,710
The sparkle you saw in the darkroom
were iron specks, not blood.

312
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,549
On everything we brought back,

313
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,750
we found iron dust or specks and
black paint coated on the camera.

314
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,619
There was no blood.

315
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,759
Hand that over.

316
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,960
(Component Analysis)

317
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,990
(Iron, Paint)

318
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,859
He put the lens cap
on and off in the darkroom.

319
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,500
Dozens of times a day.

320
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,369
There was no blood in that room?

321
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:58,269
Not a single drop.
That's not the crime scene.

322
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,009
- This is so uncomfortable.
- Seriously.

323
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,279
The mold from Kang Chi Soo's teeth
and marks on Seong Hye Bin's neck...

324
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,980
aren't a match either.

325
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,720
Then where did he go
after closing his studio?

326
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,319
He was out working.

327
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,490
We checked his camera
for photos from those days.

328
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,890
He took candid photos
of the public for sale.

329
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,089
- What?
- That's why he tried to run.

330
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,730
We proved those charges.

331
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,710
You helped us a lot.

332
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,910
I'm really sorry.

333
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,420
We were sure it was him.

334
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,450
I thought we'd get him this time.

335
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,220
You all can go home.

336
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,960
If we need your help,

337
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,190
we will give you a call.

338
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,329
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

339
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,640
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

340
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:25,220
"A Doberman never lets go
once it bites."

341
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,130
- I thought you were a Doberman.
- Yes, and your point is?

342
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,259
Why are you beating
yourself up for it?

343
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,299
No, I'm not.

344
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm waiting for my noodles.
My blood sugar is low.

345
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,299
Do you want some?

346
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,099
I'm fine.

347
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,079
Goodness.

348
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,380
I really thought that we had him.

349
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,779
I don't know where we went wrong.

350
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:50,450
This is driving me crazy.

351
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,890
Is this how you solved cases
at the Central District?

352
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,089
Usually, you seem to be cautious,
but once you're fixed on an idea,

353
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:00,529
you try to see it through
even if others try to stop you.

354
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,900
And in the process, you got demoted.
The news is all over the place.

355
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:06,130
Really?

356
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,900
When owners can't take care of
these rabid dogs,

357
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,839
they send them away
out of their house.

358
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:21,809
Why are you eating by yourself?

359
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,619
What? What is it?
Are you going to say...

360
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:26,849
that pain halves when shared
or something like that?

361
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,920
My gosh, forget it.

362
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,690
Reflecting on one's mistakes
ought to be done alone.

363
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:36,130
Come on, did you investigate
by yourself?

364
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,460
If we apprehended the culprit,

365
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,329
were you going to take the credit
all for yourself?

366
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,400
My gosh, you're terrible.

367
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,799
Did I sound like that?

368
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:52,009
I'm heading somewhere.
Do you want to join me?

369
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,380
Where?

370
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:58,450
(Under Investigation, Off Limits)

371
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,119
There wasn't a single drop of blood.

372
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,900
He washed it with water.

373
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:08,549
My gosh.

374
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,019
Dr. Baek.

375
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,900
"The culprit always returns to
the scene of the crime."

376
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,230
You completely fit that profile.

377
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,900
What are you doing in the tub?

378
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,440
- He washed it.
- What?

379
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,140
The culprit washed the body.

380
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,380
When the artery is cut, at least
3L of blood will gush out.

381
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,240
That's why he killed her
in this tub.

382
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,009
30 years ago,

383
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,779
it was doable to kill women
on desolate hills or rice paddies.

384
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,619
The blood would have been
absorbed into the soil.

385
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:41,549
But that won't be easy these days.

386
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:45,460
There are a lot of people and cars.
They are all possible witnesses.

387
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,430
That's why he killed her
inside the bathroom.

388
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,029
The blood will be washed out.

389
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,900
However, he would have left
a definite trace.

390
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:01,539
I have something to
announce to you all.

391
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,839
We're going to completely reexamine
the culprit's profile.

392
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,940
- Pardon?
- Sorry?

393
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,880
He may be shorter than 180cm
and over 50.

394
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
We will broaden his age
to men in their 70s.

395
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,920
What are you talking about?

396
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,319
Are you going to believe in
Dr. Baek's opinion?

397
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,329
(Wanted)

398
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,470
From this point on,

399
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,539
we'll start our investigation
at square one again.

400
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,839
I cannot allow this.

401
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:36,369
Are you going to throw away
all of our hard work until now?

402
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,509
I'm sorry, sir.
Even if you disagree,

403
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:41,079
the direction of the investigation
has already changed.

404
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,319
Fine. Then do whatever you want.

405
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,049
- I can't allow this.
- Wait, sir.

406
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:55,829
Let's continue.

407
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,329
All right. We have a lot to do.

408
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:01,970
The culprit always drains out...

409
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,240
the victims before
he disposes the bodies.

410
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,740
In the process, the usage
of water must have increased.

411
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,539
The average amount of water
a person uses in 1 day is 500L.

412
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,109
From the body,
about 3L of blood comes out.

413
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:16,509
To completely remove all that blood,
he would've needed 10 times of that.

414
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,779
Then he must have used
at least 5,000L.

415
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:19,849
That's right.

416
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:22,089
I'll put together
a list of households...

417
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:25,359
whose water usage skyrocketed
all over Wuseong-dong.

418
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,089
The substance that was found
in Lee Kyung Ja's stab wound.

419
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:31,329
It's a rifle bore-cleaner, produced
in the 60s for military use.

420
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:34,470
You can only buy this from military
collector shops or websites.

421
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,099
Including the websites,
look into every seller.

422
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,539
And give me a list...

423
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:42,009
of people who bought this product
over the past six months.

424
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,170
Yes, sir.

425
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,740
Prosecutor Eun.

426
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,849
I came to the management office
to measure the water usage.

427
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:50,150
In order to search every household
in Wuseong-dong,

428
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,049
they have to manually program
the households.

429
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:53,890
They said that
it will take about 1 or 2 days.

430
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,920
That long?

431
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,589
Or we have to check
the meters one by one...

432
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:00,630
and check the accumulated
usage until today.

433
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,960
We can only use that method
after narrowing down the sample.

434
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:05,400
Okay.

435
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,500
Gosh.

436
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,269
We have the list of people who
purchased rifle bore-cleaners.

437
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:15,509
We can't identify them
since they used their usernames.

438
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,509
We only picked out people who got
their package in Wuseong-dong...

439
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:19,180
during the past six months.

440
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,549
- How many do we have?
- 38 people, sir.

441
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,019
We might be able to...

442
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,890
find him by today if we dispatch
more people on that.

443
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,660
- Sir, I'll see you on the field.
- Okay, drive safely.

444
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,430
(Seoul Eastern District
Prosecutor's Office)

445
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,339
Yes, we're from Seoul Eastern
District Prosecutor's Office.

446
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:54,109
- May I check your water meter?
- Okay.

447
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,559
Here it is.

448
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,089
Unit 104.

449
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,099
- It's 480.
- 480?

450
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,099
- It's 480.
- 480?

451
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:16,400
That's too little.
This isn't the house. Let's go.

452
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:28,650
Deputy Yang, why don't you go
that way? I'll go this way.

453
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,650
Yes, sir.

454
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Excuse me.

455
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,990
Is anyone home?

456
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,029
Is anyone home?

457
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,299
Excuse me.
