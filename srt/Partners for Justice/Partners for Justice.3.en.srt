1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,009
The wife of a son of
an assemblyman in office...

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,480
has been found dead at home.

3
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,349
The son is the key suspect,

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,160
but he's denying the charges.

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,129
(Episode 3)

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,760
I'll get to the point.

7
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,929
Are the victim's death and
the assault the prosecutor claims...

8
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,429
(Witness)

9
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:29,829
Are they relevant?

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,840
No. The cause of death
was not assault.

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,679
I knew he'd say that.

12
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,969
It's about the embryo found
in her uterus.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,680
Is that related to the defendant?

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,879
- Pardon?
- Defense.

15
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,709
Elaborate on your question.

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,950
The embryo
the victim was carrying...

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,189
had nothing to do
with the defendant.

18
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,819
The main cause
of their fights was...

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,030
I hate to mention it, but it was
the deceased's unfaithfulness.

20
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,530
- He's slandering the victim.
- Come on, what's he doing?

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,500
I'm only claiming that unverified
statements must be removed.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,329
Both the embryo
and the victim passed away.

23
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,239
It's impossible for us
to confirm the facts.

24
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,569
Sustained.

25
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,079
Let me ask you one more question.

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,709
She claims that the victim was
endlessly abused.

27
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,480
Did the autopsy show that
the defendant had beaten...

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,890
the victim?

29
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:00,629
It's impossible to pinpoint
the assailant through autopsy.

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,930
The prosecution is deviating
from the nature of the trial...

31
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,139
with the assault...

32
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,969
which has nothing to do with
the victim's death or the defendant.

33
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,639
If you indicted him for murder,

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,039
provide evidence of the murder.

35
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:27,050
Prosecution. Would you like
to cross-examine the witness?

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,430
- If you're not going to...
- No, no. I will.

37
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,830
I'll cross-examine him.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
- Then please proceed now.
- Okay.

39
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,909
Is this the autopsy report
of the victim you've filled out?

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,819
(Autopsy Report)

41
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:00,449
Yes, it is.

42
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,629
Could you read this part out loud?

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,430
"The cause is
the acute poisoning..."

44
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,030
"of fluconazole
along with multiple other drugs."

45
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,770
Fluconazole.

46
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,599
Isn't that used for athlete's feet?

47
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,439
Did the victim have athlete's feet?

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,439
No, I didn't find any signs
of her having the condition.

49
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,680
Defendant, may I see your feet...

50
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,389
to check if you have athlete's feet?

51
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,789
Objection.

52
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,319
What are you doing?

53
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,430
This condition is an important point
in this trial.

54
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,930
Proceed.

55
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,629
Defendant, did you hear her?

56
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,839
They are clean. You don't have
athlete's feet either.

57
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,839
Allow me to submit
a new piece of evidence.

58
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,040
Nice.

59
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,810
This record shows that...

60
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,850
the defendant was prescribed
for fluconazole.

61
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,550
Defendant.

62
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:43,819
Why did you purchase this?

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,329
My wife asked me to get it.

64
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,300
- What?
- Ma'am.

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,699
You do not know
what anticoagulants are, do you?

66
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,980
Blood clots might cause
prosthetic valve malfunction.

67
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,050
And that's the drug that prevents
the blood from congealing.

68
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,579
Because her blood won't clot,
she gets bruises all the time.

69
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,889
Every time she fell,
it was a big mess.

70
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,550
Do you think she'd want to go out
in that condition?

71
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,560
I bought everything for her.

72
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,990
All I did...

73
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,759
was buy the medicine
my wife had asked for.

74
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,199
Getting prescribed
for someone else...

75
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,370
doesn't constitute as murder.

76
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,240
How does that make sense?

77
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,569
She had asked for medicine that
would kill her if she took it?

78
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,810
Didn't you forge the prescription?

79
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,339
You gave her this poisonous drug
to kill her!

80
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,509
- Stop lying!
- Watch your language!

81
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,209
You're the one who must stop using
your intuition.

82
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,720
- Do you have proof?
- That's enough.

83
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,189
Both of you. Approach the bench.

84
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,430
Prosecutor Eun, don't you think
you need more evidence?

85
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,240
Your Honor, please grant me
some more time.

86
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:07,110
I can prove this case.

87
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:10,810
What? Are you planning
to change your arraignment?

88
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,879
Will you drop the murder charge?

89
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,480
- This will be a waste of time.
- Your Honor.

90
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,420
I indicted him for murder.

91
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,819
There won't be any changes
in that matter.

92
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,860
I understand.

93
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,829
Please go back to your seats
for now.

94
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,439
This trial...

95
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,670
will resume three days later.

96
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,079
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- However,

97
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,009
if you cannot provide evidence
that supports the charge...

98
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,680
you indicted him for
in the next trial,

99
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,420
we will acquit him
of the charge immediately.

100
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,720
- We still have three days.
- Yes.

101
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,319
It's better than nothing.

102
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,990
I'm glad we got a continuation.

103
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,709
Good job.

104
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,310
They completely crushed me,
didn't they?

105
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,819
Unbelievable. How could he lie
without even batting an eyelid?

106
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,220
Trials are competitions of liars.

107
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,449
Doesn't it look like
they're trying to bet on...

108
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,889
which one is a better liar?

109
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,860
- And...
- The truth that lasts...

110
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,490
- until the end wins. Is that it?
- No.

111
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,360
The lie that sounds
the most probable wins.

112
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,959
Hey, that can't be right.

113
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,199
No matter how probable it sounds,
a lie is still a lie.

114
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,370
That can't be right.

115
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,410
Hyun, you seem a bit different.

116
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:51,579
How?

117
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,819
You used to look naive and innocent,
but now, you sound a bit cynical.

118
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,819
Anyone would change after working
as a prosecutor for 10 years.

119
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,290
Anyway, why did you volunteer
to become a prosecutor?

120
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,230
I mean, does this fit you?

121
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,000
Why? Do I look weird in this?

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,730
No, it's not the robe.

123
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,069
You're a very warm person
from a good family.

124
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,670
You have to be...

125
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,470
a bit colder
to work as a prosecutor.

126
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,310
Did anything happen
between then and now by any chance?

127
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,579
Why?

128
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,550
Do you think my family went under,
so I came here to get revenge?

129
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,750
Goodness.

130
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,250
Hyun.

131
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,330
You're a great son whom your family
expects a lot from, right?

132
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,360
Well...

133
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,129
I guess so.

134
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,000
That's not my case.

135
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,399
I'm someone who needs to
continuously prove herself...

136
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,409
like a weed in a greenhouse.

137
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,610
I never know
when I'll get weeded out.

138
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,909
But still, I feel confident.

139
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,179
You know very well that
I was the nosiest girl...

140
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,049
and the mentalist of law school.

141
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,450
You're right.

142
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,720
Everyone said you gave the best
solutions to their problems,

143
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,690
so they all came to you for advice.

144
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,389
You're very good at
looking through people.

145
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:16,700
However, you can't do everything
with your gut feelings.

146
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,899
Of course not.

147
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:22,129
But since I was a kid,
I always knew when I saw something.

148
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,440
I knew what was the best.

149
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
I knew who was a great person
and who wasn't.

150
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,370
Yes, I'll give you that.

151
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,009
But still, you'd better
get ready for this.

152
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,679
Don't come crying to me
when things don't go your way.

153
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,750
I'll be fine as long as I don't die.

154
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,350
The autopsy table was
awfully cold. I hated it.

155
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:45,659
- What?
- What?

156
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,190
Oh, nothing.

157
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,700
- Have a lot.
- Sure.

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,269
Look at that.
Dr. Baek is really thorough.

159
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,210
With what?

160
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,279
Taking forever with his autopsies?

161
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,679
He makes sure that
he stays an outcast.

162
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,179
You know what?

163
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,919
We can't even get on the same bus.

164
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,490
There are 20 of us in this country.

165
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,559
What if we all got onto a bus
and got into an accident?

166
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,960
Who will conduct autopsies?
It'll become a country of killers.

167
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,600
We shouldn't do get-togethers, then.

168
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,129
That's an exception.

169
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:27,169
Anyway, Dr. Baek.

170
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,669
From now on, you aren't allowed in
the autopsy room past midnight.

171
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:34,009
Hey, get changed.

172
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,570
That's like a school uniform to you.

173
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,139
I did get changed. These are new.

174
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,179
Leave him.

175
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,549
We used to order black bean noodles
and eat them in the autopsy room.

176
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,549
That's taking things too far.
What if you get infected?

177
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,389
That's back when we were all poor.

178
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,860
We all got tuberculosis
and were hospitalized altogether.

179
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,490
So none of the medical examiners
were on duty at that time,

180
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,899
praying that there wouldn't be
any homicide cases.

181
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,799
Is that why we had
so many unresolved cases?

182
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:03,970
It's just a joke.

183
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,039
We always stop laughing
when we do autopsies.

184
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,309
Hey.

185
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,539
The case with
Oh Pil Joong's daughter-in-law.

186
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,379
I heard she is presumed
to have died in an accident.

187
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,649
You hate making presumptions.

188
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,090
Hello? This is Baek Beom.

189
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,120
Yes, on my way.

190
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,059
- Don't go. Finish your food.
- It's work.

191
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,769
What are you doing?

192
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,970
I'm not done eating.

193
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,009
Who's going to drive? Me?

194
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,779
- Get up.
- Congratulations, man.

195
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,860
Hello, Prosecutor Eun.

196
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,590
This way.

197
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,490
I told you to be careful.

198
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,629
You would've killed us all
if there was poisonous gas!

199
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,629
- Gosh.
- I'm so sorry.

200
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,330
That fat kid.

201
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,929
Look, it's written on the tank.

202
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:41,970
"Balloon World". It's helium.

203
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,070
Do you think people only put in
helium into helium tanks?

204
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,870
Move.

205
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,240
Even with a different voice,
he's still a psycho.

206
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,320
Temperature is 36°C.
What's the temperature of the water?

207
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,519
It's 37°C.

208
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:08,590
The person died
more than three hours ago.

209
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:11,960
That means the suspect
couldn't have gone too far.

210
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,029
- Is this a rape murder?
- You're writing up a novel again.

211
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,470
Don't you know what rigor mortis is?

(Rigor mortis: Postmortem rigidity)

213
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:21,639
She's covered with plastic
and holding the hose with her hand.

214
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,309
Cause of death, oxygen in her lungs
was replaced with helium gas.

215
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,639
It's suicide.

216
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,909
Wrap it up. Move.

217
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,580
Wait. Dr. Baek. One second.

218
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,120
Darn it, that old man.

219
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,929
Dr. Baek...

220
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,710
- Shouldn't you apologize to me?
- For what?

221
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,539
You suddenly showed up at the trial
and ruined everything.

222
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,779
You shouldn't be like this
as someone on the same side.

223
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,450
Move. Let's go.

224
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,320
Wait.

225
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,690
I won't give up on this case.

226
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,720
- If there's anything we missed...
- We missed nothing.

227
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,559
The autopsy is finished.
The body was cremated.

228
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,629
The suspect was freed,
and we don't have the crime scene.

229
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:16,230
This case is over.

230
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,129

- I will.

Why did you come here?

237

That way.

238
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,529

1, 2.

240
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,659
He was freed on bail.
Well, naturally, of course.

241
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,230
You're here for nothing.
Today is our cleaning day.

242
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,900
- Are you destroying evidence?
- I'm getting rid of what's filthy.

243
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,170
Destroying evidence? Goodness.

244
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Prosecutor Eun, it's all over.
You need to get over it.

245
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,269
- The trial isn't over yet.
- Right, we have two more days.

246
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,450
I am going to take him back in.

247
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,250
- I'll see you at court.
- We'll be waiting for you.

248
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,980
Oh, right.

249
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,990

They're experts at
toying with the law.

260
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,039
This is blackmail.
You're a serving prosecutor,

261
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,509
and they threaten you legally?

262
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,640

from spreading their seeds.

Doctor, do you remember these?

273
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,650
The shoes you yelled at me over.

274

at that time.

I give it to you that you checked
Kwon Hee Kyung thoroughly.

But I was the one,

the first one, to sit beside
her dead body.

he got rid of the carpet.

I'm giving the order...

No.

294
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,279

299
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,069
There's a good repair shop nearby.

300

It's okay.

301
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,680
I waited for three years
and wore them just once.

302
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,819
There is powder.

303
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,160
It's pink with very rough edges.
It looks man-made.

304

Get Toxic Substances Division
to identify it.

- Of course.

Ciao.

316
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,240
I found fluconazole.

317
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:44,009
The powder here is from
a crushed-up fluconazole pill.

318
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,339
What?

319
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,349
Why would someone crush a pill?

320
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,079
Good point.

321
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:50,880
Why go to such lengths?

322
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,720
There's something wrong
with the situation.

323
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,549
That's the wrong question.

324
00:21:58,289 --> 00:21:59,589
Who crushed it?

325
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,900
He did it on purpose.

326
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,569
Immediate rigor mortis.

327
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,869
What didn't she want to
let go of even while dying?

328
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,309
She was holding onto
something desperately.

329
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,240
Where was her right hand
before you moved her?

330
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,549
You have a good memory.

331
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,759
Her pocket. It was in her pocket.

332
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,819
It's not this side.

333
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,900
It fell through the hole.

334
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,279
- Foxetin?
- Give me that.

335
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,119
It was opened then closed.

336
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,619
That's why it was crushed.

337
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,589
To put in this capsule.

338
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,700
We found her dying message.

339
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:48,500
That's scumbag's done for.

340
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,269
Will there be prints on the capsule?

341
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,619
Pour him a drink.

342
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,329
What would you like?

343
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,900
A boilermaker?

344
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:18,230
Whatever.

345
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,069
Congratulations.

346
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,230
You've practically won.

347
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,940
Congratulations on what?

348
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,410
Shall I congratulate you lot...

349
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,339
on getting a bonus?

350
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:35,279
You didn't do anything.

351
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,420
You make me pay you by the second.

352
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,589
Did you see the prosecutor
glare and talk back at me?

353
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,460
Do you want me dead?

354
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,859
- Pardon?
- That's a lot of whiskey.

355
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,589
Do you want me knocked out?

356
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,799
No, sir.

357
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,869
- Are you married?
- Yes.

358
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,410
What does your husband do?

359
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,380
What makes you think
you can act so stiffly around me?

360
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,509
That's enough, sir.

361
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,519
Are you mocking me?

362
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,589
You like my money.
You take everything I pay you.

363
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,450
Are you mocking me?

364
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,960
Hey.

365
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,359
Be careful.

366
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:41,680
Pour me more.

367
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,920
I'll die for you.

368
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,970
Die-hard coffee.
It's what we call our brew.

369
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,740
I must've dozed off.

370
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,210
Are you tired? Try it.

371
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,880
Thank you.

372
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,359
For someone who...

373
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,759
researches toxic substances,
you're very...

374
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,990
Pretty?

375
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:30,329
Guess what? Cleopatra
was a fan of toxins too.

376
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:32,329
Beauty and poison.

377
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,170
It's a charming combination.

378
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,369
Right.

379
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:39,670
Where's Dr. Baek Beom?

380
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,569
He left excitedly.

381
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:44,039
He's excited?

382
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,950
When he finds something unexpected,
he gets super high.

383
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,789
Did you get prints?

384
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,390
The capsules are so small.

385
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,589
They're all partials
and will take time.

386
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,559
We're checking every trace
we found on them.

387
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,299
The hearing's at 1pm.

388
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,630
Use this for now.

389
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,869
What's this?

390
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,710
There was so little,
so I could only request one test.

391
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:18,039
What test?

392
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:25,180
For how long must a good man
be suspected for killing his wife?

393
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,720
We will not put up with
the prosecutor's tyranny.

394
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,559
To show how we feel
about the prosecutor...

395
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,319
who assumed my client was guilty
and coerced him,

396
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,059
we refuse to respond to
her questions.

397
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,400
We invoke the right
to remain silent.

398
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,500
Then why did you bother
coming to court? You're talking...

399
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,970
2-1 of Article 283 of the Inspection
Procedure Act states...

400
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,869
that the defendant can refuse to...

401
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,940
give a statement or answer
certain questions.

402
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,740
Sustained.

403
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,349
This looks bad.

404
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,549
Won't the hearing end in 10 minutes?

405
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:00,849
(Defense Counsel)

406
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,789
- What a sly loach.
- Will you question the defendant?

407
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,740
May I still question the defendant
regardless of his intent to answer?

408
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
Proceed the cross-examination now.

409
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,680
According to Article 283
of Criminal Procedure Code,

410
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,849
he refuses to answer.

411
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:38,490
Do you remember the embryo
the victim was carrying...

412
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,460
and your claim that
it had nothing to do with you?

413
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,859
I was very curious
about the father of the baby.

414
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:47,900
(National Forensic Service)

415
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,099
It's inside this envelope.

416
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,369
This is the result of
the paternity test...

417
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:54,440
the NFS performed with the tissues
acquired from the embryo.

418
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,039
- No way. A paternity test?
- My gosh, is that even possible?

419
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,740
If you wish, I will show it to you.

420
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:02,849
However, there is one condition.

421
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:10,589
We only found
the victim's fingerprints.

422
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:12,490
She must have held them tightly
when she passed away.

423
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,289
Did you find anything else
other than her prints?

424
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,200
I did find some synthetic rubber.
That could be just about anything.

425
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:24,369
What is it?

426
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:30,539
What about them?

427
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:33,009
Latex. Isn't this synthetic rubber?

428
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:34,950
But what will you do
with the gloves?

429
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:40,150
Well, if you don't want to know,
I'll discard the result.

430
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,490
Wait.

431
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,819
What did you say?

432
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:48,890
Get it.

433
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:54,930
This won't affect the trial.
Why would you...

434
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,640
Will he answer my questions then?

435
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,180
Yes, he will.

- Right here.

All right. Should we continue?

443
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,940
These are the pills we found...

444
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,079
in the victim's pocket
on the day of the incident.

445
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,849
She didn't submit the evidence
in advance.

446
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,019
This evidence was...

447
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,619
expedited to be evaluated
by the Trace Evidence Division...

448
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:21,750
of the NFS this morning.

449
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,789
We will allow the evidence.
You may continue.

450
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:33,430
This is fluconazole
which killed the victim.

451
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,500
However,

452
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:36,940
we found something very strange
regarding the pills.

453
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,269
Let me show you myself.

454
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,009
Give it to her.

455
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,359
When you grind
the fluconazole tablets,

456
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,759
they become powder.

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,640
- What is the point of all this?
- Let her finish.

459
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,599
You may continue.

460
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:14,109
Okay.

461
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,849
These is a foxetin capsule.

462
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,579
I'll empty it.

463
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,630
Can you see?

464
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:39,559
It's a foxetin capsule,
but fluconazole is inside.

465
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,869
This is...

466

467

in which he replaced the content
to kill the victim.

- What's going on?
- Is this true?

469

Didn't you make this
to kill your wife?
