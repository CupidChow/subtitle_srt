1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,209
Okay. Now, lift.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,679
My brother died three years ago.

3
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,210
But his so-called wife suddenly
showed up with a newborn...

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,750
Deuk Nam had frozen
his sperm before he died.

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,650
I used Deuk Nam's sperm
and had his baby.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,190
She found out our dad left
his inheritance to his grandson.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,030
Get the DNA,
and close it back up.

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,199
A depressed fracture.

9
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,629
He needs an autopsy.

10
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,070
- Where did Deuk Nam go?
- Where is he?

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,370
Let's write an autopsy warrant.

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,770
- Pardon?
- I...

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,640
- stole a body.
- What?

14
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,049
This jerk...

15
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,090
Ms. Eun. Well...

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,750
What do you do on the weekends?

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,520
I'm so sorry,

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,329
but something urgent came up.

19
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,659
- I must leave now.
- Wait. Excuse me.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,929
I'm Hyun Min's mother.

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,469
I see. Hello.

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,180
- For how long were you there?
- Mom.

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,680
My gosh, be quiet.

24
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:16,450
Let me be blunt with you.

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,879
I like you very much.

26
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,879
Sorry?

27
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,219
You're a prosecutor,
so I know that you're smart.

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,959
You're quite pretty.

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,459
Marry my son, quit your job,

30
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,930
and focus on raising his children
and taking care of him.

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,760
- Pardon?
- People respect you...

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,829
because you're a prosecutor now.

33
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,700
But you know that doctors,
attorneys, and prosecutors...

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,170
aren't that popular among
residents in Gangnam now, right?

35
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,180
I'm certain that you've often heard
that having a rich grandfather...

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,609
is the best.

37
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,079
- Right now, I'm not...
- I don't know how to bring this up.

38
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,049
Here's three million dollars.

39
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,659
Because we want
our grandchild to be smart,

40
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,560
we're willing to present you
with a handsome offer.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,359
This is all your luck.

42
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,359
Excuse me.

43
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,169
With all due respect,

44
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,669
may I say something?

45
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,870
This is my 99th blind date.

46
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,840
Since I've been on many dates,
I became a good judge of character.

47
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,050
Your son has
very low self-esteem right now.

48
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,689
I presume
his rich grandfather didn't know...

49
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:32,219
the importance
of taking initiatives.

50
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,860
Forget about his marriage.

51
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,530
You two should have
a good talk about...

52
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,430
how he should live his life.

53
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:41,870
What?

54
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,639
And the kid's IQ...

55
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:48,039
doesn't depend on the mother alone.

56
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,939
Please excuse me.

57
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,419
Goodness.

58
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,530
- We're here.
- Let's go.

59
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,099
- Come on.
- Where?

60
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,129
- It's over here.
- Let's go.

61
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,099
What? The ladies are here.

62
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,939
Open the door. Hurry!

63
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,539
- Stop right there!
- Goodness.

64
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,669
Stop them.

65
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,310
- Get away.
- Move!

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,379
- Move aside.
- Calm down.

67
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,150
- Goodness!
- Stop him!

71

- Punch in your passcode again.

- Hurry up!
- Hurry!

73

- Punch in your passcode again.
- Goodness.

74
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,229
I think he locked it
from the inside.

75
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,360
- Give my brother back.
- Do you want to die?

76
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,329
Isn't this supposed to be
a state institution?

77
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,100
I am not going to let this pass.
Open the door!

78
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going to sue you all!

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,110
You'll all get fired. Get it?

80
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,110
Go get the master key.

81
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,750

- Yes, sir.

82
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,879

(National Forensic Service)

84
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,240
Do it.

85
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,339
- Hurry.
- Open it.

86
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,839
Open it.

Hurry up and open it.

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,750
Hurry up.
Why are you standing around?

89
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,889
One second.

90
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,290
Goodness, who are you?

91
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,329
- Prosecutor Eun?
- Yes.

92
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,730
- Have you been well?
- I'm so glad you're here.

93
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,399
There's a huge problem here.

94
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,000
They took away my brother's body
to conduct an autopsy.

95
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,899
I came to talk to you about that.

96
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,970
One second.

97
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,209
I'm sorry. My bag was too tiny.

98
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,050
- What is that?
- It's a bit wrinkled.

99
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,550
It's a warrant for an autopsy.

100
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,550
- A warrant?
- What is this about?

101
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,660
- Why are you doing this?
- First off, please calm down.

102
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,660
This is a necessary procedure
for your deceased brother too.

103
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,300
This is completely absurd!
He's my brother. You can't do this!

104
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,199
Excuse me. Sorry.

(A Warrant for Search,
Seizure, and Examination)

111
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,490
Hello.

112
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,290
Listen to me.

113
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,389
It's been three years since he died.

114
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,129
Why do you want to know
the cause of his death now?

115
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,600
The statute of limitations
hasn't expired yet.

116
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,639
And I thought you three would
want to know more than us.

117
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,069
If you keep doing this,

118

Yes.

121
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,180
You will be imprisoned
up to five years...

122
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,290
or pay a fine
of 10,000 dollars or less.

123
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,160
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,930
Forgive me for
not introducing myself.

125
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,100
I'm Prosecutor Eun Sol
of Seoul Eastern District Office.

126
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,529
I heard this was urgent,
so I came myself.

127
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,230
I'm Park Joong Ho, the director.
Thank you.

128
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,800
May I go in and tell him
what's going on?

129
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,569
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,779
Get out!

131
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,689
Dr. Psycho.

132
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,790
- Does she have the warrant?
- Yes, I checked it.

133
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,389
- Get ready.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,199
I guess all that you can see
is the warrant and not me.

135
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,129
Look at this. I got 28 missed calls.

136
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,629
It's like you're looking for
your crush who went off the grid.

137
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,339
Why did I come...

138
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,610
Let's get started.

139
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,910
Prosecutor Eun.
Will you wait in the other room?

140
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,649
Yes, I should.

141
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,949
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

142
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,759
A body decomposes
to go back to nature.

143
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,189
Do you think you won't decompose?

144
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,230
Everyone's the same when
they're dead. They all smell.

145
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,500
Darn it. World peace
should've been achieved by now.

146
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,029
Are you wearing perfume?

147
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,670
Yes. I had
an important meeting today.

148
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,699
Get out of here.

149
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,870
Potassium has a very unique smell.

150
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,379
The smell is important when it comes
to pesticides and hydrogen sulfide.

151
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,810
And your perfume...

152
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,379
But still, it's already been
three years.

153
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,720
Do you think he's a joke
because he's decomposed?

154
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,750
Should I do the autopsy like that on
you three years after you're dead?

155
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,059
Get out of my autopsy room.

156
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:45,529
Goodness.

157
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,899
Prosecutor Eun.
I didn't know you were that harsh.

158
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,370
How can you betray us like this?

159
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,980
Why are you so against it?

160
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,549
I mean, you shouldn't cut him open
after he's been through so much...

161
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:03,580
after many operations.

162
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,519
Just the thought
of the autopsy appalls me.

163
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,320
Goodness, that poor thing.

164
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,320
Choi Hwa Ja made you do this,
didn't she?

165
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,220
If you're a prosecutor,
you should be on our side.

166
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,059
You can't let that woman
play around with you!

167
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,960
I only see their emotions,

168
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,769
and no sincerity.

169
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,909
Don't you smell something?

170
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:34,450
- Smell? Like what?
- What smell?

171
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,019
Goodness, my clothes smell awful
from that short stay in the room.

172
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,750
Smell it. Isn't it awful?

173
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,419
- That is disgusting!
- What's with you?

174
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,889
You said you didn't want the knife
to touch your brother,

175
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,899
yet you despise the smell.

176
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,769
The medical examiner over there
went in and smelled him...

177
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,470
to find out the cause of his death.

178
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,240
- Well...
- It's...

179
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,539
All right, now.

180
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,720
This isn't just a simple fraud case.
Do you understand?

181
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,320
We'll give you a call very soon.

182
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,820
Make sure you come back
for the questioning, okay?

183
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,889
Darn it.

184
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,750
Most of his
internal organs are gone.

185
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,350
Internal organs are mostly gone.

186
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,350
(Internal organs are mostly gone.)

187
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,669
- Femur, 46.19cm.
- 46.19cm.

188
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,049
Skull dent, 15cm big.

189
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,519
15cm.

190
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,090
I thought he died at the hospital.
That's odd. The dent is huge.

191
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,159
- Bring the 3D scanner.
- Okay.

192
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,399
It's ready.

193
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,669
Scanning.

194
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,820
Darn it, that psycho
did this behind our backs.

195
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,860
If this goes wrong,
I'll end up getting punished.

196
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,590
Prosecutor Eun.

197
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,529
Hey. Get a hold of yourself.

198
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,399
Don't worry about it.
The warrant got here first.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Can't a prosecutor dress up?

200
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,370
Of course, you can. You look lovely.

201
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,309
You might get
a dent in your skull too.

202
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,639
Get a hold of yourself,
and let's get to work.

203
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,019
Dr. Baek. I made it clear that
we should hand the body over.

204
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,519
- How will this make me look?
- Forget it.

205
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,460
You saw the skull fracture.

206
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,490
We can't leave out
the possibility of murder.

207
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:36,799
Wasn't it strange that his sisters
objected to the autopsy?

208
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes, and an inheritance is involved.

209
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,299
You're writing a novel again.

210
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,840
If they'd killed him,
they'd have cremated him.

211
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,139
You believed everyone, and now,
you suspect everyone.

212
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,179
They're fighting each other
over money. They're suspects.

213
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,779
And they handed over the body?

214
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,350
A funeral home came for
the body we just autopsied.

215
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,360
- It's ours.
- Why? You're done with the autopsy.

216
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,590
We sometimes fail...

217
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,529
to get a DNA sample
from decomposing bodies.

218
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:11,629
Please try to understand.

219
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,440
Prosecutor Eun,
give me another warrant.

220
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,309
A legal one.

221
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,179
Until the case is closed,

222
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,610
I'll have the evidence protected.

223
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,779
(Humans are flowers.)

224
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,450
(Treat them gently.)

225
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:34,149
"I return to the skies."

226
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,720
"With the dew that
vanishes at dawn,"

227
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,460
- That's...
- "I return hand-in-hand."

228
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,860
It's a memorial service.

229
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,759
- What?
- Go and watch.

230
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,070
"I return to the skies."

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,870
"I will play with the sunset..."

232
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,440
"below a mountain
until the clouds beckon."

233
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,710
"I return to the skies."

234
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,509
"The day my beautiful picnic
on earth ends,"

235
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,149
"I'll return..."

236
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,620
- What's going on?
- "And say it was beautiful."

237
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,320
It's a memorial service.

238
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,490
Last year, nationwide,
the National Forensic Service...

239
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,960
autopsied 8,762 bodies.

240
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,129
We're commemorating them.
We do this every year.

241
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,429
I saw this before, but I didn't know
exactly what it was.

242
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,210
Director Park Joong Ho...

243
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:31,279
read Chon Sang Pyong's poem,

244
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,240
"Return to the Skies".

245
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,049
Now, we will play
some music as we say...

246
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,820
a silent prayer for the dead.

247
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,190
Everyone,

248
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,250
please pray.

249
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,879
Attention.

250
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,789
- I thought you'd skip this.
- You'd get upset if I did.

251
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,090
I could've fired you today.

252
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,460
Do as you want.

253
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,159
I'll work at a rural
university hospital.

254
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,899
I never saw a family object.

255
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:33,539
A long time ago, a thug
barged into the autopsy room.

256
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,870
I risked my life that day.

257
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,909
You never stole a body though.

258
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,850
You can't be beaten.

259
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,080
I'm a good judge of character,
aren't I?

260
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,769
Aren't you sick of playing
hide and seek?

261
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,279
Your father is...

262
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,049
very concerned.

263
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,559
Your hand is fine.

264
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,960
- Will you quit performing surgery?
- I can't operate anymore.

265
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,259
Then what about on people
who are already dead?

266
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,570
The benefits won't be as good,

267
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,340
but why waste your talent?

268
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,009
I can't save anyone anymore.

269
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,610
A doctor doesn't just save people.

270
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,190
I'm heading to Seoul first.

271
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:03,429
Right.

272
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,430
That book isn't for you.

273
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,900
You'd better return it.

274
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,539
(Forensic Medicine)

275
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,650
How's your hand?

276
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,119
It's holding.

277
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,890
Last year,

278
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,890
how many autopsies did you do?
More than anyone else, right?

279
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,960
I did over 700, I think?

280
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,799
Don't just focus on bodies.

281
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,099
Look at the living too.

282
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,869
That is life.

283
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
You do go home, don't you?

284
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,539
I go home, come to work,
eat, and poop. I do everything.

285
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,609
And meet people?

286
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,710
Stop being mopey,
and meet people yourself.

287
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,279
Are we done?

288
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,250
Report first if you must
steal another body.

289
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,390
I thought a memorial service
would be very solemn.

290
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,930
It's not.

291
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,369
"Humans are flowers."

292
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,029
"Treat them gently."

293
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,170
All the people we autopsied...

294
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,470
once bloomed in life like a flower.

295
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,039
A doctor who deals with the dead
must never forget that.

296
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,319
What's wrong with you?

297
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,619
Isn't it shocking? Did you hear?

298
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,190
Yes. I'm so shocked
that I'm lost for words.

299
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,529
I know.

300
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:43,559
Should I have been harsher so that
they'd create no more victims?

301
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,359
Victims? Like who?

302
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:49,730
- Me.
- Do you know how I arranged that?

303
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,500
You should just stop.

304
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,099
It's not good for
your mental health.

305
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,009
What did you dislike
so much about him?

306
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,609
She offered me three million
to marry her son.

307
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:01,109
Does that make sense?
It's just absurd.

308
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,650
What did she take me for?

309
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,819
Come and sit down.

310
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,420
- What for?
- Sit down.

311
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,329
You have to do it.

312
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,900
- Do what?
- It's a decent arrangement.

313
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,539
He's from a good family,
and I barely persuaded them.

314
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,670
You persuaded...

315
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,109
Mom.

316
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,380
You knew?

317
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,450
Three million dollars
isn't a small amount.

318
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,680
Mom.

319
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,049
Whether it's 3 million
or 30 million, it's wrong.

320
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:41,250
- Are you that special?
- What?

321
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,519
I raised you in an affluent setting,
so now, you must grow up.

322
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,289
How long will you do what you want?

323
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:49,930
Mom, I became a prosecutor
a month ago.

324
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,099
- I'll do what I want...
- And then what?

325
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,869
Will you buy us some underwear
with your salary?

326
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,569
Forget about it,

327
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,599
and marry into the right family.

328
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,900
Repay us that way.

329
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,670
Mom, what are you talking about?

330
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,410
We gave you a good life.

331
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,779
Can't you help out now?

332
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,750
If you act like this,
your brother will suffer.

333
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,619
Are you trying to challenge us?

334
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,920
Your dad won't split his company,

335
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,960
and he has no reason to
give you a job.

336
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,130
Must I tell you that?

337
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,759
Did I ask for the company?

338
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,599
Then why are you acting like this?
What's the problem?

339
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,200
You're the problem!

340
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,569
I'm just about to live my own life.

341
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:32,099
Your life? Who gave it to you?

342
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,740
Why are you doing this to me?

343
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,680
This deal is settled.

344
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,450
I'll set up another meeting,
so make it work, okay?

345
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,410
I'm Prosecutor Eun Sol.

346
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,579
I'm Eun Sol, a prosecutor.

347
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,220
Prosecutor Eun Sol. Prosecutor Eun.

348
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,880
I passed the bar with great marks,

349
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,049
was top of the class in training,

350
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,289
and I volunteered to
work in Violent Crimes.

351
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:29,190
I'm Prosecutor Eun Sol!

352
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:36,500
I must concentrate.

353
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,269
Focus.

354
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,410
Choi Hwa Ja, the defendant,

355
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,849
maintains the baby
was conceived with sperm that...

356
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,849
Jang Deuk Nam had frozen
before his death three years ago.

357
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,259
If the baby is his,
as the defendant insists,

358
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,859
he will receive
a 20-million inheritance.

359
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:04,559
To discover the truth,
with the family's permission,

360
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,400
we exhumed the body,
collected Jang Deuk Nam's DNA,

361
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,170
and requested the NFS
run a paternity test.

362
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,440
Do you have the result?

363
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,710
The body is badly decomposed,
so it will take some time.

364
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,380
But in the process of
collecting the DNA,

365
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,910
- we came across something.
- What is that?

366
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,180
We were told that Jang Deuk Nam...

367
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,279
died at the hospital due to shock
following his surgery.

368
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:29,049
A large, depressed fracture
was found on his skull.

369
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,289
According to the initial analysis
of the medical examiner at NFS,

370
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,960
he was either hit
with a blunt weapon...

371
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,059
or a blunt force might have been
applied when he fell.

372
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:43,170
This means the fracture was caused
by an external force.

373
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,299
- An external force?
- There's a possibility of murder.

374
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,509
A murder?

375
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:52,140
This is an important case where
millions of dollars are at stake.

376
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,880
I believe uncovering the cause
of the deceased,

377
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,619
who is the most important
individual of this case,

378
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,150
is the top priority.

379
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,450
You have a point.

380
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:04,059
Defense, do you agree?

381
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,759
Yes, Your Honor.

382
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,960
- Then this hearing...
- Your Honor.

383
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,670
I have one more thing
I must speak to you about.

384
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,329
Okay. Go on.

385
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:17,269
In this courtroom,

386
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:21,069
three sisters-in-law who sued
the defendant are present.

387
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,809
I'd like to indict the three
plaintiffs sitting in the gallery...

388
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,009
and the defendant, Choi Ha Ja.

389
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:30,380
Please allow me to indict
these following individuals...

390
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,750
as suspects of
Jang Deuk Nam's murder case.

391
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,420
- What?
- What did she say?

392
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,059
Prosecutor Eun,
what are you talking about?

393
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:40,930
Murder?
Are you kidding me right now?

394
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,259
- Quiet down.
- Your Honor.

395
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,200
I feel utterly wronged
by the accusation!

396
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,769
He was my brother!

397
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:51,269
Do you think we're here to
listen to your complaints?

398
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:55,039
If you feel wronged,
cooperate with the prosecution.

399
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,910
- My gosh.
- How could this happen?

400
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,450
- Has she gone crazy or what?
- Prosecutor Eun!

401
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,049
What do you think you're doing?
This is so wrong!

402
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,250
- Wait, wait.
- Pardon?

403
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,890
What's wrong with you?

404
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,490
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing?

405
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,589
- Remember where you are.
- Hey, compose yourself!

406
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,890
Have you gone mad?

407
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,500
- What are you doing? Calm down!
- Did you kill him?

408
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,970
My goodness.

409
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:28,309
- You two must have lost your mind!
- Why are you doing this?

410
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,710
- Let go. Let me go!
- Let go of me.

411
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,039
- Hey, do something.
- What can I do?

412
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,049
1, 2, 3.

413
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,910
- Hey!
- Darn it.

414
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,480
- Let go. I told you to let go.
- Stop it.

415
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,950
Hey, you're hurting me.

416
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,319
- I won't stop! Let me go.
- Stop it. That's enough.

417
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,759
- Let me go.
- Let go of me.

418
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,759
- Let go.
- My gosh.

419
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:47,359
She...

420
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,329
She hated Deuk Nam the most!

421
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:52,799
You are one scary sister.

422
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:56,170
Who always said
that without Deuk Nam,

423
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,799
all of Dad's money would be ours?

424
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,240
It was you!

425
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:02,809
You're the one to talk. You lost
all of your money to stocks.

426
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:04,210
And you even took out
a private loan!

427
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,809
- You little rat!
- Goodness.

428
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:06,910
That means...

429
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,349
all three of you...

430
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,480
have a motive for murder.

431
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,789
Were the three of you present
at the hospital...

432
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,160
on the day of Jang Deuk Nam's death?

433
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,289
We were...

434
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,759
Since the act was carried out
in his ward,

435
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,160
the three of you are prime suspects.

436
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,599
It happened in his ward?
Who said such nonsense?

437
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,599
There's this guy who talks nonsense.

438
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:41,079
You said the VIP ward is the same
from three years ago, right?

439
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,150
Yes.

440
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,470
Scan the VIP ward.

441
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,410
Will we find the weapon
that fits the fracture?

442
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,609
How would I know?
We have to look first.

443
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,849
Then I'll make the trip now.

444
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,819
I'll meet the tech team
in front of Seon Hospital.

445
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:20,890
Seon Hospital?

446
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:23,289
- Yes.
- Who was the doctor?

447
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,960
It's Lee Hye Seong.

448
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,099
- Let's go.
- Are you coming too?

449
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,400
My gosh, what's going on now?

450
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,440
(Seon Hospital)

451
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,920
My gosh, this is just like
an American TV show.

452
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:01,289
So you're going to find out
how he got...

453
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,990
the depressed fracture
with this, right?

454
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,000
We even used this system
to match the weapon...

455
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,670
the serial killer,
Yoo Young Chul, used.

456
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:10,839
I think we should move
the camera a bit to the right.

457
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,869
Right.

458
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:14,609
- We can't see anything over there.
- Right.

459
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:18,140
The bed, the table,
and the armrest on the sofa.

460
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,150
We need to scan all of those.

461
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,289
Right?

462
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,670
(Lee Hye Seong)

463
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:46,670
Take a look. Right here.

464
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,819
Let's finish this up later.
I have a guest.

465
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,000
- What brings you here?
- Do you need to ask?

466
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,769
- I'm here because of a murder case.
- So you're here to investigate?

467
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,740
All the way to
the cardiac surgery department?

468
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,710
You're shameless.

469
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,210
- How dare you come here?
- Forget about that.

470
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,380
Jang Deuk Nam...

471
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,009
I looked over his file when
the police came to get the record.

472
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:30,980
It's not uncommon that patients go
into shock for unknown reasons...

473
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,180
post-surgery.

474
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,049
There was nothing wrong
with the surgery.

475
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,859
A depressed fracture was found
in his skull during the autopsy.

476
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,160
Are you sure there weren't
any issues?

477
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,960
There was no bleeding...

478
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,930
or any external signs.

479
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,029
What about the autopsy?

480
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,230
His family made a fuss that they
must have the funeral done quickly.

481
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,099
I guess...

482
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:51,470
you must have forgotten since
you're not a surgeon anymore.

483
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,339
I'm a doctor who saves lives.

484
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,779
I'm not a doctor who holds onto
the dead.

485
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:59,940
You must be responsible
until the very last moment.

486
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,079
Are you saying...

487
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,950
this was medical malpractice?

488
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,960
I don't think I deserve that
from you, at least.

489
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,490
You look good.

490
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,799
Seeing only corpses...

491
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,559
must suit you.
