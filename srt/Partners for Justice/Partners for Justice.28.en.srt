1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,509
(Episode 28)

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,650
How small a clue may be, as long
as it's relevant to the killer...

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,990
Why do you think the killer wasn't
caught 30 years ago?

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,120
The police utilized a lot of
manpower to catch the killer.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,760
Do you know...

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,429
how Yoo Han Cheol who killed
26 people was caught in 2003?

7
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,300
We checked 50 bus routes, thousands
of subway security footages,

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,640
and 300,000 telephone
circuits thoroughly.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,909
Deploying people isn't the answer.

10
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,170
Dr. Baek.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,009
- You're hanging onto minor things.
- Minor things?

12
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:42,409
Do we rate the wounds on a body?

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,049
Well, why don't we do both?

14
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:48,649
The NFS will follow up on your lead.

15
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,420
And we can investigate
her acquaintances and hometown.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,329
Please check the network record
from the base station...

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,560
near the convenience store
and her home around the time...

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,530
she had gone missing.

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,840
And check the alibi of every man
in their 50s near the location.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,239
Yes, sir. I'll get right on it.

21
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,409
We cannot overlook
the possibility of a copycat.

22
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,049
The Internet is where the copycats
get most of their information.

23
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,620
We're searching every website
regarding crimes.

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,150
Sure, you can continue
with that lead.

25
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,590
Is there anything we can use
from the investigation 30 years ago?

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,859
You can hear all about that
in person.

27
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,959
Do you know what I got the most...

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,359
when I was investigating
the Wuseong Serial Murder?

29
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,200
- "You still haven't caught him?"
- "You still haven't caught him?"

30
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,799
You must have gone through a lot.

31
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,209
That time, I was diagnosed
with degenerative arthritis.

32
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,239
I'll be in this wheelchair
for the rest of my life.

33
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,340
There were times we got close
to catching the culprit.

34
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,450
Remember? There was a survivor.

35
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,719
- You mean Lee Kyung Ja?
- That's right. Lee Kyung Ja.

36
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,049
The tip of the knife missed
the heart by a whisker.

37
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,390
That's how she survived.

38
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,120
She climbed down to where
the houses were and made a report.

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,230
We were all dispatched and blocked
every single route.

40
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,189
But we lost him in the end.

41
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,299
We should've caught him then, right?

42
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,200
We tried everything we could
at that time.

43
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,830
Our captain...
Was her name Um Ji Hye?

44
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,539
You know the first victim?

45
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:14,669
He even went to her house
and slept in her bed.

46
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,310
He wanted to meet her
even in his dream.

47
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:20,080
- My goodness.
- Darn it.

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,550
- You should've been more careful.
- I'm sorry.

49
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,620
- Are you all right?
- Look at this. It's all ruined.

50
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,919
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

51
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,219
You may go.

52
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,490
I feel terrible for Captain Ham.

53
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:36,530
The higher-ups pressured us
to catch the killer.

54
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,330
His detectives complained
that they were struggling.

55
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,229
He was caught in the crossfire
and ended his own life.

56
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,740
The article left
by Captain Ham was...

57
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,569
the first victim's photo.

58
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,389
Director Park.

59
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,659
It's about Wuseong Serial Murder.

60
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,629
The first victim, Um Ji Hye,
from 34 years ago.

61
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,229
You performed the autopsy.

62
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,909
(Name: Um Ji Hye)

63
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,340
That's right.
Yes, I did the autopsy.

64
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:27,180
I think it was my first case
at the NFS.

65
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,680
The knife touched the rib, right?

66
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,180
Right here. This one.

67
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,919
34 years ago, the killer...

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,159
wasn't good at using the knife. He
stabbed the bones in several places.

69
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,460
Did you find any traces of
the knife on the bones?

70
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,199
Looking at the cuts, I think
the blade must've been destroyed.

71
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,569
That's a possibility. However,

72
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,639
we didn't have the technology to
detect the substances back then.

73
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,909
Dr. Baek.

74
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,110
If you need to see me, come to
the headquarters. What is it?

75
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,479
Find me a body. Okay?

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,120
Her name is Um Ji Hye.
This is urgent.

77
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,719
- Hold on a second. Dr. Baek.
- Yes?

78
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,819
Are you asking me for a favor?

79
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,889
What?

80
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,600
Remember this? The recording...

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,860
Thank you.

82
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,600
I want another recording like this.

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,439
"Do me a favor." How about this?
Can you do it for me?

84
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,040
Okay, okay. Here you go.

85
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,040
- Get out, you jerk.
- What?

86
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,139
- Get out.
- What?

87
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,240
Get out now.

88
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:40,850
Luckily, the family buried the body
and didn't cremate it.

89
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,750
I sent the address
to Mr. Jang's phone.

90
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,230
I think it's over there.

91
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,540
Dr. Baek, it's really spooky here.

92
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,600
We might see ghosts.

93
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,750
Dr. Baek!

94
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:14,120
That's just mud.
And your face is scarier.

95
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,759
Come quickly.

96
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:20,589
I think my foot got stuck.
You need to hold me.

97
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,560
Wait. My goodness. Darn it.

98
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,829
The soil must be very wet.

99
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,509
- We might have a chance.
- What? What chance?

100
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,850
Request for its substance analysis.
It's urgent.

101
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,629
- I think that might be right.
- Can you pass that over?

102
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:56,290
His looks are a separate matter.
He's known to have a temper.

103
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,629
When you search...

104
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,860
Sir.

105
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:02,329
Gosh, what brings you here?

106
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,370
I came here to tell you
something important.

107
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,009
Okay, please come this way.

108
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,009
Welcome. What brings you here?

109
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,910
This.

110
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,850
These are the files on the guy
we were chasing 30 years ago.

111
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,079
I see.

112
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,319
Here.

113
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,389
Kang Chi Soo.
He was 24 years old back then.

114
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,060
His height was 180cm.
His shoe size was 260mm.

115
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,230
This fits the profile of the killer.

116
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,769
I met thousands of suspects.

117
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:38,800
I can't forget about him
even until this day.

118
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,939
Talk, you jerk!

119
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,540
It's you, right?

120
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,350
You're trying to get your number up
by arresting innocent people.

121
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,709
Do you think I don't know that?

122
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,379
- What?
- Don't patronize me.

123
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,189
Do you have evidence?

124
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,389
- I asked you if you had evidence!
- You scumbag.

125
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,689
He was released
due to lack of evidence,

126
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,829
but he left the country right away.

127
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,230
But we heard that a few years ago,

128
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,470
he returned to Wuseong.

129
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,339
What? If that's true,
something is definitely brewing.

130
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:14,339
- Locate Kang Chi Soo right now.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,680
But by the way,

132
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,579
only the writer can read this.
I can't read his handwriting.

133
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,790
Back then,
we wrote up reports by hand.

134
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,319
I'm known
for my terrible handwriting.

135
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,220
Actually, we were having a hard time
reviewing the past documents.

136
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,129
What do you say?
How about you lend us a hand?

137
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,829
We're old now.
I'm not sure if we can help.

138
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:42,329
Don't say that.
You already helped us a lot.

139
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,800
- Let's do this then.
- Gosh.

140
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:53,040
(Soo Photo Studio)

141
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,339
- Excuse me. Did the owner change?
- Yes?

142
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:25,709
No, it's the same owner.

143
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,279
- I see. Really?
- Yes.

144
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,379
I just thought that
it didn't taste the same anymore.

145
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,250
Oh, do you not like it?

146
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,490
No, no. It's better.

147
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,850
- Please enjoy your meal then.
- How long have you been...

148
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,690
- working here?
- It's been about six months.

149
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,370
Name, Kang Chi Soo.

150
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,970
He's 54 right now and still single.

151
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,669
He went abroad
and majored in photography...

152
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,110
after the Wuseong Serial Murder,

153
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,379
then came back five years ago
and opened a photo studio.

154
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,909
Where was he
on the day of the incident?

155
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,509
Kang is a bit unusual.

156
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,379
He does not use a cell phone.

157
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:06,279
That's why he was not found
on any base station records.

158
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,149
And he's always
on the same schedule.

159
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,519
He opens his studio at 10am,

160
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,889
eats lunch alone
at a nearby diner at 12pm,

161
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,320
closes the studio at 8pm,

162
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,490
works in the darkroom
until late at night,

163
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,830
and comes home after 12am.

164
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,259
He's very meticulous.

165
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,529
Seems obsessive.

166
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,899
The murderer is the same.

167
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,639
He always made the same knot
and did everything the same way.

168
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,200
Also,

169
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,269
this alleyway has...

170
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,179
no security cameras.

171
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:31,240
Goodness.

172
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,950
There's a possibility
he chose that place on purpose.

173
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,080
That photo studio has a darkroom.

174
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,450
All lights are blocked out.

175
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,950
- It's a perfectly secretive room.
- This is rather interesting.

176
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,200
The first victim, Um Ji Hye.
Let's redo her autopsy.

177
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,360
What?

178
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,639
- Why?
- Murderers make...

179
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,809
the most mistakes
on their first murder.

180
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,870
Redoing her autopsy?

181
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:06,539
- With a 34-year-old body?
- Back then, something was left out.

182
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,750
- What is it?
- I have to look at the body first.

183
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,620
There's no need. It's decomposed.
You won't find a thing.

184
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,120
Are you suggesting that
we should be inattentive?

185
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,820
Doctor Baek, watch your language.

186
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,259
What did I say wrong?

187
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,289
I'll take the responsibility.

188
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,500
Prosecutor Eun.
Are you sure it'll be okay?

189
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,529
It won't be easy
to persuade the family.

190
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,070
If there's even a little possibility
that a case or a suspect...

191
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,110
from the past
has anything to do with this,

192
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,009
then shouldn't we reinvestigate it?

193
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,639
I'm curious to know what we'll find.

194
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,980
That's a waste of time.

195
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,379
Well, at this stage, I agree...

196
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,820
with Prosecutor Eun that
we should keep all possibilities...

197
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,350
on our minds as we investigate.

198
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,490
- Prosecutor Do.
- I'm sorry, sir.

199
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,559
I will take care of the result.

200
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,730
Prosecutor Eun, you can
work with Lieutenant Cha...

201
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,299
and get the project going
by persuading Um's family.

202
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,330
We'll keep digging
behind Kang Chi Soo.

203
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:05,240
Okay. Let's get to work.

204
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
Goodbye.

205
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,009
Hello?

206
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,720
Excuse me.

207
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,649
Hello.

208
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:21,389
You have the wrong house.
There's no one here...

209
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,549
Oh, it's not that.

210
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,059
We're from Seoul Eastern District
Prosecutor's Office,

211
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,529
Ms. Im.

212
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:33,769
(Im Sook Ja, 69 years old,
first victim, Um Ji Hye's mom)

213
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:36,500
- You can have some juice and go.
- Ma'am.

214
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,639
We have something
to discuss with you.

215
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,769
We reopened the case.
We'll take in the murderer and...

216
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,580
I don't care
if he gets caught or not.

217
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,850
So don't ever come back.

218
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,679
I finally forgot all about it.

219
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,879
- Why are you doing this again?
- You never forgot.

220
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,450
Not even once.

221
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,559
That teddy bear over there.

222
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,779
The Wuseong Serial Murders.
From 1984 to 1988,

223
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,480
over five years
in the Wuseong-dong area...

224
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,509
That is...

225
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,779
the same teddy bear
that Ji Hye had...

226
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,720
on the day of her death.

227
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,159
One of our detectives...

228
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,159
still keeps...

229
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,190
Ji Hye's picture in his wallet.

230
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,259
This time,

231
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,500
we will catch him for sure.

232
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,769
Please.

233
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,039
Help us out.

234
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,049
Goodness, Ji Hye.

235
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,190
I'm not sure if we'll even find
pieces of her bones after 34 years.

236
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,429
I know.

237
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,519
- Goodness.
- Look at this.

238
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,690
My goodness.

239
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,360
She must have a deep resentment.
She didn't even decompose.

240
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,190
How is this possible?

241
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,360
Adipocere.

242
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,559
- What?
- What?

243
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,799
If you get buried in a humid
and sealed place,

244
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,000
the fat in the body gets hydrolyzed
and turns into...

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,200
fatty acid and glycerin.
And when ammonia gets combined,

246
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,610
the body becomes wax-like.
It's kind of like soap.

247
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,879
- And decomposition stops too.
- Did you expect this?

248
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,409
The soil has a lot of moisture...

249
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:02,250
and has a lot of minerals
like magnesium and calcium.

250
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,149
It's the ideal condition.

251
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,379
Bring it back as it is.

252
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,629
- Hello.
- You're here.

253
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,759

- Great work.

255
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,250
Let us begin the autopsy.

256
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:46,960

Show me the pictures
from the past autopsy.

259
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,879
We'll look into the chest.

260
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,779
It's way too decomposed.

261
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,649
Would we find anything in there?

262
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,730
Chest area, multiple stabs.

263
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,600
"Chest area, multiple stabs".

264
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,139

00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,070
in shoulder blades and ribs.

266
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,139
Loupe.

267
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,870
What is he doing?

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,899
Scalpel.

269
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,509
You two, come here
and start scraping.

270
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,679
Scrape everything off of the bone,
and request for substance analysis.

271
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,789
I don't think we need to
stick around any longer.

272
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,519
Keep watching until the end,

273
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,460
and let me know
if you find anything.

274
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
Yes.

275
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:33,500
- Start scraping.
- Right.

276
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
What are you doing?

277
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,200
There is something
stuck on the bone.

278
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,639
We're going to scrape it all out
and get it analyzed.

279
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,509
What can you find out with that?

280
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,309
We'll only know
when we have the result.

- No.

(Lee Kyung Ja)

322
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,240
I even changed my name
to get away from it all.

323
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,500
I have nothing to say.

324
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,470
Did you hear that
we found another victim?

325
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,710
Yes.

326
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,549
There were 10 victims 30 years ago.

327
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:14,519
No one knows
how many more there will be.

328
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,789
Seong Hye Bin, the 11th victim.

329
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:18,660
She was just 20 years old.

330
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,529
Your age at the time...

331
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,230
was 20, right?

332
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,329
Even if I wanted to help,

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,240
he was wearing something
over his face.

334
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,740
I really didn't see anything.
I don't remember much.

335
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,380
There still is a way.

336
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,220
Breathe deeply and slowly.

337
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,190
Once you fall asleep,

338
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,730
you'll go back 30 years in time.

339
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,599
I was on my way home.

340
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,410
There's a man over there.

341
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,849
Just go by.

342
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,289
Just go by. Just go by. Just go by.

343
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,759
It suddenly went bright.

344
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,859
It's like I've become blind.
I can't see.

345
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,700
I hear something.

346
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:40,569
He's digging with a spade.

347
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:42,539
He's digging the soil.

348
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,849
I made a noise,
and he's coming over.

349
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,029
Please save me.

350
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,859
His face is all black.

351
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,769
He keeps looking at me.
He's looking at me.

352
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,539
He won't say a word.

353
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,480
Gosh.

354
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,549
Dr. Baek.

355
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,859
Dr. Baek.

356
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:32,960
Hey.

357
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,259
What is it?

358
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:37,900
The substance on the adipocered
body's ribs is carbon steel.

359
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,859
(Carbon steel)

360
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,769
Steel? With carbon?

361
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,039
Not stainless steel?

362
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,440
Kitchen knives
aren't made with carbon steel.

363
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,769
What blade is it?

364
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:50,210
- What are the specs?
- 1080 carbon steel.

365
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,839
Find all blades made with
1080 carbon steel.

366
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,480
In the middle of the night?

367
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,150
Searching all the knife shops
will take...

368
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,849
at least 2 to 3 days.

369
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,490
- Pack all the dummies.
- What for when we have no blade?

370
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,059
- There are blades.
- Where?

371
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,289
There just are.

372
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,859
Get packing.

373
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
- Be careful.
- Watch out.

374
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,230
- What's all this?
- How do you live here?

375
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,599
These are real blades,
so be careful.

376
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,430
This is crazy.

377
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:49,869
This must be why
he never comes home.

378
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,509
You're not here to ogle. Let's work.

379
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,039
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

380
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,009
1, 2, 3, die!

381
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:07,920
Measure that.

382
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,529
Depth 10cm.

383
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:20,500
Length 4.5cm.

384
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,799
It's too thin.

385
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,309
Measure.

386
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:40,549
Length 1.7cm.

387
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,190
No match. Next.

388
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,390
Gosh.

389
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,960
I don't think he'd have used that.

390
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,359
Is this too big?

391
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,269
You did well.

392
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:58,940
You won't have to come here again.

393
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,740
Okay. Thank you.

394
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,910
Take her home safely.

395
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,079
Yes, sir. Come with me.

396
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:21,160
(Soo Photo Studio)

397
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,099
This is crazy.

398
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:37,809
- Mr. Yang.
- I don't see Kang Chi Soo.

399
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,109
He should be in his darkroom now,

400
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,309
but he closed the studio
and disappeared.

401
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:43,750
What?

402
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,420
Can we confirm
if Lee Kyung Ja's home?

403
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,519
I'll call and check.

404
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:57,859
Hi, it's Cha Soo Ho.

405
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:00,400
Did the witness, Lee Kyung Ja,
arrive home safely?

406
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,299
What?

407
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,039
Okay... Just a moment.

408
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,410
She got out of the car
and went off on her own.

409
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,210
He called to see if she's okay,
but she won't pick up.

410
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,210
- What?
- What happened?

411
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:18,019
- Keep trying.
- Okay.

412
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,160
Measure that.

413
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:38,670
Depth 15cm.

414
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,970
Length below 3.5cm.

415
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,640
Width 0.6... Doctor.

416
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,450
This is it.

417
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,410
We got it.

418
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,319
I almost died.

419
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,019
The military M7 bayonet.

420
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,490
Made with 1080 carbon steel.

421
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:43,599
I didn't turn the lights off.

422
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,269
(Partners for Justice)

423
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,180
She was the 11th target and only
survivor of the Wuseong murders.

424
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,210
I told you to catch the killer,
and you lost the only survivor?

425
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:32,950
Do you think they'll disband
the task force team?

426
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,019
The facts the body leaves don't lie.

427
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:37,660
Your assumption is interesting too.

428
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,960
I'll check for blood.

429
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,390
It's all blood.

430
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,259
- It's done.
- It's over. We got him.

431
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:46,000
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

432
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,630
What on earth had happened?
