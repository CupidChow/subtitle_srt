1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,439
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,849
I gave you a fraud case
to take things easy,

3
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,460
but you made it into a murder case.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,219
This is all because the NFS wanted
an autopsy warrant...

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,359
So is that why you flew there
with a warrant...

6
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,530
after just one phone call?

7
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,899
I had a valid reason.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,429
Deputy Kang,
what do you think about that?

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,840
We should've been more careful
even if the NFS raised suspicions.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,210
However, since she officially
launched the investigation,

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,039
we must continue
with the investigation.

12
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,210
Prosecutor Eun, we are prosecutors.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,049
We're not subordinates to the NFS.

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,520
You know that, right?

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,420
Yes, sir. I understand.

16
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,049
It's Baek Beom again, isn't it?

17
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:50,859
Yes, sir.

18
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,530
This isn't a serial murder case.

19
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,130
It seems like it's a case among the
family members for the inheritance.

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,100
Forget about forensic science
or whatnot.

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,929
Bring in the suspects,
and interrogate them.

22
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,040
I'll keep
both lines of investigation.

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,569
I'll need both forensic science
and interrogations.

24
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,939
I'll bring in
all the suspects again.

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,840
At this rate, we might lose...

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,379
our newest recruit to the NFS.

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,849
Deputy Kang.

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,390
If you're a deputy chief prosecutor,
take care of your subordinates.

29
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,359
Yes, sir. I will.

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,090
You may leave.

31
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,500
Why did he call you of all people?

32
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,709
- What?
- Baek Beom.

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,879
Well, we figured out
the last case together.

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,540
Do you think
he'll stand up for you...

35
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,510
when there's a problem?

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,549
In the end, everything
will be your responsibility.

37
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,090
Of course. I requested that warrant.

38
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,260
Doctor Baek isn't a man
of great character.

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,489
I know that
he's crazy and psychotic.

40
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:03,530
You have the sharpest eyes
when it comes to discerning people.

41
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,430
Prosecutor Eun, I hope
you can take initiative...

42
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,530
for the investigation
instead of getting used.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,069
Like how a prosecutor should be.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,039
Hyun.

45
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:16,270
Did something happen
between you and Dr. Baek?

46
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,439
You sound really cynical right now.

47
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,550
Don't trust him too much.

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,550
He's not someone...

49
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,719
you can deal with.

50
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,360
Be careful.

51
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,500
- The corner of the bed.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,969
Die!

53
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,139
Photo.

54
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,349
No, this is diagonal.

55
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,979
- The armrest of a sofa.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:58,979
Die!

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,060
You mix well with violence.

58
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,159
This is the most similar.
Write that down.

59
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,370
Did you find the weapon?

60
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,169
It's just a simulation.
Don't get excited.

61
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,870
It doesn't come out automatically
like those American dramas.

62
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,610
There were over 10 people
who visited him that day.

63
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,610
Then there must be over 10 lies.

64
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,289
It looks like
his skull was fractured...

65
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,490
when he hit the sofa's armrest.

66
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,919
That means someone pushed him over.

67
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,860
What's important is the who.

68
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,189
You're right. Look.

69
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,659
There's Choi Hwa Ja
who was with him all the time.

70
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,430
Then there are his three sisters...

71
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,000
who came to visit him.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,840
They also had a caregiver,

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,139
the doctor on duty, his doctor,

74
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,639
nurses, residents, and interns.

75
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,379
But his three sisters are
the prime suspects.

76
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,250
The eldest, Jang Il Nam.

77
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,349
She's waiting for her
US green card to come out.

78
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,949
The second sister, Jang Yi Nam.
She has a citizenship in Malaysia.

79
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,020
The third, Jang Hu Nam.

80
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,120
She listed her real estate
in Jeju Island for an urgent sale.

81
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,319
- They're obviously about to run.
- Exactly.

82
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,030
Don't you think
they're in this together?

83
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,930
I mean, 20 million dollars is
enough for the 3 of them.

84
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,029
- Precisely.
- I couldn't possibly...

85
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,399
make that much even if I worked
since Goguryeo era.

86
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,100
Let's meet all of the people
who came by his hospital room...

87
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,939
during that time.

88
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,310
We need to find out
what happened on the day of...

89
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,410
Jang Deuk Nam's death.

90
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:32,810
Well...

91
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,379
You've worked as a caregiver...

92
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:38,920
at Seon Hospital
three years ago, haven't you?

93
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,319
Yes, I was there back then.

94
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,420
Do you remember...

95
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,519
what happened to the patient
who got a heart surgery...

96
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,629
on June 13, 3 years ago?

97
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,399
It's the guy
who had three wicked sisters.

98
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,829
They're really feisty.
Don't you remember them?

99
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,339
Oh, those crazy brats.

100
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,509
That family should be
awfully cursed.

101
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,370
He died after his surgery.

102
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,240
Do you remember
what happened back then?

103
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,250
Everyone talked about...

104
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,310
how his sisters might kill him...

105
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,680
before his heart failed.

106
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:15,250
Are you crazy? Have you gone insane?

107
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,959
Maybe the anesthetic
hasn't worn off yet.

108
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,019
Il Nam, are you sure the doctor
didn't operate on his head?

109
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,360
- He must've gone insane.
- Guys.

110
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,730
Please listen to me.

111
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,060
You don't even know who she is.

112
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,269
How can you two register
for marriage? Are you insane?

113
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:32,199
Why do you think she came after
a guy who's about to die soon?

114
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,040
It's obviously money!

115
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,810
She's not like that.

116
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,040
- Goodness.
- That's nonsense.

117
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,750
I think it was
a few days after that fight.

118
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,920
- His wife showed up.
- Hello.

119
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,279
I want to be taken in...

120
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,490
- as a part of this family...
- What?

121
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,689
Family? What did you say?

122
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,259
A brat like you can't be our family.

123
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,290
This is unbelievable.

124
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,290
I am...

125
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,060
deeply in love with Deuk Nam.

126
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:01,970
Please just let me stay with him
so that he can get better.

127
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,269
This is absurd.

128
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:08,439
She had a tough time
because of her sisters-in-law.

129
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,310
I didn't care that
they treated me like dirt.

130
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,920
But Deuk Nam wasn't
treated like a human either.

131
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,220
They locked him up at the hospital
when he got sick...

132
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,660
and then suddenly came back
when he was about to die.

133
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,319
It was as if they had been
awaiting his death.

134
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,490
I can't...

135
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,560
forgive my sisters-in-law.

136
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,730
What about on the day of his death?

137
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,069
I...

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,110
went out...

139
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,610
for a bit on that day.

140
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:46,879
When I came back...

141
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,449
Deuk Nam, wake up. Deuk Nam.

142
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,420
Doctors and nurses were...

143
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,920
surrounding him and
performing CPR on him.

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I shouldn't have left him alone.

145
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,699
On the day of Mr. Jang's death,

146
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,370
did you fight with him?

147
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,910
Goodness. That poor kid was
lying there after a surgery.

148
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,910
Why would I fight with him?

149
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:19,639
Really?

150
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,079
Actually,

151
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,750
Hu Nam was
the most jealous of Deuk Nam.

152
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,319
She was the youngest before him.

153
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,750
It was pretty bad.

154
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,290
Yi Nam always said...

155
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,100
that she hoped Deuk Nam
caught a deadly disease and died.

156
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,970
Deuk Nam went out of his way
to take the side...

157
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,139
of my sister-in-law...
No, that Choi woman...

158
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,069
which drove Il Nam crazy.

159
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,139
There was...

160
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,579
not a single day when I didn't
think of him as my real brother.

161
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,180
Not even once.

162
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,290
We ran over when we saw a code blue.

163
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,220
But his heart had already stopped.

164
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,360
We honestly didn't think
that we should check his head.

165
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,259
We had to perform
CRP on him immediately.

166
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,660
But there was no bleeding.

167
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,699
If his head bled,

168
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,300
it would've gotten on the pillow.

169
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,339
If it had,
we definitely would've seen it.

170
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,810
Is there a possibility
that the surgery went wrong?

171
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,279
Doctor Lee Hye Seong operated
on that patient herself,

172
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,040
and it went very well.

173
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,120
You can ask me that directly.

174
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,830
I'm Prosecutor Eun Sol of
the Seoul Eastern District Office.

175
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,389
Are you Doctor Lee Hye Seong?

176
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,399
Yes. Please go on.

177
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,330
You operated on
Mr. Jang Deuk Nam yourself,

178
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,700
and you were
the doctor in charge, right?

179
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,370
We cooperated with
the police investigation.

180
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,110
What more do you need?

181
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,309
The National Forensic Service is
going through the medical records.

182
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:01,009
We wanted to find out
the situation at that time.

183
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,809
I performed CPR on him myself.

184
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,820
The shock had nothing to do
with the surgery.

185
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,850
Deuk Nam.

186
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,389
Deuk Nam, open your eyes.

187
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,759
Deuk Nam.

188
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,700
Deuk Nam, open your eyes.

189
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,860
Deuk Nam.

190
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,730
Deuk Nam!

191
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,970
Take the guardian outside!

192
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,269
Deuk Nam. Deuk Nam!

193
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,840
Then what was he like
when he was alive?

194
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,139
How many patients do you think...

195
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,149
I have operated on?

196
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,279
We can't remember
what each patient was like.

197
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,450
We don't have that much free time.

198
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,950
Oh, is that so?

199
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,860
Then we need to see someone
who might know.

200
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,700
The nurse in charge of
VIP rooms would know.

201
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,000
But she isn't with us anymore.

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,039
The nurse in charge of VIP rooms?
Who is she?

203
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,000
Is it Ms. Byun Soo Kyung?

204
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,769
- Ms. Byun Soo Kyung.
- I'll summon her immediately.

205
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,279
Thank you.

206
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,039
(Prosecution Service)

207
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,779
Ms. Jang, what should I do?

208
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,519
Who knows where they'll go to?
Follow them.

209
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,019
(Seoul Eastern District
Prosecutor's Office)

210
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,629
- You're an idol at this office.
- Do you want to be a fan too?

211
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,830
I agree that
you became good-looking.

212
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,629
But I will dismiss your offer
due to lack of grounds.

213
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:11,240
You should eat before you work.
Is it not going too well?

214
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,950
No. It's the testimony
of the testifiers.

215
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,909
They all have different arguments.

216
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,580
Are these really 10 different lies?

217
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,389
It could be 10 different truths.

218
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,919
A while ago,

219
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,090
I took a case with
over 50 people involved.

220
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,629
They all had different arguments,
so it gave me a huge headache.

221
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,960
But I realized...

222
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,799
they were all truths
from their perspectives.

223
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:34,899
They took different positions.

224
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,330
They didn't lie.

225
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,539
Then there could be over 10 lies.

226
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,539
You're so unlike someone else.

227
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:48,850
Hello, Mr. Kang.

228
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,850
The NFS has Jang Deuk Nam's
toxicology report.

229
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,860
That woman, Stella,
seems really different.

230
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,389
She used to be a pharmacist.

231
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,090
She studied pharmacology at
Johns Hopkins University...

232
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,200
and was a medical examiner in Miami.

233
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:06,970
She's the top expert in
toxic substances in Korea.

234
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:09,330
She seems to love
making things in her lab.

235
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,299
She made me coffee last time.

236
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,269
She's die-hard serious.

237
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:15,340
That's her hobby.

238
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,179
She always uses the right amount
of great ingredients.

239
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,740
Trust her and drink anything.

240
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,309
Can I do that?

241
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,519
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello.

242
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:41,299
One shot?

243
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,929
Sure, thank you.

244
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,679
What is this?

245
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,720
100-percent pure, lab-made alcohol.

246
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,019
This is alcohol?

247
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,490
A bit dry, right? Next time,
I'll make it sweet.

248
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
Now, it's showtime.

249
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,460
The sample grade was poor,
so detection took a while.

250
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:14,299
I found a toxic concentration
of propofol.

251
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,570
Propofol?

252
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,669
A toxic concentration?

253
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,110
Every medication has
an appropriate concentration.

254
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:23,070
If you ingest too much,
it becomes a toxin.

255
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,740
The same goes for propofol.

256
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,809
That means someone
gave it to him on purpose.

257
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,779
This much would've caused apnea.

258
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,149
To hide the symptoms
of brain hemorrhage...

259
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,549
caused by the skull fracture,

260
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,190
someone administered
a large amount of propofol.

261
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,419
He died of apnea.

262
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,620
Murder?

263
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,830
Maybe.

264
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,100
(Emergency bell)

265
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,470
This was done by someone
with medical knowledge.

266
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,509
Someone on the hospital staff?

267
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,840
A doctor? Nurse? Who?

268
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,110
That's the wrong question.

269
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,019
- What?
- Where do you get so much propofol?

270
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:12,320
- One more shot?
- Of what?

271
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,960
No, no, sorry. Enough.

272
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,629
I'm busy. Bye. I have to go.

273
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:20,500
Silly me.

274
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,940
(Seoul Eastern District
Prosecutor's Office)

275
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,210
Come along.

276
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,350
Let's hurry.

277
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,759
We're from the Eastern District
Prosecutor's Office.

278
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,730
Here's our search
and seizure warrant.

279
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,570
I want the ledger...

280
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,299
for the antipsychotic medication
from June three years ago.

281
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,669
Including propofol.

282
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:00,110
I also want the list of
what you prescribed to...

283
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,610
every inpatient then.

284
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,240
The files are in here
and over there.

285
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,279
- Get moving.
- Okay.

286
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,250
Take everything.

287
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,450
We want everything.

288
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,620
- Hello.
- Why are you here?

289
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,330
The deputy chief sent me to help.

290
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,529
That's nice of him.
Get to work then.

291
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,159
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

292
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,000
- What are you doing?
- Prosecutor's Office.

293
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,440
Jang Deuk Nam had a toxin
in him that wasn't prescribed.

294
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,139
Propofol, a lethal dose of it too.

295
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,240
What?

296
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,509
We can't discount the fact that
a member of the staff is a suspect.

297
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,009
Did Doctor Baek say so?

298
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,279
Pardon?

299
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,980
Did he tell you to
raid this hospital?

300
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:21,149
- What do you mean?
- He used to work here.

301
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,820
In thoracic surgery.

302
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,960
I wonder if this is revenge
for kicking him out.

303
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,000
The Prosecutors' Office alone
made the decision to come here.

304
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,330
Do you know...

305
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,100
Doctor Baek well?

306
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,169
No, not yet.

307
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,610
I guess...

308
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,370
you'd be better off not knowing.

309
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,879
We'll cooperate with you for now.

310
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,299
I got it.

311
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,930
Right here...

312
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:11,400
I found it.

313
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,940
Propofol went missing.

314
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,440
Although 250ml of it was used,
the remaining amount doesn't match.

315
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,809
The drug wasn't from elsewhere.
It was from the hospital.

316
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,579
Do you see the nurse's signature?

317
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,019
This person had the key
to the drug cabinet.

318
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,890
Are you still looking for
Byun Soo Kyung?

319
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,660
Pardon?
We just can't seem to find her.

320
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,890
Her family hasn't been
in touch with her,

321
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,130
and she hasn't used
her credit card either.

322
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,400
It looks like she went into hiding.

323
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,740
Where are you now?

324
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,819
What's this mess?

325
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,049
Has she not been eating?

326
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,690
She looks like a chick
that hasn't been grazing.

327
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,619
You can't even come home
because of your mom.

328
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:11,329
Ma'am.

329
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:13,930
I brought food
in case you're starving.

330
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:18,000
- Home-made food. Eat with me.
- Goodness.

331
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,569
Who is this?

332
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,250
She hid so well that I'm having
such a difficult time finding her.

333
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,420
Hang on. She's a thyroid comrade.

334
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,920
What? A what comrade?

335
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,490
That surgical scar on her neck.

336
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,359
That scar is from
thyroid cancer surgery.

337
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,890
I always wear a scarf...

338
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,130
so I can cover up the scar.

339
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,029
Thyroid cancer surgery?

340
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,640
- That's why you take medicine.
- Yes, it's a hormone drug.

341
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,509
I have to take it forever.

342
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:54,539
Medicine?

343
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,380
- A pharmacy.
- Probably.

344
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:59,309
- You did it.
- My goodness.

345
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,650
What's this about?

346
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,279
- I can find her now.
- Wait.

347
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,849
You're going somewhere
without taking a bite?

348
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,549
Sorry, I have to go.

349
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:09,390
Eat something first.

350
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,390
Mr. Kang.

351
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,390
Get the Health Insurance Corporation
to look up where Byun Soo Kyung...

352
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,930
filled in her prescription
for thyroid hormone supplements.

353
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,369
She can live without a credit card
but not without medication.

354
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:26,940
My legs ache.

355
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,240
My knees will give way next.

356
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,309
She's really well-hidden.

357
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,079
Just wait until we find her.

358
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,779
I'll give her a piece of my mind.

359
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:38,450
We'll have a lot to hear from her.

360
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,519
We have a long way to go.

361
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,390
What are you doing here?

362
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,960
Hello. We're here to check a body.

363
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,299
A body?

364
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,170
Someone's dead?

365
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,640
Unit 203, female, Jane Doe.

366
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,809
- An unnatural death.
- Hurry up.

367
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,640
Unit 203.

368
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,990
She rented without a contract.
Jane Doe, nothing...

369
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,660
Why are you here?

370
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,329
She's in there.

371
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,970
There are many injection sites.

372
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:34,569
Was she an addict?

373
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,380
- We were looking for her.
- What?

374
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,309
We're still waiting for AFIS.

375
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,710
(AFIS: fingerprint database)

376
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,490
Byun Soo Kyung. She was
a nurse at Seon Hospital.

377
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,920
That means this isn't just
any unnatural death.

378
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:52,289
But look.

379
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,460
There are all sorts of
drugs and propofol.

380
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,829
She overdosed, or it was accidental.
She's an addict.

381
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,869
I don't see anything odd.

382
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:03,299
Everything here is odd.

383
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,599
Who said she's an addict?

384
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,940
Look at the injection marks.

385
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,140
- There are so many.
- Define addiction.

386
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,750
- What?
- Define it.

387
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,180
To inject or ingest a drug
excessively and continuously...

388
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,390
- until your tolerance...
- The injection marks are all new.

389
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,819
There are no signs of struggle.

390
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,619
These are the signs.

391
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,529
Get the autopsy and the drugs ready.

392
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,170
Move.

393
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,690
A lot of things depended
on her testimony.

394
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,990
Don't you think that's why
this happened?

395
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,500
She's been silenced forever.

396
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,799
- Prosecutor Eun.
- Hey.

397
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,940
I retraced Byun Soo Kyung's
account statement...

398
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,809
that dated back to three years.

399
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:18,009
I found records that she'd been
regularly paid by Jang Il Nam.

400
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,910
(Periodic Statement,
deposit and withdrawal)

401
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,680
I knew it. His sisters were related
to this case.

402
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,190
Byun Soo Kyung and Jang Deuk Nam.

403
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,519
Both of them could've been killed
by the same person.

404
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,759
Are you saying...

405
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,259
that the real killer started
to make a move after three years?

406
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,769
Propofol was found,

407
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,710
but the big point is insulin.

408
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,470
Insulin?

409
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,180
After she was put to sleep with
propofol, she got the insulin shot.

410
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,480
The killer disguised it to look like
a propofol overdose.

411
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,880
In other words, this is up my alley.

412
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:00,690
The killer just challenged
the toxicologist.

413
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,190
I almost missed it.

414
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,490
It's been a while
since I got all worked up.

415
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,990
Make sure you catch
whoever did this.

416
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,329
- What did you get from the syringe?
- Well...

417
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,730
Components of leather were found.

418
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,430
The killer wore gloves.

419
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,839
This way.

420
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,579
Look at the injection marks.

421
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,750
She has so many of them.

422
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,990
Byun Soo Kyung's buttons.

423
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,720
Her buttons were undone.

424
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,730
Come on.

425
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,059
Look.

426
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,599
Look.

427
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,710
You have to take off your gloves
to undo your buttons.

428
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,880
- Then the prints would be on there.
- I got it.

429
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,950
Next time, use your words.

430
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,359
Where are you going?

431
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,529
It's an expedited analysis.

432
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:22,930
Had I come out 10 minutes earlier,
I would've been off work.

433
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:29,470
(Evidence)

434
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,720
(Fluorescence)

435
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,569
Where's the UV flashlight?

436
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:54,569
(It's used to identify
prints and blood.)

437
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,710
Here you go.

438
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,220
It's there.

439
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,720
These are only partial prints.
It's going to take a while.

440
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,289
Please let me know as soon as
you have the result.

441
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,059
Sure.

442
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,000
But what else do you have
in your bag?

443
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:35,339
You asked the wrong question.

444
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:38,509
No one knows what's in his bag,

445
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:39,779
but he has everything in there.

446
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,430
Prosecutor Eun, this is Choi Hwa Ja.

447
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:04,440
I see. Hello.
What is this regarding?

448
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,369
The investigator told me
a while ago...

449
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,670
that he was looking for a nurse
named Byun Soo Kyung.

450
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:11,509
Yes, we were.

451
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:14,779
I know a few things about her.

452
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:16,549
You do? Like what?

453
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,650
It's not something I want to
tell you over the phone.

454
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,599
Right here.

455
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,539
(1-on-1 fingerprint comparison,
requested print, possible print)

456
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,579
- We... We have a match. We got it.
- Really?

457
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,789
What is this?

458
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:09,329
(Choi Hwa Ja)

459
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,500
(Choi Hwa Ja, Unit 101, Cheonho
Avenue 190, Gangdong-gu, Seoul)

460
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,200
Please stay seated.

461
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,799
- Thank you.
- Sure.

462
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,579
Thank you for coming.

463
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,039
No problem.

464
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,950
(Psycho)

465
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,650
The number you have dialed
is not available at this moment.

466
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,019
Why isn't she picking up?

467
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:58,309
(We thank Yoon Ji Min
for her guest appearance.)

468
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,660
(Partners for Justice)

469
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,990
Where's Prosecutor Eun?

470
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,029
- Prosecutor Eun!
- Prosecutor Eun!

471
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:16,059
Die!

472
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:18,099
I don't remember what happened.

473
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:19,730
Why would I want to hurt you?

474
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,430
Exactly. Why did you do
such a stupid thing?

475
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,240
- What's your motive?
- I don't have a motive.

476
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,269
It was so hard to get that evidence.
I'm so close to solving this case.

477
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,569
You were hurt!

478
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,039
Get your hands off this case.

479
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,279
If there's a problem,
will you take responsibility?

480
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,880
You'll probably run away
like you did 10 years ago.

481
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,009
This case isn't over yet.

482
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:39,519
Who are you to judge that?
I'm leading this investigation!

483
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,220
- What are you trying to do now?
- I'm here to give you a tip!

484
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,359
I'm concerned that your junior
will make another mistake!
