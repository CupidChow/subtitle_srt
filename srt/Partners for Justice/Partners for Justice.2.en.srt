1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,810
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,220
It was an assault, right?

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,279
37 hypodermal bleedings,
7 fractures, and 23 abrasions.

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,750
Do you think we perform autopsies
to count numbers?

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,359
Then did you find out anything else?

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,760
She had a prosthetic valve surgery.
The capsules need to be looked at.

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,460
- And the embryo...
- Embryo?

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,030
She was pregnant?

9
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,969
He beat his pregnant wife that much?

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,469
This guy deserves to fry
in a pot of poop to death.

11
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,710
Prosecutor Eun, a pot of poop? Fry?

12
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,579
Anyway, thank you
for the autopsy result.

13
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,780
I can take in the husband
thanks to this.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,990
What if he didn't do it?

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,259
They fought all the time.

16
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,159
The fight was the worst on that day.
So when he saw that his wife died...

17
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,030
after he beat her with a golf club,
he ran away to a hotel.

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,159
Sounds like a novel.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,100
You just saw her.
Dead bodies never lie.

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,500
Who says that dead bodies never lie?

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,239
Once a body decomposes, wounds
disappear, and random scars appear.

22
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,109
When they fall,
their wounds get all distorted.

23
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:13,109
- Many dead bodies that lie.
- Goodness.

24
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,109
If a medical examiner says that,
whom can we trust in this world?

25
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,849
Don't trust anyone.
Not even the dead.

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,650
Is this a land of distrust?

27
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,390
- Get behind her.
- What? Why?

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,200
Why? I...

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,099
Prosecutor Eun.

30
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,099
My goodness. Have a seat.

31
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,640
Hold this.

32
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,209
She has psychogenic hypotension.

33
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,409
It's her first time
observing an autopsy.

34
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,950
Are you all right?

35
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,049
- You fainted.
- What?

36
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,349
Goodness.

37
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,019
Write a novel.

38
00:01:58,489 --> 00:01:59,560
Nonsense.

39
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,959
Are you okay?

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,599
My gosh.

41
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,000
Why did you throw up at that moment?

42
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:16,569
Darn it, I made an embarrassment
of myself in front of Psycho.

43
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,009
Okay, get a hold of yourself.

44
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,050
Get a hold of yourself, Sol.

45
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,550
Sol, I mean, Prosecutor Eun.

46
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,280
Prosecutor Eun Sol.

47
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,750
You're a prosecutor
of the Republic of Korea.

48
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,189
You've been waiting for this moment.

49
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,990
You can do this. Let's go.

50
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,319
Hello.

51
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,560
Why don't you take a look?

52
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,300
These are pictures from
your wife's autopsy.

53
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't they look awful?

54
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,439
I refuse to answer
as per article 244...

55
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,340
- of the code of criminal procedure.
- Pardon?

56
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,780
Article 244, clause 3-1 of
the code of criminal procedure.

57
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,009
The accused or the suspect may...

58
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,580
The right to remain silent?
Goodness.

59
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,050
Really? The right to remain silent?

60
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,860
I refuse to answer
as per article 244...

61
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,289
You killed your wife, didn't you?

62
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,460
I refuse to say as per article 244
of the code of criminal procedure.

63
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,199
The autopsy proved everything.

64
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,830
She had over 50 wounds.

65
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,240
Who knows?
She might have hurt herself.

66
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,969
Ms. Kwon had undergone
psychotherapy for a very long time.

67
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,009
Psychotherapy?

68
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,879
- Oh, man.
- Oh, man.

69
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,909
She was doing so well.
Why did she let him get to her?

70
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,550
Going through psychotherapy is
what they always bring up.

71
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,319
She showed those pros
that she's a rookie.

72
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,590
- When will we ever bring her up?
- Exactly.

73
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,689
That scumbag.
I bet I can beat him up so easily.

74
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,189
Darn it.

75
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,579
Did you ever...

76
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,509
- love your wife?
- Love?

77
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,120
This is driving me crazy.

78
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,759
Hey.

79
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,199
Let's eat something.
I'm getting hungry.

80
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,199
- Pardon?
- Coffee.

81
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,139
- Do you have instant coffee?
- Espresso.

82
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,980
I'll go out and get some.

83
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:34,230
Where's your seven iron?
That was the only one missing.

84
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,579
You beat her with that, right?

85
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,079
Her back and shoulders.

86
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,879
A V-shaped wound
with a circular bruise.

87
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,720
The angle of this wound
has to be the seven iron.

88
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,990
Are you the type that needs
a good grip to beat someone up?

89
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,699
Prosecutor Eun.

90
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,699
We're busy men.

91
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,000
How long will you detain him
without any evidence?

92
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,939
My gut is telling me...

93
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,579
that you are the murderer.
And your eyes give it away too.

94
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,079
Goodness, you are
making me laugh very much today.

95
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,850
Is it because you're a newcomer?
You sound so naive.

96
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,589
Do you want to take a look at this?

97
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,930
This is pretty interesting.

98
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,230
It's a footage of my client
leaving home on that night.

99
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,269
- Yes, you're right.
- According to your presumption,

100
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,279
that's right after
he left her to die...

101
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,579
I mean, he walked out right after
he beat her to death.

102
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Then who do you think this is?

103
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,459
How did the dead woman...

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,959
walk him out to the door?

105
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,069
Where's my coffee?

106
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,220
My gosh, this is over.

107
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,590
- Let's get ready to see him off.
- Does he really get to walk out?

108
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,059
Obviously.

109
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,860
No allegation, not enough evidence.

110
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,230
It means the end. It's finished.
It's all over!

111
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:49,100
I'm going to hold him in custody
and indict him.

112
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,299
Please prepare the paperwork.

113
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,039
- What?
- What?

114
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,870
Why?

115
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,240
Have you never seen
a suspect that lies?

116
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,539
- But...
- But he has an alibi...

117
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,350
Some can get beaten up today
and die tomorrow.

118
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,279
That's barely an alibi.

119
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:09,250
Hey, do you think
we'll get in trouble?

120
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,419
Is this real?

121
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,789
She's going to hold him in custody
and indict him even with the alibi?

122
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,200
Hey, I need to go.
Darn it. My stomach hurts.

123
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,669
- Goodness.
- I guess it's real.

124
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:25,700
Mr. Kang's irritable bowel syndrome
broke out again.

125
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,070
That's disgusting.

126
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,139
What are you looking at?

127
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,080
You're going to detain him?

128
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,649
Is this necessary?

129
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,860
The husband is the murderer.
I had that gut feeling.

130
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,990
- What are you saying?
- Gut feeling?

131
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,299
Prosecutor Eun, we need evidence,
not your gut feeling.

132
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,330
If we decide to detain him,

133
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,039
that only puts us
in a tight situation.

134
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:00,039
- Are you confident?
- Do you think I can't do this?

135
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:01,870
Fine.

136
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,539
You probably won't care about
what this old man has to say...

137
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,710
because he's leaving soon anyway.

138
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,120
Prosecutor Eun. Why do you think
I let you take this case?

139
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,860
You must be able to differentiate...

140
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,129
your desires and the reality.

141
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,529
Only then will you become
a prosecutor.

142
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,600
Our deputy chief...

143
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,700
really wanted that case.

144
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:34,639
Okay?

145
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,049
(Reception Room)

146
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,059
- Next, Lawyer Kim Dong Jae.
- Yes.

147
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,399
- Is this some kind of relay?
- It's like a bank.

148
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:40,370
Are you bored?

149
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,039
Shall we swap?

150
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,740
Yes.

151
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,480
To a woman.

152
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,460
Lawyer Han.

153
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,090
You first.

154
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,870
(Reception Room)

155
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,309
I don't know.

156
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,379
They were a sweet couple.

157
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,710
Someone reported them fighting
early in the morning.

158
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,549
I don't know what happens
after I leave.

159
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:26,820
Come on, lady.

160
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:29,620
Ma'am, if you don't cooperate...

161
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,759
That's enough.

162
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,960
She won't say anything.

163
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,500
We have him on security cameras
checking into the hotel at 3:30am.

164
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,539
We also have them leaving
together in the morning.

165
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:46,039
It looks tough.

166
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,870
What about the neighbors?

167
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,679
Influential people live there,
and it's no joke.

168
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,309
They heard and saw nothing.

169
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,350
They kept their mouths shut.

170
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,620
They don't want to be involved.

171
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,389
That's unfair.

172
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,659
Kwon Hee Kyung.

173
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,759
Did you have no friends to talk to?

174
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,200
It's okay. There must be something.
We'll find it, won't we?

175
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,909
- Of course.
- We must.

176
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,379
It's not at all like US dramas.

177
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,250
Has she gone crazy?

178
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,590
Will a witness
suddenly come forward?

179
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,590
- Not at all.
- That never happens.

180
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,889
It never does.

181
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,129
Did she just say, "US dramas"?

182
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,159
She did.

183
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,429
What now?

184
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,139
(Stella Hwang)

185
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,279
Got anything?

186
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,409
Die-hard coffee. Want it?

187
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,120
Is this poison?

188
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,049
Fluoxetine, zolpidem,

189
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,159
acetaminophen, ibuprofen,
paroxetine, diazepam,

190
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,759
propranolol, fluconazole.

191
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,590
- A typical drug cocktail.
- Any anticoagulants?

192
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,799
Warfarin, of course.

193
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,600
People with a prosthetic valve
have to take it forever.

194
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,240
But the real hero of this case is...

195
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,110
Right here.

196
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:04,480
Amazing, right?

197
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,809
Fantastic.

200
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:40,149
This is just killing me.

201
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,950
She went where she shouldn't have
and stepped in poop.

202
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,049
Right.

203
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,090
Shall we take some caffeine
and sugar and keep going?

204
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,389
What? Is something wrong?

205
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,000
My goodness.

206
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,840
About Kwon Hee Kyung, the victim...

207
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:09,370
The National Forensic Service
sent the autopsy report.

208
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,720
(Possible accidental death)

209
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,159
Accidental death?

210
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,129
Accidental death?

211
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,330
The autopsy report is out.

212
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:36,799
An accidental death
caused by drug addiction.

213
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,039
She took what she shouldn't have.

214
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,779
- It's game over.
- And the newbie prosecutor?

215
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,009
She detained you for no good reason.

216
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,450
We can sue for defamation
and demand compensation.

217
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,389
We'll put pressure on all sides.

218
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,759
That's not what I meant.

219
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,690
She'll have to quit and will never
get to practice law again.

220

(National Forensic Service)

221
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,089
Darn it.

222
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,000
Get out.

223
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,170
Dr. Baek.

224
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:49,539
- I'm here about Kwon Hee Kyung.
- You got the report.

225
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,680
How much?

226
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,450
How much does it take to turn
a murder into an accidental death?

227
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,190
This is why prosecutors
are deemed useless.

228
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,730
It wasn't an accidental death.

229
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:09,259
Write your novel alone at home.

230
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,369
- Why did you lie?
- About what?

231
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,740
The Santa Monica high heel case.
It never existed.

232
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,470
You believed what I said?

233
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:24,609
What?

234
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:27,680
I was told to lie down
to talk to you, but it's cold.

235
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,779
Get out.

236
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,980
It wasn't accidental.

237
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,450
You saw the wounds,
bruises, and fractures.

238
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,420
They're not involved with
direct cause of death.

239
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,460
How can you say that so easily?

240
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,130
If a medical examiner doesn't think
from the victims' perspective,

241
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,230
would they be able to die in peace?

242
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,299
This drug, fluconazole.
It's for athlete's foot.

243
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:52,940
That drug must never be taken
along with her anticoagulant.

244
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,039
A typical drug cocktail.

245
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,109
The real hero of this case is...

246
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:01,880
(Fluconazole and warfarin)

247
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,250
When taken together,
they form a poison.

248
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,349
(Do not ingest together)

249
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,160
I'd believe it...

250
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,890
if you said you took a bribe
to change the facts.

251
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,630
Did dealing with stiff corpses
make you void of emotions?

252
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,500
They aren't stiff.
Rigor mortis dissipates after time.

253
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,569
- Did dealing with cold corpses...
- They aren't cold.

254
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,200
At 40℃, they're warmer if
hundreds of maggots squirm inside.

255
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,950
I see why you only
deal with the dead.

256
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,480
Do you think showing off
makes you sound professional?

257
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,650
Is it professional to cry and
throw up in an autopsy room?

258
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,319
No one cried for the dead woman.
Don't you feel sorry for her?

259
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,190
Be her friend then,
not a prosecutor.

260
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,390
You speak so easily. That's why
you wrote your report so easily.

261
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,660
You psychotic...

262
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:56,970
Do you think your name makes you
a tiger from Mount Baekdu?

263
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,000
You're just a psychotic tiger.
Psycho.

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,569
What about you?

265
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,839
Did you look at her properly?

266
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,009
Did you?

267
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,539
Kwon Hee Kyung doesn't
have athlete's feet.

268
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,079
Is that so? Then why did she take
medicine for that?

269
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,609
Exactly.

270
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,589
- Hey.
- What?

271
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:23,990
- You can do this, right?
- Don't you worry about a thing.

272
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,660
A prosecutor shouldn't be...

273
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,730
involved in something
shady like this.

274
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,930
- But will this shady trick work?
- We are all housekeepers.

275
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,170
There's this bond of sisterhood.
Just trust me on this.

276
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:56,150
Excuse me. Hello.

277
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,589
Do you remember me?

278
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:02,990
Why are you here again?
I don't know anything.

279
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,299
There's no one...

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,130
who would testify
for Kwon Hee Kyung.

281
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,869
Didn't you witness the fight
between them?

282
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,000
I can't.

283
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,910
If I testify, I will never get a job
in this neighborhood.

284
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,109
Stop bothering me.

285
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,180
I don't know what happens
after I leave.

286
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,849
Come on, don't be like that.

287
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,390
The college graduation.

288
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,759
You even went to
her college graduation.

289
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,259
You treated her as your daughter.

290
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,569
Didn't she bring you here
when she got married to him?

291
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,700
She suffered a painful death,

292
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,369
but you couldn't even mourn
for her...

293
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,369
because you were scared of
what others might think, right?

294
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:54,509
Poor thing...

295
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,420
I want to...

296
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,720
make things right for her.

297
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,849
(Mouthwash)

(Ox bezoar relaxing pill)

299
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,059
Prosecutor Eun, why don't we go now?

300
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,460
Right. Let's go. Okay.

301
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,309
I'm so glad you're here.

302
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:59,109
Are you sure about this?

303
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:00,210
I'm going to...

304
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,180
quit my job there.

305
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,579
That house...

306
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,019
is an inhumane place.

307
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,160
Thank you.

308

(Court)

309
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,319
Is that silk?

310
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,759
It makes your skin look darker.
The color doesn't suit you.

311
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,359
If you give up now,

312
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,559
I will at least
let you save face.

(Prosecution)

315
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,079
Are you the housekeeper...

316
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,980
at the defendant
and the victim's house?

317
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,180
Yes, I am.

318
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,849
Please tell us what you've witnessed
throughout your time there.

319
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,289
He had beaten her endlessly.

320
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,089
Her bones were fractured.

321
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,559
Her face was all bruised.

322
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,099
Even when she peed on the floor,
he dragged her around...

323
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,640
and kept beating her.

324
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,269
And who was the assailant?

325
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,539
It... It was...

326
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:47,750
It was him
who's no better than a beast.

327
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,720
Let me present you Exhibit 18.

328
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,519
This face is the result
of his assault.

329
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,259
- That's too cruel.
- How could he do that?

330
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:00,930
She had 37 contusions,
7 bone fractures,

331
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,500
and 27 abrasions and scratches.

332
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,230
The victim's body shows
she was suffering in pain.

333
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,569
On top of that,

334
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,769
she was carrying...

335
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,779
an embryo of eight weeks.

336
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,309
(Judge)

337
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,980
That'll be all.

338
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,430
I request a new witness.

339
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,900
I was not informed in advance
regarding a new witness.

340
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,069
This witness is critical
to this trial.

341
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,970
Who is the witness?

342
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,009
He performed the autopsy
at the National Forensic Service.

343
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,509
He's Medical Examiner Baek Beom.

344
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,049
- What?
- Baek Beom?

345
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,150
If he's present,
you may question the witness.

346
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,799
My gosh.

347
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,670
"I solemnly swear..."

348
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,279
"I'll tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth."

349
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:28,410
"If I commit perjury,"

350
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,119
"I swear that
I will face the punishment."

351
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,089
(Witness)

352
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,559
I'll get to the point.

353
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,230
Are the victim's death and
the assault the prosecutor claims...

354
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,630
relevant?

355
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,839
No.

356
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,950
The cause of death was not assault.

357
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,480
(Partners for Justice)

358
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,579
It would've been better
if you hadn't shown up.

359
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,779
This case is over.

360
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,980
- Are you destroying evidence?
- I must clean up what's dirty.

361
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,150
How dare you legally threaten
an active prosecutor?

362
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,650
- Don't hide.
- What do you think it is?

363
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,559
- You found the dying message.
- This is the last time.

364
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,160
Didn't you make this
to murder your wife?

365
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,430
I should keep an eye on her...

366
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,900
to see how far she will go.

367
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,769
I request
Medical Examiner Baek Beom...

368
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:55,299
of NFS as witness.
