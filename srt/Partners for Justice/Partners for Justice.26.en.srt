00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,940
(Episode 26)

2
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,089
What are you doing?

3
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,160
- Get out.
- I need to focus.

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,090
How dare you come here?

5
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,420
Look who's talking.

6
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,829
You didn't do anything right either.

7
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,799
You're so shameless.

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,400
You don't feel an ounce
of shame at all.

9
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,969
I came here to fulfill my duty.

10
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,739
Your duty? If you were sincere,
how could you do such a thing?

11
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,049
You're no better than me. You got
caught trying to keep...

12
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,019
all of the insurance money
to yourself.

13
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,219
Are you here to nitpick about that?

14
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,120
That's enough. It's Dad's funeral.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,859
You've got to be kidding me.
You don't get to say that either.

16
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,060
You secretly tried to sell off
Dad's house, right?

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,099
Hey, if you took good care of
Dad to begin with...

18
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,400
Then why didn't you take care
of him yourself?

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,469
Everyone, stop it.
It's all because of money.

20
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't care about money anymore.
This happened because of you all!

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,370
Darn it. I have nothing to
do with Dad's death.

22
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,209
- Me neither.
- It wasn't me either!

23
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,959
Hey, listen.
Doesn't that mean none of us...

24
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,129
are responsible for his death?

25
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:03,230
So what?

26
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:05,930
- Dad's insurance money.
- Yes.

27
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,099
Let's go get the money.

28
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,229
Let's go.

29
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,349
I found it!

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,689
That's it.

31
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,430
I told the insurance company that
the cause of death was heart attack.

32
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,229
Already?

33
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,300
Darn it.

34
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,500
- What are you doing?
- I have to write up the report.

35
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:48,770
What if the family gets
the insurance money and leave Korea?

36
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,870
I must hurry.

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,240
You once complained of giving
the killer time to get away...

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,449
and performed an autopsy despite
the possibility of getting MERS.

39
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,680
That's a separate matter.

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,849
I clearly helped you that time.

41
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,990
So you must go to them
and tell them yourself. Okay?

42
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,289
- Get your stuff. Hurry.
- Wait...

43
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,389
Goodness, we're wasting time here.

44
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,090
- This is crazy.
- What?

45
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,960
Mr. Kang, please locate
the deceased's family now.

46
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,030
If they're at the insurance company,
please meet me there.

47
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,430
Yes, it's urgent.

48
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,599
Lieutenant Cha, can you look
into someone right now?

49
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,110
Where are you going?

50
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,939
I'm going to take a taxi.

51
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,050
- Come on, we're in a hurry. Get in.
- Then drive slowly.

52
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,620
Do you see this
newly acquired life line here?

53
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,349
I'm trying to see
if I can follow on it.

54
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:35,289
Get in now. Hurry.

55
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,860
Goodness, you're always like that.

56
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:49,500
We have received Yeom Sang Goo's
autopsy report from the NFS.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,870
It's heart attack, isn't it?

58
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,439
Yes, the cause of death
was heart attack.

59
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,979
I need your signatures right here.

60
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,879
Hurry up.

61
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,550
(Name: Yeom Dae Chul)

62
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,889
Thank you.

63
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,189
Once we verify this, the money
will be transferred to you.

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,930
Please wait here.

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,230
Put two hands on the wheel,
and sit up straight.

66
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,199
And keep the dashboard clean too.
That's a murder weapon in accidents.

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,310
Your shoes...

68
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,810
I see. You put them on.

69
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,319
Come on!

70
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,990
Have you gone mad?

71
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,720
(Approved)

72
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,660
She's here. Here she is.

73
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,579
Were you waiting for me?

74
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,279
Of course not.

75
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,519
- Prosecutor Eun.
- Hello.

76
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,389
He's from the NFS.

77
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:53,060
- Wait.
- Hello.

78
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,490
Excuse me. Prosecutor Eun.

79
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,300
- You're right on time.
- Yes.

80
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:58,730
Here you go.

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,269
Here's a request to postpone
the payment of the insurance money.

82
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,740
- What?
- What are you talking about?

83
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,600
Postpone the payment?

84
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,209
We have the type of
Yeom Sang Goo's death.

85
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,620
Would you like to watch it together?

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,420
Here is the afternoon's footage
on the day of his death.

87
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,800
Dad.

88
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,040
During the autopsy,

89
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
we found injuries
on the lower part of his body.

90
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,279
The injuries and the point of
contact from the bicycle match.

91
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,980
Spoke-wheel injury.

92
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,389
(The injury is caused by the bicycle
tire as it skins the body parts.)

93
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,160
The disc brake.

94
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,990
Formation of burn marks.

95
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:05,829
The tire skinned his calf. He got
burned by the heated disc brake...

96
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,800
from going downhill.

97
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,829
Let me see.

98
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:17,240
- How did this happen?
- I bumped into a bicycle.

99
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,620
Come on. You can't die just
because you bumped into a bike.

100
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,620
Take a look.

101
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,829
The handle left trauma
on his chest.

102
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,199
And that catalyzed the condition
and caused the heart attack.

103
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,810
But... But he made it
all the way home.

104
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,139
He was fine!

105
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,240
The shock wasn't big enough
to cause him to die instantaneously.

106
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,269
He was fine until he came back home.

107
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:22,870
But his chest...

108
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,110
probably began to
hurt more and more.

109
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,120
He barely made it home.

110
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,549
He couldn't even fold his umbrella.

111
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,129
Dropped significantly. Here are
pictures of my rage at home.

112
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,559
Donate your money
to this poor bitcoin zombie.

113
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
Mr. Yeom Dae Sik.

114
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,669
You had no idea because you were
busy checking your cryptocurrency.

115
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,080
Then he probably lied down...

116
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,950
and had a tough time breathing.

117
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,389
I remember tying him up
that morning.

118
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,129
How did he untie that?

119
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,029
It's because of me.

120
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:21,269
(Sangnim Patrol Division)

121
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,299
I lost my dad at the hospital.

122
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,809
(The day before his death,
June 17, 2:22pm)

123
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:29,870
And I barely found him
lying on the patrol division's sofa.

124
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,110
Then I brought him back home.

125
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,950
Be careful. Lie down.

126
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,649
I'll put the blanket on you.

127
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,580
Get some rest, Dad.

128
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,059
I just...

129
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,759
left him in his room...

130
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,590
and walked out.

131
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,629
That's why...

132
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:51,799
he was left untied.

133
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,730
(June 17, 11:10pm)

134
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,639
When did he untie himself?

135
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,940
I tied him again.

136
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:15,049
I came out to get some water
in the middle of the night.

137
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,820
I saw Dad's room was...

138
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,860
filled with urine.

139
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,600
I had no idea.

140
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,600
I just got frustrated.

141
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,940
When you die,
all of your muscles relax.

142
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,769
Your urethra and
sphincteral muscles relax too.

143
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,409
That's how urine comes out.

144
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,019
Cause of death.
Acute myocardial infarction.

145
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,149
Type of death. External cause.

146
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,159
(External cause:
Death caused by external factors)

147
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,460
That's my opinion.

148
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,000
Mr. Yeom Sang Goo was
enrolled into a life insurance...

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,700
by Ms. Choi Seon Rye 30 years ago.

150
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:03,740
Is the term due to an illness?

151
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,070
Yes, you are correct.

152
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,210
Once his death is concluded as
death caused by external forces,

153
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,809
you will not receive
the insurance benefit.

154
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,110
What?

155
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:14,750
No way.

156
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,559
Prosecutor Eun, I brought him.

157
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,970
Hey, it's you. You are the one
who rode this bike.

158
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,769
- I'll kill you.
- Calm down.

159
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,399
It's him. That's him.

160
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,240
How shameless of you?
How can you hit him and run off?

161
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,309
He committed a hit-and-run.
He's a murderer.

162
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:45,509
- You!
- Calm down.

163
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:46,980
Okay. Calm down.

164
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,580
Prosecutor Eun.

165
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,080
Mr. Seo Jeong Yun...

166
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,450
always had a camera on
when he went biking.

167
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,789
There is a video of the accident.

168
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,600
(Video)

169
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,370
- Goodness.
- Dad.

170
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,639
- Sir, are you all right?
- Goodness.

171
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:21,610
What's going on? What was that?

172
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,379
Where are you headed?
I'll take you to a doctor.

173
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:25,580
It's raining.

174
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,519
I have to go get my kids.

175
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,820
You can't do that.
You need to get to a hospital.

176
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,059
I need to be there
before school is over.

177
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,029
I'm fine. Help me get back up.

178
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,460
- Sure.
- Goodness.

179
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,100
- Get up.
- My gosh.

180
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,629
I'm fine.

181
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,039
I need to get to their school.

182
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,870
What if you got hurt?

183
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,340
Goodness. I am fine.

184
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,580
I don't need to go to a hospital.

185
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,110
I have to go to their school.
You can go head.

186
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,750
You said he always left...

187
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,690
when it rained.

188
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,450
He always goes missing.

189
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,620
He always leaves when it rains...

190
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,759
and gets into trouble.

191
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:09,730
This is the footage of...

192

Mr. Yeom's whereabouts
after the bicycle accident.

193
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120

June 17, 3:37pm)

194
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,230
Over here.

195
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,070
Dae Chul, Ji Sook!

196
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,330
- Dad!
- Hey.

197
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,669
Hurry up and come. It's raining.

198
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:52,440
- Be careful.
- You're getting wet!

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,610
My goodness, kids. Take this.

200
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,179
- Where have you been?
- Let's go.

201
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,149
He went to pick up his kids...

202
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,750
with an umbrella...

203
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,190
so that they wouldn't get wet.

204
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,029
That can't be right.

205
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,730
He had dementia.

206
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,470
No.

207
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,370
There's no way he heard what I said.

208
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,740
What do you mean?

209
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,779
What did you say to him?

210
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,149
It can't be.

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,159
Dad.

214
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,330
Don't go walking around outside.

215
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,230

"Don't get hurt outside."

220
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,320
"And don't go to a hospital."

221
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,230
He heard...

222
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:24,929
what I said.

(Adult Guardian Application)

224
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,539
Mr. Yeom knew.

(Adult Guardian Application)

226
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,649
He knew he had dementia.

227
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,490
He didn't want to
become a burden to his children,

228
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,320
so he applied for
a guardian himself.

229
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,929
That he will give over...

230
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,629
all of his assets to his children.

231
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,309
But you are now
deprived of that right.

232
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,110
You will get disqualified
as his inheritor...

233
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,940
if you get sentenced.

234
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:14,509
All three of you will be punished...

235
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,580
for injuring and abandoning
your parent, abuse,

236
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,250
and for fabricating
official documents.

237
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:26,889
Some call the moment
when a demented patient...

238
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,690
regains their memory a miracle.

239
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,460
And some...

240
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,769
call that a curse.

241
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:36,870
And during each of...

242
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,399
those miraculous moments,

243
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,639
all he thought about
was his children.

244
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,480
But what you all have done...

245
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,250
turned those moments into a curse.

246

Excuse me, Prosecutor Eun.

If they do not wish
to settle the case with him,

he will be taken in for negligence.

settle the case with him?

Look at the target, not your hand.

What?

263
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,549
Don't trust your hand. It shakes.

264
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,220
- The target's steady. Look at that.
- Okay.

265
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:58,779
What would've happened...

266
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,349
if the family had just buried him
without getting greedy...

267

Then their dad's death
would've gone unnoticed.

It's good that it didn't, right?

Illness, cardiopulmonary arrest.

271

death certificates.

without demanding a payment.

274

- What's the occasion?
- It's nothing.

of pig skin and got to eat none.

Can we have five more portions?

286
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,480
- More?
- Okay.

287
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,779
Yummy. It's my first pig skin dish.

288

last time because of Dr. Baek.

this playing? Cut up some more.

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,809
Seriously?

(Adipocere: When body fat hydrolyzes

332
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,710
This is bad. We're late.

333
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:05,710
Sir, they don't take us seriously
because we're from Busan.

334
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,109
I was the number 1 drug buster
5 years in a row at Busan Central.

335
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,779
Shouldn't we go to
the Special Branch?

336
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:13,720
Violent Crimes? At Seoul Eastern?

337
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,319
This is just crazy.

338
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:18,160
You think you're all that, Mr. Yang.

339
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,259
Do you need medicine? Stop talking.

340
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:22,259
This is just wrong.

341
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,599
No backers doesn't mean
we have no pride.

342
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:27,200
Okay, fine.

343
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,869
Is this it?

344
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,970
They take all the big cases
and ditched us.

345
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,769
Quiet, quiet.

346
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,180
Hey, we have something great.

347
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,279
- Let's go.
- What?

348
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,009
Where to?

349
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,980
Here. I doubt we'll be bored here.

350
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,890
Don't stare or you'll crash.

351
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,950
Let's go to Wuseong-dong.

352
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,160
Let's see.

353
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,500
Take him away. Who brought him here?

354
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:16,720
Look at the holes in the back.

355
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,880
How did you get up here in that?

356
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,720
I came over in a hurry.

357
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,789
Are you a new member
of the Forensics team?

358
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:28,529
You're wearing gloves,
but they're clean.

359
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,160
You aren't police or Forensics.
You're from the Eastern District.

360
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,400
Who are you?

361
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:37,640
It's my first day here,
and I'm blessed with workload.

362
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,839
I bring violent cases wherever I go.

363
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:41,569
What?

364
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:44,640
Hello. You made it up here.

365
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,980
Hello.

366
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,079
- Hello.
- Hi.

367
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:50,220
Are you the new deputy chief?

368
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,980
I'm Do Ji An. Don't bother.

369
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,089
- Are you Prosecutor Eun Sol?
- Yes.

370
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:57,690
Aren't you too pretty
for a prosecutor?

371
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,160
You're so funny.

372
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,859
Nice to meet you.

373
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:04,000
Mr. Do, do you remember how...

374
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,099
I arrested Jang Tae Joo for you?

375
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,569
I heard you shot
an action film in the parking lot.

376
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
I owe you one.

377
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,769
Didn't you just do your duty
as a police officer?

378
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,109
Hello. I'm Yang Soo Dong,
Mr. Do's investigator.

379
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,349
Hello.

380
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,019
Nice to meet you, Mr. Yang...

381
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,720
It sounds like the word
for "chicken coop".

382
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,819
Sorry.

383
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,529
I'm deputy investigator
Kang Dong Sik.

384
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,599
Mr. Yang.

385
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,369
Yes. It's Yang Soo Dong.

386
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,369
I work with Prosecutor Eun Sol.

387
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:46,670
Why did you come straight here?

388
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,740
Why didn't you go
to the office first?

389
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,670
We can take care of everything here.

390
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,009
I know everyone there.
I can visit them later.

391
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:55,279
- Let's look at the crime scene.
- Okay.

392
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:21,809
Aren't you going to
observe the body more?

393
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,319
The burial site is too clean.
There are no bloodstains here.

394
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,390
You're right.

395
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,220
Seal her hands and feet,

396
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,160
- and transfer her to the NFS.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,230
Wait, excuse me.

398
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,099
I don't think you should
untie the knot carelessly.

399
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,299
- Sorry?
- Who are you?

400
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,940
He's Prosecutor Do Ji An. He just
transferred to the Eastern District.

401
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:57,880
Prosecutor Do, I took the photos.

402
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,049
If we don't untie them, it's hard
for us to transfer the body.

403
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,750
- Won't that destroy the evidence?
- Then why don't you move the body?

404
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:07,619
Just as it is. All the way
to the bottom of the mountain.

405
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,619
(Partners for Justice)

406
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:43,089
Something is off.
Find me a body. It's urgent.

407
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:45,690
The scum who killed that woman
has killed before.

408
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,430
The fingerprints from a case
30 years ago...

409
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,289
and the fingerprints
from yesterday's case match?

410
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:52,000
- How is this possible?
- Woosung Serial Murder Case.

411
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,930
Prosecutor General wants the police
and prosecution to work together.

412
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,099
- I'll make sure I catch him.
- I can't say for sure.

413
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,539
If the killer insists on using
a unique murder weapon,

414
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:00,869
that could be a clue.

415
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:03,609
That guy. He's something else.
Seriously.

416
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,680
This is a historical moment.

417
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,710
The serial murder case's
Pandora's box...

418
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,579
from 30 years ago has opened up now.
