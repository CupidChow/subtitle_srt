1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,780
Here's the analysis report of
tetrodotoxin in Yeom Sang Goo.

2
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,049
(Toxic Substance Report)

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,220
- So what?
- That's not the cause of death.

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,380
He didn't take a lethal dose.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,990
What?

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,160
You guys found tetrodotoxin,
but he didn't take a lethal dose?

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,399
The toxic substance report
just came out.

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,399
Traces of toxic substances
take long by nature.

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,429
Traces?

10
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,600
Traces of poison can kill rats,
but not people.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,339
Then how do you explain
Yeom Sang Goo's death?

12
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:33,340
If it wasn't the tetrodotoxin,
why did he die?

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,770
I don't know yet. I haven't found
what caused the external injuries.

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,009
External injuries?

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,509
Oh, the skin abrasions on his calf
and burn marks on the knees?

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,549
Should I tell you
what you told me before?

17
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,850
Those injuries aren't
enough to kill a man.

18
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,890
In February of 2018, middle-aged
men got into a fight on the street.

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,429
An angry man punched
the other guy in the face.

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:54,960
Just one punch.

21
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,829
But the guy who was punched
died in his sleep at home.

22
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,229
The cause of death, heart attack
due to ischaemic heart diseases.

23
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,399
But he didn't die of an illness.

24
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,540
The deceased had a heart disease,
and the punch affected his heart.

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,640
Are you lying to me again?

26
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,439
No, take a look.

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,239
Look. It's a true story.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,379
("A Punch Kills a Man
with a Heart Disease")

29
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:16,250
When a patient has
an acute heart disease,

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,549
a punch is enough to
trigger the heart attack.

31
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,849
That's why we call it the catalysis,
not the cause of death.

32
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,819
(A minor pressure
that can worsen a condition)

33
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:25,359
But not all heart diseases are
caused by these minor pressures.

34
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,790
Bruises on your arms and legs
go away within a few days,

35
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,859
but not the heart.
When the heart is bruised, you die.

36
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,400
That's why we must find it out.
Okay?

37
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,840
You're here.

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,579
We should release
Kim Hyo Jin, right?

39
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,650
We can't prove her motive, and she's
irrelevant to the cause of death.

40
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,079
Okay. Let's release her.

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,650
And we'll go back to square one
and start the investigation again.

42
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,599
Unidentified burn marks.

43
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,669
Doctor, these are the materials
for tomorrow's autopsies.

44
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:14,039
Every contact leaves a trace.

45
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,840
Yes, of course.

46
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,009
There's a trace,
but what was in contact?

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
Sorry? What contact?

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,849
- Get ready. We're leaving.
- Pardon? Go where?

49
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,990
You already saw the crime scene.
We already took all the evidence.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,039
It's been three weeks
since the gas got cut off.

51
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,240
Get the dryers,

52
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,479
iron, and any products
that might heat up in the house.

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,490
The oldest son, Yeom Dae Chul,
got married 13 years ago.

54
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,060
He has a son who's in middle school.

55
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,889
His business went under five years
ago. He works at a company now.

56
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,469
His only apartment was auctioned off
when he couldn't pay the mortgage.

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,729
And the second oldest, Yeom Ji Sook.

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,539
After she got a divorce, she runs
a clothing stall in Dongdaemun.

59
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,009
She's behind rent
and used up all of her deposit,

60
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,340
so she's about to get kicked out.

61
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:25,240
What about Yeom Sang Goo's assets?
Did he leave an inheritance?

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,150
His only asset was the house
he resided in.

63
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,680
After the redevelopment plan was
approved, the value multiplied.

64
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:33,349
I heard that last year, there was
quite a scene in that neighborhood.

65
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,719
To sum up, with the insurance money
and the property,

66
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,620
they could have gotten 600,000
to 700,000 dollars when he died.

67
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,789
Something is very fishy
about the family.

68
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,530
The fact that they were
financially struggling,

69
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,569
and they caused a big scene
to change the cause of death.

70
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:51,169
In the initial questioning, both
Yeom Dae Sik and Kim Hyo Jin lied.

71
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,069
We cannot believe their statements.

72
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,240
I'll ask questions about
Yeom Dae Chul, Yeom Ji Sook,

73
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,710
and their acquaintances.

74
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,349
Didn't the father live
in a collective housing area?

75
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,150
Most of the residents are
retired senior citizens, right?

76
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,120
They wouldn't open up to strangers.

77
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,919
Then should I give it a try?

78
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,860
- No, I...
- Hello, ma'am. Hi.

79
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,970
Why don't you have a drink each?

80
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,769
Gosh. Thank you.

81
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:26,000
My pleasure. You're friends of
Uncle Sang Goo, right?

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,170
- Yes.
- Who are you?

83
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,410
- Do you know Mr. Yeom?
- I'm his niece.

84
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,610
I'm from Anseong.

85
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,079
I came to visit him
since it's been a while.

86
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,319
Gosh, may I sit down?

87
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,120
I mean, Uncle Sang Goo...

88
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,860
isn't the type
who would leave that easily.

89
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,459
When it comes to age, there's
no set order of departure.

90
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,629
Gosh, he had the worse luck
when it came to children.

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,500
What do you mean?
He had three children.

92
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,899
What good are they?

93
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,540
They never showed up once.

94
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,639
- Hey, you got all the points.
- You got all the points.

95
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,379
- You got the points. Keep going?
- Pardon?

96
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,279
- Yes, go. Keep going.
- Keep going? Okay.

97
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,550
Then I guess his children
didn't take care of him.

98
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,550
His son came to visit
not so long ago.

99
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,949
Which one? The oldest?

100
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,750
I live in the house behind his.

101
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,860
It looked like he was taking
Mr. Yeom to a nice place by car.

102
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,329
Do you remember when that was?

103
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,959
Goodness, how could I remember that?

104
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,660
The days are
all the same for me now.

105
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,699
- You got them. You got the points!
- Goodness.

106
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,639
- Goodness.
- This is your third time.

107
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,000
- You're right. I got the points.
- Gosh.

108
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,639
- Every point costs 1 cent, right?
- Yes, 1 cent.

109
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,610
You don't have enough cards,
light cards, and red ribbon cards.

110
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:40,980
- And I have the trio.
- It's your third time.

111
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,649
Then it comes out to
134 dollars and 84 cents.

112
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:46,379
- Goodness.
- Oh, my. What's all this?

113
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,649
- You're in big trouble.
- Gosh. Goodness.

114
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,689
All that matters is
that we all had fun.

115
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:53,930
Then why don't I just forget
about the score?

116
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,660
Gosh, it's so hot.
This is stuffy.

117
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,230
It's been ages since I played.
My fingers feel so stiff.

118
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,670
Hi, Prosecutor Eun.

119
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:11,180
The oldest son, Yeom Dae Chul,
visited Yeom Sang Goo.

120
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,250
The whole family is a pro.

121
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,910
We keep finding new things
about them.

122
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,949
This isn't a merely
dysfunctional family.

123
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:19,750
It's a family
full of hidden agendas.

124
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,620
Please look into Yeom Dae Chul's
recent card statement.

125
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,860
We must find out the time of
his secret visit to Yeom Sang Goo.

126
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,560
(Opening of 24-Hour
Specialized Center for Dementia)

127
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,899
This is it.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,069
This is the place.

129
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,069
On June 17, the day
before Yeom Sang Goo's death,

130
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,740
Yeom Dae Chul swiped and
canceled a bill for 780 dollars.

131
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,439
Specialized center for dementia?
He said he didn't know about that.

132
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,079
Let's go to the administration
and check.

133
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,350
Let's go inside.

134
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,519
Patient Yeom Sang Goo?

135
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,519
He was to get tested
for dementia on June 17 at 10am,

136
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,620
but he didn't get tested.

137
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,189
What? Why is that?

138
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,759
That day, Mr. Yeom disappeared
from the parking lot.

139
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,500
Can we look at the surveillance
camera from that day?

140
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,829
- Please look here.
- Okay.

141
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,540
June 17... June 17. You said
it was in the morning, right?

142
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,540
Yes.

143
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,480
Here. Here he is.

144
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,449
The guardian came alone
and checked in.

145
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,259
Then he said he'd bring his father.

146
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:32,920
Then did he go missing
right after that moment?

147
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,129
I'm not exactly sure.

148
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,529
Look at that.

149
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,240
Wait, isn't that Yeom Ji Sook?

150
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
You're right.

151
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,279
We've been after Yeom Dae Chul.

152
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,839
Why is she suddenly
popping into the picture?

153
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,379
When did this car leave?

154
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,920
After the old man went missing,

155
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,680
his guardian came back
and took the car to go find him.

156
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,819
The son and daughter who weren't
in touch with him for five years...

157
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,490
suddenly came to see him.

158
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,560
And he passed away the day after.

159
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
I'm sure something was going on.

160
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,029
I need to find out
the whereabouts of...

161
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,170
both Yeom Dae Chul
and Yeom Ji Sook on this day.

162
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,899
Cell phones automatically connect...

163
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,870
to base stations
even if you are not on a call.

164
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,209
If we analyze the data of
base stations with their phones,

165
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,839
we will be able to find out
their whereabouts.

166
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,040
All right.

167
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,220
That way.

168
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,250
May I ask you something?

169
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,019
Have you seen this guy on
the morning of Sunday, June 17?

170
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,059
I don't know.

171
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,389
Can you take a closer look?

172
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,990
I don't know.

173
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,529
Can you at least take a look?
See if you can remember.

174
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,129
Goodness.

175
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,730
Work must be tough. She's angry.

176
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,200
- Let's go.
- Let's leave.

177
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,669
- Hello.
- Hello.

178
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:54,240
Hello, we're from Seoul Eastern
District Prosecutor's Office.

179
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,070
It's about the morning of June 17.

180
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,610
A woman in her 30s and
a man in his 70s were here, right?

181
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,950
When is that?

182
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,149
The old man had dementia,

183
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,179
so he must have been here
with his daughter.

184
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,279
Dementia?

185
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,019
Oh, could it be them?

186
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,059
Do you remember anything?

187
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,490
They were sitting
on that table over there.

188
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,360
They only ordered
a glass of juice...

189
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,830
and left about 10 minutes after
if I remember correctly.

190
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,590
This is 130 Songpadae-ro.

191
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,460
So this is the 130.

192
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,200
What kept him so busy
after he lost his father?

193
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,029
Why did he stay here for an hour?

194
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,100
Dong Sik, wake up. We have to go.

195
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,070
Leave me alone for an hour.

196
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,340
You want to sleep for an hour?
He stayed here for an hour.

197
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,669
We have to go. Come on out.

198
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,809
What? Darn it.

199
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,850
Hey, don't be so tough with us.

200
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,909
We know that Yeom Dae Chul was here.

201
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,019
We need the information
for our investigation.

202
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,919
According to Article 26
of the Attorney-at-Law Act,

203
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,460
I cannot disclose any confidential
information about my client.

204

("Q and A of Adult Guardian System
of the Elderly with Dementia")

208

My grandfather has been
a bit funny lately.

209
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,679
I'll come back
to discuss it with you.

210
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,850
Let's go.

(Police Patrol Division)

212
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,480
Yeom Ji Sook.

213
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,389
Yeom Ji Sook? Oh, here she is.

214
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:51,889
She brought an old man who was lost.

215
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,090
What?

216
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,289
- She brought her dad here?
- What?

217
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,929
That old man was her father.

218
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:00,070
Wait, that can't be right.

219
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,929
She said she brought him
because he seemed mentally unstable.

220
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,669
She made sure that I promised
to take him back home.

221
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,039
- Goodness.
- That's odd.

222
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,240
- Prosecutor Eun.
- What's going on?

223
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,450
Mr. Kang, Mr. Cha.
What brings you two here?

224
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,250
This is where Yeom Dae Chul's
last signal was found.

225
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,090
Why are you two here?

226
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,889
Yeom Ji Sook left her dad here.

227
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,759
One came to leave him here,
and the other took him.

228
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,389
They put on a huge show
with their dad.

229
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,759
Did Yeom Dae Chul take his dad
then go home?

230
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,230
Yes, that's what shows
on his cell phone trace.

231
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,330
What about Yeom Ji Sook?

232
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,769
She left him here,
then went somewhere again.

233
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:42,409
Ms. Yeom came to change...

234
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:46,110
the beneficiary of
Mr. Yeom Sang Goo's insurance.

235
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,049
She said Mr. Yeom wanted to
change the beneficiary.

236
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,649
She brought the documents,

237
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,220
but it was missing a few things,
so it never got cleared.

238
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,019
It was requested by Mr. Yeom?

239
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,059
Yes.

240
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:00,129
We should have the paper
with his thumbprint.

241
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,129

Do you know
any good pork skin places?

246
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,100
Pork skin?
I can never have enough of that.

247
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,129
Let's go.

248
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,070

(Sigang Pork Skin)

250
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,309
This is a famous place.
It's got the best pork skin.

251
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,740
Did you ask them not to cut it?

252
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Of course. I'll cut it myself.

253
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,149
Yes!

254
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,320
We aren't going to eat it.

255
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,019

256
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820

Darn it.

What are you doing?

264
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,070
I thought I smelled
some meat burning. That smells.

265
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,769
Then get out.

266
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,080
Oh, my gosh.
Is this new Korean barbeque?

267
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,610
It looks weird, but it tastes great.

268

What are you doing?

269

We're looking for the weapon
that burned Yeom Sang Goo.

270

Do you have to try this to know?

271
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,059
Pork skin doesn't do the trick.
Show me your skin.

Goodness, what's wrong with you?

273

That's enough.

00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,700
- Get out if you won't help.
- Me?

275
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,899
You're responsible
if the fire alarm goes off. Okay?

276
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,399
Let's go.

277
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,549

278
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,080
on June 17?

279
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,320
That's the day before
your dad passed away.

280
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,960
I worked. I worked overtime too.

281
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,830
I was working at my shop too.

282
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,129
And then?

283
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,399
You met with your dad.

284
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,509
You both told me the same lie.

285
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:05,110
That you haven't seen your dad
for the last five years.

286
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,509
Goodness. I am so sorry.

287
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,409

Which hospital?

290
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,759
It was a hospital
for dementia patients.

291
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,460
You already knew
that he had dementia?

292
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,929
I stepped up because
neither of you seemed to care.

293
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,570
I couldn't just leave him like that.

294
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,700
I wanted him to get treated.

295

(Adult Guardian Application)

297
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,340
You tried to buy a house
by applying to become his guardian.

298
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:39,610
You had a meeting...

299
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,250
with a family law attorney
on that afternoon.

300
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,049
You wanted to take his house?

301
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,620
You're unbelievable.

302
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,690
Oh, the thing is...

303
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,720
Someone...

304
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,159
had to become his guardian anyway.

305
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,399
The house was about to be
put up for an auction,

306
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,399
and I had no money on me.

307
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,669
I just wanted to make a living.

308

June 17, 9:25am)

Come with me.

310
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,509
I have no money. No money.

311
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,740
Okay. I understand.

312
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,250
Dad, isn't it frustrating
to be stuck in here?

313
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,419
I'll let you go.

314
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,090
I really shouldn't have done it.

315
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:04,000
But all I did was take him
to the hospital. That's the truth.

316
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,869
I was really dumbfounded
when he went missing that day.

317
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,069
You weren't the only one...

318
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,839
who went to the hospital
that day.

319
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,339
- What?
- What?

320
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,710
You tried to change
the beneficiary...

321
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,119
of Mr. Yeom's life insurance to you.

322
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,150
(Application to Change
the Beneficiary)

323
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,319
(Signed by Yeom Sang Goo)

324
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,750
What's she talking about?

325
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,859
This thumbprint. Yeom Sang Goo
didn't do it himself, did he?

326
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,430
What are you talking about?

327
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,099
You took him from the hospital
and made him do it.

328
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:44,299
What? You abducted Dad?

329
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,509
You left him alone in the car.

330
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,609
I went inside
for a while to register.

331
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,940
I took him for a while...

332
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,240
to get his thumbprint.

333
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,609
Then you left him at
a patrol station?

334
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,049
Even if he had dementia,

335
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,490
was it easy to leave him
alone like that?

336
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,190
He was your father.

337
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,059
I was afraid
my brothers would find out.

338
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,630
I went to his place at first.

339
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,029
But...

340
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,240
(Day before Yeom's death,
June 17, 9:35am)

341
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,380
Hang on.

342
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,779
What's he doing?

343
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:28,980
Dae Chul was taking him somewhere.

344
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,619
Something looked off.

345
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,079
Dad, it's me, Ji Sook.

346
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,920
Ji Sook, your favorite.
Come along, Dad.

347
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,619
Come with me.

348
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,190
Get out.

349
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,559
You see, our dad...

350
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,890
loved me the most.

351
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,390
After our mom died,

352
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,559
I paid all the insurance premiums.

353
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,200
Isn't it just right that
I get what I paid for?

354
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,539
Is that why you went on and on
about the insurance?

355
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,440
At least I didn't try to take
the only thing that belonged to Dad.

356
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,039
What? Are you done?

357
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,579
Will you stop it?

358
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,150
The thing is,

359
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,619
I couldn't change
the beneficiary's name.

360
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:44,859
I don't know
what all this fuss is about.

361
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:49,460
Ma'am, I wasn't able to set
myself up as the legal guardian.

362
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,829
What did I do wrong?

363
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,299
Ji Sook.

364
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,039
You struggled with your dad
while forcing him to put his print.

365
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,680
Here's the footage from
the cafe's security camera...

366
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,980
and dashboard camera footage
from a car outside the hospital.

367
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,950
I sent them to the NFS for analysis.

368
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,490
- Thanks.
- Sure.

369
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,599
Here, have a look.

370
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,140
Dad, do you see
these two marks here and here?

371
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,869
Put your thumbprints here.

372
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,339
No.

373
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,279
Dad. Will you help me out?

374
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,980
I'm hungry.

375
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,819
Will you just help me?
I'm really struggling.

376
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,990
No.

377
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,950
Relax your arm.

378
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,890
I said no.

379
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,829
I'm really struggling.

380
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,359
Here, Dad.

381
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,940
Do you call that
a physical struggle?

382
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,480
Dae Chul, have a look at this.

383
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,150
Dad. Dad? Get out.

384
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,289
No.

385
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,160
Come with me.

386
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,430
I don't want to go.

387
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,900
Dad.

388
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:42,269
I was just trying to
take him to see a doctor.

389
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,779
His cause of death
was myocardial infarction.

390
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,609
It can start with a small shock...

391
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,950
that results in death
after a period of time.

392
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,849
The physical struggles with you
were enough to cause his death.

393
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:56,819
- What?
- What do you mean?

394
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,660
I'm saying that both of you...

395
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,089
are responsible for
your father's death.

396
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:06,970
Gosh, not me.

397
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,569
You struggled with him
to get his thumbprint.

398
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:12,500
What? You hit Dad first.

399
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,710
- You murderer.
- What? How dare you?

400
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,410
Watch your language or I'll just...

401
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,680
- You brat.
- Fine, hit me. Hit me.

402
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,480
- You killed Dad!
- What are you doing?

403
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,049
What's wrong? You did it!

404
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:27,390
You're the one who took him!

405
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,670
No matches.

406
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,000
Dr. Baek.

407
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,710
Yeom Sang Goo's autopsy report.
The director wants it now.

408
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,910
Tell him I got it.

409
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,240
The insurance company sent a letter.

410
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,349
- They want cause of death.
- COD, myocardial infarction.

411
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:57,880
And type of death?

412
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,819
Do you want to do the autopsy
and write the report?

413
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,519
You're ready to do so.

414
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,490
Yeom Sang Goo...

415
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:10,500
Did you analyze
the camera footage we sent?

416
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,099
It's neither. Neither of them
are involved in his death.

417
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,230
Neither of them?

418
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,039
He'd be bruised if there were
any serious physical altercations.

419
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,900
That isn't enough
to set off the heart.

420
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,569
The old man was
tied to a door all day.

421
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,240
There were no outside causes
that could've triggered anything.

422
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,880
If these aren't it, where could he
have sustained such trauma?

423
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,480
I'm looking for that with pig skin.

424
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,019
Did he really say
it's neither of them?

425
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,920
Then is it really over?

426
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:42,930
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

427
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,799
I just took out
a life insurance policy.

428
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,029
- Pardon?
- What?

429
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't want my kids
to fight and end up...

430
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:53,869
in prison when I die.

431
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,579
Prosecutor Eun.

432
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,950
- Guess what a natural death is.
- Pardon?

433
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:04,650
Dying naturally of an illness
within yourself...

434
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,589
and not an outside cause or trauma.

435
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:13,059
In Korea, about
300,000 people die each year.

436
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,490
Over 90 percent of them
are natural deaths.

437
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,329
Most people grow old and die.

438
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,099
Did working with the NFS make you
think every death is a conspiracy?

439
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,470
And old man who died of
a myocardial infarction.

440
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,710
What other reason is there to
an old heart that stopped beating?

441
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,380
Who wants to find out?

442
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,650
Stop wasting time,
and close the case.

443
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:44,259
(Pork Skin Restaurant)

444
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,369
(Pork Skin Restaurant)

445
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,250
Can I have some soju?

446
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,890
What is this?

447
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,990
I don't usually drink soju,
but I crave some today.

448
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,799
Thank you.

449
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,869
Is this pork skin?
I've never had it before.

450
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,640
What? Are you not going to eat it?

451
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,309
It's for testing.

452
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,619
Stay and have some.
I put it on the grill.

453
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:52,190
- I have no time.
- It's a waste.

454
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,430
You look hungry too.

455
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:56,460
Sit back down.

456
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,240
And old man died,

457
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,240
and we have no killer.

458
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,279
Every death has a cause.
Don't write a novel.

459
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:15,710
I shouldn't.

460
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,319
But aren't you here because
you don't have an answer?

461
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,519
You look troubled.

462
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:25,190
You say, "Don't write a novel,"
then give crucial information.

463
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,660
You have something, don't you?

464
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,559
Did you give me something to keep?

465
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,200
You hate unknowns
more than anything.

466
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,930
(Unknown: Unknown cause of death)

467
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,579
Right knee, burn marks.

468
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,079
It might mean something.

469
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,420
- Take close photos.
- Okay.

470
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,789
The burn marks from the autopsy.

471
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,990
Can we share information, please?
Seriously.

472
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:03,700
Look, the meat is burning.

473
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,369
Hang on.

474
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:10,799
This is that.

475
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,569
I saw this before.

476
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,880

477
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,190
Gosh.

478
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,420
What is it? Are you sick?
Or did you get hurt?

479
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,589
Yes, I fell.

480
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:34,960
Let me see.

481
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,160
How did this happen?

482
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,380
(Cloudy, the temperature is 24°C,
higher than yesterday.)

483
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,160
I think I got it. I figured it out.

484
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,190
- Figured out what?
- Hold on a second.

485
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,099
Yes, it's me.

486
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:12,829
Get me the surveillance footage
from Yeom Sang Goo's area...

487
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,069
on the day of his death.

488
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,630
There was a sudden shower
at 3pm that day.

489
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,039
Yes, footage before and after 3pm.
