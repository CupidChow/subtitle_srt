1
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:06,440
Who is it?

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,509
(Episode 32)

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:10,019
- Hello.
- Hi.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,349
He's...

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,849
Yong's friend.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,429
Are you Yong's friend?

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,769
Then you should've called us ahead.

8
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:29,199
- We have nothing to serve you.
- No, that's all right.

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,699
Have a meal before you go. Okay?

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,140
Thank you for the meal.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,619
Please eat, Mom.

12
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:50,689
I hope it's to your liking.
We don't have a lot of side dishes.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,659
Yong liked young radishes too.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,899
I forgot the stir-fried anchovies.
My goodness.

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,680
My mom...

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,950
still misses Yong a lot.

17
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,790
The young radishes are good.

18
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,900
Mr. Jang,

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,739
I'm sorry to bother you
at your mealtime,

20
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,409
but I can't focus on work
because it keeps bothering me.

21
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,780
Why don't we settle this
like real men today?

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,180
One of us should give up
courting Stella for good.

23
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,019
Lieutenant Cha Soo Ho.

24
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,950
How much do you know about Stella?

25
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,489
I know her very well.

26
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,189
She's the best toxicologist
in Korea.

27
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,459
She was top of her class for
four years at Johns Hopkins...

28
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,260
Not what you read
about her on the NFS website.

29
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,400
- What?
- When Stella was a kid,

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,760
- What?
- When Stella was a kid,

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,569
she was adopted to the US.

32
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,900
Her parents run a pharmacist.

33
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,469
She was the only Asian
in her neighborhood.

34
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,610
She couldn't go out
because she was scared...

35
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,610
and only stayed in the pharmacy.

36
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,909
That's why the drugs were
her only friend.

37
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,979
Can you communicate with her?

38
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:25,180
Can you carry on a conversation
when medical terms are involved?

39
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:26,689
When you go meet her parents,

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,789
can you ask for their approval
to marry her?

41
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,560
Stella is beautiful.

42
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,430
She has a great body
and is sexy too.

43
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,530
You only like her
because of her appearance.

44
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,330
If that's why you like her,
you can't handle Stella.

45
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,599
In English, we would say
she's out of your league.

46
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,360
Now, you can tell me.

47
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,830
What had happened 10 years ago?

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,900
It's like a trashy soap opera.

49
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,169
Are you sure you can handle it?

50
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,379
Yong...

51
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:29,080
was really stupid...

52
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,080
and pitiful.

53
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,189
Are you...

54
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,419
all right?

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,430
What if I'm not?

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,830
What do you plan to do now?

57
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,969
I'll keep trying until the end.

58
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,539
Nothing is certain in our future.

59
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,210
Except for that fact
that we'll all die one day.

60
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,759
Be a lawyer.

61
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,729
That suits you better.

62
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,959
(New Cases)

63
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,500
Doctor Baek, you're back already?

64
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,600
Why? Should I just quit?

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,569
Come on, don't say that.

66
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,209
Give me all of the records
of autopsies done without me.

67
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,670
I'll take another look.

68
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,079
Why? Chief Ma will get so angry.

69
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,779
- Bring them.
- Darn it.

70
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,180
Give me the picture
of this wound cut up.

71
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,019
Right here.

72
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,560
And prepare a tissue slide.

73
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,870
Why is the necrosis so serious
with a three-centimeter burn?

74
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,199
This is weird.

75
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,800
We got her medical record,

76
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,339
and she received
burn treatment the day before.

77
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,240
Here.

78
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,449
Someone spilled hot coffee on her.

79
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,879
She just got the burn dressed
and was sent back home.

80
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,319
- This is even weirder.
- What is?

81
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,519
The damage on her soft tissue is
too severe for a light burn.

82
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,089
What's her blood calcium level?

83
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,600
It's a little low.

84
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,129
It must be because she died.

85
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,529
Are you writing fiction too?

86
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,000
What's with you?

87
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,699
Where's Stella?

88
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,500
I don't think she's at work yet.

89
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,110
Call the Eastern District
Prosecutor's Office and Chief Ma.

90
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,170
We have no time to lose.

91
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,389
Hi.

92
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,329
Did you find anything
in Han's blood?

93
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,470
Nothing special.

94
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,339
Do a target-testing
for fluoride ion.

95
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,139
It's an emergency.

96
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,740
And come to work on time.

97
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,790
Fluoride ion and hydrogen ion
were found in Han's blood.

98
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,519
When fluoride meets hydrogen,
it becomes hydrofluoric acid.

99
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,560
It means she had
hydrofluoric acid in her blood.

100
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,230
Hydrofluoric acid.

101
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,560
Oh, my chemical poison!

102
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,459
What is she saying?

103
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,600
Wait.

104
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,600
Did someone terrorize her
with hydrofluoric acid?

105
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
It's possible.

106
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,470
But she had no burn
in her respiratory organs.

107
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,009
- None.
- Then it must be skin contact.

108
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,350
It's a chemical burn
due to hydrofluoric acid.

109
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,350
(Chemical burn: A burn
caused by chemical components)

110
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,819
They added hydrofluoric acid to
hot coffee and spilled on purpose.

111
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,850
In the process, there was necrosis
in the skin tissue of the burn.

112
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,750
Hydrofluoric acid
necrotizes neurons,

113
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,019
then reacts with calcium in blood
to cause hypocalcemia.

114
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,889
And when the symptom worsens,

115
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,699
you can get a cardiac arrest.

116
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,600
After that, you all know.

117
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,699
Death.

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,000
That means she was murdered.

119
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,370
One more thing.

120
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,170
If the acid is diluted
down to 20 percent or lower,

121
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,610
it can take up to 24 hours...

122
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,410
for the symptom to come out.

123
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,610
So it can be delayed.

124
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,949
That' enough time to run away
and make alibis.

125
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,949
The wound didn't look severe
on the outside,

126
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,019
so she was just sent home
after simple treatment.

127
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,389
And her symptoms
must have worsened that night.

128
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,959
Then she died in her car
on the next morning.

129
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,990
You said someone spilled coffee
on her the day before, right?

130
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,230
- Yes.
- Find the security footage.

131
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Yes.

132
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,370
Let's go.

133
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,339
How dare you stab me in the back?

134
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,779
You should have requested
a chemical test.

135
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,779
It was my autopsy and my order.

136
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,519
How dare you interfere?

137
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,350
I would've taken the responsibility
for not requesting the right test,

138
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,990
and I was going to request...

139
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,919
a chemical test
after the toxin substances test.

140
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,129
A chemical test for what?

141
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,730
Do you think you would have
looked for hydrofluoric acid?

142
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,700
Do you think I'm a joke?

143
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,129
That's enough, Chief Ma. Come on.

144
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,399
Do you think you're that good?

145
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,669
Are you the only smart guy here?
I'm also...

146
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,600
putting in everything I have
for my work too.

147
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,240
I'm warning you.

148
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Forget it.

149
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,610
Did you see that?
I've been reassured once again.

150
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,350
I really despise that jerk.

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
Excuse me.

152
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,529
Do you remember the guy
who spilled coffee on this table?

153
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,500
I'm not sure.

154
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,539
Goodness.

155
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,210
I think it's him.

156
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,740
Who are you?

157
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,409
Let's go to the situation room
and go through the footage.

158
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,409
Thank you.

159
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,720
- Soo Ho, I found it.
- Okay.

160
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,330
Track his next move.

161
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,299
And?

162
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,769
The hotel. He went into this hotel.

163
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,940
Get the address
and request for cooperation.

164
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,440
I heard Jinseong Law Firm...

165
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,539
wants to recruit me.

166
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,980
May I ask why?

167
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,210
There's a case
that I'd like you to take.

168
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,080
Do you remember my client?

169
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,750
Director Oh Man Sang
of Seongjin Group.

170
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,259
Doesn't he already have
a dozen people on his counsel?

171
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,659
Oh, he lost one...

172
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,889
quite recently.

173
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,029
We're willing to offer
anything you'd like.

174
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,139
I promise that you'll get
the best contract.

175
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,809
Thank you for dinner.

176
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,539
Are you turning me down?

177
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:38,710
I am.

178
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,309
Do you still think you're
a deputy chief prosecutor?

179
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,320
No one wants to work with
a prosecutor who had to resign...

180
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,679
after he manipulated evidence.

181
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,019
That's my business.

182
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,789
About Mr. Oh Man Sang.

183
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,759
This time, he'll have to...

184
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,129
pay the price for what he has done.

185
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:12,809
We saw him walking into this hotel.

186
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:15,750
But after that, we can't track him
because there were...

187
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,980
way too many people here.

188
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,220
He came to a crowded place
to hide himself.

189
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,549
He probably stayed
under a different name...

190
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:23,090
and paid with cash.

191
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,590
If he got changed
and took off the cap,

192
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,960
it's too hard to detect him
on security cameras.

193
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,159
There are over 500 people
staying at this hotel.

194
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,129
We're going through the list,
but it'll take a while.

195
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,500
(An event for our customers)

196
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,570
No, I doubt it.

197
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,740
But since you never know,
should I at least check?

198
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,850
Room service.

199
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,399
Darn you.

200
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,149
- Who are you?
- Then who are you?

201
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:21,409
You idiot.

202
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,289
Detective Kang.

203
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,759
Did you do that?
Did you do that to him?

204
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,659
You jerk.

205
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,710
Darn you.

206
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:11,259
Don't get near me.
I'm going to kill him.

207
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,700
Hey.

208
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,169
Do you know what this is?

209
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,139
It's hydrofluoric acid.
I'm sure you know this better.

210
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:23,940
Detective Kang, dodge!

211
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,149
Get him!

212
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,690
It's not hydrofluoric acid.
That was water.

213
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,490
What? Darn you!

214
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,289
Goodness, you spilled something
that dangerous on someone.

215
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,799
Did you think we won't find you
if you hid in a crowd?

216
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,799
(An event for our customers:
Earn mileage with your stay)

217
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,269
(You can use your mileage
for your flights.)

218
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,539
Among the guests who paid by cash,

219
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,000
can you give me a list of people...

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,039
whose names are different
between their registration...

221
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,610
and on their airline account?

222
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,149
You used a different name
and paid by cash...

223
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,679
to avoid getting tracked down.

224
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,120
But you couldn't hold back
from earning free mileage...

225
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,779
and ended up using your real name.

226
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,090
Lim Hyun Soo.

227
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,250
Get him.

228
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,659
You were about to
fly to the Philippines tomorrow.

229
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:16,629
And you upgraded your seat
by using the mileage you earned.

230
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,759
Right?

231
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,870
Lim Hyun Soo's call
and transaction history.

232
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,899
Gosh, look at all this.

233
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,740
Have Prosecutor Eun get us
an emergency arrest warrant.

234
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,809
- Okay.
- Okay?

235
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,509
I want everyone from
Gangdong Police Station on this.

236
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,210
- Yes, sir.
- There's...

237
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,750
another thing I need.

238
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,220
What's all this?

239
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,919
Just a moment please.

240
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,129
I'm Lawyer Yoo Tae Joon.
Do you have a warrant?

241
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:50,299
You know your client's eligible
for an emergency arrest.

242
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:53,769
Are you trying to challenge
governmental authority? Are you?

243
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,600
Sir, just give the order.

244
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,639
We'll go in.

245
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,639
Let's all calm down.

246
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,909
The warrant will be here
and it's over, so let's talk.

247
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:07,009
Everyone in Korea knows
my client's face and where he lives.

248
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:10,720
He's not a flight risk.
An emergency arrest is too much.

249
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,490
Let's keep this on the low.
We'll come to your office later.

250
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,889
Mr. Yoo, you did your part.

251
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,059
Now make way.

252
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,129
Causing trouble and ending up
on the evening news...

253
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,399
will only worsen
Sungjin Group's image.

254
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,399
Shouldn't they be here?

255
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,100
Mr. and Ms. Reporters,
over here please.

256
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,799
Come in and line up that way.

257
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,340
Let them through.

258
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,409
Let's go.

259
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,389
Oh Man Sang, you're under...

260
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,019
Where is he?

261
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:02,629
You said you speak to the dead
in an autopsy. You really do.

262
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,340
Then get out.

263
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,070
Let me continue.

264
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,309
The hydrofluoric acid
mark you found...

265
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:12,240
let us to Oh Man Sang.

266
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,279
Get got away before
we could arrest him,

267
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,480
but he's a wanted man
so we'll have him before long.

268
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,620
- I don't care.
- I'm just saying.

269
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,389
Anyway.

270
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,590
Thank you.

271
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,500
When I first saw you on this table,

272
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,370
I thought you were a real nutcase.

273
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,440
But when I didn't see you flinch...

274
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,509
when you were framed for murder,

275
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,649
I realized it then.

276
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,320
You felt guilty, didn't you?

277
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,120
For surviving.

278
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,759
You felt guilty towards
Han Soo Hee...

279
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,460
and Kang Yong.

280
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,289
That's why you only
deal with the dead.

281
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,130
In atonement.

282
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,029
Stop writing fiction and get out.

283
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,500
Yes, sure.

284
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,099
Everything you say
about someone else is fiction.

285
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,569
You can't see inside their mind.

286
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,980
They can just blow you off.

287
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,079
But there's a time when you know.

288
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,019
"That's what it was."

289
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,789
"That's what happened."

290
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:31,490
An autopsy isn't the only way
to look inside a person.

291
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,130
This is what you did.

292
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,200
You cut from the throat
down to below the navel.

293
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,299
Flip open the skin.

294
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,210
Cut the ribs...

295
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,109
and set them aside.

296
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,910
Heart, left lung, right lung,

297
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,220
liver, spleen, stomach, pancreas,

298
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,779
left kidney, right kidney.

299
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,150
Heart, left lung, right lung,

300
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,259
liver, spleen, stomach, pancreas,

301
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:05,690
left kidney, right kidney.

302
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,289
I'll take them out
in that order. Keep up.

303
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,130
I think I get it.

304
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,130
How you feel.

305
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,970
Don't lie to your heart.

306
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,700
You pretend to be strong,
that you don't mind.

307
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,069
Don't hide among the corpses.

308
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,869
Go and face her.

309
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,509
Before it's too late.

310
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,789
So Hee showed some strange symptoms.

311
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:37,519
The brain PET-CT showed
her brainwaves changed.

312
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,390
She might regain consciousness.

313
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,430
When someone in her state
suddenly wakes up...

314
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,599
I know.

315
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,730
I think...

316
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,799
she was waiting for you.

317
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,869
I don't think
she has much time left.

318
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,250
Ms. Eun.

319
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,160
Thanks.

320
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,309
So Hee.

321
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,329
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,369
I came too late.

323
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:51,089
Cause of death.

324
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,789
Multiple organ failure.

325
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,529
Preceding cause.

326
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:03,329
Diffuse axonal injury
due to car accident.

327
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:09,940
Type of death.

328
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:14,549
External.

329
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,319
Father. Save me.

330
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,980
I said spend money
if that will help.

331
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,589
It won't help this time, okay?

332
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:57,859
There's nothing I can do.

333
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,289
- Father!
- I said not this time.

334
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,829
I can't go to prison again.

335
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,930
I can't, over my dead body.

336
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,099
Then die.

337
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,190
Hi, Stella.

338
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,930
Are you free?

339
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:35,960
What's up?

340
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,660
I did some thinking.

341
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,660
I reached a conclusion.

342
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,700
I think this is it between us.

343
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,640
I won't go about
flirting with you...

344
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,470
and won't go beyond
being a colleague.

345
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,180
I'll stay away.

346
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,549
No more flirting.
I'll draw the line.

347
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:55,809
Can I ask why?

348
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,319
Compared to you,

349
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,049
I'm not good enough.

350
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,019
That's it. Bye.

351
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,589
You're not the man I dreamed of.

352
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,359
But you're the man I found.

353
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,599
I don't understand English.
I'm so sick of the language.

354
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,339
Stupid.

355
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,180
But cute.

356
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:30,650
Just now...

357
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,119
You crossed the line first, okay?

358
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,359
We aren't flirting anymore.

359
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,789
Hang on.

360
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,630
Why must I run at a time like this?

361
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,569
I have to go. I'll be
right back, Stella. Stella.

362
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,779
Hello.

363
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,049
Hi. What happened?

364
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:06,119
A tanker full of oil collided
head-on with a passenger car.

365
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,490
The tanker exploded...

366
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,990
and burned everything.

367
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,460
Both drivers died at the scene...

368
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,460
and all we have are the bones.

369
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,700
There are no cameras here,

370
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,559
It's going to take us some time
to figure out exactly what happened.

371
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,500
And it's about the owner
of the vehicle.

372
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,299
- It's Oh Man Sang's.
- What?

373
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,009
This car accident couldn't
have happened at a better timing.

374
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,819
My client has passed away.

375
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:41,150
Why would Oh Man Sang die
all of a sudden?

376
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,750
Something seems off here.

377
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,660
Dead men tell no tales...

378
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:51,829
- or can be found guilty.
- Even a piece of a bone is a body.

379
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,269
Did the NFS arrive yet?

380
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,809
My gosh. Everyone's here.

381
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,450
For the 1st time in 3 years,

382
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,849
we don't have
any scheduled autopsies...

383
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,119
except for those bones.

384
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,819
The world is in peace
where there are no corpses.

385
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,259
It's a day when
the NFS has gathering.

386
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,130
But what about Dr. Psycho?

387
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:24,930
I mean, where is Dr. Baek?

388
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:30,000
He'll be here soon.

389
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,170
(Baek Beom)

390
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,740
Death isn't the end.

391
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,670
The last story left behind death.

392
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,079
Medical examiners...

393
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,809
are the last people
who listen to their last stories.

394
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,420
Current time, 7:17am.

395
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,859
Let us begin the autopsy.
