1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,569
(Episode 23)

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,279
Dad!

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,990
Dad. Dad.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,690
(Yeom Dae Sik,
Yeom Sang Goo's second son)

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,890
(Dae Sik)

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,030
Gosh, why is this brat calling me
in the middle of the night?

7
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,929
- Hello?
- Dad passed away.

8
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:29,730
- What did you say?
- Dad is dead!

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,969
(Yeom Dae Chul,
Yeom Sang Goo's first son)

10
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,609
When?

11
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,310
Did he really pass away?

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,310
(Kim Hyo Jin,
Yeom Sang Goo's daughter-in-law)

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,649
Are you sure he's not breathing?
Did you check?

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,479
Okay. I'm hanging up.

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,350
What happened?

16
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,619
Dad passed away.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,189
Poor Dad. I feel so bad for him.

18
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,130
Ji Sook, stop crying.

19
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:04,040
Did you sign him up
for a mutual aid society?

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,340
That's the job of the oldest.
Didn't he sign Dad up for one?

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,840
Forget it. Bye.

22
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,280
A mutual aid society?

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,909
We can barely get by.

24
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,019
Hey, be quiet.
Get dressed, and come out.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,590
Dad.

26
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,599
What are we going to do?

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,599
We should prepare for a funeral.

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,269
Should we call the police?

29
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:41,170
Ji Sook, why would we call
the police?

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,680
Was there a crime? We'll call 911.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,879
Hyo Jin, people call 911
when they're injured.

32
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,480
Why would we call 911
when he already passed away?

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,980
Dae Chul, come on. Do something.

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,420
What do I know? This is
the first time Dad had passed away.

35
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,090
Hey, if we call the police, they'll
investigate. It'll be a mess.

36
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,599
That's probably true.

37
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,240
He passed away while sleeping.
There's no need to make a fuss.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,539
Really? So what else did it say?

39
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,770
We need to call the funeral hall.
They'll take care of everything.

40
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,039
(Funeral hall)

41
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,849
Did you get
the death certificate issued?

42
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,379
No, we just came here straight.

43
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,590
We need the death certificate
for us to proceed.

44
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,889
Should our agency refer you
to a doctor?

45
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,960
Yes, please.

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,259
- Please wait here.
- Okay.

47
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:48,039
Did he suffer
from any chronic illnesses?

48
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,509
- Dae Sik, how was Dad lately?
- I don't know. He was always ill.

49
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,949
He had a series of illnesses.
He was quite old.

50
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,689
I think he passed away in his sleep
without feeling any pain.

51
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,460
He died of an illness.

52
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,860
The cause of death is
cardiac arrest.

53
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,129
Which one of you will pay the fee?

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,610
The oldest son will pay.

55
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,280
- How much is it?
- 300 dollars.

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,979
300 dollars? Why is it so expensive?

57
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,479
I made a trip here.

58
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,280
If you don't like it,
get a medical license.

59
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,020
That's all right.

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,689
We have 2 types of VIP mortuaries
and 1 standard mortuary.

61
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:44,860
The 1st VIP mortuary is 439m²
and costs 1,000 dollars per night.

62
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,469
The 2nd VIP mortuary is 330m²
and costs 700 dollars.

63
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,099
There isn't a big gap in prices.

64
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,780
He won't have that many visitors.

65
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,780
Let's just go
with the standard mortuary.

66
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,050
(Standard Mortuary)

67
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,409
Let me move onto the food.

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,219
We'll set up meals,
side dishes, and snacks.

69
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:08,789
We put them into A, B, and C to
make it easier for you to choose.

70
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,919
You can choose the set
in a unit of 50 servings.

71
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,319
Dae Sik. Dae Chul.

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,729
Everyone, come on out.

73
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,329
Hey, here's the thing.

74
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,540
I think we should switch
to another funeral hall.

75
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,699
What?

76
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,040
Ji Sook, what are you saying?

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,110
I'll take care of everything.

78
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,810
Let me explain. I got a call.

79
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,180
If we play this right...

80
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,089
It's 15 dollars per hour for the
morgue, so that'd be 30 dollars.

81
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,959
The transfer fee
for the body is 150 dollars.

82
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,699
The transfer fee is 150 dollars?

83
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,029
- It only costs 20 dollars by taxi.
- Then you should've taken a taxi.

84
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,470
If you don't settle the fee,
I can't give back the body.

85
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,970
Everything costs money.

86
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,839
Why are you paying again?

87
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,680
Ji Sook.

88
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,680
You know that Dae Chul paid
for the fee earlier, right?

89
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:11,850
Are you the only son he has?

90
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,050
There's something you don't know.

91
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:46,050
About what happened 10 years ago,
that wasn't the whole story.

92
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,990
What are you saying, Dad?

93
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,160
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,329
You don't make sense, Dad.

95
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,730
By the time she arrived
at the hospital, it was too late.

96
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,509
I must go to her.

97
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,079
Where's So Hee?

98
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,939
It's all over.

99
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,610
They already had a funeral for her.

100
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,319
Beom, you've been
unconscious for a week.

101
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,149
So Hee.

102
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,930
So Hee.

103
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,329
So Hee. Are you okay?

104
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
So Hee.

105
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:06,560
So ever since my father was young,

106
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,639
he often said that
his heart was in pain.

107
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,110
- I wondered why that was the case.
- Gosh.

108
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,910
Doctor, I'll make
this simple for you.

109
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,180
My dad passed away in his sleep.

110
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,180
His heart wasn't
in good condition by nature.

111
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,920
I think he must have passed away
due to a heart attack.

112
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,790
I see some wounds here.

113
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,759
That old man probably
bumped here and there.

114
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,129
By the way,
about the heart attack...

115
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,529
I won't know with bare eyes.

116
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:43,269
Did he regularly go to the hospital
for his heart condition?

117
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:44,500
Yes, of course.

118
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,439
- Hey, Dae Sik.
- Yes?

119
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,069
Didn't Dad
go to the hospital regularly?

120
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,879
I don't know.

121
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,779
Do you have his hospital record?

122
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,350
He passed away in the nighttime.
How could we have the record?

123
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,420
Then I cannot conclude the cause
of death as a heart attack.

124
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,560
What?

125
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,129
Hey, look.

126
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,459
Let's not be too technical about it.

127
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,329
I'm telling you that
he died of a heart attack.

128
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,199
(Death Certificate)

129
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,069
Hey, what are you doing?

130
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,269
Why is the cause of death unknown?

131
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,810
It's unknown because
I don't know how he passed away.

132
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,480
You jerk.

133
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,680
You all look very suspicious.

134
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,080
You jerk!

135
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,289
Are you done?
Are you done with your accusations?

136
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,019
No, detective.
That's not what happened.

137
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,129
How dare he mar my dad's reputation?

138
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,429
Why did you call me if you came up
with your own cause of death?

139
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,970
That's enough. Come on.
Let's calm down and talk.

140
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,370
Sir, this is not fair.

141
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:56,039
I can't believe
we got a quack for a doctor.

142
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,580
What? A quack?

143
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,580
My dad always had a bad heart,

144
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,750
and he died of a heart attack
in his sleep.

145
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,120
It's that simple. I don't know
why you're putting up a fight.

146
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,950
All we asked him to do was
to write up a death certificate.

147
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,690
Then let me see
the death certificate.

148
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,870
Do you see how it says "unknown"?

149
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,269
If the medical examiner
concludes the cause is unknown,

150
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,799
he gets classified as a person
who died of an unnatural cause.

151
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,440
And we must undergo
an investigation immediately.

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,940
Do you understand?

153
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,879
My goodness.
Why did you get the papers confused?

154
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,679
This is the one.

155
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,779
This is my dad's paper.

156
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,250
- What?
- We take back the quack's paper.

157
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,820
You can look at this one.

158
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,590
What?

159
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,700
You have two death certificates.

160
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:55,570
- Yes.
- Yes.

161
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,740
- That's right.
- Look at these.

162
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,169
Are you people kidding me?

163
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,110
What's wrong?

164
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,440
We got that from another doctor.

165
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,950
Do you think this is a pancake?
You don't go around ordering it.

166
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,519
This is a fabrication of
an official document.

167
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,129
You cannot have his funeral.

168
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,529
- What?
- What did you say?

169
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,330
What do you mean?

170
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,799
According to Article 222 of
the Criminal Procedure Code,

171
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,470
the processing instruction of
those who died an unnatural death,

172
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,370
his body must go through an autopsy.

173
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,210
Darn it.

174
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,549
Sol.

175
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,690
I don't think
that's my place anymore.

177
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,330
I'll take full responsibility
and leave.

178
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,360
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:02,370
Goodness.

180
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,600
Prosecutor Eun.

181
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,340
Have you heard?

182
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,139
Prosecutor Kang turned in
his letter of resignation.

183
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,549
Yes, I know.

184
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,679
It's been processed already.

185
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,279
Why were they so quick with this?

186
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,120
I'm sure Hyun wanted this.

187
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,320
People who are worse than him
hold out longer.

188
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,360
You know he isn't the type
who'd do that.

189
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:27,289
He will come back someday.

190
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:33,000
You're here.

191
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,940
I was wondering
if you all got to work all right.

192
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,009
You know,
Criminal Division Eight is...

193
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,139
now facing a very difficult time.

194
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:50,580
But it's not like we will have
less cases to deal with.

195
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,419
It's not like
we'll suddenly have peace.

196
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,019
So... What was I saying?

197
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,490
Oh, anyway.

198
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,559
I just wanted to say that we should
all work hard without being shaken.

199
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,529
Okay.

200
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:04,730
Okay.

201
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,440
(National Forensic Service)

202
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,679
What?

203
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,850
Goodness, is this really you?

204
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,879
What do you want?

205
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,850
Here. We should do this.

206
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,519
I already had some.

207
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:32,620
Have another one.
It's a new day for you.

208
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,690
Get a clean, pure, and confident
start like this tofu.

209
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,690
Forget it. Get out.

210
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,360
Get out? You want me to leave again?

211
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,269
Doctor Baek.
Shouldn't you at least thank me?

212
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,940
Do you know how much work...

213
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,710
Doctor Jang, Stella, and I
put in for you?

214
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,470
Thanks. Happy now? Get out.

215
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,279
Wait, I was talking over you.

216
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,309
I don't think I heard you.
What did you say?

217
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,049
I said thanks.

218
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,820
Thanks.

219
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,460
I can't believe I got such a phone,

220
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,990
then I got you to thank me too.

221
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,059
Why are you still here?

222
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,830
I'm leaving. Leaving now.

223
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:12,429
I'm setting that
as my ringtone now.

224
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Right, Doctor Baek.

225
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,629
Now that you're back,
I really want to say...

226
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,669
Thanks.

227
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,320
Thanks.

228
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,389
- We think he gets up at 3am.
- Exactly.

229
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,720
And with his son...

230
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,629
You're back.

231
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,100
I was never gone.

232
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,730
Ta-da.

233
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:48,830
I already had two.

234
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,240
It's a tradition.

235
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,769
- You can have this.
- Sure.

236
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Where's Prosecutor Kang?

237
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,879
He resigned.

238
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,179
And I can't reach him.
He went off the grid.

239
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,279
He could come back
after he takes a break.

240
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,750
Would that be possible?

241
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,090
- What?
- What?

242
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:13,929
What's the case?

243
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:15,389
Oh, right.

244
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,730
Name, Yeom Sang Goo, age 76.

245
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,570
He was found dead
last night at 3am at his house.

246
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:25,669
Yeom Dae Sik, his son who lives
with him, found him first.

247
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,840
He just died of old age.

248
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,669
But something is suspicious.

249
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,039
They went to a funeral hall
without making a report.

250
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,909
Then they moved
to a different funeral hall...

251
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,080
because they didn't like
the death certificate,

252
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,980
called a different doctor,
then got into a fist fight.

253
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,820
They're an unbelievably rude
and dysfunctional family.

254
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,549
A fist fight?

255
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,360
Yes. You can take a look.

256
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,789
They got death certificates
from two different places.

257
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:49,389
One of them says, "death from
illness". The other says, "unknown".

258
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,460
(Death Certificate)

259
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,529
(Cause of death: Unknown)

260
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,970
Unknown. The one who wrote this
got punched, didn't he?

261
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,100
Yes.

262
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,840
They wanted him to write
"heart attack", didn't they?

263
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,169
How did you know?

264
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,610
There's a scene outside.

265
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,679
What?

266
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,149
You can't take my dad.

267
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,779
Never.

268
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,649
You can't have my dad,

269
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:16,289
not even over my dead body!

270
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:18,389
Please don't make a scene here.

271
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,190
Dae Sik, will you come here?

272
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,860
That piece of trash.

273
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,360
Please get up.

274
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,070
The ambulance has to pass through.

275
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,399
If you want to go,
you can drive over me.

276
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,399
What's going on?

277
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,740
Forget it.

278
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,110
Goodness.

279
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,070
What are you doing here?

280
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,840
You can't do an autopsy
on my dad. You can't.

281
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,909
We're going to take him.

282
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,779
You can't do this.

283
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,220
Take them.

284
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,490
Hurry up and take them away.

285
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,649
Come on, let's go.

286
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,090
- Let go of me.
- Let go.

287
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,220
Let go of me.

288
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,860
- Hey, stop.
- Let go of me.

289
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,960
- That hurts.
- Let go.

290
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,460
- Let go of me.
- Goodness.

291
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,470
- Dad!
- Let go of me.

292
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,570
You're killing me.

293
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,970
Let go of me.

294
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,539
- Dad.
- Unbelievable.

295
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,740
- Stop.
- Dad.

296
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,139
- Father.
- My goodness.

297
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,850
- Let go of me.
- Stop it.

298
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,610
- Let go.
- What do you think you're doing?

299
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,679
- Stop this.
- Goodness.

300
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,519
He was an old man,

301
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,519
and he died
at his house in his sleep.

302
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,820
Why do you have to take this so far?

303
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,129
He really died in peace.

304
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,259
You'll agree when you see his face.

305
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:33,600
No one could have passed away
more peacefully than he did.

306
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,429
I understand that
you are heartbroken.

307
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,169
But the state cannot let it pass...

308
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:41,769
when we find someone who died
of an unknown cause.

309
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,639
It must be tough, but shouldn't we
find out the cause of his death?

310
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,080
Why do you want to
cut up my dad so badly?

311
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,549
I'm telling you.
He died of a heart attack.

312
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,960
Do you know what a heart attack is?

313
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,360
- What?
- What's a heart attack?

314
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,500
It's not like we're doctors.

315
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,099
If you don't know, how can you tell
if he died from that?

316
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,099
Hey, what's a heart attack?

317
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,069
A coronary artery, which
brings blood to one's heart,

318
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,640
gets clogged due to
blood clot or vasoconstriction...

319
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,410
It's 1 of the 3 diseases
that gets covered by...

320
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:19,779
most life insurance plans
without a question.

321
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,029
Insurance coverage?

322
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,799
Are you doing this
because of insurance money?

323
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,630
I knew something was up
when they made a scene so late.

324
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,000
No, it's not that.

325
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,599
I've seen many families
who believed their family members...

326
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,240
died of a heart attack.

327
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,940
It must be painful,
but please stick to our procedure.

328
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,509
No, it's not that.

329
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:59,049
My dad really had a bad heart.

330
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:01,049
Of course, that's the case.

331
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,269
Forceps.

332
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,619
No wound found
on his face, neck, and upper body.

333
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,690
"No wound found
on his face, neck, and upper body."

334
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,930
The front of right calf,
multiple skin abrasions.

335
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,730
"The front of right calf,
multiple skin abrasions."

336
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:52,700
Right knee, burn marks.

337
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,170
(Burn marks)

338
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,970
"Right knee, burn marks."

339
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:58,680
I think this means something.

340
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,549
- Take detailed photos.
- Okay.

341
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,019
Right ankle,
possible ligature marks.

342
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,519
(Ligature marks:
Marks of being tied)

343
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,930
"Right ankle,
possible ligature marks."

344
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,230
Ligature marks? He was tied up?

345
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,000
Above and below ankle,
bleeding from ligature marks.

346
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,670
(Bleeding from ligature marks)

347
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,640
"Above and below ankle,
bleeding from ligature marks."

348
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,180
Did they just say he was tied up?

349
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,279
Yes.

350
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,980
It is suspicious.

351
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,720
He was tied up...

352
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,349
Tied up?

353
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,799
- Heart, 468g.
- "Heart, 468g."

354
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,670
- Enlarged heart.
- "Enlarged heart."

355
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,910
(Heart is larger than usual.)

356
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:07,950
Coronary artery, extremely hardened.

357
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,279
(Wall of vein is thick and stiff)

358
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,420
"Coronary artery,
extremely hardened."

359
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:14,450
Make a tissue slide
and biopsy the heart muscle.

360
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Okay.

361
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,000
- No food.
- "No food."

362
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,769
He didn't eat for at least a day.

363
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,509
(Stomach empty)

364
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,779
Multiple ligature marks
all with different appearances.

365
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,180
He was constantly tied up.

366
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,319
There are abrasions and scraped-up
bruises on his lower body.

367
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,859
- This is abuse.
- What?

368
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:57,299
Abuse? They abused
an old man in his 70s?

369
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,700
Do the ligature marks mean
he was confined?

370
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,569
I would say so.

371
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,339
What's the type of death?

372
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:08,569
There are wounds from an outside
source and signs of heart problems.

373
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,380
We don't know yet
which caused his death.

374
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,650
If it was the heart, it's a natural
death caused by an illness.

375
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,319
- If he died from the wounds...
- There's the possibility of murder.

376
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,390
For the sake of the investigation,
you could lean to one so that...

377
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,160
Homicide, natural death.

378
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,059
We can't exclude either.

379
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,099
Can I ask you something?

380
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,730
Doctor. The time of my dad's death.

381
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,339
Was it before or after midnight?

382
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,579
We have to plan his funeral.

383
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,150
We need to know time of death
to figure out a timeline.

384
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,279
Based on rigor mortis,

385
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,150
he's been dead for a while.

386
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,420
Are you saying it's possible
he died before midnight?

387
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,160
I can't say for sure,
but there's a possibility.

388
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,259
That means he should
go into the coffin tomorrow.

389
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,529
We can't do that.

390
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:08,170
- We need to call and host visitors.
- Right.

391
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,500
It's possible
he died after midnight.

392
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,470
Say he died afterward then.

393
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,640
- What?
- You said you aren't sure.

394
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,480
Yes, but still.

395
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,880
It's done then.

396
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,349
Put him in the coffin
two days from now.

397
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:22,750
That gives us one more day.

398
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,579
We went to so many funerals.

399
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:26,049
Yes, do that.

400
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,819
We haven't called anyone yet
because of the autopsy.

401
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:32,119
- That's right.
- So the date's settled and...

402
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,089
Is death child's play?

403
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,799
Can you change
time of death as you wish?

404
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,859
What?

405
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,069
Hey. Is that all you can say?

406
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:45,240
I've been watching you, and you're
really nasty, do you know that?

407
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,039
Can't we even ask
when and how our dad died?

408
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,680
You don't want to know when he died.

409
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,509
Aren't you whining to get one more
day to accept visitors and money?

410
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,079
Come on, Ms. Prosecutor.

411
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,420
Don't you think you're out of line?

412
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,690
Yeom Dae Sik?

413
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:07,759
You lived with Yeom Sang Goo, right?

414
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,500
- So?
- His body showed signs of...

415
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,799
long-term tying and abuse.

416
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,440
You wouldn't have known
because his upper body was clean,

417
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:23,309
but signs of abuse
were focused on his lower body.

418
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:27,650
Yeom Dae Sik, as per Article 250
Clause 2 of the Penal Code,

419
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,380
you're under arrest
for the parricide of Yeom Sang Goo.

420
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,319
Detective, what do you mean?
What was that?

421
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,819
You can stay silent,

422
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:37,319
refuse to give an incriminating
statement, and hire a lawyer.

423
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,460
- Let's go.
- Isn't this a misunderstanding?

424
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,960
The autopsy showed us everything.

425
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:43,630
Yeom Dae Sik has no job
and is a flight risk.

426
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,660
We have cause for
emergency arrest. Come along.

427
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,670
- Dae Sik.
- Say something.

428
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,339
Dae Sik, Dae Sik.
What did you do? Dae Sik.

429
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:52,569
Dae Sik!

430
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:54,809
Yeom Sang Goo's death.

431
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:58,839
We'll investigate with
the possibility of murder in mind.

432
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,309
I would like you all to cooperate.

433
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,650
Then he...

434
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,019
My gosh.

435
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,630
They needed a death certificate...

436
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,400
but have no use for
their father's body.

437
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:31,240
When you're a kid and it rains,

438
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,509
your mom comes to school
with an umbrella.

439
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,079
That never happened to me.

440
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,920
For some reason, I think...

441
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,289
Yeom Sang Goo
will feel the same now.

442
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,730
He's dead,

443
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,259
and no one is mourning him.

444
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,609
Seriously?

445
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:41,809
Is that the place?

446
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,349
Go upstairs.

447
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,259
Unpaid bills, reminders,

448
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:57,029
and warning of power suspension.
I get the picture.

449
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,599
This isn't even open.

450
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,839
- Hello.
- Careful, don't step on that.

451
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,309
You're hard at work.

452
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:09,809
- Walk that way.
- Okay.

453
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,250
Take everything as it is.

454
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,390
Okay.

455
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:29,089
Doctor. Look at this.

456
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,529
Swab the doorknob.

457
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:34,470
See if you get fibers.

458
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,190
Was he tied to the doorknob?

459
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:02,460
Yes. It's possible.

460
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,079
The mat too.

461
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,130
Did anyone even use the kitchen?

462
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,660
The fridge and cabinets are bare.

463
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,730
There's not a grain of rice.

464
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,539
- They didn't feed the old man.
- I guess not.

465
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:48,710
It's not the kitchen. I think
that is Yeom Dae Sik's room.

466
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:08,859
The scene of the crime. This is it.

467
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:11,859
He did this to his dad?

468
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,769
Stop it!

469
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,869
I'm going to destroy everything!

470
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,640
I don't care!

471
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,509
Why! Why!
