1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,870
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:05,139
I'll be quarantined with her.
I won't leave the room.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,349
The emergency lockup is activated.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,279
We cannot open the door
from outside.

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,119
The moment this door opens,

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,449
the whole building of the NFS
will be at risk of the infection.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sol.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,370
Calm down. Take a deep breath.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,399
Breathe.

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,439
There you go.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,770
I requested for ice packs.

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,840
You'll be fine once you put them
on your forehead.

13
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,880
Don't worry.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,179
Don't forget who you are.

15
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:43,880
You're Crazy Sol.

16
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,219
Yes.

17
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,619
I'll let my craziness take over.

18
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,530
- Yes, Kang Hyun speaking.
- Prosecutor Kang.

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,630
The life insurance money for the
deceased Lee Dong Jae is sizable.

20
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,799
I got it.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,670
Hyun.

22
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,609
You should go back to work. Okay?

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,909
No, I'm going to stay here.

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,079
No.

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,590
I should be the only prosecutor
who plays hooky today.

26
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,359
That guy...

27
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,730
Please find out quickly
if that guy was killed by MERS...

28
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,659
or someone. Please?

29
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,599
Will you be okay?

30
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,700
Of course, I'm fine.

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,500
I'm so curious
about the cause of death. Please?

32
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:40,810
So please help me. Please.

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,810
Wait here.

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,709
I won't be long.

35
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:09,400
Yes, Ms. Cheon.

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,400
Please find that out immediately.

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,300
Thank you.

38
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,469
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

39
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,050
Your heart rate...

40
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,550
You have tachycardia.

41
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,349
(Tachycardia: heart rate that
goes over the normal rate)

42
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,550
Don't be nervous. Don't be.

43
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,189
Don't be anxious.

44
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,930
What... What are you doing now?

45
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,129
The carotid artery that leads
to the heart is located here.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,669
When you press this part,
it will help you relax.

47
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,539
Do it yourself.

48
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,680
It's been over a month...

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,680
since the last time I saw my mom
after I moved out.

50
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,620
There are tons of cases
I didn't get to solve.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,719
I should've listened to my mom
and gotten married.

52
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,319
Instead, I'm locked up here
and infected by MERS.

53
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,729
Darn it.

54
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,300
Doctor!

55
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,169
Dr. Baek!

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,930
Dr. Baek!

57
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,199
Come on, Dr. Psycho!

58
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,139
Please wake up.

59
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,539
He's burning up.

60
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,780
Prosecutor Eun,
remove Dr. Baek's gown.

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,710
Oh, dear.

62
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,120
He should've told me
if he wasn't feeling well.

63
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,590
This is crazy. My gosh.

64
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,289
What?

65
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,159
Wait, what is this?

66
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,230
Dr. Baek.

67
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,899
Wake up! Wake up!

68
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,370
Dr. Baek, are you all right?

69
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,600
Doctor, are you all right?

70
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,910
Are you okay? Please wake up.

71
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,480
Are you okay?

72
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,180
Are you okay? Beom.

73
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,350
So Hee.

74
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,990
Han So Hee. So Hee...

75
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,560
So Hee.

76
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,079
Come here.

77
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,189
Take a seat over here.

78
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,660
Stay here for a second. Okay?

79
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,670
Oh, no.

80
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,240
So Hee.

81
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,209
I love you.

82
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,949
Move in with me.

83
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,259
Are you touched?

84
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:56,089
Was I too cool for you to handle?
Is that it?

85
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:59,029
Why are you about to cry?

86
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:01,430
Don't cry.

87
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,639
Give me your hand.

88
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,639
I'll take that as a yes.

89
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,879
I can't do this, Beom.

90
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,019
What's wrong?

91
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,420
I...

92
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

93
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,560
What...

94
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
Really?

95
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,600
Are you... Are you really pregnant?

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,040
Come here.

97
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,610
You should've told me sooner.
Why didn't you tell me?

98
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,639
Wait.

99
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,439
Did we walk for too long today?

100
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,149
From now on, don't even take a step.

101
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,519
I'll give you a piggyback ride.
You shouldn't walk starting now.

102
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,250
Hurry, and climb on my back. Hurry.

103
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,819
It's not yours.

104
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,360
The baby isn't yours.

105
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,699
It's Kang Yong's...

106
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,600
baby.

107
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,759
- Beom, can you slow down a bit?
- Why would I?

108
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,699
I was betrayed by the friend
whom I trusted the most...

109
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,670
and the woman I loved the most.
So why would I?

110
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,839
It's all over now.

111
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,509
So Hee.

112
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,419
So Hee...

113
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,019
So Hee.

114
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,769
So Hee.

115
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,370
So Hee. Can you hear me? Can you?

116
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,679
So Hee.

117
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,279
So Hee... So Hee...

118
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,649
Han So Hee.

119
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,519
So Hee.

120
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,320
Prosecutor Eun.

121
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,029
- Doctor Baek.
- What?

122
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,399
Are you all right?

123
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,039
Doctor Baek. Are you okay?

124
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,409
That's cold. Goodness.

125
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,740
Doctor Baek, try to get up.

126
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,710
I'm fine. What's with you?

127
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,009
Gosh.

128
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,960
Lee Dong Jae's son was
treated for pneumonia last year.

129
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,629
Are you sure he had pneumonia?

130
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,899
This is his son's medical record.

131
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,710
Prosecutor Eun, are you okay?

132
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:41,509
Yes, I'm fine.

133
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,350
My fever dropped.

134
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,789
This is a setup unless he has
a family history of pneumonia.

135
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,360
What about the things
from his kitchen?

136
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,659
Are they still being analyzed?

137
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,500
Ladies and gentlemen, it's showtime.

138
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:02,899
Is that pepper?

139
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,269
No, it isn't. It's poison.

140
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,240
Gramoxone.

141
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,309
(Gramoxone: herbicide
that's harmful to human body)

142
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:09,309
Bingo.

143
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,139
They put it in a pepper grinder
and made him take it with each meal.

144
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,750
I found that pepper grinder.

145
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,850
You insisted that he had
idiopathic pulmonary disease.

146
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,879
(Idiopathic pulmonary disease:
lung disease of unknown cause)

147
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,850
Is that highly poisonous?

148
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,019
Yes.

149
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,590
Once it gets into your system,
it'll definitely destroy your lungs.

150
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:28,289
It was intended to be used
as herbicide, but it was stopped...

151
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,929
because it was highly poisonous.

152
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,929
Because it's green,
it's also known as the Green Demon.

153
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,299
If someone was poisoned to death
in rural villages,

154
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:36,470
it's usually due to this.

155
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,600
How did they get this?

156
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,809
Because this was highly effective,
some farms had bought them in bulk.

157
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,940
He must've had so much.

158
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,080
One sip.

159
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:48,450
What?

160
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,019
Even one sip of that can be fatal.

161
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:54,549
So even if he had a bit,
he was bound to die one day.

162
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,389
It's perfect for an insurance fraud.

163
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,789
When was his prescription?

164
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,190
Six months ago.

165
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,490
That means this was plotted
over a long time.

166
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,230
Is his wife still unreachable?

167
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,500
We checked her call history and
security footages, but she's gone.

168
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,470
Don't you think she ran off already?

169
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,740
Wrong question.

170
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,139
She fed it to her son and made him
get treated for pneumonia,

171
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,580
then killed her husband.

172
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,509
Do you think she was
only after the two of them?

173
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,820
Prosecutor Kang, I found this
about Lee's wife, Hong Seon Ja.

174
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,460
She claimed and received
30,000 dollars of insurance...

175
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,299
when her son was
hospitalized last year.

176
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:41,100
And with her husband's death,
she'll receive 700,000 dollars.

177
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,570
Her ex-husband is also deceased.

178
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:45,440
The death benefit was... Let's see.

179
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,710
440,000 dollars?

180
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,940
What's his cause of death?

181
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,110
He also died of
idiopathic pulmonary disease.

182
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,750
Thank you.

183
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,779
Hong Seon Ja's phone was
turned off three days ago.

184
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,789
The last trace of her phone was
found near Mr. Lee's home.

185
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,120
This is highly suspicious.

186
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,929
A successful insurance fraud
never ends with the first one.

187
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,330
Then she's...

188
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,159
Looking for her next target.

189
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,899
Find the insurance plan of
those that are acquainted with her.

190
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,440
This is now switched into a murder
case for an insurance fraud.

191
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,179
Okay.

192
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,019
Cheongdam Beauty Salon,

193
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,590
8,900 dollars.

194
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,090
Another transaction of 8,900 dollars
at Cheongdam Beauty Salon?

195
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,129
So you got a massage
every single day?

196
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,700
What happened to Prosecutor Eun?

197
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,299
She's still under quarantine.

198
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,970
That's why I told her
not to be nosy.

199
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,940
What are we going to do?
I'm so worried about her.

200
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,409
Worried? Nonsense.

201
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,980
Forget it.

202
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,009
Tell her to just stay in there.

203
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,980
Tell her to use up
all of her vacation days in there.

204
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,960
The beauty salon.

205
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,669
Seon Ja recommended this place
to me.

206
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,139
Hong Seon Ja.

207
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,350
Oh, right.

208
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,909
Is Seon Ja's masseuse here?

209
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,049
I need her to take care of me too.

210
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,289
Of course. Come this way.

211
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:41,519
Let's go.

212
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,190
That's great.

213
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,860
Are you Ms. Hong's friend?

214
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,600
I'm her junior.

215
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,700
She had such smooth skin,
so I had to ask her.

216
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,639
Really?

217
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,269
It's all thanks to you, right?

218
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:05,279
Please make my skin look smooth too.

219
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:07,750
You have very firm skin.

220
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,779
You'll look like a porcelain doll
in just a few months.

221
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:11,980
That sounds great.

222
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,950
Make my skin so smooth that
a fly will slip off of it.

223
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,490
- You know, right?
- Of course.

224
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,620
- This is cold.
- Sure.

225
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,389
My goodness. That was shocking.
That's awfully cold.

226
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:22,929
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

227
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, nothing. I was just surprised.

228
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,669
Anyway, isn't Seon Ja coming today?

229
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:31,370
It looks like
you have some time today.

230
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:34,110
She went to see
her in-laws for a few days.

231
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:36,710
Her in-laws?

232
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,710
Right here.

233
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,389
All of these are
Hong's life insurance plans?

234
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:50,389
Yes. Some of them are years old,
and some are recent.

235
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,389
It's everything that lists her and
her husband as the beneficiary.

236
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,460
Lee Dong Jae is her husband.

237
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,129
Who's Lee Moo Seong?

238
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,500
That's her father-in-law.

239
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,870
So Lee Chul Joong is her son,

240
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,669
and Cha Sun Ok is her mother-in-law.

241
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:08,070
Hong Seon Sook is
her younger sister.

242
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,139
Man, look at the number of
life insurances she's involved with.

243
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,009
This can be a serial murder.

244
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,279
This is Kang Hyun.

245
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,190
Prosecutor Kang, I found out.

246
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,389
Hong went to see her in-laws
because her mother-in-law said...

247
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:26,659
she wasn't feeling well.

248
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,090
Her mother-in-law?

249
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,129
She has a life insurance too.

250
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,299
She went to cook for her.

251
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,470
Oh, right.

252
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,110
Wait for me. Hey, wait.

253
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,019
What? I'm busy.

254
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,820
Can I claim the fee
for this massage?

255
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,289
Massage? What are you talking about?

256
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:56,960
I'm at the beauty salon
that Hong goes to.

257
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,289
And it costs 300 dollars
per session.

258
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,490
Have you gone insane?

259
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,659
I can claim this, right?

260
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,029
Did you get the massage?

261
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:07,400
- I did.
- Why did you?

262
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,299
Wait for me. My gosh.

263
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,740
Hello?

264
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,240
I still have 10 minutes left.

265
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,950
Whatever.

266
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,559
Are you looking for this?

267
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,759
My goodness.

268
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,369
Who are you?

269
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,329
I'm here to take care
of the old lady.

270
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,339
You must be from the gu-office.

271
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,509
Are you a social worker?

272
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:25,339
Yes, but I didn't know
her daughter-in-law came.

273
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,349
Are you making stew?

274
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,950
Oh, she loves doenjang stew.

275
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,549
That looks pretty salty.

276
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,220
No. It's perfectly seasoned.

277
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,220
Really?

278
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:43,460
Then why don't you taste it?

279
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,500
No.

280
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,559
It's perfectly seasoned.

281
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,569
Then should I have a taste?

282
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:55,710
No. I think the one who made it
should taste it. Have some.

283
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,480
No. Stop it.

284
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,880
Of course, you can't eat that.

285
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,250
What?

286
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,390
My goodness. You shouldn't.
That'll kill you.

287
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,589
What are you talking about?

288
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,730
Gramoxone. You added poison.

289
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,829
If not, have some.

290
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,000
Ms. Hong Seon Ja.

291
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,170
You're arrested for the murder of
Han Sang Soo, Lee Dong Jae,

292
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,970
causing bodily harm
to Lee Chul Joong,

293
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,940
defraud and attempted murder
of Cha Sun Ok,

294
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,240
and defraudation of
insurance payments.

295
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,109
As per Article 212 of
the Criminal Procedure Code,

296
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,410
you're under arrest.

297
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,079
You can refuse to testify
and hire a lawyer.

298
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,779
You can challenge the confinement...

299
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,049
You didn't stop me from
trying to taste the food.

300
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:43,660
That's fine.

301
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,730
I won't charge you for attempted
murder of a police officer.

302
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,960
Let's go.

303
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,759
(National Forensic Service)

304
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,000
They have arrested...

305
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,500
Lee Dong Jae's wife.

306
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,509
Then can we go out?

307
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,210
He didn't die of MERS.

308
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,809
We can't be sure.

309
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,380
A possible combination.

310
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,089
When two or more crucial injuries
harm separate organs.

311
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,990
When will Disease Control get back?

312
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,460
You got varicella zoster.

313
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,000
What's that?

314
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,769
Shingles.

315
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,309
It hurts like mad.
But it doesn't kill. Don't worry.

316
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,839
- I knew it.
- You knew?

317
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,009
Blisters forming
close to nerve endings.

318
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:41,849
Early symptoms are fever and nausea.

319
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,519
And pain in the nerves.

320
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,180
- PCR results?
- Confirmed.

321
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,019
- Then it's for sure.
- You should've told me sooner.

322
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:51,619
I got worried thinking
you were infected.

323
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,089
Was it me you were worried about?

324
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:57,859
It's Park Joong Ho,
Director of the NFS.

325
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,599
Yes.

326
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,230
Okay.

327
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,470
I'll do that.

328
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,599
Let's go.

329
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,710
- What?
- The results are out?

330
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:14,779
You didn't even hear...
It's really out?

331
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,750
It's negative. You're free to go.

332
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,119
Go to a hospital.

333
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,990
What for?

334
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,089
To say I spent five hours with
a dead man who'd been to...

335
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,130
the Middle East and
a man with shingles?

336
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,829
Get a tetanus shot.

337
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,599
And get some antibiotics.

338
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,309
He's in pain but tries to be strong.

339
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:43,410
Are you okay?

340
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,440
I really thought it was MERS.

341
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,250
I took my temperature with
a rectal thermometer.

342
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,849
That's not it.

343
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:54,890
What?

344
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,829
This is the postmortem
rectal thermometer.

345
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,230
(Thermometer used on corpses)

346
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,559
That psycho really...

347
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,049
(Autopsy Room)

348
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,690
Eun Sol!

349
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,759
Hyun. It's negative.

350
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,029
Is your fever gone?

351
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,700
- Yes.
- How's your hand?

352
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,740
I think it's okay.

353
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,680
- Let's go to a hospital.
- Okay.

354
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,549
Hey, it's nicely done.

355
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,759
The stitches are even and regular.

356
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,930
An expert did this.

357
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:10,630
- Really?
- Who treated you?

358
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,000
A quack.

359
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,670
I said I could manage alone.

360
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,940
I was worried.

361
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,380
No.

362
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,309
I'll be honest.

363
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:28,309
I was afraid...

364
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,619
that something would happen to you.

365
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,849
I don't know how to explain it.

366
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,150
I just...

367
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,490
had to come running.

368
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,230
We identified the cause of death...

369
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,170
and caught the killer.
It all ended well.

370
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,039
Will you ignore me to the very end?

371
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,710
- About what?
- Dr. Baek.

372
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,910
I want you to stay away from him.

373
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,619
Hyun. I don't know exactly...

374
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,750
what went on between you two but...

375
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:13,789
This isn't like you.

376
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,000
You know you're
unusually obsessive, right?

377
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,829
Watching you all day...

378
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,599
made me vow...

379
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,369
never to lose a loved one again.

380
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,710
I'll explain later.

381
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,880
Today,

382
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,650
I have to be somewhere else.

383
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,289
Today is...

384
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,759
my brother's death anniversary.

385
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,789
Are you happy?

386
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,059
(Kang Yong)

387
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,190
Are you that happy?

388
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:21,829
You're always the same.

389
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,359
You selfish jerk.

390
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,869
My dear new colleagues.

391
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:31,599
Today is the day...

392
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,240
you start your careers
as prosecutors.

393
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:38,440
It's a solemn and important day.

394
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,910
I congratulate you all.

395
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,279
As of this moment,

396
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,019
as a prosecutor...

397
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,289
As a prosecutor, I hope that...

398
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,730
(Appointment Ceremony)

399
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,130
(Prosecutor Kang Hyun)

400
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,380
Is this your older brother?

401
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:17,849
You lunatic.

402
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,089
Did you leave Mom and me...

403
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:23,390
just to end up like this?

404
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:27,460
I told you never to show up again.

405
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,930
Did you have to...

406
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:34,269
show up like this today?

407
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,319
Don't you ever care about
me or Mom?

408
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,019
Ever?

409
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,000
You're such a loser.

410
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,799
Is that why you left?

411
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,210
- Is that?
- You're Yong's younger brother?

412
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,980
He never told me he had a brother.

413
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,250
He never spoke about his family.

414
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,549
I knew there was something
in your gaze.

415
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:30,059
Shut your mouth.

416
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,960
You never visited in 10 years.
Why are you here?

417
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,670
What? Now, you want to
ask for forgiveness?

418
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:44,200
I'm dating Han So Hee.

419
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,839
It's Kang Yong's...

420
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:48,670
baby.

421
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:52,609
I came out of my sense of duty.

422
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,349
You shameless jerk.

423
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,720
How dare you show up here?

424
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,490
Do you think I had something
to do with Yong's death?

425
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,619
Don't you dare...

426
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,990
say my brother's name.

427
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,430
You killed him!

428
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:23,609
Cause of death.

429
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:27,009
Suffocation due to respiratory
muscle paralysis caused by...

430
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:29,150
a sodium pentothal and
succinylcholine injection.

431
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,319
Classification of death, suicide.

432
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,190
Those are the facts he left behind.

433
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,660
That's how you always
get out, isn't it?

434
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,859
With your glorified facts.

435
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,200
Eun Sol seems to think
you're someone impressive.

436
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,769
I know what you're thinking.

437
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,299
You just ran away
after killing someone.

438
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,039
To hide among corpses
who can't speak.

439
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,880
Like a coward.

440
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:06,119
But even that's over for you now.

441
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,890
Your hypocrisy...

442
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,519
and lies.

443
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,190
I'll expose them all.

444
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:14,960
I'm nearly there.

445
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,930
Brace yourself.

446
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,099
When we meet again,

447
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,900
it'll be somewhere fun.

448
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:46,960
(Partners for Justice)

449
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,289
- Stop!
- Did something happen?

450
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,299
Who is it?

451
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:53,970
Listen to me! Open the door
right now, you jerks!

452
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,470
Beom, open up!

453
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,869
Doesn't that mean this is a suicide?

454
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,369
Are you saying this is a homicide?

455
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,670
Don't submit anything for now.

456
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,369
Please let me just check.

457
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:04,509
That's not our son, right?

458
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:06,279
I can't be Sung Jae's
mother anymore.

459
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,150
My son, Sung Jae, died.

460
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,309
Do you really think...

461
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,750
my son's death had nothing to
do with your sons?

462
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,650
This is a murder case.

463
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,950
Stop writing your novel.

464
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,420
No, this time,
I'll write a masterpiece.
