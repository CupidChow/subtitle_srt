1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:04,009
He didn't face the charge
due to lack of evidence.

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:05,379
But Baek Beom is...

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,410
an assailant.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,650
It could've been an accident.

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,050
No, and that's the truth.

6
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:15,750
He ran away because
he couldn't handle the truth.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,359
And that's when he hurt his hand?

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,890
Did you know?

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,160
I just had a feeling.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,600
Why did a successful surgeon hide
in the National Forensic Service?

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,000
He probably couldn't save people
with his hand anymore.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,640
What about his fiancee?

13
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,539
She died.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,909
I don't want you to
work with Baek Beom.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,649
He only handles the dead anyway.

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,219
He's using you too.

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,920
(Episode 12)

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,289
(National Forensic Service)

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,599
Come home early today. Sung Jae
is coming home from his dorm today.

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,640
Our son is at the top
of his class again.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,480
I knew it.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,010
Sweet ice cream

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,109
Come in.

24
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,620
Hey, Seong Joo.
What brings you here?

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,890
- I have a favor to ask you.
- Okay. Go ahead.

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,519
I'm sorry to ask you this,

27
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,189
but can you switch
one of our autopsies?

28
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,629
Why?

29
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:32,900
Didn't you assign the victim of
the car accident to Dr. Baek?

30
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,900
He despises car accidents.

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,939
You know that
he hates car accidents.

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,840
Hey, look.
You think you got so big now?

33
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,579
Do you think I like taking
car accident cases?

34
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,980
Insurance companies file lawsuits
and request for verification.

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,879
Of course, I know that, but
can't you just switch this once?

36
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,620
Ask the medical examiners
at our establishment.

37
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,620
Everyone hates doing autopsies
for car accidents.

38
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,719
Does he think he deserves
this special privilege?

39
00:01:58,489 --> 00:01:59,590
I understand.

40
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,629
He totally ruined my good mood.

41
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,669
He won't switch it. This is bad.

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,469
- I'm switching to another team.
- Come on, don't do that.

43
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,909
Please do this with me.

44
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,240
You know well how he becomes when
he takes on car accident cases.

45
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,139
My gosh, this is driving me crazy!

46
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,250
Do we have a car accident today?

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,150
Dr. Baek!

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,219
Hello, I'm sorry
for not coming earlier.

49
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:29,750
Is it a car accident?

50
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,819
Dr. Baek, thank you so much.

51
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,889
You gave me a chance to
live the Act Two of my life.

52
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,060
- Yes.
- I won't do it.

53
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,099
Tell them to reassign it.

54
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,330
Dr. Baek, this is...

55
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,199
What kind of case is it?

56
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,539
Okay, hold on.

57
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,180
The female driver died on the scene.

58
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,379
Only her boyfriend who was
in the passenger seat survived.

59
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,710
- Only the driver died?
- Yes. The passenger was fine.

60
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,280
This is quite a rare case.

61
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,389
(Incident Report)

62
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:04,990
(Choi Mi Jin, the driver,
died on the scene.)

63
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:06,960
Get ready for the autopsy.

64
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,430
- Move it.
- Dr. Baek, this is for you...

65
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,430
What's going on?
What am I not getting?

66
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,069
Dr. Psycho is in action.

67
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,870
What? In action?

68
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,110
What? What do you mean?

69
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,039
(Car Accident Report)

70
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:28,780
Age, 25. Name, Choi Mi Jin.

71
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,150
Around 2am yesterday, when she was
driving in place of Jeong Ji Hoon...

72
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,819
who drank alcohol,
she veered out of the lane.

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,159
She drove over the centerline and
crashed into a tree across from her.

74
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,620
She died on the scene.

75
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,259
Jeong Ji Hoon in the passenger seat
was drunk at that time.

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,729
He only has mild contusions.

77
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,500
- Do you think she dozed off?
- She was new to driving.

78
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,469
It's possible that
she lacked experience.

79
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,370
I think she only drove because
she couldn't let him drive.

80
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,409
Are you writing a novel?

81
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,409
Are you?

82
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,449
Let's do the autopsy.

83
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,289
- Did something happen to him today?
- He hates car accident autopsies.

84
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,819
- We're doomed.
- Let's go.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,110
Stella.

86
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,810
- How are you?
- Stop.

87
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,209
Let me concentrate.

88
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,889
I had a zit.

89
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,920
It was 0.25cm big,

90
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,089
so I needed to apply
exactly 1.35mg of ointment.

91
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,029
You could just apply
whatever amount.

92
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,060
No way.

93
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,160
If I use less than the suggested
amount, it won't be effective.

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,829
If I use too much,
it'll cause more infection.

95
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,430
- You don't want that.
- Okay.

96
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,470
Anyway, what brings you here?

97
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,540
It's about Jeong Ji Hoon
who was in the car with her.

98
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,839
Do you have his blood alcohol
content? I sent it in urgently.

99
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,079
Did you come here yourself?

100
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,709
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

101
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,089
Why do you ignore my calls
and text messages?

102
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,959
- Oh, because I'm busy.
- Busy?

103
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,589
Stella.

104
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,899
I'm not the type of guy
who writes up a contract...

105
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,970
to have sexual intercourse.
I'm not that inhumane.

106
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:30,170
Let's just lightly
see each other first.

107
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,040
Let's do that, okay?

108
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,910
- Awesome.
- What?

109
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,370
Okay?

110
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,579
You said okay, right?

111
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,180
I'll try very hard.

112
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,980
No, no. When you flirt,

113
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,980
you need to be charming,
not try hard.

114
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,519
- Be cool.
- Be cool, right.

115
00:05:52,959 --> 00:06:00,269
(Prove one's death.)

116
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,930
Stop whining.

117
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:07,269
Everyone freaks out whenever they
see a car accident autopsy.

118
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,139
Let's keep it within
five hours today, okay?

119
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:11,540
It's not about doing it quickly.

120
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,850
Aren't you going to think about
your coworkers?

121
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,350
I'm not suggesting
that we just do it quickly.

122
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,250
I'm suggesting that we make it
accurate yet quick.

123
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,379
Accurate yet quick?

124
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,319
Is this a Chinese delivery?

125
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,360
I'll let you have your joke
because I'm having a great day.

126
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,990
Sung Jae is coming home today.

127
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,160
You've met him before.

128
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,259
The top of his class in
the Academy for the Gifted.

129
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:35,800
Well, you don't have a kid.
You wouldn't know.

130
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,470
Forget it. My autopsy today is
from a car accident too.

131
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,209
It's awfully damaged.

132
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,379
Do you want to compete
and see who finishes first?

133
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,459
Compete, my foot.

134
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,379
Local scrape on forehead.

135
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,079
(Local scrape: a partial scrape
on one's skin)

136
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,050
"Local scrape on forehead".

137
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,089
No wound from the seat belt.

138
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:30,589
"No wound from the seat belt".

139
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,360
I don't see that many bruises.

140
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,000
She must've been hurt quite a lot
if it was a head-on collision.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,329
You can get bruised
only when you're alive.

142
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,629
Once someone dies,

143
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,939
there's no blood circulation,
so they can't get any bruises.

144
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,439
If she wasn't dead, she
would've been bruised everywhere.

145
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,879
Chafed on the right knee,
has abrasions.

146
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,519
"Chafed on the right knee,
has abrasions".

147
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,689
Likely caused by the dashboard.

148
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,290
"Likely caused by the dashboard".

149
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,660
No injury on her left arm.

150
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,060
Aren't you going to write that down?

151
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,100
You said there's nothing there.

152
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,500
Come here.

153
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,939
Come here!

154
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,170
Write down that there was
no injury on her left arm.

155
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,639
Don't you know that
a negative finding is as important?

156
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,350
Yes, you're right. I apologize.

157
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,250
- Do you want to leave forever?
- What?

158
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,080
- No, sir.
- Keep it up.

159
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,149
Write it down.

160
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,129
"No injury on her left arm".

161
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,529
He's more irritable than usual.

162
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,299
Oh, that's called...

Dr. Psycho in action.

164

Lower half of right arm, fractured.

165
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,149
"Lower half of right arm,
fractured".

(Internal skin damage: outside force
separating one's skin and muscle)

167
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,789
Internal skin damage.

168
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,190
"Internal skin damage".

169
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,059
The passenger seat window
was open, right?

170
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,299
One second.

(Vehicle condition: Front damage,
window open, damaged)

173
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,899
You're right. The window was open.

174
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,039
She isn't the driver.

175
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,009
- What?
- She wasn't damaged from the wheel,

176
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,879
no damage from the air bag,

177
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,179
and she didn't have a seat belt on.

178
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,679
That makes no sense.

179
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,620
She had her right arm
on the passenger seat window.

180
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,549
But he said his girlfriend drove.

181
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:41,549
He lied.

182
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:43,889
So that...

183
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,659
he wouldn't get caught
for driving under the influence?

184
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:51,360
I mean, there were no
security cameras around,

185
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,500
and he claimed that
he just slept in the car.

186
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,629
So what? Do you want to
switch the suspects?

187
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,399
Well, it's not that.

188
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,409
He's been crying
through the night,

189
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,379
blaming himself for her death
in that office.

190
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,240
Then go check the inside of his arm.

191
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,980
You'll find a lead there.

192
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,649
Hurry up!

193
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,330
Mr. Jeong Ji Hoon?

194
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,200
Is her autopsy...

195
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,940
- over?
- No, not yet.

196
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,340
Let me check a few things.

197
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:41,779
Mr. Jeong, your blood alcohol
content was 0.27 percent.

198
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,649
You must've been
completely drunk, right?

199
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:46,649
Yes.

200
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,220
It's all my fault.

201
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,019
I shouldn't have gotten so drunk.

202
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,090
Then Mi Jin wouldn't have died.

203
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,559
Let's be honest.

204
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,960
- Who drove?
- I told you. It's Mi Jin.

205
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,269
Then let me see your arm.

206
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,440
- What?
- Roll up your left sleeve.

207
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,940
Why?

208
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,740
What about my arm?
That has nothing to do with this.

209
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,779
Is he really hiding something?

210
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,159
The air bag was inflated.

211
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,230
Yes, it was.

212
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,529
The hand injury
from the air bag is...

213
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,360
only found on the arm of the person
who was behind the wheels.

214
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,799
You almost got me.

215
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,059
Mi Jin! Mi Jin!

216
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,929
Mi Jin!

217
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,639
Mi Jin, I'm sorry.
Mi Jin. I'm so sorry.

218
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,190
We can find out through
the autopsy,

219
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,519
so don't try to play any games.

220
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,299
One second.

221
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,669
- Suture thread.
- You already stitched her up.

222
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,870
Hey, you're still here?

223
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,539
I already went through two bodies.
I won. Admit to your defeat.

224
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,600
Yes, you won, so get out.

225
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,740
You're bothering me.

226
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,070
Don't worry.

227
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,740
I'm not blaming you
for taking it slowly but...

228
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,980
Aren't you busy?

229
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,409
No, I mean...

230
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,879
I heard that you've taken up
a car accident case for once,

231
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:35,649
so Chief Ma and I
decided to come over.

232
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,990
What are you doing?
Are you operating on her?

233
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,690
The funeral house will
take care of everything. Why are...

234
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,129
"A body after an autopsy must look
more humane than before."

235
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,500
Isn't that what you told me?

236
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,570
What?

237
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,740
Did I say something like that?

238
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,409
You're a great medical examiner.

239
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,679
Take your time.

240
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,340
- Your hands must hurt.
- Cut.

241
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,799
Cut.

242
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,649
The suspect of my first case was...

243
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,450
Baek Beom.

244
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:37,250
A car accident.

245
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:38,580
It was intentional.

I was on a business trip.

00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,039
I fell ill there...

252
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,500
and went to a local hospital.

253
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,070
When did the fever start?

- This morning.
- I see.

- Can I use the toilet first?

Sure, go ahead.

that arrived at 11am.

269

- Prosecutor Eun.

the Gimpo corpse came through.

I'm heading over first.

Doctor.

278
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,150
I think you should take this.

279
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,410
Who is it?

280
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,779
It's our director.

281
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,519
What is it?

282
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,759
We got the man's
immigration records.

283
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,059
He only stopped by Japan.

284
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,460
He first boarded in Qatar.

285
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,900
It could be MERS.

286
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:39,730
- What?
- The Disease Control...

287
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,130
wants confirmation.

288
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,970
Take photos.

289
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,839
Okay.

290
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,069
I'm really sorry.

291
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,640
I can't do this.

292
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,910
Soo Yeon, where are
you going? Don't leave.

293
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,210
You can't go out. Soo Yeon.

294
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,750
- Dr. Han.
- I got the emergency...

295
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,619
- What's wrong?
- Get out, and close the door.

296
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,819
- I brought the warrant.
- I said, get out.

297
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,960
It's an emergency.
That's why I brought it myself.

298
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,829
- What a temper.
- Now, you can't leave.

299
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,000
What's he saying?

300
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,779
From now on, no one can enter
or exit the autopsy room.

301
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:25,140
What?

302
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,579
It could be MERS.

303
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,269
I swabbed his nose cavity.

304
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:54,809
Send a hazmat team.

305
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,750
From now until Disease Control
gives us any instructions,

306
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,019
you are under quarantine.

307

The hospital Lee went to in Qatar...

308
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,059
was one of the MERS outposts.

309
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:15,660
He could've had contact with
a MERS patient?

310
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,059
It'll take 5 to 6 hours
to get the results.

311
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:22,529
I have to stay here for that long?

312
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,670
It's protocol.

313
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,339
(Protocol: an agreed process)

314
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,640
- Test this.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,980
Send the transporters and the driver
who brought the corpse...

316
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,720
to the hospital.

317
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,420
- There's a problem.
- Is everyone quarantined?

318
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,690
- Soo Yeon helped prep the body.
- Dr. Han?

319
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,559
- Where is she?
- I don't know where she is.

320
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,329
- What?
- She ran out after you called.

321
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,230
I can't reach her.

322
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,299
Security at the gate said
she hasn't left yet.

323
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,400
Don't just stand there. Find her!

324
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,440
Okay.

325
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,769
- What's going on?
- Director Park.

326
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,579
Prosecutor Eun.

327
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,609
What are you doing in there?
This place is quarantined!

328
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,549
I know.

329
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:12,480
This is really bad.
What should we do?

330
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,529
Director Park, is this place safe?

331
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,460
The air in there...

332
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:29,869
flows from the ceiling to the floor
to prevent contamination.

333
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:31,000
You'll be fine.

334
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,470
No, she won't.

335
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,440
If we're infected, it's game over,
so they're leaving us in here.

336
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,750
You have a way of
giving someone hope.

337
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:50,720
Put this on.

338
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,359
Are you trying to comfort me now?

339
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,029
You must wear that in here.

340
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,900
It's protocol.

341
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,150
Relax. Why are you so tense?

342
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,380
Who... Who said I'm tense?

343
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,589
I've never worn this before.

344
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,730
Chief Prosecutor No.

345
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,130
Sir, I have really bad news.

346
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,400
What's the matter?

347
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,700
Prosecutor Eun is in lock-down
in the autopsy room at the NFS.

348
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,710
- What?
- Lock-down?

349
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,309
- What do you mean?
- Well...

350
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,279
I'll explain.

351
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,309
Did you see the news earlier?

352
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:51,150
The dead man from Gimpo
might have MERS,

353
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:54,720
and she went over there
and made contact with the body.

354
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:58,819
Why would a prosecutor
come into contact with a corpse?

355
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,430
I have no idea.

356
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:03,160
I'll go over there.

357
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,369
Excuse me. Could...

358
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:20,710
Could you cover up
the corpse with something?

359
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:28,650
- What are you doing?
- An autopsy. What else?

360
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,720
What? Are you crazy?

361
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,390
- Why?
- An autopsy?

362
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,160
He has MERS.

363
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,130
- It's just a possibility.
- You can start once we get...

364
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,799
- the result.
- How long must I wait?

365
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,970
Blood gets everywhere
when you do an autopsy!

366
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,039
Won't that spread the disease?

367
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,369
- Are you writing a novel?
- What?

368
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,710
MERS is a respiratory disease.

369
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,880
Infection by blood
was never reported.

370
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,880
- Must you do that now?
- We have to find cause of death.

371
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,349
Wait, Dr. Baek.

372
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:03,220
I get that you want to
find out why he died,

373
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,289
but that's not the case for me.

374
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:06,690
I...

375
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,759
I'm...

376
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,599
I'm scared.

377
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,799
This isn't the time
to be fixated on a corpse.

378
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,069
It's not.

379
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:22,569
(Prosecutor Kang Hyun)

380
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,049
It's Prosecutor Kang Hyun.
Where is Prosecutor Eun?

381
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,849
- She's with me.
- You'd better watch out!

382
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,390
If something happens to her,
I'll make you pay.

383
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:42,490
Take it.

384
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,430
- What?
- Take the phone.

385
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,099
- What?
- Whose call...

386
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,369
- Hello, Hyun.
- Sol, are you okay?

387
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,980
Yes, I'm okay.

388
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,680
- How did you...
- Don't worry. This place...

389
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,309
- is safe.
- You're not safe.

390
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:04,150
That's the most dangerous place.

391
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,180
I'll be fine.

392
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,519
MERS has a 40-percent death rate.

393
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:11,890
I'm on my way,
so stay where you are.

394
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:17,130
Current time is 1:55pm.

395
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,859
I'll begin the autopsy.

396
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,630
- The scumbag.
- Wait.

397
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,599
Must you do it now?

398
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,099
This is my job. Who else will do it?

399
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,470
- But still...
- You said it's urgent.

400
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,740
Is it urgent if it's not MERS
and not urgent if it is?

401
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,450
But still...

402
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,720
- It won't change anything.
- What if it was a homicide?

403
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,349
- What?
- We're letting the killer get away.

404
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,259
- What if he had MERS?
- I don't know that.

405
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,230
That's why
I must perform the autopsy.

406
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,769
But I can't do it alone.

407
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,480
Then...

408
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,480
what do I need to do?

409
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,349
Why would she do that?

410
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,220
Do you know how to use that?

411
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,690
Just take photos.
It's not that hard.

412
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,859
The ladder is over there.

413
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,039
Put it over there.

414
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Take photos.

415
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,210
Okay.

416
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,579
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

417
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,250
What happened?

418
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:25,789
What is it?

419
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,359
I think I cut myself.

420
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,930
What? Blood? You're bleeding?

421
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,869
- Prosecutor Eun, are you all right?
- How did you get the cut?

422
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,900
If you got it from the used scalpel,
you'll be in great danger!

423
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,809
Darn it.

424
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,410
(Partners for Justice)

425
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,250
Something is wrong with me, right?

426
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,079
Is it possible that I caught MERS?

427
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,119
We don't have a solution
for the time being.

428
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,720
We can't rule out
the possibility of a homicide.

429
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,259
We're going to go find a poison
that might or might not even exist.

430
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,390
- Are you interested?
- What are you doing?

431
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,029
We must find out the cause of death.

432
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,029
- It might be.
- Don't you think this could be...

433
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,200
a serial case?

434
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,529
Something is off about this.

435
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,369
I bet the culprit is zeroing
on the next target.

436
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,599
Find out if this is MERS or a crime.
Please hurry.

437
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,769
Dr. Baek!
Dr. Baek. Wake up!
