1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,580
The investigator told me
a while ago...

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,849
that he was looking for a nurse
named Byun Soo Kyung.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,050
We were looking for her.

4
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:14,119
Byun Soo Kyung. She was
a nurse at Seon Hospital.

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:16,519
This person had the key
to the drug cabinet.

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,359
I know a few things about her.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,160
We... We have a match. We got it.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,800
What is this?

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,170
- Hello?
- Where is Prosecutor Eun right now?

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,409
Is this Dr. Baek from the NFS?

11
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,750
Seriously? Why is he asking
for her all of a sudden?

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,850
- Didn't Prosecutor Eun leave?
- She went to meet Ms. Choi Hwa Ja.

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,549
- Choi Hwa Ja? What for?
- Choi Hwa Ja?

14
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:51,259
Yes, but what is this regarding?

15
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,590
We found Choi Hwa Ja's prints
on the dead Byun Soo Kyung's blouse.

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,789
What? What did you say?

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,000
He wanted to make...

18
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,600
a real family with our child.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,740
(Psycho)

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,400
That was Deuk Nam's dream.

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,150
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,150
My gosh, look at this mess.

23
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,049
Where's the restroom?
I should wash this.

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,019
Okay. The restroom is that way.

25
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,260
- I I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,319
Yes, we're on our way to
Choi Hwa Ja's cafe. Okay.

27
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,090
Let's hurry.

28
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,740
(Benzodiazepine)

29
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,360
- Prosecutor Eun!
- Prosecutor Eun!

30
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,530
Prosecutor Eun!

31
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,099
Darn it.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
Hey, that's her handbag!

33
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,939
Hey, it's still warm.

34
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,110
Die.

35
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,620
Die.

36
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,229
Die.

37
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,370
Die. I just need you to disappear!

38
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,539
Die!

39
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,439
Die!

40
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,509
- Prosecutor Eun!
- What is it?

41
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,479
Prosecutor Eun! Grab her.

42
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,750
Prosecutor Eun, are you all right?
What just happened?

43
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,590
Hey, call 911. Call 911.

44
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,360
Ms. Choi Hwa Ja, you're
under arrest for assault.

45
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,090
You have the right to counsel.

46
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,759
Exercise your right to remain
silent, and come up with excuses.

47
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,399
If you feel wronged, go ahead, and
file for an unlawful arrest. Got it?

48
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,269
On your feet! Stand on your feet.

49
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,540
- Keep walking!
- She's so loud!

50
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,540
- Evidence...
- Okay.

51
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,819
(Episode 7)

52
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,459
Prosecutor Eun.

53
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,329
You're not supposed to
meet the suspects alone.

54
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,269
Besides, why didn't you answer
your phone?

55
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,470
If I did, she would've suspected me.

56
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,910
Then she would've hidden
her intention.

57
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,810
- Have you gone mad?
- Have you gone mad?

58
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,910
Pardon? Are you talking to me?

59
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,319
No, no. Not you.
I was talking about Choi Hwa Ja.

60
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,949
- Right, Dong Sik?
- Of course.

61
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,689
How dare she assault
a serving prosecutor?

62
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,060
- Mr. Kang.
- Yes?

63
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,800
Please request the NFS
for an expedited analysis.

64
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,500
Please drop me off at my office.

65
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,370
- Okay.
- Will you be okay in that state?

66
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,569
This is my job.
Don't worry about me.

67
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,490
Die. I just need you to disappear!

68
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,029
Die!

69
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,329
I'm all right.

70
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,759
It's something that you must do.

71
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,300
Let's push forward.

72
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,459
Prosecutor Eun,
I'll make a confession.

73
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,259
I'm an addict to
propofol, benzodiazepine,

74
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,230
sleeping pills, and tranquilizers.

75
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,399
I hid that because I thought
it may harm the investigation.

76
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,899
You do realize that
you were caught in the act, right?

77
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:15,370
For assaulting and attempting to
kill an incumbent prosecutor.

78
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,410
Isn't this enough...

79
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,050
to stop your heart
if it's injected into your heart?

80
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,079
Prosecutor Eun.

81
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,850
I'm mentally deranged.

82
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,259
I don't remember
what happened just before.

83
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,589
Is that propofol?

84
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,459
That's mine.

85
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,839
By the way, why would I hurt you?

86
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,870
Exactly. I wonder why
you did something that irrational.

87
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,480
What are your intentions?

88
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,779
I don't have any.

89
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,550
Come in.

90
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,019
- Yi Nam.
- They came out from the car...

91
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,959
that was parked next to your cafe
since the morning.

92
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,930
What's going on?

93
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,360
- Please speak.
- I'm sorry.

94
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,129
I've been tailing you.

95
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:16,370
You were suspicious of me,
so I got anxious...

96
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,370
because I didn't know
what you would do.

97
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,899
I paid Byun Soo Kyung...

98
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,680
to find out Deuk Nam's condition
in detail.

99
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,279
You knew that Ms. Jang had been
tailing me, didn't you?

100
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,220
You were going to kill me
where there were no cameras,

101
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,919
then blame the murder
on Ms. Jang, weren't you?

102
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,389

105
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:03,080
Why did you taint with my coffee?

106
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,120
- What?
- You added zolpidem...

107
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,789
in my coffee.

108
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,059
Did you think I had no idea?

- Choi Hwa Ja is the murderer.

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,389
- I found her fingerprints.
- What?

113
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,259
Yes, I got it.

114
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,500
What? Where are you?

115
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,129
I'll call you back.

- Well...
- Goodness.

119
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,360
Where's your restroom?
I need to wipe this off.

124
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,200
In Ms. Byun Soo Kyung's blouse
that she wore on the day she died,

125
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
your fingerprints were found.

126
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,509
Now, let's go back to the beginning.

127
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,840
You confessed that you're an addict.

128
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,009
Did you get propofol...

129
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,450
from Ms. Byun?

130
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,120
Yes.

131
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,549
- Once or twice a month.
- Then why did you kill her?

132
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:24,990
The rumor got too big about a search
and seizure of Seon Hospital.

133
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,690
I thought she might hear that
and ask me for more money.

134
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,190
Then what about Mr. Jang?

135
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,129
- What?
- You pushed him to the sofa...

136
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,730
and injected propofol.

137
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,870
Why? Did you two
get into a physical fight?

138
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,600
Why did you push him?
Did you two fight?

139
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:47,480
You're wrong.

140
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,649
It looks like you don't have...

141
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,820
any evidence on Deuk Nam's case.

142
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,019
- What?
- Like you said,

143
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,389
let's say that
I killed Byun Soo Kyung.

144
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,690
But I didn't kill...

145
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,529
Deuk Nam.

146
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,840
Bad news for the prosecutor
who was brought up like a princess.

147
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:14,970
Your scar...

148
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,240
will last a long time.

149
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,210
I'll find the evidence...

150
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,049
to your murder
of Mr. Jang very soon.

151
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,399
You had a fight with the suspect?

152
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,070
Yes.

153
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,200
Goodness, Prosecutor Eun.

154
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,370
How can I put this?
You're like a loose cannon.

155
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,639
You run to the National
Forensic Service when they call,

156
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,879
and you run over to the suspect
when they call too.

157
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,309
Do you think you're
a marathon runner?

158
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,220
I apologize.

159
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:00,850
I thought I could
take care of this by myself.

160
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,860
My trial just ended.

161
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,000
Take a look at
your junior prosecutor.

162
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,100
What is it?

163
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,110
- What happened?
- She had a fight with her suspect.

164
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,179
I thought I told you...

165
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,409
to take care of your junior,
didn't I?

166
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:28,480
I apologize.

167
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,279
Prosecutor Eun.

168
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,990
Are you not going to report to me
just because I'll be gone soon?

169
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,720
I'm sorry.
I didn't think it through.

170
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,690
- You liar.
- Pardon?

171
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,259
You think you've done well,
don't you?

172
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,090
You even found evidence.

173
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,429
- No, it's not that.
- That is...

174
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:47,929
pride.

175
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,570
I will have a talk with her.

176
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,940
You can leave this case.
I'll take care of it.

177
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,450
No, it was hard to get the evidence.
I'm almost there.

178
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,080
You got hurt!

179
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,789
You're right.

180
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,820
It was horrifying.

181
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,830
I thought I might die there.

182
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:19,000
But still, I don't want to give up.
That's cowardly.

183
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,330
This is your first year.

184
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,029
It's not a case
that you can wrap up.

185
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,600
It's all because of Baek Beom.

186
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,740
Hyun, I want to
take this to the end.

187
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,940
I can do it.
I don't want to let her go.

188
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,139
Don't you understand?

189
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,379
Baek Beom.

190
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:36,750
He did this on purpose!

191
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,320
You can't let go of the suspect.

192
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,350
Okay.

193
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,120
- Please.
- You may leave.

194
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,830
I do understand.

195
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,960
I understand better than anyone.

196
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,529
Then...

197
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,470
please let me do this.

198
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,309
- I'm home.
- Hey, you're home.

199
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,809
What's with your face?

200
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:12,080
Oh, I fell and got scraped.

201
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:23,700
I had a fight with a suspect.
It's nothing. I'm fine.

202
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,960
I was going to turn
a blind eye for a year,

203
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,669
but I can't let this go on.

204
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,870
Go to the office tomorrow,
and turn in her resignation.

205
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,210
Yes, honey. I'll do that.

206
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,779
I'm not going to resign.

207
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,480
How can you say that
when you look like that?

208
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,250
Look like what?
I'm very proud of myself.

209
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,549
I found key evidence
thanks to these wounds.

210
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:51,990
You probably caught a pickpocket
if anything.

211
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,590
No, I caught a murderer...

212
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,559
What? A murderer?

213
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,559
I mean...

214
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,500
There were police officers nearby...

215
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,200
Quit immediately.
I will not repeat myself.

216
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,009
Do you think my choices...

217
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,440
and my job is such a joke?

218
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,309
Don't be such a fool.

219
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:15,580
People like you won't
survive in an organization.

220
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,519
Quit and help your brother
in the company's legal team.

221
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,549
I...

222
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,049
I can't do anything right,
is that it?

223
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,289
When I came first in class as a kid,

224
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,259
you complained it was me,
not my brother.

225
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:30,059
- What got into you today? Stop it.
- Keep going.

226
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,000
You all bully me.

227
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:36,230
I thought that if I studied law,
passed the bar,

228
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,870
and accomplished something,
you'd acknowledge me.

229
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,539
What did you do?

230
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,139
Every privilege you've enjoyed.

231
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,940
You're nothing without that.

232
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,909
Then what?

233
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,080
Must I marry into
an appropriate family...

234
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,990
and exit elegantly
from this household?

235
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,649
I'm sorry,

236
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,019
but I can't do that.

237
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,889
I want to be a prosecutor,

238
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,090
and there are things I want to do.

239
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,599
Then get out of my house.

240
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,440
Okay.

241
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,269
- I will.
- Leave everything behind.

242
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,109
You can't do this.
Tell him you're sorry.

243
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,869
Bye.

244
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,289
I have nowhere to go.

245
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,670
Don't drag it on.

246
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,809
Prosecutors are boring
and hard to marry off.

247
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,180
People like you won't
survive in an organization.

248
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,849
Quit and help your brother
in the company's legal team.

249
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,490
Get out of my house.

250
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,710
What happened?

251
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,849
- Baek Beom speaking.
- It's been a while, Mr. Baek.

252
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:11,589
Or should I call you Dr. Baek?

253
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,829
- Who's this?
- Prosecutor Kang Hyun.

254
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:20,869
- So what?
- Prosecutor Eun.

255
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,269
I'll watch out for her.
You don't have to.

256
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,069
Okay, bye.

257
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,240
One more thing.

258
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,640
Prosecutor Eun just joined.

259
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,750
You seem to be using her eagerness.

260
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,349
Stop that.

261
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:37,150
If something were to happen,

262
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,579
will you take responsibility?

263
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,420
You'll just run away...

264
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,690
like you did 10 years ago.

265
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,490
Drop this case.

266
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,700
The National Forensic Service
has done its job.

267
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:02,809
We have a suspect.

268
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,440
Can I shred all this now?

269
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:06,710
Did you read it all?

270
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,680
Yes, I kind of did.

271
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,819
Did you read every single page?

272
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:13,819
Yes.

273
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,789
I don't think I read his physical
description and test results.

274
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,630
Didn't I tell you to read
every page of the medical files?

275
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:24,829
Hey, would you've ignored the files
if they were yours?

276
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,829
- Sorry, sir.
- Give them to me.

277
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,970
These?

278
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,039
(In-body checklist, height 174cm)

279
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,680
- Jang Deuk Nam was 174cm tall?
- Yes.

280
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,849
His femur was 46.19cm long.

281
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,519
What's this?

282
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,130
Estimated height is 171cm.

283
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,730
Yes. 3cm is within the error range.

284
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,069
You let it go when there's
as much as a 3cm difference?

285
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,740
Request for a 3D
facial reconstruction.

286
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,299
This case isn't over yet.

(Baek Beom, Han So Hee)

289
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,630
Yes, so I left my credit cards
and walked out.

290
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,200
There's no going back now.
Aren't I cool?

291
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,329
I have nothing but guts.
Call me Gutsy Sol now.

292
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,869
Whom could I say that to?

(Real Estate)

294
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,859
Hello. I'm looking for
a place to stay.

295
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,289
Take a seat.

296
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,190
A house? Where's the groom?

297
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,599
A studio apartment will do.
With a deposit of 10,000 dollars.

298
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:08,930
There's a small officetel nearby.

299
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,400
I'll take it.
Can I move in as soon as possible?

300
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,940
- You won't take a look?
- I'm sure it's nice.

301
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,009
I think this place is my fate.

302
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,079
Your fate?

303
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:21,950
Just a moment.

304
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,150
Hello, Eun Sol speaking.

305
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,359
What?

306
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,690
Facial reconstruction?

307
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,900
We create a model of the face
from the bone structure.

308
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,329
That's fascinating.

309
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:41,269
Compose Bach's face was
the first ever to be reconstructed.

310
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:43,400
Why are we doing
Jang Deuk Nam's face?

311
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,299
We thought the case was over
when we got the suspect,

312
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,910
but he said something was off so...

313
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,710
He must feel responsible
because he dug up the body.

314
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,880
Responsible?

315
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,450
He doesn't do that.

316
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:58,279
It's a sickness. Why do you think
we call him a necrophiliac?

317
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,490
I thought he was a hard worker.

318
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,150
He doesn't care for
anything but autopsies.

319
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,819
He's actually really lazy.

320
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,430
He sleeps in his office because
he can't bother to go home.

321
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,960
- He wraps his bag...
- Why are you so excited?

322
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,099
What are the scuff marks
and abrasions on your forehead...

323
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,569
and marks on your neck that seem
to be made by pressure from a hand.

324
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:20,740
Turn around.

325
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:25,210
Don't autopsy me. I'm still alive.

326
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,339
Did I say you're dead?

327
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,450
Gosh...

328
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,990
It's okay.
I don't think he heard you.

329
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,450
No, it's okay.

330
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,559
You shouldn't have asked.

331
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,890
This is the face reconstructed
based on the skull of...

332
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,700
the body you dug up.

333
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,730
And this is...

334
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,069
the 2D image that I extracted.

335
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,339
It's different.

336
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,380
Why is it so different?

337
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,250
Did he get plastic surgery?
Was there an error?

338
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,720
- Do corpses age?
- Don't write a novel.

339
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,559
It's so strange.
It can't be different.

340
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,730
It can be if it's
a different person.

341
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,099
What?

342
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,829
Then the body doesn't
belong to Jang Deuk Nam?

343
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:23,269
We need to find out.

344
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,519
I've never dug the same grave twice.

345
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,420
- See the soil has different colors?
- Yes.

346
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,490
- Bag them separately. Thoroughly.
- Okay.

347
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,799
- Get this batch first.
- Okay.

348
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,900
- Got it.
- That's it.

349
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,900
- Be thorough.
- Okay.

350
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:58,700
It's important soil.

351
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,059
Every forest, rock, and pebble
have their own DNA.

352
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:28,529
No human has the same fingerprint,
and that goes for soil too.

353
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:30,740
This was from the burial site.

354
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,210
This was from the corpse's
skin and bones.

355
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,779
The ratio of heavy hydrogen is high
in one and very low in another.

356
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,980
Can you explain it
so I can understand?

357
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:46,720
We got the body from
Yeoncheon in Gyeonggi Province,

358
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,490
but the soil from the bones
is from the sea.

359
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:52,859
Jang Deuk Nam's body
was swapped?

360
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,930
Then where's the real Jang Deuk Nam?

361
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,259
- That's the wrong question.
- What should I ask then?

362
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,059
The body I autopsied.

363
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,099
Who was he?

364
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:04,400
How would I know that?

365
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,519
There were two men
who had died to begin with.

366
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,319
One would be Jang Deuk Nam.
The other would be someone else.

367
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,029
Who is this man?

368
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,230
Should I answer that?

369
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,299
He's your child's biological father.

370
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:37,099
Because the DNA must match
for you to get the inheritance.

371
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,809
You little witch.
I'm going to... Look at you.

372
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,190
It won't take long to find out
if any of your acquaintances...

373
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,920
had gone missing.

374
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,460
Did you bury him in the mountains
and dig him up again later?

375
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,269
He won't show up in the database
for missing persons.

376
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,109
He didn't go missing.

377
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,579
- What?
- What?

378
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,450
I'm sure there was a proper funeral.

379
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,380
There was a depressed fracture
on his skull.

380
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,920
It would've been declared
as an accidental death.

381
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,150
How did you find that out?

382
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,089
When I fed Choi Hwa Ja false
information, she seemed relieved.

383
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,859
All right.
The baby is 12 months old.

384
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,160
She was impregnated
around September in 2016.

385
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,099
She didn't need
the baby's father anymore.

386
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,829
She must've hurried to bury him...

387
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:42,869
so that the corpse would be
decomposed like Jang Deuk Nam's.

388
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,099
- You're right.
- Two bodies were buried.

389
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,309
She probably switched those
two bodies before burying them.

390
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:50,210
Please find me
the funeral service agency.

391
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:54,109
Hi, I'm calling from Seoul Eastern
District Prosecutor's Office.

392
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:56,720
It's from September
to October in 2016.

393
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,380
- Have you buried switched bodies?
- Yes, yes.

394
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,650
One of them was in Yeoncheon, and
the other one was near the coast.

395
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,220
All right. I have
more funeral service agencies.

396
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,390
Okay. I got it.

397
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,829
- Are you busy? I'm busy too.
- I'm busy too.

398
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,200
Make your voice useful.

399
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,470
- What? What's going on?
- My goodness.

400
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,069
Just like you're setting up a date,
be nice and precise.

401
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,309
You can't let them go.

402
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:25,640
Go along.

403
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,710
What? This is...

404
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:30,980
This is good.

405
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,150
My gosh, my throat feels sore.
My bronchial tubes...

406
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,059
are quite weak.

407
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:41,730
I called so many people,
so they are completely ruined.

408
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,059
How many calls did you make?

409
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:46,029
Didn't you call 1 agency
when we were done with 3?

410
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:48,200
No, I called many of them.
What do you have against me?

411
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,170
Is that so? Let's eat.

412
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,140
You have two phones?
Do you have two jobs?

413
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,180
No.

414
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,140
It's not that.

415
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,680
This one is for work,
and this is for my personal life.

416
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,980
Having separate phones
is more convenient.

417
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,319
No, that's for his ladies.
He meets so many of them.

418
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,319
If you keep it up,
you'll pay dearly for that.

419
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,460
What are you talking about?

420
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,190
- Tell you what.
- This is good.

421
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,960
"Women belong to the sky."
Three men at this table...

422
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,400
- What?
- What?

423
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,930
I meant to say, "Men and a woman".

424
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,099
- My gosh.
- That's my family custom.

425
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:28,240
Anyway, that's why I pay
special attention to women.

426
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,440
By the way, why do you have
so many skies then?

427
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:35,880
Why not?
The sky takes up half of our world.

428
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,980
You'd be dead on the spot when
you get struck by lightning.

429
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:41,319
You might end up
on Baek Beom's autopsy table.

430
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:44,259
Stop it. Don't even joke about that.
Don't even.

431
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,460
- My gosh.
- Isn't it good?

432
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,990
- This is delicious.
- Right.

433
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,460
Hello? Yes.

434
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,730
Yes, yes.

435
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,569
- Okay, I got it. Hey.
- What?

436
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,769
- Call Prosecutor Eun right now.
- What is it?

437
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:00,369
- Why?
- We found the funeral agency.

438
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:02,339
- Let's go now.
- I still have a lot left.

439
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:03,539

440

- What?
- Pay for the meal.

441
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,950
- Am I paying again?
- Thank you for the meal.

442
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,809
- Hey, look.
- Thank you for the treat.

443
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:09,809

(Moving and Opening Burial Site)

445
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:15,119
Has it been about two years?
A young woman visited me.

446
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,019
She told me that
she had two dead husbands.

447
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:18,920
She told me that
she was about to die...

448
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,789
because they were buried
in wrong sites.

449
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,660
- Why?
- Why do you think?

450
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,259
I'm pretty sure
she picked the wrong fortune-teller.

451
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,829
Well, she told me that
she'd pay handsomely for that,

452
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:29,970
so I switched the bodies.

453
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,799
One was buried
in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province.

454
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,410
Do you remember
where the other body was buried?

Well... Hold on.

Please find out where the body
was buried. My goodness.

458
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,599
- Stop it.
- Here it is.

- Stop digging.

Go down there.
Start digging, please.

00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,609
Hey, when will you finish
if you assemble it one by one?

482
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,210
- Let him be. This is how he works.
- Is that so?

483
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,119
You mean how slow he is?

484
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,549
If the cause of death is clear,
I can finish within 30 minutes.

485
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:31,920
- Is that what you want?
- Have you gone mad?

486
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,660
Since you're making it,
make a good one.

487
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:48,009
I didn't know you could focus
on something else than autopsies.

488
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,210
Tomorrow...

489
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,079
is Choi Hwa Ja's final trial.

490
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
So what?

491
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:02,920
You must be happy. Your job ends
once you submit your conclusions.

492
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,259
It's not over yet.

493
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,329
There's a song named "Billie Jean"
by Michael Jackson.

494
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:13,430
- "Billie Jean is not my lover"
- "But the kid is not my son"

495
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,140
Did you get the result?

496
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,769
(Court)

497
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:21,809
Defendant.

498
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,380
You told me that...

499
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,950
you wanted your child
to have a father.

500
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,150
You were living with Han Dong Hoon.

501
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,619
And you were married
to Jang Deuk Nam.

502
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:36,589
We collected the DNAs
from these two victims...

503
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,490
and ran a paternity test.

504
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:48,970
Your child is...

505
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:51,839
not Han Dong Hoon's.

506
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,809
It's Jang Deuk Nam's.

507
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:00,849
- The IVF treatment worked?
- He's Deuk Nam's son?

508
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:03,079
Then what about the man
she had an affair with?

509
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,279
(Judge's Seat)

510
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,820
The frozen sperm treatment
which has a very low success rate...

511
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,289
worked.

512
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,429
(DNA Test Results)

513
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,489
(It's 99.8 percent positive the DNA
matches Subject 1's DNA.)

514
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,260
I gave birth to Deuk Nam's baby.

515
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:22,730
I gave birth to Deuk Nam's baby.
