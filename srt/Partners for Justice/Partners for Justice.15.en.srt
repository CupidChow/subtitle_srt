1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,009
You killed him!

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,810
You're Yong's younger brother?

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,419
Cause of death.

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,349
Suffocation due to respiratory
muscle paralysis caused by...

5
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:16,690
a sodium pentothal and
succinylcholine injection.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,719
Classification of death, suicide.

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,559
Those are the facts he left behind.

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,390
You always manage
to escape like this.

9
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,059
But you know what?

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,960
That's all over now.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,600
I'm going to expose you...

12
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:29,269
as a hypocrite that you are...

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,039
and of your lies.

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,869
I'm almost there.

15
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,810
Look forward to it.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,009
When we meet again,

17
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,979
we'll meet somewhere
a bit more interesting.

(Medical Specialist Kang Yong)

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,510
Yong.

21
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,150
Beom.

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,290
- What's going on?
- Slight fever of 37.8°C.

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,090
I vomited in the morning of nausea.

24
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,290
The pain is currently in
the right, lower abdomen.

25
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,230
There's an oppressive pain
at McBurney's point.

26
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,829
It looks like Rovsing's sign.

27
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,670
- Do you have appendicitis?
- My muscles aren't stiff yet.

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,299
It hasn't become peritonitis yet.

29
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,340
Can you take care of this?
You're the only one that I can ask.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,870
You should've told me earlier.
What kept you so long...

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,340
And put me on sacral anesthesia.

(Sacral anesthesia:

33

Why are you so late?

34
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,689
I'm sorry.
My rounds ended a bit late.

35
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:59,120
This is an emergency operation.
It's okay to be a bit late.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,159
Patient, please be quiet.

37
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,189
If not, I'll put you
on some sedatives.

38
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,400
Okay, fine.

39
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,959
Goodness.

40

Ms. Han.

42
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,879
Can you turn the light
a little to my right?

43
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,949
That's good.

44
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,520
- What are you doing?
- I want to look too.

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,219
Don't you trust me?

46
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,629
- I thought I was your best friend.
- It's not that I don't trust you.

47
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,530
I want to see
what my insides look like.

48
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,129
Let us begin.

49
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,439
Mosquito forceps.

50
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,409
You need to open it farther
to go in at ease.

51
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,449
Yes, more.

52
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,050
That's good.

53
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,289
If we spread it farther,

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,860
it won't heal as quickly.

55
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,090
You need to put it in gently now.

56
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,590
Be careful. Yes.

57
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,900
Come on. Try to be gentle.

58
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,770
This is mine, come on.

59
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,259
Hey, Yong.

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,030
What have you done to me?

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,030
I put you on a sedative.

62
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,560
You can stay relaxed now.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,000
It'll be over in no time.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,699
Gosh, man.

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,639
- Hey, Yong.
- Yes?

66
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,169
I have a confession to make.

67
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:56,939
What is it?

68
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,780
I'm dating Ms. Han.

69
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,250
The best...

70
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,219
The best operating room nurse
of Seon Hospital.

71

You'll congratulate me, won't you?

72
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,800
I wanted you to be
the first one to know.

73
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,069
On this historical day...

74
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,839
when someone takes away my appendix.

75

76
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,490
Don't be sorry.

78

It's just two people in love.

79
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,230
So Hee, don't you think...

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,899
even my appendix is pretty handsome?

Write down that
his fly was unzipped.

Fly unzipped.

90

Pin point pupil.

and scratching them.

"Many traces of boils
and scratching them".

96
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,930
That's odd.

98

Come in.

99
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,730
He was lying on the flower bed
of an apartment in Songpa-gu.

100
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,500
A guard who was on patrol found him
and reported him around 9pm.

101
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,839
He was already dead
when he was found.

102
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,339
Then did he drop to his death?

103
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,370
Well, yes.

104
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,209
But it's pretty odd.

105
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,310
He has barely any wounds...

106
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,079
for him to have fallen to his death.

107
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,449
Take a look.

108
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,319
Here.

109
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,050
There's no blood around him.

110
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,490
It's just his head that cracked.
Why is that?

111
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,060
Did you identify him?

112
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,430
We put him through AFIS,
but we can't find him.

113
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,800
He's not even 20 yet.

114
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,209
- Call Doctor Hong.
- Yes.

115

Swab.

116
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,259
His teeth are that of a teenager.

117
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,860
He's probably around 15.

118
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,100
He's probably not registered
as an adult yet.

119
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,139
Then we'll have to check
his identity with his DNA.

120
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,139
Here's the sample.

121
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,110

(DNA Analysis Report)

123
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,259
Yes, I just received
the DNA Analysis Report.

124
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,960
Are you sure this is correct?

125
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,360
Could you double-check?

126
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,299
Yes. He seems like a minor,

127
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,830
so go through the security footages
of the apartment's elevators...

128
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,269
and doors to find his traces.

129
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,370
Yes. He's about 15 years old.

130
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,539
So find people his...

131
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,980
Yes, get moving.

132
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,179
What's going on?

133
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,450
It's this one.

134
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,919
And this too.

135
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,289
- Okay.
- Is that good?

136
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,960
Sausage corn dogs are
the true super stars.

137
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,159
- Are you talking about Botox?
- Exactly.

138
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,529
What's going on?
What about Botox?

139
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,830
Stella, you look great
without any Botox. Don't get that.

140
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,970
It's not that. It's the story
of sausage corn dog and Botox.

141
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,840
Sausage corn dog?

142
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,809
Why? Did someone get
food poisoning from that?

143
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,080
Stella, are you okay?

144
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,379
Oh, my. That's not the point.

145
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,509
What?

146
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,250
Back in 19th century,
a doctor named Kerner...

147
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,580
found poisonous toxin
in spoiled sausages.

148
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,389
And it had a side effect
of numbing one's muscles.

149
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,960
Thanks to that side effect,
Botox was created.

150
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,690
It even numbed the muscles
that creates wrinkles.

151
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,759
Fantastic.

152
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,700
Please run that by quickly.
I have to go back.

153
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,730
Okay, bye.

154
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,600
Hey, Stella.

155
00:09:58,539 --> 00:09:59,840
What was that?

156
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,809
What's going on between them?

157
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,509
Director Park.

158
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:09,409
We had an unidentified body,
so we ran a DNA analysis.

159
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,279
And the result was...

160
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,419
a little odd.

161
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,450
Why?

162
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,360
He's a match with an employee
of National Forensic Service.

163
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,629
- It wasn't a cross-contamination?
- No, it's a single sample.

164
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,570
Who showed up?

165
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,529
We'll begin.

166
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:30,970
Scalpel.

167
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:38,740
Stop.

168
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,480
What's wrong?

169
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,820
This kid.

170
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,460
You have good news?

171
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:56,289
My son came first in his year.

172
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:57,700
At a school...

173
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,759
for gifted children.

174
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,100
Have a look.

175
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,370
My son has spots on his neck
that look like the Big Dipper.

176
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,269
Geniuses have this marking.

177
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,809
He's grown up since I last saw him.

178
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,710
It's in his blood.

179
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,710
You tried for seven years
to have a kid.

180
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,820
He went from 1st straight to
3rd grade in high school.

181
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,250
- Among gifted children.
- That's incredible.

182
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,559
Who is he?

183
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,990
This boy is...

184
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,230
Ma Do Nam's son.

185
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,149
(Wife)

186
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,889
Sir, your phone keeps ringing.

187
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,090
Who's calling
so early in the morning?

188
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,460
- It's your wife.
- Darn it.

189
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,259
- It's ringing again.
- She knows mornings are hectic.

190
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,429
Hold this.

191
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,710
- What?
- It's Sung Jae.

192
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,340
He didn't return to the dorm.

193
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,139
What do you mean?

194
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,610
He got a pass to leave
the school yesterday...

195
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,720
and didn't return this morning.

196
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,120
He said it was to go home.

197
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,549
- He didn't come home.
- Exactly.

198
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,389
- His phone is turned off.
- Wait. I'll come over.

199
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,830
(Autopsy Room)

200
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,929
- Dr. Ma.
- Hello, sir.

201
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:39,059
I need to leave for a while.

202
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,470
My son missed class
and can't be reached.

203
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,169
I finished one autopsy.

204
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:45,940
Dr. Choi will do the rest.
Excuse me.

205
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,340
Could you...

206
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,179
spare some time?

207
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:56,409
Listen carefully to what I say.

208
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,750
Director, I have to go. Sung Jae...

209
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,049
This morning,

210
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,320
a body came in.

211
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,730
Dr. Baek started the autopsy.

212
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,230
Okay, but is it urgent?

213
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,070
Sir, I'll listen as I drive.

214
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,740
- What is it?
- A John Doe.

215
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:19,200
He came in this morning.

216
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,570
He has...

217
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,840
spots on his neck.

218
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,480
Like the Big Dipper.

219
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,850
- What?
- They ran his DNA.

220
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,620
It's a 99-percent match with you.

221
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,919
What?

222
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,759
What did you just say?

223
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:42,629
Ma Sung Jae...

224
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,200
has passed away.

225
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,669
You can't speak such nonsense!

226
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,470
I was just about to leave
to look for him!

227
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,419
(Wife)

228
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,389
Hello?

229
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,919
Honey. What's wrong?

230
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,759
Our Sung Jae...

231
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,730
What about him?

232
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,970
Yesterday, he...

233
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,799
What's going on?
Talk to me properly! Speak!

234
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,639
There was an accident.

235
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,580
Sung Jae!

236
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,590
Sung Jae! Sung Jae!

237
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,990
Lock the door.

238
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,889
Open the door!

239
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,429
Open this door! Let me in!

240
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,899
I'm sorry.

241
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,370
You evil jerk! Open the door!

242
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,100
- Hey!
- Lock the viewing room door.

243
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,110
- Close the blinds.
- You jerk!

244
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,409
Open the door! Hey!

245
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:03,809
Let me in!

246
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,009
Come back.

247
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,379
Cover the body.

248
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,879
Hey!

249
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,220
Let me just look. Please let me in!

250
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,919
Sung Jae! Sung Jae.

251
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,860
- Dr. Ma.
- Open the door!

252
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,860
Dr. Ma. You know very well that...

253
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:25,299
the bereaved cannot view an autopsy.

254
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,870
Sir, there's a mistake.
It's not my Sung Jae.

255
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,840
I'll just check.

256
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,909
I need to take a look.

257
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:38,340
It's not my son, sir...

258
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,679
Sung Jae! Sung Jae...

259
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:43,879
They ran his DNA three times.

260
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:51,789
Don't touch my son's body!

261
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,659
Leave him alone!

262
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,730
How dare you?

263
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,700
That's enough.

264
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,769
Will you...

265
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,570
let us take care of him?

266
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:08,570
Don't you touch my son.

267
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,840
Sung Jae...

268
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,549
Sung Jae. Sung Jae.

269
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,990
It's not my Sung Jae.

270
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,659
How could this happen?

271
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,320
This is just wrong.

272
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,629
My heart aches.

273
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:29,830
Sung Jae.

274
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,669
Sung Jae...

275
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,340
Let me in.

276
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,309
This is unfair.

277
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:44,110
Sung Jae...

278
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,250
Sung Jae...

279
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,860
Let me just see his face.

280
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:16,240
(Ma Sung Jae, male, in autopsy)

281
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,450
Why...

282
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,750
Why is Sung Jae here? Why?

283
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,690
Honey.

284
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,559
Honey. Darling.

285
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,059
It's not him, is it?

286
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,859
Isn't it someone with the same name?

287
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:43,900
Honey, it's not him, right?

288
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,240
- I need to find Sung Jae.
- Honey.

289
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,210
Honey, honey, calm down.

290
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:52,839
Honey...

291
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,880
Our Sung Jae...
I feel so sorry for him.

292
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,390
Our baby...

293
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,059
What should we do without him?

294
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,200
Honey. Honey!

295
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,299
Do Hee. Wake up, Do Hee. Do Hee.

296
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,500
Run a 3D reconstruction.

297
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,670
Okay.

298
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,039
It's up.

299
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,619
How could this be?

300
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,549
There are numerous fractures.

301
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,690
Multiple rib fractures.

302
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,759
"Multiple rib fractures".

303
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:19,859
Shoulder blade fracture.

00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:21,670
"Shoulder blade fracture".

305
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,000
Spine fracture and...

306
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:27,509
- dislocation.
- "Spine fracture and dislocation".

307
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,549
Humerus and radius fracture.

308
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,079

- Stomach empty.

- Leftover food found in duodenum.
- "Leftover food found in duodenum".

323
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,109
He fell.

324
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:44,250
But he looked fine.
He didn't bleed either.

325
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,019
I think when he hit the ground,
he died that instant.

326
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,390
The heart must beat
for the body to bleed.

327
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,670
"People are like flowers.
Be gentle."

328

Cut.

329
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,200
Define a fall.

330
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,029
It refers to a phenomenon
where a body is destroyed...

331
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:16,230
and the heart stops beating as it
hits the ground with great force.

332
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,869
Relationship of the fall
and the damage.

333
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,109
The degree of damage depends on...

334
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,309
one's posture,
the height of the fall,

335
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,640
characteristics of the ground,
and existence of obstacles.

336
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,910
Conclusion on accidentality.

337
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,920
We must know if he was dead
or alive when he fell.

338
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,990
- And?
- If he was alive when he fell,

339
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,990
we must ask if it was intentional
or if he was pushed.

340
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,720
Hold on.

341
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,690
The damage seemed very serious.

342
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,660
Don't you think
someone might've pushed him?

343
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,529
This is fishy. Something is off.

344
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,569
Death is the only certain outcome
from the fall.

345
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:50,940
Every case differs on
how it happened.

346
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,339
Don't believe everything you see.

347
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:55,009
Then what's your opinion?

348
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,839
- Let's go.
- Go where?

349
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,880
The scene of the incident.

350
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,740
Get ready.

351
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,450
This is usually locked,

352
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,190
but the kids from this neighborhood
break in at times.

353
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,400
Let's go.

354
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,200
This is it.

355
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,579
There it is. It's over there.

356
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:56,029
- Dong Sik.
- Yes?

357
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:58,240
Don't the footprints mean
that this is a suicide?

358
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,440
But the weird thing is,

359
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,240
how could the top of his head
hit the ground first?

360
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,710
If he jumped,

361
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,849
shouldn't his face hit
the ground first?

362
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
(Direction of the fall)

363
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,019
(Place of serious damage)

364
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,890
(Classification of death, suicide)

365
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,930
You're right.

366
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,329
But look. This looks odd.

367
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:31,599
You're right. If he fell like that,

368
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,910
it does make sense
that he fell backward.

369
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,579
- Could someone have pushed him?
- Right.

370
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,019
(Posture when he fell)

371
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,049
(Place of damage, back of the head)

372
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,119
(Classification of death, homicide)

373
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,619
(Estimated location of the fall, 3m)

374
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,559
Then are you saying
this is a homicide?

375
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:07,140
Dr. Baek, Dr. Ma is probably
waiting for the initial report.

376
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:10,440
- Don't submit anything for now.
- Dr. Baek.

377
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,980
But you should tell us your opinion
for us to start the investigation.

378
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,180
Looking at the footprints,
it seems like a suicide,

379
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,220
but looking at his head,
it seems like a homicide.

380
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,890
- Don't write a novel.
- Pardon?

381
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,890
Let's go down.

382
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,460
- Dr. Baek.
- Wait. Hold on.

383
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,519
Dr. Baek.

384
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,789
- I heard it was the fourth floor.
- Did you hear anything? A thump?

385
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:33,160
- My goodness.
- Did you hear kids chatting?

386
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,230
- What's this?
- I can't believe it.

387
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,430
From the wall
to the point of the fall,

388
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,670
it's exactly 4.95m.

389
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:40,140
That's too far.

390
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:43,339
What does the distance tell us?

391
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:44,740
The body usually falls...

392
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,309
within 2m from the wall
when it's an accidental fall.

393
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,049
If there was an external force,
it's about 3m.

394
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,750
Then isn't 5m too far from the wall?

395
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,359
That's what I just said.
I said that was too far.

396
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,170
There wasn't a single time...

397
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,369
when he wasn't
at the top of his class.

398
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:19,509
Did he feel pressured or stressed
regarding getting good grades?

399
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,680
He said he wanted to be
a doctor just like his dad.

400
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,549
He was self-motivated to study hard.

401
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,650
My gosh.

402
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:33,529
16 is still a young age.

403
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,529
Was he stressed out about
the college entrance exam?

404
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,099
My son...

405
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,430
had no problems.

406
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,740
He was kind and obedient.

407
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,980
Look at this.

408
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:54,480
He'd text me often from the dorm.

409
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,150
That's not an easy thing to do.

410
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,950
Mom, I'm doing well.

411
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,450
I had tteokbokki
with my friends today.

412
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,049
I really like my teachers too.

413
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:08,890
I must've bragged too much that...

414
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,359
I had a smart and perfect son.

415
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:13,900
The universe was jealous.

416
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:20,640
And that's why they took him
away from me.

417
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:39,759
Sung Jae...

418
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,890
wasn't the type to commit suicide.

419
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,759
He wouldn't leave this world...

420
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,930
and leave his parents behind.

421
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,500
You'd know if you met him.

422
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,140
Ma'am.

423
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,539
Please find the person who's
responsible for his death.

424
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,150
Please find that person.
My son didn't commit suicide.

425
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,609
My son... Sung Jae.

426
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:05,119
Please find the person responsible,
so he won't feel wronged.

427
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,319
Please I'm begging you.
Please find that person.

428
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,559
Please, I ask of you.

429
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:27,910
Are you Park Jun Ha?

430
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,609
Didn't you share a room
with Ma Sung Jae?

431
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,480
Over there.

432
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,180
The product of p and s...

433
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:55,599
The height of this is x.
I'll square that number...

434
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,539
The square of x is... The value...

435
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,039
The sum of x and y is z.

436
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,779
Your roommate died.

437
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,119
- Don't you feel sad at all?
- It's the exam week.

438
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,319
We aren't human.
We're just test-takers.

439
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,089
Hey. But he was your friend.

440
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,160
You're distracting me.

441
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:20,930
Can you leave?

442
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,650
We're here.

443
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,460
We're at your school.

444
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:03,769
Wait. What?

445
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,609
Wait, why are you stopping us?

446
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:09,769
What are you doing?

447
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,109
Unauthorized cars are
not allowed in during class.

448
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:15,650
- What?
- It's an order from the principal.

449
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,779
It will disturb the students.

450
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,480
My son is a student here too!

451
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,589
What kind of disturbance
do you think we're going to cause?

452
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,220
I mean, there are rumors and stuff.
Please leave.

453
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,190
Rumors? Rumors?

454
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,559
Is that so important?
My son is dead!

455
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,029
If you keep doing this,
we'll report you to the police.

456
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,200
My son, Sung Jae,

457
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,430
studied here all day long
and lived here!

458
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:39,670
And you aren't even going to
let him say goodbye?

459
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,769
What kind of manners is this?

460
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:43,809
Open this gate. Open it.

461
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:45,240
- Open it!
- Please leave.

462
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,150
Open the gate, you jerks!

463
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,220
How do you call yourselves human?
Let go of me.

464
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,480
Open the gate.

465
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,549
- Open the gate.
- Please leave.

466
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:57,819
- I can't.
- Open the gate.

467
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:59,359
Sung Jae.

468
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,890
Sung Jae has to say goodbye.

469
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,529
Sung Jae. Open this gate.

470
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:13,299
Open this gate.

471
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,359
He wasn't alone,
so it took me a while to find him.

472
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,230
He was with his friends.

473
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:42,130
That's Park Jun Ha, his roommate,
his classmate, Ahn Jae Hoon,

474
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,599
Cha Dong Soo,
and Kim Kang Doo. Right?

475
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,740
You're right.

476
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,910
And take a look at
the footage from the elevator.

477
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,380
This is hard to look at.

478
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,710
- What's going on?
- Oh my.

479
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,210
He was taken against his will.

480
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,019
This is that kid who was
his roommate, isn't he?

481
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,880
Do they think they are thugs?

482
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,049
The four of them are
bullying that poor kid.

483
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,220
We have the answer right here.
It was school violence.

484
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,759
It was obviously a murder.
