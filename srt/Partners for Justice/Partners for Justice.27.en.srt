1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,770
Seal her hands and feet,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,480
and transfer her to the NFS.

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,440
Wait, excuse me.

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,050
I don't think you should
untie the knot carelessly.

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,179
Sorry?

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,019
- Who are you?
- He's...

7
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,119
Prosecutor Do Ji Han. He just
transferred to the Eastern District.

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,960
Prosecutor Do, I took the photos.

9
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:21,089
If we don't untie them, it's hard
for us to transfer the body.

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,760
- Won't that destroy the evidence?
- Then why don't you move the body?

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,600
Just as it is. All the way
to the bottom of the mountain.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,179
Gosh, you're really bad-tempered.

13
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,820
I got it.
Sure, let's untie the knots.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,149
But film the process of untying
the knots, and keep it for evidence.

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,920
Okay?

16
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,320
- Record the video.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,870
What is it? Did you find something?

18
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,650
- She doesn't have any fingerprints.
- What?

19
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,500
This is Prosecutor Do Ji Han from
Seoul Eastern District speaking.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,840
I guess you do know that you were
transferred to the eastern district.

21
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,670
- Who is this?
- It's Chief Prosecutor No Han Sin.

22
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,069
Aren't you coming in today?

23
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,739
My gosh, hello, sir.

24
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,549
A body was found on a hill.
I went to the crime scene first.

25
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,120
- I'll go after the autopsy.
- Deputy Chief Prosecutor Do.

26
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,549
It's your first day. Shouldn't you
visit the Prosecutor General first?

27
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,489
The field is the most important
place for prosecutors to visit.

28
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:58,659
I'll visit him later when I have
time. He'll understand, right?

29
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,290
- Bye.
- What do you mean he'll understand?

30
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,030
What? He already hung up on me?

31
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,870
All right. Let's see.

32
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,469
What's up with his nose?

33
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,819
All right. She's a Jane Doe.

34
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,020
A hiker discovered the body
and called it in this morning.

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,349
As you can see,
we found her stuff, but not her ID.

36
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,360
Her fingerprints are all destroyed,
so we're running her DNA.

37
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,830
Current time, 10:51am.

38
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,500
I'll begin the autopsy.

39
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,210
- Anemic condition.
- "Anemic condition".

40
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,110
(It refers to the anemic condition
after the blood is drained out.)

41
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,550
Teeth marks on the left side
of her neck.

42
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,180
"Teeth marks on the left side
of her neck".

43
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,520
(Teeth marks: marks caused by bites)

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,050
- Let's copy the marks.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,909
Stab wound on the left side
of the collarbone.

46
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,840
"Stab wound on the left side
of the collarbone".

47
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,110
(A wound caused by stabbing)

48
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,560
- The depth is 15.7cm.
- "The depth is 15.7cm."

49
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,289
- The length is 3.4cm.
- "The length is 3.4cm."

50
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,960
- The width is 0.7cm.
- "The width is 0.7cm."

51
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,060
This is odd.

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,069
- The wound shape looks strange.
- Make sure you take photos.

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,310
Both arms have ligature marks.

54
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,210
Bleeding during the incident.

55
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:09,689
The fingertips were carved out.
The fingerprints are destroyed.

56
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,689
"The fingertips were carved out.
The fingerprints are destroyed."

57
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,560
Do you think the killer did so
to conceal her identity?

58
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,100
Yes, if not, the killer wouldn't
have gone this far.

59
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,069
She was skinned in various parts
of her body. Abrasions.

60
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,410
"She was skinned in various parts
of her body. Abrasions."

61
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,040
Vulva has been torn and bled.

62
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,079
Traces of sexual assault.

63
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,550
"Vulva has been torn and bled.
Traces of sexual assault."

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,790
Then are you saying
that she was raped too?

65
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,050
We think so.

66
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,689
- Swab the inside of her vagina.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:55,329
The subclavian artery was cut.
The heart was punctured.

68
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,069
Her heart was stabbed too, right?

69
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,569
At one go.

70
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,060
I found food in her stomach.
It wasn't digested yet.

71
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,889
Does that mean she was murdered
right after her meal?

72
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,300
Before she was murdered,
her body was extremely stressed.

73
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,529
In that case,
the digestive system stops working.

74
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,079
The cause of death. Cut subclavian
artery and punctured heart.

75
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,189
The knife that went through
this wound stabbed her heart.

76
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,420
We believe she passed away
due to excessive bleeding.

77
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,360
She looked pale.

78
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,730
There were no bloodstains
in the burial site.

79
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,560
It means that the killer drained out
all the blood before burying her.

80
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,699
And the teeth marks are very clear.

81
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,540
- Is there a reason for that?
- It's a postmortem mark.

82
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,240
The murderer bit the corpse?

83
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,139
If the murderer bit her this hard,

84
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,480
she would have resisted.
Then the teeth marks can't be clear.

85
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,709
You said she was raped earlier.

86
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,019
Then we must have his DNA.
He's done for.

87
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,120
We'll know
once we get the sperm test.

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,389
You know the knot that was
used to tie her hands and feet?

89
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,730
We'll write
a separate report on that.

90
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,990
Hold on.

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,970
Wait a second.
It went like this and that.

92
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,800
- Mr. Yang.
- Yes.

93
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,870
Let me see.

94
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,680
I can't stand being curious.

95
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,779
I looked it up online
on my way here.

96
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,779
It's a handcuff knot that
was used to imprison people.

97
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,850
I found out that
it was used in the military.

98
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,089
And one more thing.

99
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:58,689
If it pierced the heart through
the subclavian artery at once,

100
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,089
doesn't that mean he's a pro?

101
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,959
Well, that may be true.

102
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,629
Even when you stab someone
accidentally with a cutlet knife,

103
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,069
there are times when you rupture
the heart in one go.

104
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,509
But it means that he knew
the location of the artery...

105
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:17,379
- and the distance to the heart.
- Exactly.

106
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,639
Was it last month?

107
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,009
A woman stabbed a man who almost
raped her with a fruit knife.

108
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,779
She stabbed the same location.

109
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,750
But she was a kindergarten
teacher, wasn't she?

110
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,220
There are cases like this.

111
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,689
Gosh, he's something else.
He is indeed.

112
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:39,660
- "Something else"?
- I meant that you were awesome.

113
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,069
Awesome. I'm sure
the autopsy doctor has it right.

114
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,110
Excuse me. He's not an autopsy
doctor. He's a medical examiner.

115
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,470
Oh, right.

116
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,939
We have to use that title now.
I'm forgetful. My apologies.

117
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,050
By the way, the jerk
who killed that woman...

118
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,779
He's not a first-timer.

119
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:04,319
The sperm test was a negative.

120
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,490
- What?
- What?

121
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,189
He didn't even leave his DNA.

122
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,300
See? I'm telling you.
That scum is a pro.

123
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:14,000
And we have
the identity of the victim.

124
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,199
Luckily, her mother's DNA was kept
in the missing person's database.

125
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,370
We should really check on that.

126
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,839
Where is Hye Bin? Where is her?

127
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,810
We just finished the autopsy.

128
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,879
I can't believe this.

129
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,850
My poor daughter, Hye Bin.

130
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,419
(Kim Jung Ran,
Seong Hye Bin's mother)

131
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,960
- Gosh, please calm down.
- Goodness. You'll fall.

132
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,690
Please take a seat.

133
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,899
Gosh.

134
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,029
Ma'am, I understand
how difficult this must be for you.

135
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,470
Since when did she go missing?

136
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,039
She went missing two days ago.

137
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,080
She left for her part-time job,

138
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,580
but she never came back home.

139
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,230
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Do Ji Han.

140
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,230
You went for a hike on your first
day. You're like an old lady.

141
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,870
I worked in the narcotics unit
for five years.

142
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,539
I can't help myself
but check the crime scenes.

143
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,440
Can I take
the Wuseong-dong hill murder case...

144
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,279
as my first case in the Eastern
District Prosecutor's Office?

145
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,220
Why? Did you get attached to it
because it's where you first went?

146
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,190
But Prosecutor Eun was already
assigned to that case.

147
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,860
- It means she worked in vain.
- It's a rape-murder case.

148
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,330
The victim is young enough
to be her younger sister.

149
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,700
It'll be too hard on her.
I mean, people have emotions.

150
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,769
No, I can conduct
an objective investigation.

151
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,470
- To this day, I...
- I saw how...

152
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,870
you couldn't even look at her body,

153
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,940
then you cried
in front of the victim's family.

154
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,240
Are you sure you can be objective?

155
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,309
I think it'll be too tough.

156
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,250
She had a stab on the right
shoulder blade, about 15.7cm deep...

157
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,679
and 3.4cm long.

158
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,820
Teeth marks on the left side
of the neck.

159
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,490
Abrasion on her arms and legs.
Bleeding from 14 places.

160
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,960
Cause of death, severed artery due
to the stab on her shoulder blade...

161
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,220
and heart failure.

162
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,360
She lost all of her blood
right after death,

163
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,629
giving her the anemic condition.

164
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:24,159
Then they tied her hands and feet
to abandon her body easily...

165
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,529
and buried her in secret
by digging up...

166
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,129
a rectangular-shaped hole
with a depth of 1m...

167
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,470
and 80cm in length and breadth.

168
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,039
I can conduct
an objective investigation.

169
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,269
Prosecutor Eun has a great memory.

170
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,539
Doesn't she sound useful?

171
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:41,710
What was that? I never knew
we had another talent here.

172
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,720
The more I find out about
this place, the more I like it.

173
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,149
Prosecutor Eun.

174
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,549
Go over the initial investigation
with Gangdong Police Station...

175
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,960
and report it to me later, please.
No. Report it to me later.

176
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:55,590
Yes.

177
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,269
This isn't just any old knife.

178
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,340
I have the first analysis
of Seong Hye Bin's drug test.

179
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,110
I didn't find anything.

180
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,879
It looks like she doesn't even
take cold medicine.

181
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,279
She's just a normal girl.

182
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,480
- Okay.
- Autopsy documents for tomorrow.

183
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,720
Will you read them beforehand?

184
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,789
Leave them here.

185
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,690
Are you leaving right on the hour?
Are you sick?

186
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,830
- Do you want me to do overtime?
- I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye.

187
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,929
Let's go get some meat.

188
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,070
This is similar.

189
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,210
(Death of a woman in her 20s
in Wuseong-dong)

190
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,110
(Seong Hye Bin, job seeker)

191
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,649
Give me that. Over there.

192
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:24,679
Okay.

193
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,490
Let's see.

194
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,620
Is this the first time you two met?

195
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,990
- Yes.
- Say hi to each other.

196
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,360
This is Deputy Yang Soo Dong.

197
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,500
He gets angry
when you call him Deputy Yang...

198
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,429
because that sounds like
a chicken coop.

199
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,269
If his last name was Yuk,
he would've been a kind of soup.

200
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,340
Deputy kind of rhymes
with jeopardy too.

201
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:48,710
We're in a meeting to catch
a murderer.

202
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,179
How can you two sit there
and joke around?

203
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,409
Goodness.

204
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:54,809
My gosh.

205
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,850
Oh, hello.

206
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:01,120
I am Cheon Mi Ho,
and I work with Prosecutor Eun Sol.

207
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,190
I look forward to working with you.

208
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,620
Look forward to what?

209
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,360
We can all just do our jobs.

210
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,460
- You're right.
- What?

211
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,929
He's harsh.

212
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,700
- Hello.
- It's all right with me,

213
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,269
so let's just keep
all of the old desks and furniture.

214
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,169
Don't get them changed.

215
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,000
It takes up time and money.
What a waste, right?

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,409
- Yes.
- Right.

217
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,340
- Are we all here?
- Yes.

218
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,610
Let's greet each other later
and go right into the case.

219
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,639
Sure.

220
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,649
Name, Seong Hye Bin.

221
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,250
Age, 20. She was a job seeker.

222
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,820
She went MIA after she left work
at around 5pm...

223
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,059
at the convenience store two days
before her body was found.

224
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,120
Did you find anything on the scene?

225
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,629
We found her wallet
and belongings...

226
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,429
in the bag that was found
next to her body.

227
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,659
But something was odd.

228
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:47,929
We found her credit card
and cash in her wallet,

229
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,429
but only her ID card was missing.

230
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,200
They left money
and took her ID card?

231
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,370
They were trying to trick us
and stop us from identifying her.

232
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,409
It's so obvious.

233
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:01,080
- I know that.
- All right, now.

234
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,350
The walk back home
from the convenience store is...

235
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,720
a pretty deserted alleyway,
so there is no security camera.

236
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,519
It's difficult to locate
her whereabouts on that day.

237
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,559
So you have no leads?

238
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,259
I heard the first thing...

239
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:15,330
that detectives look for nowadays
are security cameras and DNA.

240
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,129
It's not that. The cameras are...

241
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,929
Stop making an excuse.

242
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:22,100
We used to have no problems
investigating without those things.

243
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,769
You have to get out there.

244
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:26,039
Do you all investigate
sitting around at your desks?

245
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,340
That's the problem.

246
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,240
Right, I can do it
without the security footage.

247
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,879
Deputy Yang, yes.

248
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,480
We don't run out blindly
to investigate anymore.

249
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,720
Come on, everyone.

250
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,250
All right, let's do this, okay?

251
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,919
Mr. Yang, please find
what I asked for in the morning.

252
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,159
- Yes.
- What? What is it?

253
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,529
We're not at the stage
to tell you yet.

254
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,100
It's just an assumption.
I'll tell you in time.

255
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:56,399
Okay. Let's get to work.

256
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,169
Can you bring the documents to me?

257
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:01,169
Can you wait one second, Mr. Yang?

258
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,840
- Mr. Yang.
- Whatever.

259
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,110
(National Forensic Service)

260
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,710
The evidence for
Seong Hye Bin's case.

261
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,720
One second.

262
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,529
That's where her ID card
would have been in.

263
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,960
Your thumbprint gets left behind...

264
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,259
as you take this out, right?

265
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,840
There are many thumbprints.

266
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,039
A lot of people touch
your credit card.

267
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,980
Then can you make samples of
each one of them except for hers?

268
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,210
Prosecutor Do.

269
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,720
- I brought it.
- Give it to her.

270
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,419
- What is that?
- Evidence.

271
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:53,889
What?

272
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,159
That looks pretty old.

273
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,529
- How long has this been?
- 30 years.

274
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,970
That's a long time.

275
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,509
You'll see a part of a thumbprint
on the buckle.

276
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,009
Please compare that
with the thumbprints...

277
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,210
found on her credit card.

278
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,250
Prosecutor Do, what are you doing?

279
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,379
I don't know.

280
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,649
How should I put it? My sixth sense?

281
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,590
Let's talk when we have the result.

282
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,090
Your sixth sense?

283
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,519
- 6th sense?
- 6th sense?

284
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:28,429
Sixth sense?

285
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,470
(Material, blade length,
total length, blade thickness)

286
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,639
Doctor Baek.

287
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,009
We have the analysis result
of Seong's case.

288
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,009
Okay.

289
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,519
There he is.

290
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,259
Hello.

291
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,970
There were a total of
eight thumbprints on the card.

292
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,440
One of them is a match
with the thumbprint...

293
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,569
- found on the buckle.
- What?

294
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,170
So the thumbprints on
a 30-year-old evidence...

295
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,180
and today's are identical?

296
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,809
- Yes.
- What's going on?

297
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,779
I told you.
This wasn't their first murder.

298
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,420
Then which case is that belt from?

299
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,490
Wuseong Serial Murder case.

300
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:30,259
- What?
- What?

301
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,589
Wuseong...

302
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,829
A total of 10 victims.

303
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:37,200
The serial murder that broke out
around Wuseong-dong area...

304
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,599
between 1984 to 1988,
for over 5 years.

305
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,000
You all know, right? It's 1 of the 3
most famous cold cases.

306
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,309
Don't you feel your blood boil?

307
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,369
Right, Prosecutor Eun?

308
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,240
This is a historical moment.

309
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,809
Then are you saying
Seong Hye Bin's murderer is...

310
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,480
the murderer of
Wuseong Serial Murder?

311
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,890
But I thought people said
that he already died.

312
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,789
He killed 10 people in 5 years.

313
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,859
He couldn't have suppressed
his will to kill.

314
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,559
Come on, that's not right.

315
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:13,059
He was a young man 30 years ago.
Why would he suddenly die?

316
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:14,769
What do you think?

317
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,140
We can't jump to a conclusion
because the thumbprints matched.

318
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,009
- Mr. Yang.
- Yes.

319
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,509
- All right. Take a look.
- What is this?

320
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,690
Tied the knots the same way,
killed the same way,

321
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,190
buried them the same way,

322
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,390
and the teeth marks
after their death.

323
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,519
The patterns are exactly the same.

324
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,460
The thumbprint is the cherry on
the top and the smoking gun.

325
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,500
The murderer of
Wuseong Serial Murder...

326
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,769
who's gone off the grid for 30 years
after May of 1988 is...

327
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:50,400
now on the move again.

328
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:52,339
Could he be a copycat?

329
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,009
Like you said,
this was a high-profile case.

330
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,339
Everyone knows
what the murderer's routine is.

331
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,779
Would they copy his thumbprint too?

332
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,950
They're both partial,
so we can't say for sure.

333
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,779
Okay. That's enough.

334
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,690
That's why I want to prove this
through our investigation.

335
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,890
Then good luck
with your investigation.

336
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:11,089
Let's go.

337
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,589
Okay.

338
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,960
What?

339
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,430
I believe we should
begin the investigation...

340
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,230
by leaving the possibility
that it could have been done...

341
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,230
by a copycat or by someone
who held a grudge against her.

342
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,069
Prosecutor Eun, you are objective.
Let's do that.

343
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,470
But let me tell you one thing.

344
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,880
Criminals always make mistakes.

345
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,710
Those mistakes are
opportunities for us, okay?

346
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,180
The serial from 30 years ago.

347
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,549
We just opened the Pandora's box.

348
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,329
Kang Hyun speaking.

349
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:54,970
Hello?

350
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,079
I'm Baek Ho Chul.

351
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,480
You have something
to tell me, don't you?

352
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,349
I heard you were at the hospital.

353
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:17,220
I'd been looking for
Han So Hee for a long time.

354
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,890
How long were you going to hide her?

355
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,559
You must think I'm despicable.

356
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,400
I know very well.

357
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,160
This tragedy...

358
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,500
was of my own making.

359
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:34,609
I thought that Beom would
give everything up for So Hee.

360
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,569
I was afraid.

361
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,049
I beg of you.

362
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:45,119
It was Beom's lifelong dream
to study in the US.

363
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,450
But now he wants to stay
because of you.

364
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,960
Is that what you want?

365
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,500
Can't you give up on him for me?

366
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,339
Okay.

367
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,779
I'll do that.

368
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,819
I never imagined that
she was carrying...

369
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,450
Beom's child at the time.

370
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,859
Had I known, I wouldn't have
done what I did.

371
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,190
You're mistaken.

372
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,930
That baby was my brother's.

373
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,529
It can't be.

374
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,269
After it was miscarried,

375
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,539
I ran a DNA test.

376
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,640
- It was Beom's child.
- But...

377
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,769
How...

378
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:47,049
I'm getting married.

379
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,710
You'll be an uncle soon.

380
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:57,589
I caused this disaster out of
greed and ambition for my son.

381
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:00,690
So Hee...

382
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,930
has been in a vegetative state
for over 10 years.

383
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,470
I will carry the burden until I die.

384
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,569
So please,

385
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,539
I beg of you as a father
who has a son,

386
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,440
though I don't deserve to.

387
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,309
Please leave both So Hee...

388
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:22,079
and Beom alone as they are.

389
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,990
Why are there so many of them?
What's going on?

390
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,630
They're called hyenas for a reason.

391
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,000
They took the bait called
Wuseong Serial Murder.

392
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,329
The criminal will be
watching TV, right?

393
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,339
He'll be anxious to know
that we're onto him.

394
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,839
Right?

395
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,140
Hello, everyone.

396
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,509
Are you investigating
the Wuseong Serial Murder?

397
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:55,309
Could you give a comment?

398
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:00,349
There's the prosecutor
in charge. Sir?

399
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,559
- That must be him.
- Over there.

400
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,460
Any comments?

401
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,130
Give us some details.

402
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:12,930
- They flocked over.
- Oh dear.

403
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,670
Look at that.

404
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:30,319
- Any comments?
- Talk to us.

405
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,519
- Fill us in.
- How are things going?

406
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,920
What a mess.

407
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,160
Prosecutor Eun,
it's a total disaster.

408
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,759
It got out of hand.

409
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,859
Reporters are saying
the Wuseong killer woke up.

410
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:43,900
I don't know how
and when they caught on.

411
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,660
"Wuseong killer" is
the most-searched phrase...

412
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,029
on the main search engines.

413
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:52,170
On a mountain in Gangdong-gu
Wuseong-dong,

414
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,309
the body of a woman in her 20s
was found stabbed and buried.

415
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,109
The police are investigating.

416
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,779
The woman lost touch
with her family after leaving...

417
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,220
her part-time job at
a convenience store in Wuseong-dong.

418
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,119
She was reported missing.

419
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,650
Police noticed her fingerprints
were badly damaged...

420
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,690
and that her wrists and ankles
were tied using an unusual knot.

421
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,299
They believe the MO
is similar to the Wuseong...

422
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,900
serial killings that happened
between 1984 to 1988.

423
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,869
(The Fearsome Serial Killer Awakes)

424
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:27,839
You scored huge.
The whole country's in uproar.

425
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,579
I tend to create big issues.

426
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:31,980
My nickname was...

427
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,150
The Rabid Dog, the Doberman.

428
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,579
Rumors spread already?

429
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,589
A Doberman never lets go
once it bites.

430
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,990
I'll catch him.

431
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,890
I don't think we should
exclude a copycat killer.

432
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,559
Fine. Just catch the killer.

433
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,960
The Prosecutor General ordered we
and the police set up...

434
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,200
an Wuseong task force team.

435
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,130
We'll send over...

436
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,539
the medical examiner
who autopsied the victim.

437
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,000
That would be Dr. Baek.

438
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,069
I'll still show up to work here.

439
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,640
They won't let me do anything there.
I don't like it.

440
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:11,519
Can he work on
such a huge case on his own?

441
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,849
It's a serial.

442
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,150
As his superior,
I should represent...

443
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,789
I heard that the task force team
already invited another examiner.

444
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:22,390
- Who?
- Someone the President appointed.

445
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,000
The chair is here.

446
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,940
Hello, I'm Prosecutor Do Ji Han.

447
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,579
Hello.

448
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,049
How are you?

449
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:42,950
It's been a while. Let's sit.

450
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,789
I'm Pyo Yoo Seong and
I was asked to lead the team.

451
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,829
You all know
this is an important case...

452
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:58,630
which the public
is following closely.

453
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,170
Let's all work together
and solve it.

454
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,329
- Sure.
- Okay.

455
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,710
You played a huge role in catching
serial killer Yoo Han Cheol.

456
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,109
You're the only person
who can lead us on this case.

457
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,490
Will the NFS be joining us?

458
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,460
Yes, of course they will.

459
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:30,500
I invited only the best
from each field.

460
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,569
I hope you'll back me up.

461
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,569
Sure.

462
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,799
Shall we begin?

463
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,140
The Wuseong Serial Murders.

464
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,809
From 1984 to 1988,

465
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:48,380
over five years
in the Wuseong-dong area,

466
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,950
10 women were raped and murdered.

467
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,920
The investigation lasted 13 years,

468
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,950
and over 200,000 people
were involved.

469
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,990
Over 17,000 people
were considered suspects,

470
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:01,490
but they failed to
catch the culprit,

471
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,990
and it became a cold case.

472
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,529
That's right.
All the victims were killed,

473
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:10,339
and with no witnesses,
the investigation made no headway.

474
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:14,109
But Lee Kyung Ja, the last target,

475
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:16,039
managed to get free...

476
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,339
and give us the criminal's profile.

477
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:20,849
The killer is about 180cm tall,

478
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:24,180
wears 260mm-sized shoes
and is very strong.

479
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,150
He's very agile and is in his 20s.

480
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,849
But after his last victim got away,

481
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,660
the criminal went dormant.

482
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,700
That's the composite drawn
based on Lee Kyung Ja's description.

483
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,730
This would be him 30 years later.

484
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,400
It's what we expect him
to look like in his 50s.

485
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:49,569
The MO, the way he killed,
is slightly different.

486
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:53,140
The location of the stab wounds
and the method of disposal.

487
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,650
Serial killers evolve.

488
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,119
Anyone, when repeating a task,

489
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,890
is bound to find a way
to do something quicker and easier.

490
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,819
Serial killer Yoo Han Cheol...

491
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:06,619
had a routine that involved
cutting up his victims.

492
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,960
At first, the cutting job
was very haphazard.

493
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,230
Later on, as he became experienced,

494
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,900
he got good enough
to cut at the joints.

495
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,240
He said something
after we caught him.

496
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,369
"Chopping up bodies was so hard,"

497
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:21,339
"so I bought and studied
an anatomy book."

498
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:24,410
That's right. He did research.

499
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,279
Look at the fingers.
How he cut off the fingerprints.

500
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,750
He's not an ordinary guy.

501
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,819
Okay then.

502
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,990
First.

503
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,890
He makes sure
the bodies are found late.

504
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,160
Second.

505
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,930
He makes sure to delay the victim's
identification as long as possible.

506
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,230
That's the Wuseong killer's routine.

507
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,069
In the beginning, he left
the body at the crime scene.

508
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:52,140
After the third murder,

509
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,069
he hid them in agricultural
waterways or mountains.

510
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:58,980
From the fifth,
he started to bury them.

511
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,980
Did you find anything
during the autopsy?

512
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,549
He used a unique weapon.

513
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:06,849
I'm trying to identify...

514
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,119
Did he use the same
weapon 30 years ago?

515
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,220
- It's possible but not confirmed.
- That's fine.

516
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,130
On this victim's body
or at the burial site,

517
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,029
did you find the criminal's DNA?

518
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,430
No, we didn't.

519
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,440
Isn't extracting DNA the most
important of the NFS' duties?

520
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,970
If the killer insists on using
a unique weapon,

521
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,440
that too can be a clue.

522
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,109
So are you telling me that we should
catch a serial killer with a knife?

523
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:36,109
Pardon?
