It's rape and murder.

She was found on a hill
in Gyeonggi Province.

were both removed.

There was a crash.

Hypodermal bleeding in the back
of her thigh and a femur fracture.

The point of the injury is
60cm above ground.

The vehicle was an SUV.
There was no sign of a nosedive.

17

The driver probably dozed off.

The driver disguised it as rape.

22

There was no rape.

23
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,370
It was just an external injury
to her thigh.

24

What? They're searching the hill?

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,210
You were the top of the class
at the training center. Nonsense.

163
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,620
The wife of a son of
an assemblyman in office...

164
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,649
- has been found dead at home.
- Yes. I got it.

165
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,659
- The son is the key suspect,
- I have the perfect one for that.

166
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,960
- but he's denying the charges.
- Don't worry about it.

167
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,529
- The police...
- Goodbye, then.

168
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,360
received a report on that day
at the patrol center...

169
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,929
- of the couple's loud fight.
- Hey, you're here.

170
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,269
- Take a seat.
- However, there weren't any...

171
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,899
specific evidence found,

172
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,070
so they also believe
she could have been murdered.

173
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,580
I'm Prosecutor Eun Sol, appointed
to Criminal Division Eight...

174
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,879
of Seoul Eastern District
Prosecutor's Office.

175
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,210
Yes, good to see you. Take a seat.

176
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,320
So I heard...

177
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,350
- you wanted to be a prosecutor.
- Yes.

178
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,690
Why? With your grades,
you could've been a judge.

179
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,429
And you volunteered to become
a part of the criminal division.

180
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,929
I really loved investigative dramas.
I watched a lot of US dramas too.

181
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:06,970
US dramas?

182
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,570
I love your young energy.

183
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,909
Criminal Division Eight is...

184
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,039
infamously known for
its murderous workload.

185
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,740
Do you get it?

186
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,210
You mean that I will be
very busy from now on, right?

187
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,649
You're quick-witted too.

188
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,190
I've given this some thought.

189
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,360
Your first case. You know, right?

190
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,730
You'll remember your first case
for your entire life.

191
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,899
Since you like watching TV,
this will be great.

192
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,230
Pardon?

193
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,500
Oh Man Sang.

194
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,330
He's the son of
Assemblyman Oh Pil Joong,

195
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,370
and his grandfather is Oh Deuk Sang,
a former chief justice.

196
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,639
His mother's side is Seongjin Group.

197
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,110
He's a spoiled grandson
of a conglomerate.

198
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,580
What do you think?
It's quite huge for your first case.

199
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,779
Are you interested?

200
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Yes.

201
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,960
(The prosecution summoned
Suspect A on the day of the crime.)

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,169
Sir, what case is this?

203
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,940
How did the husband become
the prime suspect?

204
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,340
- Please answer.
- Please.

205
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,169
- Any comments?
- Please?

206
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,509
Tell us something.

207
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,840
- Don't push.
- Tell us something.

208
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,779
- Could you tell us anything?
- Please comment.

209
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,259
Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.

210
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,090
Don't you see
it's a restricted area?

211
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,929
- Which TV station?
- I'm...

212
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:45,159
Give me your number first.

213
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,830
- What...
- You fool.

214
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,769
You can't hit on just anyone.

215
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,000
- Prosecutor Eun Sol just joined.
- Prosecutor...

216
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:54,269
Prosecutor?

217
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,779
Hello, I'm Detective Cha Soo Ho
from Gangdong Police Station.

218
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:00,049
I thought all violent crimes cops
were burly.

219
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,779
You look quite stylish.

220
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,649
Prosecutor Eun.

221
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,850
It's a crime scene.
You can't act like this.

222
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,350
- A crime scene.
- Yes.

223
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,820
- Okay.
- Let's go.

224
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:17,600
Hey. Lift your jaw from the floor,

225
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,470
and let's get back to work, okay?
Let's go.

226
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,909
The victim's name is Kwon Hee Kyung.
The helper found her this morning.

227
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,679
The local police station
got a call...

228
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,940
about a couple's fighting
this morning.

229
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,850
The couple fought?
Did her husband kill her?

230
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,149
He says he left early this morning
and stayed at a hotel.

231
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,490
The husband is the prime suspect.

232
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,090
The police were called for domestic
disputes five times this year.

233
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,960
What are you doing?

234
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,230
Are you okay?

235
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,190
- It's nothing. She...
- She touched the body.

236
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,799
You flipped her.

237
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,269
I was told that Forensics
had already taken the photos.

238
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:34,539
Don't you see this?

239
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,440
- Is that decomposition?
- What?

240
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,009
It's livor mortis,
not decomposition.

241
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,049
The pooling of blood after death.

242
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:48,090
It's on half of her face.
That means she was face-down.

243
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:52,389
Dr. Baek, it's not a serial.
Her husband killed her.

244
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:55,360
- Why can't we flip her?
- "Why can't we"?

245
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,559
What's the police line for, then?

246
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:01,429
Get rid of the police line, and let
all the reporters and spectators in.

247
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:03,570
Let them all in! Why can't we?

248
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,840
I flipped her.

249
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,409
I apologize.

250
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:17,750
You weren't even wearing gloves.
Is this a horror flick?

251
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,320
At least the troublemaker
gets killed off first in movies.

252
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,789
No shoe covers?

253
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,830
Must you be so particular?
Moderation is...

254
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,269
Don't bother, then!

255
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:37,070
- It's her first day and...
- So what?

256
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,639
Was it that wrong for me
to wear high heels?

257
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,639
Santa Monica, USA, 1877.
A family is slaughtered.

258
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,210
Prints of the next door neighbor's
heels were found,

259
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,480
but the killer was a man.
He'd worn heels on purpose.

260
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,220
The problem was they figured it out
15 years too late...

261
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,149
after the neighbor
had been executed.

262
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,259
Do you need another example
of how heels ruined a case?

263
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,099
Tell me what you did and
touched in chronological order.

264
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,329
Here.

265
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,369
Set up a perimeter.

266
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,410
- Send everyone but Forensics out!
- Okay.

267
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,980
This is a mess, not a scene.

268
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,210
Get out, all of you!

269
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,019
Let's go.

270
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,049
You, prosecutor.

271
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:32,859
- Leave your prints.
- What?

272
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:35,690
I need to exclude yours
from what's on her body.

273
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,430
What?

274
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:50,910
(Gangdong Police Station)

275
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,180
(Identity Screening)

276
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,880
Baek Beom's a complete lunatic.

277
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
He causes such a fuss.

278
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Eun.
Let me apologize on his behalf.

279
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,859
No, it's okay.

280
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,230
The medical examiner's
name is Baek Beom?

281
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,730
Yes. It's best that
you never cross paths with him.

282
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,839
But it's impossible.
He shows up whenever someone dies.

283
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,809
"If you want him to treat you like
a human, end up on his table."

284
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,410
- That's what people say.
- Is he good at what he does?

285
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,279
He's second to no one
but has the temperament of a dog...

286
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:31,849
He's mean.

287
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:33,319
He's no tiger.

288
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:35,319
He's a psycho.

289
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,289
What?

290
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:39,660
A what? A psycho?

291
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,460
I like that. Psycho.

292
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:10,690
Baek Beom screamed at her...

293
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,990
for flipping over a dead body.

294
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,890
He yelled at us to get out
because she wore heels.

295
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,099
Do you know how frigid
things were today?

296
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:22,299
I thought my prosecutor
would have livor mortis.

297
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,769
You should've
smeared it on his face.

298
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:29,170
- You just let him off?
- Even Soo Ho lowered his tail.

299
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,180
She got a right hazing.

300
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,279
She did.

301
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,380
I caused some trouble at the scene.

302
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,750
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,089
We all do on our first day.
Sit over there.

304
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,859
Since it's Prosecutor Eun's
first week,

305
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,859
we'll party every day.

306
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,829
Okay?

307
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,400
- Set things up.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,670
- There you go.
- My goodness.

309
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,140
I put a lot of love into this sock.

310
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,009
- Gosh.
- There it goes.

311
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,180
Here goes our love and dedication.

312
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,319
Sorry. I'll add something for taste.

313
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,720
It's a tradition
in Criminal Division Eight.

314
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,960
That's a lot.

315
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,359
- Drink it up, drink it up.
- Drink it up, drink it up.

316
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,430
Gosh, do you people still do this?

317
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,339
I can't drink soju.

318
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,039
Excuse me. Can I have the wine list?

319
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,579
- Wine?
- Who will drink this?

320
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,819
Chief, it was your idea.
Will you drink it?

321
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,049
Prosecutor Eun.

322
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,119
You're funny.

323
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,559
That's funny.

324
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll drink it.
I retire in six months,

325
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,099
so I'm the last in line.
Bring it over.

326
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,829
- Come on.
- No, sir.

327
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,000
- Sit down.
- Then...

328
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,369
since you all made it together,
you can all share it too.

329
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,109
Yes, we could share.
Give that to me.

330
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,779
Let's share. A little for everyone.

331
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,619
Will two glasses each do?

332
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,789
Here you go.

333
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,420
Thank you.

334
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,130
My wine...

335
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,069
Chief, do you think Prosecutor Eun
can handle that case?

336
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:37,769
Why?

337
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:40,869
If you give her such a hard time
from the start, she'll never adjust.

338
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,539
Give the case to me.

339
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,339
It's out of her league.

340
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,319
Who said that the case is in yours?

341
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,289
It's...

342
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,190
my call.

343
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:59,789
Will you just let me?

344
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,730
Come on.

345
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,299
- Cheers, everyone.
- Help me out, please.

346
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,369
Welcome.

347
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,910
You did as I told
for just 10 months.

348
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,549
While you were inside me.

349
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,410
Really?

350
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,619
But then, you always kicked me.

351
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,619
You still did as you wanted.
I can't stuff you back inside me.

352
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,890
I gained weight.
That will never work.

353
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,160
Don't take it too far.

354
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,859
Prosecuting isn't fun,
and it'll be hard to marry you off.

355
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:38,930
I'll keep my job. It's fun.

356
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,329
Your brother was the result of
a one-night stand.

357
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,329
You're the biggest mistake
of my life.

358
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:57,079
If I die in this posture,

359
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,049
livor mortis will be
all over my face.

360
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:07,190
- You had a team dinner?
- You're the best, I tell you.

361
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,960
Did the people high up
who work for the government...

362
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,599
give you a hard time?

363
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,730
- I was so heartbroken.
- Why?

364
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,940
My first case's victim was...

365
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,069
a wife whose husband
beat her to death.

366
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:22,009
My gosh, that rat deserves
to be fried to death.

367
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:25,140
What? He had nothing better to do
than beat his wife to death?

368
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,410
You just made my day.
I wish you were the judge.

369
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,349
But you know what? This neighborhood
is full of those kinds of scumbags.

370
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,390
It's just that the housewives
sweep this part under the rug.

371
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,089
Among the housekeepers,
it's already old news.

372
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:40,759
Tell you what. Who would dare
to say that the husbands...

373
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:44,700
in 308 and 701 in the next building
abuse their wives?

374
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,970
Does that hurt? Is this hard on you?

375
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:58,740
- Does that hurt a lot?
- Get that hand off me.

376
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,369
You scumbag. Don't you touch me.

377
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,250
You know better.
Why did you rile me up?

378
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,519
You know about my temper.

379
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:14,250
I told you not to make me angry!

380
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,539
Hey, hey, hey.

381
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:37,039
Hey! Hey!

382
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,180
You!

383
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,779
Hey!

384
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,259
Come out. Darn it.

385
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,319
Darn it!

386
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:41,170
The time of autopsy is 8:30am.

387
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,650
Forceps.

388
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,900
My gosh, this is too cruel.

389
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,970
I can't look at that.
That's too much.

390
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,140
Multiple contusions.

391
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,269
"Multiple contusions."

392
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,609
(Multiple contusions)

393
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,750
Immediate rigor mortis
on her right hand.

394
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,579
"Immediate rigor mortis
on her right hand".

395
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,789
A lot of materials found
underneath her fingernails.

396
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,019
"A lot of materials found".

397
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,730
Hello, Prosecutor Eun. You're here.

398
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,000
- Hypodermal bleeding on 25.
- "Hypodermal bleeding on 25".

399
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,500
2.7cm by 6cm. Vertical.

400
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,170
"2.7cm by 6cm. Vertical."

401
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:57,380
- You took a photo of 25, right?
- Yes, I did.

402
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,480
- What about before the incision?
- That... Before...

403
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,089
I... I missed that.

404
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,960
I told you to take photos for each
layer. I already made an incision!

405
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:11,230
I... I messed up, sir.

406
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,400
Hey, we're going to split her body
in half and crack her head open.

407
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,000
Do it right. Otherwise, we are
no better than psychopaths.

408
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,170
I'm sorry, sir.

409
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,109
Put down the camera.

410
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,809
There he goes again.

411
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,609
Get out.

412
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,079
Get out!

413
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,819
- Did we get the body scan data?
- Yes.

414
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:41,230
Blow up the 3D bone reconstruction.

415
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,900
(The CT scans are reconstructed
into a 3-dimensional framework.)

416
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:46,029
- Do your job right.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,690
Fracture on the fourth rib
of her left shoulder.

418
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,200
"Fracture on the fourth rib
of her left shoulder".

419
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,769
The strike came from the back.

420
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,210
- Did we get the drug list?
- Yes, sir.

421

- Wait, what is he doing?
- Don't mind him.

427
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:04,309
His autopsies tend to take longer
and is a bit peculiar.

428
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:29,799
The weight of her heart is 326g.

429
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,700
"326g".

430

"A prosthetic valve surgery".

Request Toxic Substance Division

Yes, sir.

439
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,319
There was an embryo.

440
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,230
- Early stages of pregnancy.
- I'm pregnant.

441
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,960
Move in with me.

442
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,839
Beom, I love you.
