1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,810
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:20,890
That capsule...

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,359
What is it?
I've never seen it before.

4
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:27,670
- Don't speak. I'll deal with...
- What will you deal with?

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,570
What do you think is going on?

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,740
Defendant, how much longer
will you lie for?

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,539
The promiscuous behavior...

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,979
Were you not speaking for yourself?

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,380
You were with a woman at a hotel
the night your wife died.

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,450
We caught you on camera.

11
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,729
Shall we debunk more of your lies?

12
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,299
You said your wife harmed herself
due to mental illness.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,239
The self-harming...

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,969
- was all you.
- What?

15
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,040
We didn't find your skin cells
under the victim's fingernails.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,109
Whose fingernails do you think...

17
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,109
created all these marks?

18
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:25,359
Did you do it?

19
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,730
- To yourself?
- What about that?

20
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,530
I didn't kill her.

21
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,629
Stop talking.

22
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,829
I pay you a fortune,
and what are you doing?

23
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,739
She's dragging me down
even after death.

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,739
For so many years,
you tortured and assaulted her.

25
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:45,379
But as if that wasn't enough,
you killed her?

26
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,379
I said I didn't kill her!

27
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:50,719
- You made these pills to kill her!
- Did you see me? Did you?

28
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,950
Unfortunately for you,

29
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,890
the victim hid a few pills in her
pocket right before she died.

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,420
Did you think a perfect crime
would be that easy to commit?

31
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,489
Whom do you think you're
making out to be a criminal?

32
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,230
Who do you think you are?

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,729
Is this how you treated your wife?

34
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,909
Yes.

35
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,080
She made my blood boil
and made me violent,

36
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,050
but I did not kill her.

37
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,780
Then did you beat her
until she was on the brink of death?

38
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,520
When she was pregnant?

39
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,250
You're just human trash!

40
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:31,860
- You should die too!
- You're no human!

41
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,659
Silence, please!

42
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,699
What a mess of a trial this is!
Call it off. This is a con!

43
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,770
What do you know?
You're all insects. Know your place.

44
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,240
Let go of me. Let go.
Do you know who I am?

45
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,110
You're all dogs and cattle.
I saw all your faces.

46
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,280
I saw you all! Let me go! Let go.

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,180
Let me go!

48
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,629
That capsule.

49
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,629
Can you prove I killed her?

50
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,000
Defendant.

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,930
You're lying to the end.

52
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,110
If we find your prints on these,

53
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,870
that will be the end of it all.

54
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,580
I...

55
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,150
- He's here.
- Okay.

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,520
The evidence that will point to
who tampered with the capsules...

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,020
has arrived.

58
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,159
I summon
Medical Examiner Baek Beom...

59
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,990
as my witness.

60
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,419
(Witness Stand)

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,800
I believe you've analyzed
the components...

62
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,410
on the capsule.

63
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,740
- Yes.
- Do you have...

64
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:31,680
the result?

65
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,279
The culprit tried to hide
the maker of the capsules.

66
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,720
Therefore, they put on a pair of
latex gloves used in kitchens...

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,519
and made the capsules.

68
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,389
Then are you saying we can't
identify who made the capsule?

69
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,230
The gloves will hide
any fingerprints.

70
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,860
That's exactly why...

71
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,600
I could identify the maker.

72
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,699
When you put these on,

73
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,040
they tend to stick to your fingers
as it gets humid inside the gloves.

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,439
Then the inside of the gloves are...

75
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,410
covered with fingerprints and sweat.

76
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,240
Also, your sweat...

77
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:05,810
contains your DNA.

78
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,250
Did you find both
the fingerprints...

79
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,519
and the DNA?

80
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,350
Yes.

81
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,089
He is definitely the best.

82
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,089
Then is the identified person...

83
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:23,360
sitting in this courtroom right now?

84
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,009
No, they aren't.

85
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,610
- What?
- What?

86
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,110
- What happened?
- How can that be?

87
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,350
- What?
- It's not him?

88
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,649
Then it's someone else?

89
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,220
Witness.

90
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,620
- What do you mean?
- Then...

91
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,389
whose fingerprints did you find?

92
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,060
I found the fingerprints and the DNA
of the victim, Kwon Hee Kyung.

93
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,829
What?

94
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,470
(Fingerprint Analysis Result)

95
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,310
(Kwon Hee Kyung)

96
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,310
How...

97
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,980
did this happen?

98
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,779
She put on a show to
make it look like it was murder.

99
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,300
She set it up to make
her husband look like the murderer.

100
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,500
It's a footage of my client
leaving home that night.

101
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,439
Then who do you think this is?

102
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,339
How did the dead woman
walk him out to the door?

103
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,779
She made him get a prescription
of drugs that could kill her,

104
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,050
made it look like...

105
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,290
her husband made the capsules,
and then killed herself.

106
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,290
The counterfeit capsules were...

107
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,329
to be used as evidence against
her husband for her murder.

108
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,850
But because of a hole in her pocket,
the capsules fell out.

109
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,750
Her life-risking plan...

110
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,980
had gone wrong.

111
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,029
That was my opinion.

112
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,069
Prosecutor Eun.

113
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,379
What will you do now?

114
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,509
Prosecutor Eun.

115
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,550
(Judge)

116
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,600
Why do you think your wife left...

117
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,670
a dying message in
such a difficult way?

118
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,569
She was afraid of you...

119
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,680
even as she died.

120
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,480
No one would have believed
the words of Ms. Kwon,

121
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,350
a daughter of two teachers,

122
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,289
that her rich husband had been
beating her up badly.

123
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,320
She wanted revenge.

124
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,419
No, she at least wanted you
to be punished by law,

125
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,629
but this was the only way
she could think of.

126
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:45,799
The three capsules
she held in her hand as she died...

127
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,570
Those were the only things
in this world...

128
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,370
that she could put her trust in.

129
00:08:58,309 --> 00:08:59,940
She had no one to trust...

130
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,779
or to share her heart with.

131
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:06,120
This was the desperation
in her heart.

132
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,850
She wanted to punish her husband.

133
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,019
Her heart is...

134
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,389
the sole truth in this.

135
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:32,080
Objection.

136
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,350
The prosecution...

137
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,279
has made an assumption on the case
based only on circumstances.

138
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,590
Sustained.

139
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,659
Delete that from the records.

140
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,659
Prosecutor Eun.

141
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,830
I will change...

142
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,470
the indictment to special injury.

143
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,409
Because the prosecutor must
change the indictment,

144
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,450
we will continue the trial
on the next appointed date.

145
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:26,000
- Great job.
- Thank you.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,429
- Great job.
- Great job.

147
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:30,669
Over here.

148
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,639
Let's go.

149
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,990
You should live properly.

150
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,490
If not, we may meet again.

151
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,029
- There he is.
- There he is.

152
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,000
- He's here.
- He came out.

153
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,169
- What happened?
- Please share a word.

154
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,809
- How do you feel?
- Was your wife abused by you?

155
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,139
- Did you beat her?
- Share a word.

156
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,710
- Over there.
- The prosecutor.

157
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,740
The prosecutor?

158
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,710
- Where?
- She's there.

159
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,649
Prosecutor, are you satisfied
that he admitted to the violence?

160
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,779
Didn't you practically lose
if you had to change the indictment?

161
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,990
- How do you feel right now?
- What do you think?

162
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,220
What do you think
about losing the case?

163
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,460
Anything to say about the violence?

164
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,929
Excuse me, stop!

165
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:30,629
We won't say a word
until we give our official release.

166
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:32,860
Please share a word.

167
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,000
- What do you think?
- I'm sorry.

168
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,269
Do you admit to losing the case?

169
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,139
A, who was the key suspect
of his wife's murder,

170
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,309
was freed from his murder charges.

171
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,509
Don't you think everything went...

172
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,580
just as you wanted?

173
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,779
Yes, I'm sure
what we did was enough.

174
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,350
The indictment has been changed
from homicide...

175
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,750
However,

176
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,860
I'll have to keep my eyes on them
from now on.

177
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
(The prosecution's excessive
investigation will be criticized.)

178
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,990
Prosecutor Eun,
you looked great on camera.

179
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,500
("The Prosecution's Half-victory
Will Be Hard to Avoid Criticism")

180
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,899
Everyone is saying that
Prosecutor Kang is handsome.

181
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,799
- Goodness, you.
- Stop.

182
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:12,740
I'm saying he's handsome
because he is.

183
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,110
Look.

184
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,980
That means he won.
The rich are always innocent.

185
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,110
I feel bad for the deceased.

186
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,210
The prosecution is
only a slave to the powerful.

187
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,149
We should just become rich
instead of writing comments.

188
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,480
He says, "I beat her to near-death,"

189
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,450
- "but I didn't kill her."
- Oh, the comments are...

190
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,259
Prosecutor Eun.

191
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:33,860
It's all right. You've done
quite well for that case.

192
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,460
Quite well for that case?

193
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,929
- No.
- Oh, it's not that.

194
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:40,399
Everyone fails to do well
on their first case.

195
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,169
- Yes, of course.
- Right.

196
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,940
I heard I'd remember
my first case for life.

197
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:47,340
Wasn't it frightening?

198
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,639
Did you see that husband
walking out in joy?

199
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,710
If she was going to blame him,

200
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,750
why didn't she just plant
evidence everywhere in her home?

201
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,610
She probably thought
his family would...

202
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,350
destroy any evidence that could
obviously be used against him.

203
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,120
That's how desperate she was.

204
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,720
I am a bad prosecutor.

205
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,159
You stayed with the case
and found more evidence.

206
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,659
You've done all you could.

207
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,370
He's the reason why I failed.

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,169
I'm going to get that old man.

209
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:17,799
That old man?

210
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,240
Please excuse me.

211
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,669
Where are you going?

212
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,639
- Prosecutor Eun.
- You can't just leave.

213
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,879
What was that?

214
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,480
(Indoor Shooting Range)

215
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,509
He often goes to
that shooting range.

216
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,620
I think he went there.

217
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,159
Are you happy now? Satisfied?

218
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,769
Get out.

219
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,500
You never thought
she was murdered, right?

220
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,340
It would've been better
if you hadn't shown up.

221
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,340
Don't you feel bad for her?

222
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,509
How desperate would she have been
to take things that far?

223
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:01,149
You just freed that jerk!

224
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,980
Do you feel sympathetic for a woman
who wanted to get a private revenge?

225
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,059
Then what?
Shall I sue him for assault?

226
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:13,460
He'll be let out on probation.
He won't be detained.

227
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,190
I wouldn't have had to open her up.

228
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,059
You were wrong too.
You know that, right?

229
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,200
You said it was an accidental death,
but it was suicide.

230
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,740
I wondered why you're here shooting.
You must be angry.

231
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:29,409
- You must have fury...
- Get out.

232
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,480
Aren't you curious?

233
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,720
The paternity test results
were sealed.

234
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,480
- You didn't read it.
- I don't care.

235
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,289
I didn't have to read it
to know the baby was his.

236
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,970
My gut feeling's 100 percent.

237
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,870
Nothing's ever 100 percent.

238
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
I see why you only
deal with the dead.

239
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,340
Because the living
makes too much noise.

240
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,679
Do you want me gone?

241
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,710
Let's try to stay away from
each other.

242
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,320
Only after world peace.

243
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,490
- What?
- We won't meet if no one dies.

244
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,220
- Or you can quit.
- You psycho.

245
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,929
I'll do my best as a prosecutor
to bring about world peace.

246
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,519
(Negative Autopsy:
When cause of death is unknown)

247
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,090
- Do something.
- I'm furious.

248
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,429
We need help.

249
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:56,090
- It's crazy.
- Calm down.

250
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,360
Will you be quiet?

251
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,399
- It's just so unfair.
- I'm so upset.

252
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,929
Okay, okay, be quiet! Quiet!

253
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,370
Just one. Speak for the group.

254
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,710
That fraud, the witch!

255
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,580
I got sick because of her!

256
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,009
I'll do the talking.

257
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:16,919
Prosecutor, my brother
died three years ago.

258
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,450
But his so-called wife suddenly
showed up with a newborn...

259
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,919
and said it was
my brother's offspring.

260
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,360
She had a dead man's baby?

261
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,960
- Is that possible?
- Exactly.

262
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,500
She's the worst kind of fraud.

263
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,629
She found out our dad left
his inheritance to his grandson.

264
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:36,669
An inheritance?

265
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,309
Our youngest sibling, Deuk Nam.

266
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,769
Our dad did adopt him
from an orphanage.

267
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,309
We did have a grudge
against our dad.

268
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:48,250
He wanted a son so much
that he named us,

269
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:51,750
his daughters Il Nam,
Yi Nam, Hu Nam.

270
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,389
Then he adopted someone
from goodness knows where.

271
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,259
This just doesn't make sense.

272
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,460
I'm sure...

273
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:04,000
my sisters-in-law all want me dead.

274
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,460
But...

275
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,099
I thought long and hard
about getting pregnant.

276
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:12,299
"Is this really what
Deuk Nam would want?"

277
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,970
I'm sure.

278
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,509
Deuk Nam...

279
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,380
had frozen his sperm before he died.

280
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,279
I found out only later.

281
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,819
I guess he wanted to
preserve his sperm...

282
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,119
before his condition worsened.

283
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:33,220
IVF treatment
couldn't have been easy.

284
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,099
I used Deuk Nam's sperm
and had his baby.

285
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,099
I have medical records.

286
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,130
I want to do...

287
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,099
whatever it takes...

288
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,670
to give my child his father back.

289
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,009
Isn't that what a mom would want?

290
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,539
Prosecutor Eun.

291
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,609
Please help me.

292
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,079
You'll do whatever it takes?

293
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,680
Yes.

294
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,460
In that case, there is
something we can do.

295
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:17,539
It's an upward hill,
so I'll step on it.

296
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,900
Slow down, you fool.

297
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,970
The weight drags the van backwards.

298
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,809
I'll sit in the back next time.

299
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,009
Do that. Why do you always
sit in the back?

300
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,049
- Focus on the road.
- Okay.

301
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,329
- Don't scratch the coffin.
- Okay.

302
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,799
- Are these all the workers?
- There are more coming.

303
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,240
- Hurry up.
- Tie that side.

304
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,569
- Will you move it?
- The sun's setting.

305
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,210
That's it, right there.

306
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,579
Will you move faster?

307
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,049
- Take each of the ends.
- Okay.

308
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,849
Search carefully.

309
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,279
Take the front end first.

310
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,190
A bit deeper on the inside.

311
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,950
You aren't done yet? Are you?

312
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,930
Wait a bit. We're nearly there.

313
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:20,500
Work on the tent first.

314
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,369
I can't believe this.

315
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,900
We should've eaten first.

316
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,170
What's the matter?

317
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,079
That's it.

318
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,349
Watch your hand right there.

319
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,279
Okay. Now, lift.

320
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,049
- Slowly.
- Slowly, slowly.

321
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:41,890
Slowly.

322
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:45,390
- Hold the coffin steady.
- Hold the coffin.

323
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,259
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

324
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,460
- Get the coffin.
- Slowly.

325
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,829
- Slowly.
- Hold on.

326
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,369
Put that on the ground.

327
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,440
Ready?

328
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,619
Do your best for me.

329
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,490
Open it.

330
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,960
- 1, 2, 3.
- 2, 3.

331
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,500
It's open.

332
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,309
Get the DNA,

333
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,710
and close it back up.

334
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,079
Will you leave everything else
and take a rib?

335
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,329
It must've rot and cracked.

336
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,500
Do you think we have chicken bones?

337
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:04,400
Do we?

338
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,470
If you can't stay, get out.

339
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,309
Get out!

340
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,450
How much longer will it take?

341
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,480
You shouldn't have to wait too long.

342
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,160
- Hey!
- Hey!

343
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,630
- What are you doing?
- You wench!

344
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,930
That's my brother's grave!

345
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,930
You witch! Come here!

346
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,700
What have you done?

347
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,400
- Please.
- "Please"?

348
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,700
- I'm sorry!
- Who do you think you are?

349
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,700
I just hate your guts!

350
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,970
Stop it.

351
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,849
- You can't do this!
- Let go of me!

352
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,380
What are you doing?

353
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,619
Why are you doing this to me?

354
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:51,880
You!

355
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:59,759
Hey! What?

356
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:02,259
- How could you do this?
- You're crazy.

357
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,500
How could you dig up my brother?

358
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,240
A depressed fracture.

359
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,609
What do you think you're doing?

360
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,279
Stop this!

361
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,869
Who are you?

362
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,650
- Hey!
- Are you okay?

363
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:59,650
Save her!

364
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,250
Get her out of there!

365
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,990
Will you let go of my hair?

366
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,390
Will you let go, darn it?

367
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,460
- Go on.
- Keep coming.

368
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,599
- Looking good.
- Keep coming.

369
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,430
Keep coming. More, more, more.

370
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,000
That's it.

371
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,539
Open the trunk.

372
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,240
We booked a crematorium,
and we're taking our brother.

373
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,480
Okay, but the examination's
not over yet.

374
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,519
The examination?
What nonsense is that?

375
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,480
Close the coffin,
and hand our brother over.

376
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,619
If you don't, I'll have you
buried as well.

377
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,660
We're here
on official, legal business.

378
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,089
Even if you're family,
what you're doing is obstruction.

379
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,730
Obstruction, my foot.

380
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,099
Give us our brother.

381
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,869
- Come on.
- How is this obstruction?

382
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,599
- Be quiet.
- He's ours.

383
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,900
- Who pays you?
- Just hand him over!

384
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,440
He's our brother!

385
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,640
He needs an autopsy.

386
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,740
Let's hand him over...

387
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,410
and persuade his sisters.

388
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,450
- Let's get them to agree to it.
- What?

389
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,259
This is insane.
I can't believe this.

390
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:11,720
How dare you do this?

391
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,900
- Here he comes. Here he is.
- Deuk Nam!

392
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,660
- Deuk Nam.
- Deuk Nam.

393
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,869
- Deuk Nam.
- Hey!

394
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,569
- Hey, hey.
- Hey!

395
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:23,740
- What are you doing?
- No way.

396
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,539
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Just bring him this way.

397
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,339
- What is she doing?
- What's wrong with her?

398
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,670
- What are you doing?
- No, no!

399
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,410
- Hurry.
- Load him in the car.

400
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,480
- Put him in the car now.
- Hurry up.

401
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,849
- I want my kid to have a father.
- Let go.

402
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,579
- Please.
- He's already dead.

403
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,619
- Let's get in the car.
- I want my kid to have a father.

404
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:41,349
- Let's go.
- Come on, get in.

405
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,119
Please don't take him.

406
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,119
Deuk Nam! Deuk Nam!

407
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:55,569
My gosh.

408
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,759
(Psycho)

409
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,130
(28 Missed Calls)

410
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,930
What's going on?

411
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,200
Please excuse me.

412
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,109
Yes, this is Eun Sol speaking.

413
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:39,980
- Let's write an autopsy warrant.
- Pardon?

414
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,950
Sorry?

415
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,849
What are you talking about?

416
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,970
What is this? What?

417
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,640
- Where did Deuk Nam go?
- Where is he?

418
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,039
- Where did he go?
- My goodness.

419
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,809
- My goodness, where is he?
- What on earth happened?

420
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,710
Well...

421
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,279
- I stole a body.
- What?

422
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,869
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

423
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,869
- Hey, come quickly.
- Okay.

424
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,400
- Excuse me.
- Let's go.

425
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,740
Yes, why didn't you answer my calls?

426
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,809
Open the door.

427
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:45,910
- No!
- Hey!

428
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,750
- Excuse me!
- Hey, you!

429
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:50,349
Stop them.

430
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:51,380
- No.
- You can't be here.

431
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,819
- Get out of the way.
- Move.

432
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,119
- Move out of the way.
- Dr. Baek.

433
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:58,720
- You can't do this!
- Hey, Beom!

434
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,470
Hurry. Come on.

435
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,269
- Hurry up!
- Open up now!

436
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,109
- Please try again.
- Wait, what happened?

437
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,940
Sir, I think he must have
locked the system from inside.

438
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,410
- Give back my brother.
- Do you really want to die?

439
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:22,049
- What are you doing?
- How could an institution do this?

440
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,880
I won't let this slide.
You must open it now. Do it now!

441
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,890
All of you will lose your jobs
over this. Got that?

442
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,890
Bring me the master key.

443
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,930
- Hey, hurry up.
- Go.

444
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,930
- Okay.
- I can't believe this.

445
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,140
(Partners for Justice)

446
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,910
I gave her a fraud case
to take it easy.

447
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,880
She turned it into a murder case.

448
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,440
I thought he died in a hospital.
That's odd.

449
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,349
I shouldn't have left
Deuk Nam alone.

450
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,920
Now, this isn't
a simple fraud case anymore.

451
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,990
The three of you are prime suspects.

452
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,960
I will never forgive them.

453
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
I searched everywhere,
but I can't locate her.

454
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,529
She's the one we were looking for.

455
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:43,500
- A homicide?
- This could be a homicide.

456
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,859
- Is it Baek Beom again?
- Why did he call you of all people?

457
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,799
Did something happen
between you and Dr. Baek?

458
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,099
Don't trust him too much.
Just be careful.

459
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:52,099
Are you saying
the real murderer is on the move?

460
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,200
What is this?
