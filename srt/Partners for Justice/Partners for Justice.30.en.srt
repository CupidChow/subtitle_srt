00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,509
(Episode 30)

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:07,750
Prosecutor Do?

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,720
Sir, what brings you here?

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,720
That's my house.
What brings you here?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,390
I had to check something
from this house.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,589
By the way, do you know the person
who lives in that house?

7
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,559
That's Sergeant Choi
Hyun Seok's house.

8
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,629
I see. The detective
in the wheelchair?

9
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,399
Yes, that's him.
Is there something wrong?

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,609
I just need to check a few things
about the case, but he's not home.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,109
Did he go out?

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,909
Should I give him a call?

13
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,649
I have Detective Choi's son's
number at my house.

14
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,520
- I'd appreciate it.
- Sure.

15
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,719
Okay. Hurry it up. All right.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,390
I called...

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,159
Detective Choi's son,
so he should call you soon.

18
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:00,070
- Thank you.
- Have a seat.

19
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,170
- I should bring you something.
- Thank you.

20
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,640
(Prosecution Service)

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,849
My gosh.

22
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,150
- Prosecutor Eun.
- This is taking way too long.

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,590
Haven't you seen Prosecutor Do?

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,920
He was checking this side,
but he's gone.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,489
I haven't seen him.
Did you check this line already?

26
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:28,790
- They ordered the cleaner as well.
- Yes, they're all normal.

27
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,000
- Then let's get moving.
- Okay.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,129
Keep this. It's way too hot.

29
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,469
Wait.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,700
Why? What is it?

31
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,290
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

32
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,689
Watch it!

33
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,599
- My gosh.
- My pants are ruined.

34
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,569
This is Detective Choi's wheelchair.

35
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,349
- I got it. Have some.
- Oh, thank you.

36
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,780
It must be tough.

37
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,020
I hope you catch him soon.

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,860
- Is that your daughter?
- Yes.

39
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,129
How old is she?

40
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,000
She's 31 years old.

41
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,669
- Then was she born in 1988?
- But...

42
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,439
she passed away...

43
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,849
in a car accident two months ago.

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,120
Goodness, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

45
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,169
So...

46
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,770
I got a message that
they have the suspect's address.

47
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,379
I need to get going.

48
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,710
If it's okay, may I come with you?

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,909
It's always been a huge regret...

50
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,250
that I couldn't catch the culprit.

51
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,090
Yes, of course. Come with me.

52
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,960
I'll go get my jacket.

53
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,889
I'll wait. Take your time.

54
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,710
The door won't open.

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,310
Really?

56
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,889
You're right.

57
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,759
Are you okay?

58
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,500
Don't get near me.

59
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,439
Don't come.

60
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm going to kill you all. Don't!

61
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,480
Sir.

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,149
- Don't get near me!
- Put down your knife.

63
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,279
I'm going to kill myself!

64
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,949
Let's talk this out, okay?

65
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,250
Come on, detective to detective.

66
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,889
Let's have a chat, shall we?

67
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,120
Come on.
You weren't like this before.

68
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,959
You!

69
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,199
Let go. Let go of me!

70
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,100
- You jerk!
- You're arrested...

71
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,899
for the rape and murder of
Seong Hye Bin and Lee Kyung Ja.

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,040
You may consult a lawyer,
remain silent, decline to bear...

73
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,339
unfavorable testimony,

74
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,939
and ask the competent court to
review the legality of your arrest.

75
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,149
Did you think you'll always be free
hiding behind the police badge?

76
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:09,509
How do you call yourself
a detective?

77
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,079
- You jerk!
- Take him.

78
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:12,949
- Take him.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,689
Let go!

80
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,920
Are you all right?

81
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,089
Yes. Thank you.

82
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,189
I'm just doing my job.

83
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,189
Prosecutor Do!

84
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,959
- Let go, you jerk!
- Prosecutor Do.

85
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,699
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

86
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,300
Are you okay?

87
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,269
- Great timing.
- I know.

88
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,310
That was close.

89
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,810
This is Detective Choi's wheelchair.

90
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,180
Find out the name of the resident...

91
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,120
and the actual owner
on the registration.

92
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,189
Hey.

93
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,319
Both this house and that one are...

94
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,290
- owned by Detective Oh Jong Cheol.
- What?

95
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,899
Darn it.

96
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,040
Oh Jong Cheol is the culprit.

97
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,910
I got a message that
they have the suspect's address.

98
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,410
I need to get going.

99
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,649
In 1984, Um Ji Hye, Park Jeong Hye.

100
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:56,250
In 1985, Yoo Yeon Ja, Chae Han Hee.

101
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,959
In 1986, Jang Soon Ok,
Jeong Won Kyung.

102
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,860
In 1987, Han Geum Ji,
Han Myung Sook, Mo In Sook.

103
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,600
In 1988, Noh Ja Yeong.

104
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,800
Then in 2018, Seong Hye Bin
and Lee Kyung Ja.

105
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:10,540
Do you admit to raping
and murdering all of them?

106
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,939
All of the murders
from 30 years ago...

107
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,110
took place...

108
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,949
within 30 minutes of
walking distance from your house.

109
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:25,379
We could have easily found out
who the culprit was...

110
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,389
had we only connected the dots.

111
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,889
No one would have thought
that the detective...

112
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,290
who dedicated his entire career
over the last 13 years...

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,529
to arrest the culprit
was the murderer himself.

114
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,459
But you made sure you used
the situation to your benefit.

115
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,730
No, I'm sure
you enjoyed it secretly.

116
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,839
It was fun to see...

117
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,769
how they always went after
the wrong guys.

118
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,879
Tell us how that was possible.

119
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,079
That suspect profile
you love so much.

120
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,079
I made that.

121
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,990
Did you see the culprit or not?

122
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,519
I really didn't.
He had something over his face.

123
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,689
What about his voice?

124
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,790
I just heard him breathe.

125
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,500
If he got you from behind,
that means he's tall. No?

126
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,370
He's at least 180cm tall.
And he's strong, right?

127
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,529
- Wasn't he young?
- He was.

128
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,769
That's good. The culprit is
180cm tall and young.

129
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:22,769
- Yes.
- A strong man in his 20s.

130
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,709
- Right? Isn't that so?
- Yes.

131
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,709
When you get attacked,

132
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,220
the attacker seems huge to you.

133
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,850
Making the woman stick to my story
was a piece of cake.

134
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,690
Three months after
Lee Kyung Ja's incident,

135
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,960
your daughter was born.

136
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,759
- That's unrelated.
- No. It is related.

137
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,559
49 days after your daughter's death,

138
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,029
you began to...

139
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,769
kill people again after 30 years.

140
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:51,870
Why did you do that?

141
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,370
You're a meticulous guy.

142
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,909
I'm sure you didn't kill
just anyone.

143
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,840
She looked like her. My mom.

144
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,480
I'll take these.

145
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,519
Sure.

146
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,070
That's why we didn't find any semen.

147
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,710
You killed those women
in place of your mother.

148
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,470
It's called a family suicide.

149
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:33,009
When a parent kills their children
as they commit suicide.

150
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:34,580
I...

151
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,049
almost died with her
when my mom killed herself.

152
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,750
I was about 13 years old.

153
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,120
My mom gave me...

154
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:45,490
a beverage mixed with pesticides.

155
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,289
I almost died from that.

156
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:50,700
Is that why you only chose women
who looked like your mom?

157
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,500
To be honest,

158
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,570
you were just afraid.

159
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,509
- You don't know anything.
- You were scared...

160
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,970
after Lee Kyung Ja ran away.

161
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,309
"Someone has seen me." You were
scared that you'd get arrested.

162
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,549
- No?
- What do you know?

163
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,110
You're just using...

164
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,120
your mom and your daughter
as an excuse...

165
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,389
to hide your
hideous instinct to kill.

166
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:14,789
After your daughter died,

167
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,919
you couldn't hold back anymore
and killed another person.

168
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,590
Then you hid behind your
police badge like a coward.

169
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,200
No! What kind of nonsense is that?

170
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,769
(May 20, 1988, the 11th murder
of Wuseong Serial Murder)

171
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,259
Who's there?

172
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,070
It's me.

173
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,399
Detective Oh.

174
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,340
We have another one.

175
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:10,379
We were told to search the area.

176
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,879
I know that. I was peeing.

177
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,450
I searched this area. Go that way.

178
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,120
- Let's go that way.
- Okay.

179
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,059
This time, you drew
an even bigger picture, didn't you?

180
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:29,230
You joined us in the boardroom.

181
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,600
(Wuseong Serial Victims)

182
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,200
The witness. Let's go all the way.

183
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
You found out
where Lee Kyung Ja was.

184
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,179
Kang Chi Soo.

185
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,179
You wanted to make him
the killer but failed.

186
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,649
Then you tried to kill
Prosecutor Do in secret...

187
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,980
and frame your colleague
for the murders.

188
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,389
Choi Hyun Seok's home
is registered under your name.

189
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,889
The rifle bore-cleaner.

190
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,960
You had it delivered to
Detective Choi's house on purpose.

191
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,860
To create a way out for yourself
in case things went wrong.

192
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,799
You told Det. Choi that it's oil
to clean his wheelchair with.

193
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,639
Then you pretended like
something happened to his son...

194
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,970
and made a fake call.

195
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,539
We checked everything.

196
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,179
Okay.

197
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,889
Detective Choi,
you should go to your son.

198
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:28,320
To my son's?

199
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,659
Okay. Hurry it up. All right.

200
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,789
Rather than leave it unsolved,

201
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,759
putting someone in for it...

202
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,399
would make things
much safer for yourself.

203
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,669
You couldn't suppress
your urge to kill...

204
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,210
and became a serial killer
by killing 12 innocent women.

205
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,039
You still wanted to get away,

206
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,950
so you went so low as to
frame your own colleague.

207
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,809
That's what you truly are.

208
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,049
You managed to stay alive and well.

209
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,919
The rest of your days...

210
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:04,289
will be spent making up for
your crimes.

211
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,929
The statute of limitations lapsed
for the 30-year-old murders.

212
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:13,029
But the charges for killing
Seong Hye Bin and Lee Kyung Ja...

213
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,039
can keep you behind bars
until you die.

214
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,509
Prosecutor Do.

215
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:24,710
Your first case was a tough one,

216
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,980
and you did well.

217
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,610
- It was a huge success.
- Not at all.

218
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,519
Prosecutor Eun and the NFS
did all the work.

219
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,690
I learned a lot.

220
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,419
She joined me
to question the suspect,

221
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,190
and she even got me too.

222
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,730
It's your first year.

223
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,559
You'll become a great prosecutor.

224
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,730
Thank you.

225
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,269
I'll get a good case next time
and really do you proud.

226
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:49,100
Okay. I look forward to it.

227
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:51,799
- Detective Cha.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,169
You did very well
on the task force team.

229
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,610
Not really.
Thanks for letting me join.

230
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,879
Thanks for the meal.

231
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,610
- Well done.
- I want to arrest you.

232
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,750
Attention, please.

233
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,950
We should welcome Prosecutor Do.

234
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,490
I'll mix Criminal Division Eight's
traditional cocktail.

235
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,590
No thanks.

236
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,259
- Let me.
- Okay.

237
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,299
What? Oh, okay.

238
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,330
What?

239
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,370
Here you go.

240
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,980
They came out at once.

241
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,379
He has eggs.

242
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:35,580
Oh dear.

243
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,580
With some eggshells?

244
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,330
Double-yolk soju.
Chicken coop style.

245
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:50,730
Here.

246
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,169
Chief, with all my respect.

247
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,169
Prosecutor Do, this isn't how
you show your respect.

248
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:05,379
You can show it with
a soft glance, can't you?

249
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,080
It's well-stirred, sir.

250
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,179
They're special eggs, very fertile.

251
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,019
- Who'll drink it for me?
- No.

252
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:19,190
- So...
- Your shoelaces.

253
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:21,289
Tie them up tight.

254
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,690
They'll come off.

255
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,059
I'll drink it for you.

256
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,230
What?

257
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,429
- You'll drink that?
- It's nothing.

258
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,940
- Don't.
- No...

259
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,470
You're so manly. Totally my type.

260
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,080
That must smell.

261
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,039
That's so manly.

262
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,279
I'll tell you my wish later.

263
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,519
That was so cool.
Totally unlike someone else.

264
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,419
Do you have a death wish?

265
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,620
- Over there.
- The NFS people.

266
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,360
Hello.

267
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,529
You were of great help...

268
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,259
in solving the case
as part of the team.

269
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,669
You did all the hard work.

270
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,970
Please forget about
the misunderstanding that...

271
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,740
Mr. Kang caused.

272
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,070
It's all water under the bridge.

273
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,480
It seems that you're not yet over...

274
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,450
losing a very talented man.

275
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,220
We had our reasons, you see.

276
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,320
I'm sure you did.

277
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,090
But however skilled one may be,

278
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,330
one can never beat science.

279
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,700
Shouldn't we create a society where
justice trumps science?

280
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,870
We all work to uphold justice.

281
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,570
Science before justice.

282
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,799
Justice comes first.

283
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,340
- Chief.
- We...

284
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,879
How about Criminal Division Eight's
traditional cocktail?

285
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

286
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,179
- You mix it up.
- Sure.

287
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,889
Oh dear.

288
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

289
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,930
An old sock.

290
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,299
- There.
- It's done?

291
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,069
Aren't science and justice friends?

292
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,140
What are you doing?

293
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,910
- Prosecutor Eun.
- Look at that.

294
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,619
Well done.

295
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,190
Sir, let's show them
our traditional cocktail.

296
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,730
Okay. Make sure the ratio's
exactly 1 to 2 to 8.

297
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,299
- Casper's Law.
- Casper's Law.

298
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,930
- What law?
- Seong Joo, mix it up.

299
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,069
Yes, sir.

300
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,440
- Dr. Baek.
- What?

301
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,039
I need to be exact.

302
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,180
It's for autopsies.

303
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,710
- Did you wipe it?
- With wet wipes.

304
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,809
Okay.

305
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,589
We need a ruler
to make our traditional cocktail.

306
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,660
Current time is about 8:05pm.

307
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,359
I shall mix the cocktail.

308
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:12,400
One.

309
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:15,630
Two.

310
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,700
Eight.

311
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:20,339
Okay.

312
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,440
- Gosh.
- Who will start?

313
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,210
- Dr. Baek?
- I'll pass.

314
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,950
- Then I'll drink.
- Pass.

315
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,079
- Why?
- You must drive if there's a case.

316
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,049
Then it's yours.

317
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,690
What?

318
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,089
I can't put a kid to sleep drunk.

319
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,390
They all said no.

320
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,589
- I'll drink it.
- Wait, Stella.

321
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:41,160
No, wait.

322
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,430
I'm the chief, so I'll drink it.

323
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:57,839
Well done.

324
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,380
Nice.

325
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:00,950
Perfect.

326
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,690
One last shot. Thank you.

327
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,089
Thank you.

328
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,430
What are you eating?

329
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,869
That pig.

330
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,140
You'll lose her.

331
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,400
I might just...

332
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,869
What are you saying?
I won't lose her.

333
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:33,079
Look at that.
He's stealing your woman.

334
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,650
Go to her.
Don't end up like me.

335
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,779
I'm drunk.

336
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,319
- Like you?
- Look.

337
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,390
Be manly.

338
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,990
You did really well.

339
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,529
Aren't you with them, detective?

340
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:53,099
I'm not on any side.
I'm neutral, okay?

341
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:54,869
Right, Stella?

342
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,230
Whatever.

343
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,869
- One more shot, please.
- Okay.

344
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,150
Fine, Stella, you know...

345
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,920
I can't make cocktails,
grill meat or speak English.

346
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,089
I know I'm not good enough
in many ways.

347
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,089
But I'm a good judge of character.

348
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:27,000
I like you, Stella.

349
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,099
- Okay, cool.
- What?

350
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,640
I like you too.

351
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:32,799
Excuse me.

352
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,079
She spoke English and left?
I should take English lessons.

354
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,079

- Why sit here among...

355
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,890
- all the other seats?
- No, I...

356
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,119
- I like this seat.
- What...

357

What? Clueless about what?

359
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,930
Can't you see that
I'm trying to win her over?

360
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,730
- Please help me out here, man.
- Same here.

361
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,970
I've been trying for three months.

362
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,539
- I've been trying for 3 years.
- 3 years... What?

363
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,869
It's not over until it's over.

364

I'm taking English classes
in the morning.

366
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,250
What?

367
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:17,779
English classes...

368
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,119
- One more shot, please.
- Sure.

369
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,920
It's my pleasure.

370
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:26,960
I'm fine...

371
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:28,890
Wait. Stella.

372
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,569
Hey, take a seat. Sit down.

373
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,869
- This is red.
- Why did you dye it red?

374
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,380
- Like pinkish red?
- That's the prettiest color.

375
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,410
- My goodness.
- Why did you do that for?

376
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,450
- That's not what it is.
- Really?

377
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,849
- Then what is it?
- What?

378
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,250
- Gosh, it's an accomplishment.
- We solved a good one.

379
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,650
- Where did he go?
- That was really fun.

380
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,619
Since it's in the morning,
I can't sleep.

381
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,089
- That's right.
- Prosecutor Oh was really good.

382
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,759
- I used to play soccer too.
- Solving the case...

383
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,430
- Solving the case was awesome.
- Sure, sure. The striker...

384
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,500
And this case was...

385
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,700
the biggest cold case...

386
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,910
You really are an outcast.

387
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,319
- I didn't know we could do this.
- Exactly.

388
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,490
This is Baek Beom speaking.

389
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,859
I'm on my way.

390
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,200
- Let's go.
- What? Where?

391
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,470
It's a murder.

392
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,539
I've been drinking.

393
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,410
- What?
- Me too.

394
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
Me too.

395
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,279
You said you couldn't drink
because of your daughter.

396
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,440
It all worked out because of that.

397
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,549
- How will you get there?
- I'll take a taxi.

398
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,779
- Gosh.
- It's here.

399
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:56,880
- Drink it.
- Hey.

400
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
- Drink that.
- That's mine.

401
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,549
I got a message. Let me show you.

402
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,289
I think Prosecutor Eun sent me this.

403

- Prosecutor Eun.

I... I'll get going now.

00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,599
- Hey.
- You come back here.

407
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,170
- I'm not an outcast.
- No, you're not.

408
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,240
Why would I be an outcast?

409
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,539
- No, no.
- You're not an outcast.

410
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:20,670
- Look at this.
- No, you're not.

- Why would I be...
- Forget about that.

we plan to introduce the matter
of reinstating Director Oh.

423

So far, about 45 percent of

swore and verbally abused his driver
leaked to the public.

he didn't need the money.
