1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,640
(Episode 24)

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,349
What on earth happened in this room?

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,250
- Soo Yeon.
- Yes?

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,890
Swab the bloodstains,
and get the stuff in this room.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,260
Okay.

6
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,230
- Detective Kang.
- Yes?

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,530
Check the computer over there.

8
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,079
It's bitcoin again.

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,619
- Again?
- What?

10
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,820
You know what bitcoin is, right?
That has become a problem lately.

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
We are instructed to
check the computers...

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,020
for suicide and unknown cases.

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,859
Yesterday, the rate plummeted.
It was a huge scandal.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,130
How many times were we dispatched
because of bitcoin cases yesterday?

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,600
3 cases for vandalism.
2 disputes between drunk people.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,969
Five gangster cases.

17
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,769
I bet he was infuriated yesterday.

18
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:08,969
That's possible.

19
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,439
70 percent of the assailants for
abuse are live-in family members.

20
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,349
And 4 people out of 10 are...

21
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,209
the sons.

22
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,750
It's obvious what happened here.

23
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,689
I didn't find anything.

24
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,730
Gosh! It's a rat. A rat!

25
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,900
Why is there a rat here?

26
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,640
Move.

27
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,680
Did you find anything?

28
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,420
Yes.

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,120
- You scared me.
- What are you doing?

30
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,390
- It died not too long ago.
- Is that so?

31
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,569
- Hey, wrap this up.
- Okay.

32
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,569
- What? This?
- You're taking that?

33
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:13,039
What are you doing?
It's just a dead rat.

34
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,870
- Please don't joke about that.
- What are you doing? Bag it.

35
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,840
The quarantine headquarters
take care of dead animals.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,150
Just bag it.

37
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,180
Hey, that...

38
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,189
We're going to investigate the son.
Why would you...

39
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,289
I don't care about the living.
But a dead rat is a different story.

40
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:34,729
It's the right call to suspect
the son who's alive now.

41
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,259
He lost all of his money and tried
to get the insurance money.

42
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:38,930
There you go again with your novel.

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,530
But it sucks. It has no twists.

44
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,139
This.

45
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,770
You scared me!
Why? Why are you giving it to me?

46
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,409
Chain of custody.

47
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,280
The police have to
take the evidence.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,949
(It's a way to assure there are
no changes in the initial evidence.)

49
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,349
It's not like I can call
an ambulance for rats.

50
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,750
- A cooler would be perfect.
- What?

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,460
- He said to put it in the cooler.
- Wait.

52
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,319
- This...
- Hey!

53
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:09,789
It died with its eyes open.
It must've been upset. Look at this.

54
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,659
Hey!

55
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,569
- Mr. Kang, wait for me.
- Hey!

56
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,969
Here you go.

57
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,599
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- No problem.

58
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,020
(From Soo Ho)

59
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,289
Exhibit 18 from the scene.

60
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,620
It's a dead rat.

61
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,090
Exhibit what? A dead rat?

62
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:15,659
It was found dead under the table
at Yeom Sang Goo's house.

63
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,759
It's a rat. A rat.
Do you think there's a cake inside?

64
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,930
So what do you want us
to do with it?

65
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,569
Swab its fur, please.

66
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,610
Dr. Baek wants us to test
all the dust and dirt in the fur...

67
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,009
for its substance.

68
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,740
He's unstoppable.

69
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:34,480
Please carry on.

70
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,850
Go.

71
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,819
What's this?

72
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,560
What is it? Is it your first time
seeing a dead rat?

73
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,959
"To Stella with love."

74
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,300
"From Protector Cha"?

75
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,639
Yes, enjoy the cake. Cake...

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,870
The rat...

77
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,410
Stella.

78
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:04,639
Stella.

79
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,180
No, no!

80
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,600
Please. Stella!

81
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,800
Don't look!

82
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,839
No, Stella. Don't look.
Don't open it. No.

83
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,420
Stella, I'm sorry.

84
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,750
I made a mistake.

85
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,790
This is a surprise, right?

86
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,120
No, this was supposed to
go to the other room, but...

87
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,259
Fantastic.

88
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,959
What? "Fantastic"?

89
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:00,399
Stella, isn't this disgusting?
This is a dead rat.

90
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,230
Don't look at that. It's not good
for you. Don't look at it.

91
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,240
I received a dead rat
after breaking up with my ex.

92
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,839
"Ex"? Ex as in...

93
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,509
- your ex-boyfriend?
- Some guys are like that.

94
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,339
Love hurts.

95
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,610
Anyway,

96
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,220
good job.
You kept this fresh and safe.

97
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,879
Okay. Thanks.

98
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,889
Put this back in.
I must take it back.

99
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,490
This is from me.

100
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,769
The tie we found
at the victim's house.

101
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,170
I found a lot of epidermal cells
on the tie.

102
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,370
Most of the cells belong to
the victim himself,

103
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,910
but I found some that belong to
Yeom Dae Sik who lived with him.

104
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,009
The son tied it.

105
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,850
I'll notify the Prosecutors' Office.

106
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,529
(Yeom Dae Sik,
Yeom Sang Goo's second son)

107
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,399
From the tie in the master bedroom,

108
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,730
we found your DNA.

109
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,769
It proves that you tied him up.

110
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,910
There were a lot of bloodstains
in your room.

111
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,240
Did you abuse your dad in that room?

112
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,480
We'll have the analysis report
from the NFS soon.

113
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,050
So I advise you to confess.

114
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,149
I did tie my dad up.

115
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,720
He had dementia.

116
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,990
Dementia?

117
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,689
It's been about six months.

118
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,290
It got worse.

119
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,990
He often disappeared.

120
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,430
He always went out on rainy days.
He caused trouble too.

121
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:12,930
I had no choice.

122
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,569
But I don't understand how
you could tie up your own dad.

123
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,540
Did you tie him up all day long?

124
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,670
Let's see if you won't do the same
after nursing such a patient.

125
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,069
It was really hard for me.

126
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,439
Why didn't you ask
your brother and sister for help?

127
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,550
I did.

128
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,879
But no one cared.

129
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,350
Then it should've ended
with only tying him up.

130
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,019
Why did you hit him?

131
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,389
Didn't you assault him as well?

132
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,590
Your room was covered in blood.

133
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,360
And that's how you got
the wounds on your hands.

134
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,970
You also went through treatment
for anger management.

135
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,470
I checked the treatment record.

136
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,409
You can't control your emotions
when you get angry. Is that it?

137
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,909
And your condition
worsened recently.

138
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,639
Should I tell you why?

139
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,679
(Recent Transactions)

140
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,090
The record of your last month's
transactions for virtual money.

141
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,259
You put in the living expenses
that your brother sent you,

142
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,759
but it became useless.

143
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,929
Why is it a problem
for me to use my own money?

144
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,700
You never flinched...

145
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,769
when I mentioned
your dad, brother, and sister.

146
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:23,769
But you became emotional...

147
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,840
when I mentioned virtual money.

148
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,940
I guess you are angrier about
losing virtual money...

149
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,580
than sitting in here...

150
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,679
as a suspect
who murdered your father.

151
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,710
Prosecutor Eun.

152
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,720
- I have a favor to ask.
- What is it?

153
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,450
May I use a cell phone?

154
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,159
Just for five seconds. Please?

155
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,159
Darn it.
Let me see the darned phone!

156
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,929
Let me see a phone!

157
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,330
Why can't I see a darned phone?

158
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,769
- Calm down.
- I need to see a phone!

159
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,269
The bloodstains found in your room.

160
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,139
We'll soon find out
whose blood that is.

161
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,509
- Take him outside.
- What did I do?

162
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:07,710
All I've done is...

163
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,779
What's going on with Dae Sik?

164
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,320
We're investigating
the case right now.

165
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,720
When did you last see your father?

166
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,289
Well, it's...

167
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,429
(Yeom Dae Chul, 43 years old,
Yeom Sang Goo's eldest son)

168
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,759
Do you not remember?

169
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,570
I asked him for help
when my business was suffering,

170
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,970
but he flat out said no.

171
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,899
That was five years ago.

172
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,909
I didn't see him ever since.

173
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,509
Not even once?

174
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:39,580
No.

175
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,909
But I've done all I should
as his son.

176
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,120
I continuously sent him
800 dollars a month.

177
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,450
I see.

178
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,990
Dae Sik was...

179
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,889
my father-in-law's favorite
because he had him late.

180
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,860
That's why he had
a weird personality.

181
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,100
He sat around doing nothing
after he got discharged.

182
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,970
You must have thought
he was pathetic.

183
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,600
To be honest,
we were very disappointed.

184
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
We had a tough time making a living,

185
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,070
but we always had to do
all the difficult things...

186
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,110
while Dae Sik
sat around doing nothing.

187
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,340
I heard your husband
didn't visited him in years.

188
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,379
What about you?

189
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,980
Have you recently seen
your father or Yeom Dae Sik?

190
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,620
If my husband didn't see them,

191
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,490
there's no reason
for a daughter-in-law to.

192
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:27,230
We had no time to pay attention.

193
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,100
I had to take up a part-time job
to make ends meet.

194
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,870
I knew Dae Sik would do this.

195
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,600
(Yeom Ji Sook, 38 years old,
Yeom Sang Goo's daughter)

196
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,370
He lived off of our dad,

197
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:40,440
and he never became
a man of his own.

198
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,110
Do you think your brother did this?

199
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,480
How can he...

200
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:47,379
tie him up like that...

201
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,480
and beat him?

202
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,279
My goodness.

203
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:59,590
This really breaks my heart.

204
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,860
Then why didn't you do anything
before he died?

205
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,100
It's been...

206
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,330
five years since I got divorced.

207
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,970
I couldn't face my dad
after my marriage failed.

208
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,409
Don't you think
I've done well as his daughter...

209
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,350
to make a living on my own?

210
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,450
Excuse me, Prosecutor Eun.

211
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,090
Take a look at this.

212
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,360
Yeom Dae Sik's dad's
burial is tomorrow.

213
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,100
He asked me to temporarily
suspend his confinement...

214
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,200
to let him go to the burial.
What should I do?

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
Is that tomorrow?

216
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,940
Well, I guess
he wants to see him off...

217
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,110
since they lived together for long.

218
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,379
Goodness. Why did he abuse him
while they lived together?

219
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,509
You can let him go if he agrees
to go with a police officer.

220
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,679
Sure.

221
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,980
I'll ask Lieutenant Cha
to accompany him.

222
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,019
Excuse me.

223
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,330
All of your guests
only gave us 50-dollar bills.

224
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,100
Quantity over quality.

225
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,629
See? I got the most envelopes.

226
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,669
That's great-aunt.

227
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,299
This is for me.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,840
This isn't yours. It's mine.

229
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,110
Goodness.

230
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,940
Let's see.

231
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:28,350
Since she gave me 300 dollars,

232
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,950
you can take 100.

233
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,580
What? Give me half of that.

234
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,620
You never had to deal with her.

235
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,230
This is mine.

236
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,230
Fine, you can have that.

237
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,240
I'm sure it's one of your friends
who'd come and leave...

238
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,470
just 10 dollars in a funeral.

239
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,909
Honey.

240
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,440
Isn't this the company
you used to go to?

241
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,279
You're right.

242
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,409
I didn't even call them.
How did they know?

243
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,679
What? Five dollars?

244
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:06,750
My goodness.

245
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,990
They probably got this
mixed up with a 50-dollar bill.

246
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,259
Goodness.
I can't believe this nonsense.

247
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,269
You. How dare you come here?

248
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:21,529
That crazy...

249
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,639
You crazy idiot.
What if someone sees you?

250
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:25,740
Dae Sik.

251
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,509
They're so embarrassing.

252
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:30,539
What? Get out of here.

253
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,210
He got permission to come.

254
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,980
I hate that kid.

255
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
Goodness.

256
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,220
Let's go, Detective Cha.

257
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:42,720
Let's go.

258
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,230
It took some time to check
all the bloodstains.

259
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,299
I only found his blood.

260
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,240
What do we do now?
They arrested him.

261
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,710
Goodness. How can this be?

262
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,379
I was 100-percent sure
that he was murdered.

263
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:05,940
You can't be 100-percent sure.

264
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,580
Only 0.3 percent of all deaths in
a year are caused by murder.

265
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:09,980
Then did he die naturally?

266
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,049
We need to do a biopsy.

267
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,750
Prepare a slide of his heart cell.

268
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,750
Okay.

269
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,820
(A Death of a Man in His 70s)

270
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,929
Prosecutor Eun,
have you been free lately?

271
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,500
This isn't a criminal case.

272
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,129
Why are you obsessing over
an old man who died?

273
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,600
I found circumstances of abuse
by his youngest son.

274
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,500
The bloodstains found...

275
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,669
in the suspect's room
all turned out to be his own.

276
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,309
- You can't prove his assault.
- But...

277
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:40,379
they picked and chose funeral halls
to hide the cause of his death...

278
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,710
and fabricated
his death certificate as well.

279
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,679
They did that to get
insurance money.

280
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,289
- Exactly.
- Yes.

281
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:49,220
They did something that absurd...

282
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,419
to get some more money.

283
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:54,059
They're a dysfunctional family.
However,

284
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,330
they aren't murderers.

285
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,269
Things are hectic
after Prosecutor Kang resigned.

286
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,639
Can we please keep it low
until we have his replacement?

287
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,039
Conclude this case
without an indictment,

288
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,039
and let go of his son immediately.

289
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,950
Let's not cause more problems
with an unreasonable investigation.

290
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,120
(A Death of a Man in His 70s)

291
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,820
- Yes.
- Why did you do that?

292
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,519
- Why do you blame me?
- Okay.

293
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,690
I got it.

294
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,259
- What did I do?
- Hey, Dae Chul.

295
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,500
- Yes?
- It's the Prosecutor's Office.

296
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,000
Dae Sik has been acquitted.

297
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,629
- They're letting him go.
- What?

298
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,200
Then is the investigation over?

299
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,799
Of course.

300
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:46,179
Everything is over,
so we need to be quick.

301
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,509
Okay.

302
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:49,950
Ji Sook. Hey.

303
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,450
Here.

304
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,529
The insurance money for
my dad's death will be...

305
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,960
approved now, right?

306
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,829
Oh, didn't you know?

307
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,069
Once an autopsy is under way,

308
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,569
we need the autopsy result
before we pay out...

309
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,839
any insurance money.

310
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,539
I can't believe you.

311
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,680
We brought you
that death certificate.

312
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,480
I apologize, but that's our policy.

313
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,720
Then what about the coverage?

314
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,990
If the cause of his death
is a heart attack,

315
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,089
you can get extra coverage.

316
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,390
Then how much do we get in total?

317
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,490
In total...

318
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,059
You'll get 300,000 dollars
for his death,

319
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,759
then extra 100,000 dollars
for a death with heart attack.

320
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,000
You can get up to 400,000 dollars.

321
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,460
I heard that man's
assault couldn't be proved.

322
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:07,490
Was this a case with natural death,
which you hate?

323
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,390
- A natural death?
- We don't know yet.

324
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,369
Can I keep this?

325
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:19,069
Do you know what it is?

326
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,539
Someone's heart muscles
400 times enlarged.

327
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:25,509
And I also see some dead muscles,
infection, and even hemorrhage.

328
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,910
Is this a heart attack?

329
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,579
You can even read that?

330
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,220
Pathology is my second major.

331
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:35,990
What do you want to do with that?

332
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,660
It's a perfect design for a scarf.

333
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,789
Doctor Baek.

334
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,160
Jin Dol just had kids. Six pups.

335
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,200
Oh, my gosh. Can I go see them?

336
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,269
But the pups had...

337
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:52,539
rice gruel with medicine
I made for Jin Dol.

338
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,839
I'm not sure if I should
take them to a hospital.

339
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:57,380
Poor doggies.
Which medicine did you give them?

340
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,779
Virbac calci delice?

341
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,450
- Do you want to go and see?
- Okay.

342
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:04,819
Where is the rat?

343
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,890
We have an emergency.

344
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,589
You can't come down here.

345
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,619
Move. Where's the director?

346
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,960
- Get the director.
- What are you doing?

347
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,799
- Calm down.
- Give us our dad!

348
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,319
I'm sorry you had to
see me at my worst.

349
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,160
You could've taken a longer break.

350
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:46,460
Will you be okay?

351
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,660
Yes. I'm fine.

352
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,859
Is this it?

353
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,299
Here you are.

354
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:58,039
I apologize.
They're a victim's relatives.

355
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,839
Okay.

356
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:02,809
Have a seat.

357
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,549
When can we get
our father's autopsy report?

358
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,450
The thing is, we don't
have a conclusion yet.

359
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,559
The medical examiner...

360
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,259
I looked into it.

361
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,430
You can tell if it was
a heart attack...

362
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,859
from a heart muscle tissue biopsy.

363
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,430
Why are you stalling?

364
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,700
The person who did
the autopsy. Is he here?

365
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,470
I must see him right now.

366
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,269
We lodged a complaint online...

367
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,670
and left a message
on the Blue House's website.

368
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,680
We won't let you off lightly.

369
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,779
We'll sue you as well.

370
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,150
- Go and bring Dr. Baek.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,730
We're ready for the autopsy.

372
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,970
Loupe.

373
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,849
Current time, 7:57am.

374
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,609
We'll begin the autopsy. Scalpel.

375
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:37,170
- Send to Toxicology.
- Okay.

376
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,170
Toxicology?

377
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,869
Must I repeat myself?

378
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,240
Okay.

379
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,440
Forceps.

380
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,250
That's all trash.

381
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,190
- They're omnivorous.
- I know. So they eat rat poison.

382
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,490
Let's just do the autopsy.

383
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,329
Are you kidding me?
A full toxicology report on a rat?

384
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,269
Oh my. This isn't
National Geographic.

385
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:09,569
- It's evidence.
- What if you get nothing?

386
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,500
What if there's rat poison?

387
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,039
If a rat dies of rat poison, is that
a poisoning or a natural death?

388
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:19,309
If it's unrelated to the case,
I'll pay for the tests. Now go.

389
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,109
It'll cost you.

390
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,160
The old man's family
is causing a nuisance, so what...

391
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,259
What are you doing?

392
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:34,660
Can't you see? It's an autopsy.

393
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,400
We found it dead outside
Yeom Sang Goo's home.

394
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,529
Dead animals aren't
within our jurisdiction.

395
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,269
If this causes a problem later...

396
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,400
I'll take the blame. Get out.

397
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,539
You're crazy.

398
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,740
What's going on?

399
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,210
- Gosh.
- What are you doing?

400
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,210
- Darn.
- Did you cut open a rat?

401
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:57,819
What about the family
that's screaming for a report?

402
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:58,980
Tell them to wait.

403
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,789
Toxicology tests take an hour.
Can't they wait that long?

404
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,529
You got something?

405
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,470
I have the rat's toxicology report
which was never done here before.

406
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,740
- And?
- Mickey Mouse...

407
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,440
went on a hunt into the sea.

408
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,710
What?

409
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,210
The body...

410
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,049
I mean, the dead rat
went hunting in the sea.

411
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,220
Who let the rats out?

412
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,750
What are you talking about? A hunt?

413
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,220
In the sea?

414
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,019
Fugu. Blowfish.

415
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,059
What?

416
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,430
Blowfish poison.
Also called tetrodotoxin.

417
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:46,460
This rat ingested poison.

418
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,970
Poor rat. Who killed you?

419
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,799
Are you saying the rat was poisoned?

420
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:52,839
And...

421
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,269
it wasn't just the rat that
went blowfish hunting.

422
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,509
(Tetrodotoxin, positive)

423
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,549
Yeom Sang Goo tagged along.

424
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,359
How long are they making
us busy people wait?

425
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,430
How long must we wait?

426
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,630
Kim Hyo Jin, you work at
a blowfish sashimi restaurant.

427
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,230
Yes. So what?

428
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,440
Kim Hyo Jin, as per Article 250
Clause 2 of the Penal Code,

429
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,140
you're under arrest for
the parricide of Yeom Sang Goo.

430
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,250
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?

431
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:39,880
See for yourself. Let's go.

432
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,819
Honey. Was it really you?

433
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,559
Did you really do it?

434
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,630
How could you?
How dare you kill our father?

435
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,670
How could you do such a thing?

436
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,670
How could you?

437
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,680
You did that,
and you call yourself human?

438
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,990
(Partners for Justice)

439
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,829
(Sudden Death: Unexpected death
in a short period)

440
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,279
Your blowfish restaurant
sells these.

441
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,220
We found traces of it
in Yeom Sang Goo's blood.

442
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,430
You said you hadn't seen him
in over five years.

443
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,059
You lied.

444
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,299
Will you tell me what happened?

445
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,470
A month or so ago,

446
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,579
I went to see him
out of desperation.

447
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,380
(A month before Yeom's death,
May 18, 2:18pm)

448
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,859
Father, we're about to
lose everything...

449
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:31,200
and end up on the streets.

450
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,230
This house is worth much more now.

451
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,900
We'll sell it for a good price
and find you a nicer place to stay.

452
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,109
Father.

453
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:44,109
I have no money. I have nothing.

454
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:45,910
Just this once.

455
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,279
Help us out just
this one time, Father.

456
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:53,349
We could all die.

457
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:56,420
Please.

458
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,319
I said we could die,
but he didn't bat an eyelid.

459
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,460
I couldn't stand him.

460
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,829
So...

461
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,829
you took the poisoned pellets?

462
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,869
We handed them out...

463
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:12,200
to our VIP customers.

464
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,450
How does this cure cancer?

465
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,849
It contains poison. It could kill.

466
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:28,650
It doesn't cure cancer.

467
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:31,960
I took a few of these once.

468
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,460
I almost died myself.

469
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,599
If an old person takes this,
it could really kill.

470
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:41,329
- You bet.
- Let's be careful.

471
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:42,730
Old people?

472
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,599
(A week before Yeom's death,
June 11, 10:39pm)

473
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,039
I was furious,

474
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,670
and I couldn't sleep.

475
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,579
So I got the idea.

476
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:01,190
They said it wouldn't kill.

477
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:04,259
So I just...

478
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,329
Father.

479
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,099
We sorted out
our financial situation.

480
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,230
You needn't worry.

481
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,640
They say this is
really good for you.

482
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,440
It was hard to get.

483
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,549
Make sure you take it.

484
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,220
I didn't think...

485
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,890
he'd suddenly die a week later.

486
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,259
Yeom Sang Goo had dementia.

487
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,230
What?

488
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,700
What do you mean?

489
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,400
He was demented?

490
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,170
When you saw him,

491
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,109
I bet he was unable to
make sense of the situation.

492
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,180
I really had no idea.

493
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,539
I swear.

494
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,549
Even if you did, would that
have changed anything?

495
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,380
It wasn't just me.

496
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,319
Ji Sook and my husband...

497
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,359
Everyone had gone mad.

498
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,460
Everyone wondered
when that old geezer would die...

499
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:15,089
and why he was still breathing.

500
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,099
Everyone was waiting for him to die.

501
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:22,799
It wasn't just me.

502
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,589
Kim Hyo Jin confessed
that she stole tetrodotoxin...

503
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:48,259
from the restaurant
and confessed to the act.

504
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:53,529
Here's the analysis report of
tetrodotoxin for Yeom Sang Goo.

505
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:55,799
(Toxic Substance Report)

506
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,269
- So what?
- That's not the cause of death.

507
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,710
He didn't take a lethal dose.

508
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:03,910
What?

509
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:31,470
(Partners for Justice)

510
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,970
If this isn't it either,
what would've caused the shock?

511
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,470
I'm trying to figure that out
with the pork skin.

512
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,579
For the past five years, his son
and daughter didn't contact him.

513
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:42,210
They came to visit their father,
and their father died the next day.

514
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,019
Gosh, this one looks fun.

515
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:45,650
I won't be bored. That's for sure.

516
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,849
Hold on. I don't think
you can untie that just like that.

517
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,690
Then why don't you move it?

518
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,259
Gosh, you're really bad-tempered.
