1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:02,770
Kim Joon Tae, 22.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,540
Yeon Mi Rae's boyfriend
of three months.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,119
- There's the demon's face.
- Kim Joon Tae!

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,189
Darn it. I think
he already skipped town.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,359
I think he's leaving Korea
by ferry, not plane.

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,820
- What?
- I found a photo of a port.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,890
Gungpyeong Port?

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,030
(Episode 11)

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,770
- Hwarang 17 is right there.
- Okay.

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,640
Stay here for a second.

11
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,270
Let's spread out to look for him.

12
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,379
You should've gone to the airport.

13
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,780
Why did you come here?

14
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,419
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,830
But I'm not as bad as you think.

16
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,870
Are you all right?

17
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,169
You scumbag!

18
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,780
Let go of me!

19
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,479
- The police are on their way now.
- Okay. Mr. Kang.

20
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,490
- What is he doing?
- Darn it. Come on, move it.

21
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,789
Hey, you!

22
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,599
Are you all right?

23
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,000
- Darn it.
- My gosh.

24
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,870
You're done for.

25
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,639
Let's make this easy.

26
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,110
Come here. Come.

27
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,120
I let my guard down. That's all.

28
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:31,750
I let my guard down.

29
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,449
Hey, don't you even watch movies?

30
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,250
In the movies, they let criminals
throw a few punches.

31
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,889
Starting now, everything I do
will be self-defense.

32
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,360
You scumbag.
Let me just punch you once.

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,430
Just one punch.

34
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,159
My gosh, that hurts.

35
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,099
You don't even have respect
for your elders.

36
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,039
You little rat. That's why
you beat up fragile women.

37
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,310
You little brat. You only learned
how to be awful. You dirtbag!

38
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,460
Hey, hey. Hold on.

39
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,259
Hey, cut it out!

40
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,470
My gosh, that jerk.

41
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,500
Hey, I'm...

42
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,769
I'm in front of the cold storage.

43
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,639
Hey, hey, hey!

44
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:30,939
You're going to hurt yourself.

45
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,149
Seriously?
There are no elevators here.

46
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,889
Hey! Stop right there.

47
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,100
Hey, hey, hey!

48
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,000
You're a piece of work, aren't you?

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,240
Hey, hey! Seriously.
That little brat.

50
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,410
My gosh, that's steep. Goodness.
My gosh.

51
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,889
I see him. Right there!

52
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,389
- Run, run!
- To the harbor.

53
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,129
That's enough. See?
You have nowhere to run now.

54
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:22,360
Come here. Come here!

55
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:25,560
- Let me go!
- You jerk.

56
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,069
You scumbag.

57
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,540
My gosh, that was tough!

58
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,879
You little rat. It's over now.
It's over.

59
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,220
Hey, he's right here! Take him away.
I collared him!

60
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,689
- He's my collar. Hurry up.
- This is...

61
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,759
Come on, go easy on me.

62
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,360
That hurts.

63
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,290
- Thank you.
- It stings even more. Why is that?

64
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,230
This hurts so much.
Prosecutor Eun, are you all right?

65
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,569
- Yes. Are you all right?
- No, I'm not fine.

66
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,939
What's wrong with this?

67
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,209
Hey, Hyun.

68
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,009
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,819
- I came too late, didn't I?
- No.

70
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,050
- He showed up like a comet.
- Hey.

71
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,449
Good job.

72
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,060
Weren't you scared?

73
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,259
You inkling was critical
in apprehending the suspect.

74
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,629
I have newfound respect for you.

75
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,699
Are you complimenting me now?

76
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,129
- Let's go to the hospital...
- No.

77
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,470
My job hasn't finished yet.
Let's go back to the office.

78
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,410
- Sol, come on.
- Hyun.

79
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,069
Do you know the term,
"safe breakup?"

80
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,009
It's a sad, new word which means
breakups need to be safe.

81
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,750
Yeon Mi Rae...

82
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,350
She couldn't get any help.

83
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,949
She desperately wanted
to escape from his abuse.

84
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,990
She only escaped it through death.

85
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,259
I want to take this to the end.

86
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,500
I really think I should.

87
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,639
- Why does this sting so much?
- Yes, it stings a bit.

88
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,370
Goodness. Darn it.

89
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,779
What are you going to do now?

90
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,509
- Let's go.
- Yes.

91
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,750
I never even thought of that.

92
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:31,689
Maggots.

93
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,930
I could've completely
fooled you all.

94
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,399
To be honest,

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,300
I was amazed.

96
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,269
You just have to know the pattern.

97
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,269
The pattern?

98
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,040
Cha Soo Ho has...

99
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,709
a very specific pattern of behavior.

100
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,139
He drinks on his day off...

101
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,949
and always gets the same beer
at the same convenience store.

102
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,120
You just need to follow him around
for a few days to find his pattern.

103
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:02,319
Police officers always work
in three shifts,

104
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,990
so they always have
a specific day off.

105
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,189
Then you took the evidence...

106
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,389
and took it to Lieutenant Cha's
place on the right day.

107
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,300
Investigators always go after...

108
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,860
the smallest evidence
and DNAs, right?

109
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,500
I kept it around for you.

110
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,470
First off,

111
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,069
I erased the evidence
that lead to me.

112
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:22,509
Then the first lead needed to be...

113
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,839
something very obvious.

114
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,750
Here you go. Thanks a lot.

115
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,470
Thanks.

116
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,269
Then create a decisive proof...

117
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,940
so that he cannot deny the charges.

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Where is...

119
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,899
the other pair?

120
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,769
The blood found on
the steering wheel was Yeon's...

121
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,669
and so was the blood found on
the towel left in the driver's seat.

122
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,580
And the towel was the same sort
as the one from the victim's house.

123
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:37,220
Then I made a report
in case you might've missed him.

124
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,750
I even changed my voice.

125
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,490
It seems like they used
a voice changing device.

126
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,690
The sound is a bit messy.

127
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,159
Yesterday at dawn, I saw a man...

128
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,190
coming from that corner,
wearing just one shoe.

129
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,129
Why did you kill her?

130
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,080
Because I loved her.

131
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,779
What?

132
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,580
Darn you.

133
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,490
Mi Rae.

134
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,960
Did you sleep with that cop?

135
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,299
You did. Didn't you?

136
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,330
Mi Rae.

137
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,269
Mi Rae.

138
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,269
I love you.

139
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,309
I really love you!

140
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,950
Darn it.

141
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:46,019
Darn you. Are you scared of me?

142
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,049
Then what do you like
so much about him?

143
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:49,889
I can't live without you.

144
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,159
I love you.

145
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,230
And Mi Rae...

146
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,870
loves me too.

147
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,570
She went a bit crazy
because of Cha Soo Ho.

148
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,340
But she didn't realize that and
asked me to break up with her.

149
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:12,940
I...

150
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,549
still love Mi Rae.

151
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,350
That's why I killed her.

152
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,259
No.

153
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,789
I didn't do this.

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,330
Mi Rae. Why did you do it?

155
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,840
It's all because of you.

156
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,870
I didn't do this.

157
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:41,840
It's because of him.

158
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,309
This happened because
he got between us.

159
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:49,009
So this is all because of him.

160
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,379
I didn't do this.
It's all because of him.

161
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,490
It's all that jerk's doing.

162
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,429
Mi Rae can't leave me anymore.

163
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,669
She can't ask me
to break up with her.

164
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,139
What did you say?

165
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,549
I should've killed you.

166
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,820
- What?
- You should thank me.

167
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,190
You're only alive thanks to me.
I could've killed you.

168
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,629
You should be punished for
stealing someone else's girlfriend.

169
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,590
Don't you think so?

170
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,860
I didn't do anything wrong.

171
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,399
You're the one who flirted with
a girl who had a boyfriend!

172
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,929
So you're the one who killed her!

173
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,070
- Get a hold of yourself!
- You.

174
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,139
You.

175
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,409
You're just a kid.

176
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,279
You're just a kid...

177
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,580
who's frightened...

178
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:01,519
to get abandoned.

179
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,759
She was concerned and asked me...

180
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,200
if you could join the police academy
with a criminal record.

181
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,299
Mi Rae did that.

182
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,039
She even lied to me
that she was asking for a friend.

183
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,039
I'm actually asking for my friend.

184
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,750
Her boyfriend is...

185
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,809
beating her.

186
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,950
But if she reports him,

187
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:36,490
that will turn him
into an ex-convict.

188
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:41,259
I heard he's studying to get into
the police academy,

189
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,860
so that can't be good for him.

190
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,399
If he beats women,
don't cut him any slack.

191
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,470
She loves...

192
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,200
She loves him.

193
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,840
Tell her that...

194
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,210
she shouldn't go down that path.

195
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:04,450
It's not good to just hold back...

196
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,690
for both of their sakes. Okay?

197
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,190
Stop crying. Come on.

198
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,360
Here.

199
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,830
Do you now understand
what you have done?

200
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,769
Don't try to teach me!

201
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,340
What do you know?

202
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,210
Up until then,
she said she loved you.

203
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,350
So you are the one...

204
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:36,720
who broke her heart.

205
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,919
- You poor kid.
- What kind of nonsense is this?

206
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,889
You.

207
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:47,460
Mi Rae...

208
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,500
Mi Rae told me...

209
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,929
Mi Rae...

210
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,669
Mi Rae...

211
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:03,009
Mi Rae... Mi Rae...

212
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,909
Mi Rae, I'm so sorry...

213
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,850
- It hasn't been that long.
- Yes?

214
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,389
It's about time Prosecutor Eun came.

215
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,460
- Look who this is!
- Mi Ho!

216
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,399
- Dong Sik!
- Hey.

217
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,200
Goodness, you're gross.

218
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,929
Dong Sik, I love you.

219
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,669
You're hurting my ribs. This hurts.

220
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,769
People at the National Forensic
Service did a lot for you too.

221
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,279
Both Dr. Baek and Dr. Hwang
of Toxic Substances Division.

222
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,179
- Yes, I'm going to stop by.
- Yes, you should go over.

223
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,779
They've done a lot for you.

224
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,320
All we did was
stay up all night working,

225
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,820
getting nosebleeds,
getting scraped, hurt, and...

226
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,059
- Is that true?
- This hurts.

227
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:51,059
My ribs are broken.

228
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,389
Goodness, stop showing it off.
Is that so, Dong Sik the baby?

229
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:58,000
- Stop it.
- Good boy, Dong Sik.

230
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,700
Goodness, kid.

231
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,200
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

232
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,750
It's always the best idea
not to touch a tiger...

233
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,279
or Dr. Baek when they're asleep.

234
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,830
Thank you.

235
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,669
Isn't she here?

236
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,679
This is Jang Seong Joo. Yes.

237
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,879
- Please excuse me.
- Sure.

238
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,450
Hey, stop.

239
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,649
This is... Goodness.

240
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,289
- What are you doing?
- This...

241
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,960
Who are you to come in
and smash things?

242
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,960
I'm Cha Soo Ho from Violent Crimes
at Gangdong Police Station.

243
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,930
I'm looking for Dr. Hwang
from the Toxic Substances Division.

244
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,170
- Oh, Dr. Hwang?
- Yes, Hwang, Hwang.

245
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,039
- Will you wait?
- Sure.

246
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,049
Dr. Hwang.

247
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,920
You met already.

248
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:03,019
- What?
- Ciao. I'm Stella Hwang.

249
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,660
Stella Hwang. Hwang? Hwang?

250
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,930
Oh, that Hwang?

251
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,470
You cleared my name.

252
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,869
Thank you, Dr. Hwang.

253
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:18,839
- Just call me Stella.
- Just Stella?

254
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:23,109
Okay. That's nice. Stella. Stella...

255
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,980
So, Stella. When we repay someone...

256
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,680
In Korea, I have to buy you a meal.

257
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,119
I know a famous restaurant.

258
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,119
Meat. Let's eat meat.

259
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,369
You grew up in the US.

260
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:53,039
How is your Korean so fluent?

261
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,970
The meat here just
got out of rigor mortis,

262
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,380
- so it's super delicious.
- What?

263
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,579
Rigor mortis?

264
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:03,250
It's too tough
right after slaughter.

265
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,480
But if it's too ripe,
it starts to decompose.

266
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,849
Beef ribs are perfect when
the temperature and time are right.

267
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,259
- During an autopsy...
- Autopsy?

268
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,059
No, it's okay.

269
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:19,960
You're just being thorough
at what you do.

270
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,500
Ripening and decomposition
straddle a very thin line.

271
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:24,839
Got it?

272
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,269
That's why the meat here is so good.

273
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,839
With nice marbling.

274
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,279
The ideal ratio for
fat to muscle is 2 to 8.

275
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,509
Fat to muscle.

276
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,119
The best ratio for hair parting
is 2 to 8 as well.

277
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:40,890
2 to 8, the speed of decomposition
in a buried corpse and drowned one.

278
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,490
That's the formula.

279
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,390
Okay. Thanks.

280
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,630
Nice rigidity and decom...
No, not that.

281
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,799
Nicely matured and marbled.

282
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,200
You're the best.

283
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,839
Meat requires alcohol.

284
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,440
- How about a drink?
- I'd love a drink.

285
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,250
Hold it for me.

286
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,190
Sure.

287
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,000
Thank you.

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,730
2 to 8 gives you a drink that's
7.2 percent alcohol.

289
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,140
There's a golden ratio
to boilermakers too.

290
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,269
Golden ratio. Drop the bomb.

291
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,170
Right. Drop the bomb.

292
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,539
Soju with beer
always tastes the same.

293
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,380
I like things to be exact.

294
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,720
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

295
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:46,349
Cheers.

296
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,529
It's complete gold. Gold, gold.

297
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,240
24K.

298
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,609
Gold, 24K...

299
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,380
Do you want to...

300
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,380
- sleep with me?
- I'd love that.

301
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,319
No, no, what? What was that? What?

302
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,849
What did you say to me?

303
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,650
Yes?

304
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,690
Deputy chief.

305
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,960
Mi Ho, what is it?

306
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,130
Are you free this evening?

307
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,329
I have something urgent
to deal with.

308
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:34,730
I see.

309
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,339
Then we'll go to Eun Sol's
housewarming without you.

310
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,940
Mi Ho?

311
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,309
Are we leaving right now?

312
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,380
- Yes.
- Okay.

313
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,710
- Wait.
- Come along.

314
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,250
- The weather's great too.
- Right.

315
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,789
Prosecutor Eun has such
expensive and grand taste.

316
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:56,420
I'm not of that caliber.

317
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:59,160
She had great taste
even in university.

318
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,430
She's rich, isn't she?
I can tell her family's loaded.

319
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,700
- Let's see her grand flat.
- Is this it?

320
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,029
Okay, let's hurry.

321
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,099
- We're here.
- We must be quiet here.

322
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:11,839
- This is it.
- It's here.

323
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,809
Who is it?

324
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,480
Who's that?

325
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,920
- Who's...
- Oh my!

326
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,190
- You three?
- Wait.

327
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,460
- Why are you here?
- What's going on?

328
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,789
What are you doing here?
What? Why? How?

329
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,829
- Let's talk inside. Move.
- You aren't coming in.

330
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:41,829
What kind of amazing,
hallelujah situation is this?

331
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:43,869
Oh, my gosh,
unbelievable. Chest hair.

332
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:45,170
- Move.
- Wait!

333
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:49,069
This is why you can never tell
what one is like. Move!

334
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,980
- You can't come in.
- Prosecutor Eun! Prosecutor Eun!

335
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,279
What are you doing there?

336
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:03,819
- I live here.
- Move it.

337
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,289
You... Neighbors?

338
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,009
Why are we moving so fast?

339
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,420
I'm ready. Come in.

340
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,690
Come... Come in? Come in?

341
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,220
Yeah... Okay, let's go.

342
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,630
Stella?

343
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,599
Hwang?

344
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,390
Sign that.

345
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,799
(Intercourse Contract)

346
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,470
"This contract covers consensual
and reasonable sexual..."

347
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:29,769
"No photos, audio,
or video recordings."

348
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,980
"Both parties
will use contraception."

349
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,680
"If due to a natural disaster
a pregnancy occurs,"

350
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,279
"both parties
will share responsibilities."

351
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,420
Why would you state the obvious?

352
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,220
I like things to be exact.

353
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,529
"This contract is valid
for one event."

354
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,029
"To extend, a written agreement..."

355
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,940
"After termination of contract,
do not force regular contact."

356
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,039
Does this mean...

357
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,309
this is just a one-night thing?

358
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,940
A one-night stand?

359
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,509
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

360
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,529
I refuse. A one-night stand?

361
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:22,289
I'm not that kind of guy.

362
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,130
I'm disappointed in you.

363
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,470
She'll come after me.

364
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,009
1, 2, 3.

365
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,519
Let's call it quits then. Bye.

366
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,990
Wait, Stella. Dr. Hwang.

367
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,119
What was that about?

368
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
This place...

369
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,730
Welcome to the place I moved into
with almost nothing to my name.

370
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,430
I call it Crazy Sol's place.

371
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,869
Thank you, but you know...

372
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:05,369
It's like there's...
There's nothing here.

373
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,710
Kind of, yes.

374
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,940
Minimal life is all the rage.
It's not bad.

375
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,180
It's okay. I only come in to sleep.

376
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,549
What do you mean?

377
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:15,609
You must leave work on time, cook,

378
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:18,019
and have a life of your own
that isn't so bare.

379
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:20,549
I won't ask you to work
overtime with me.

380
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:23,359
That's not what I meant.
You got me very wrong.

381
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,220
- It's not that.
- It's fine.

382
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,359
I have nothing to serve you.
Shall we go out?

383
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,630
My treat.

384
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:32,859
Why do you live
next door to Dr. Psycho?

385
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:37,299
I want to rinse out my eyes.
Did you three see his chest hair?

386
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:40,640
Did you see what looked like
wisps of seaweed?

387
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,869
I feel sick.

388
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:45,240
I don't want to think about that.
I touched it to push him in.

389
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,779
- What for?
- With my hand.

390
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:48,809
It was a coincidence. I moved in...

391
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,450
and realized he lived next door.

392
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,220
He got so ferocious just because
we rang the wrong doorbell.

393
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,819
Do you think he keeps people's heads
in his fridge or something?

394
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,559
He might have a body in there.

395
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:02,190
All that aside,
what if there's a ghost?

396
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,730
All he does is autopsies.

397
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,730
My gosh, you're scaring me.
Let's drop that subject.

398
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,269
But I do believe that spirits might
stay at a corner of his house...

399
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:09,930
- and walk around his house.
- That's right.

400
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,500
I mean, you must agree that
his job isn't normal, you know?

401
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,940
We only share
the hallway and the elevator.

402
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,910
He won't share his ghosts with me.
Don't worry.

403
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,180
You're right.

404
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,309
Deputy Chief Kang,
are you all right?

405
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,549
Yes. I was thinking about
something else for a second.

406
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:29,819
- Here's your chicken.
- Thank you.

407
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:32,359
Please excuse me.
I must get home early today.

408
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,430
I have a woman waiting at home.

409
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,059
- Did the designated driver arrive?
- Yes, the driver is already here.

410
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,759
- Drop me off on your way home.
- Okay.

411
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,430
- Are you leaving now?
- We're leaving.

412
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,170
- I'm sorry.
- Wait...

413
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,299
Get home safely.

414
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:46,369
Are you okay?

415
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:48,910
What? What do you mean?

416
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:50,940
Living at a place like that alone.

417
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,880
Our family went broke.

418
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,319
What?

419
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,680
It was a joke. A joke.

420
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,390
I moved out all on my own.

421
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,690
I had exactly 10,000 dollars
in my account.

422
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,089
Isn't that ridiculous?

423
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:10,700
So what if I drove a nice car?
It wasn't mine to begin with.

424
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,400
You really have gumption.

425
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,700
Just live there for a while,

426
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,670
and go back to your house.

427
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,339
No.

428
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:25,339
From now on,
I really want to live on my own.

429
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,450
I don't like that
you're living next to Dr. Baek.

430
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,650
You're still...

431
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,490
just a criminal.

432
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:39,160
Your novel's still boring
after all this time.

433
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:44,000
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

434
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,200
but what's between...

435
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:48,400
Dr. Baek and you?

436
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,299
"You'll remember your first case
for the rest of your career."

437
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:55,009
- Remember that?
- Yes.

438
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,640
And, "Everyone fails to do well
on their first case."

439
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,279
The defendant
of my first case was...

440
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:02,650
Baek Beom.

441
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,019
A car accident.

442
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,019
It was intentional.

443
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,789
He was in the driver's seat,
and his fiancee who had...

444
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,089
a change of heart was
in the passenger seat.

445
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,970
Even after he saw the obstruction
on the road ahead of him,

446
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,339
he didn't avoid it.

447
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,869
And most of its damage...

448
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,380
went to the passenger seat.

449
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,869
Let's start.

450
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,579
Why didn't you steer away
from it that night?

451
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,549
You crashed into it on purpose.

452
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:49,420
You wanted to kill your fiancee
who had changed her mind about you.

453
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,319
- No.
- You found out it wasn't your baby.

454
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,059
That's why you lost your mind
and wanted to kill her!
