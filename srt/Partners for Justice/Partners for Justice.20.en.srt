1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,009
Name, Jang Tae Joo.

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:05,540
He's a drug offender
Mr. Seo arrested four years ago.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,610
He got out on parole a month ago.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,509
According to the physical checkup
from prison,

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,250
his height is 182cm,
and his shoe size is 285mm.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,490
Wait, what?
He has the same shoe size.

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,750
He used to be a vet.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,989
After he was convicted,
he lost his license.

9
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,760
He had been saying that...

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,460
he was going to kill Mr. Seo
once he got out of prison.

11
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,359
Where is he now?

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,899
We can't locate
where he was seen last.

13
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,670
My guess is that he's on the run.

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,640
And the drug found
at Mr. Seo's home, succinylcholine.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,369
Animal hospitals use this often
when they put them to sleep.

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,679
Put them to sleep?

17
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,979
I got it. Find out more
about him on your own.

18
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,210
Pardon?

19
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,450
- Why would I investigate on my own?
- The murderer of this case...

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,149
is the same guy
from the one 10 years ago.

21
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,689
We already specified
a prime suspect.

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,890
What we need to focus on
right now...

23
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,630
is directing our resources
to prove the charge,

24
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,829
not adding a new suspect
onto the list.

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,399
If you look, Jang Tae Joo fits
the description of the murderer.

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,670
He clearly held a grudge too.

27
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm telling you to take care of that
at your own precinct.

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,040
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

29
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,540
Are you ruling this out
because it's coming from me?

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,879
- Hey, what's wrong with you?
- Gosh.

31
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,019
I know that you were
disappointed by my actions...

32
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,849
regarding the past incident.

33
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:22,319
However, please refrain from
disturbing the investigation...

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,859
- based on your personal feelings.
- Aren't you...

35
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,260
speaking for yourself?

36
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,170
- What did you say?
- You lost your objectivity, not I.

37
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,739
When I stood before you
as a murder suspect,

38
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,540
you evaluated based on the evidence.

39
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,170
At that time,
I could understand you.

40
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,939
If I were in your shoes,
I would've suspected the same.

41
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,909
- But this is wrong.
- Hey, will you stop that?

42
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,480
- Watch what you're saying.
- I didn't say anything wrong.

43
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,849
- I told you to stop.
- Please calm down.

44
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:53,989
I get it.

45
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,849
Follow your lead...

46
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,159
with Jang Tae Joo.

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,859
I will.
I will chase him until the end.

48
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,659
- Hey. Cha Soo Ho.
- Stop it.

49
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,730
Soo Ho.

50
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:06,969
My gosh.

51
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,039
The suspect is exercising his right
to remain silent and being stubborn.

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,310
In order for us to prove
that he's guilty,

53
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,810
this evidence won't be sufficient.

54
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,949
Interview everyone
related to this case,

55
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,449
and get their statements.

56
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,889
When you see him performing
autopsies for homicides,

57
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:34,030
- you can tell that he's a lunatic.
- How can you tell?

58
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,800
People who lack the ability to feel
empathy are called sociopaths.

59
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,430
That's what he is.

60
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,599
He always says that
he must become the assailant...

61
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:44,669
when he performs autopsies.

62
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,870
I just thought he was a crazy dude,

63
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,009
but after thinking back,

64
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,580
he's giving me the chills.

65
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,479
Dr. Baek isn't the type
who would do such a thing.

66
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,710
He's a great doctor.

67
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,050
He takes care of Jin Dol
the most diligently at the NFS.

68
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,379
According to our sources,

69
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,620
he screams, curses,
abuses his authority,

70
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,560
and says insulting remarks.
Is this true?

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,960
When we mess up, he does yell at us.

72
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,400
He often tells us to
get out of the room.

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,699
When did you have
the hardest time with him?

74
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,229
It's the hardest
when I don't get to eat my meals.

75
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,530
During mealtime,

76
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,740
we always have a new case
or an urgent autopsy.

77
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,069
Other medical examiners...

78
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,110
would work after finishing
their meals,

79
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,379
but Dr. Baek isn't lenient.

80
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,680
Gosh, he's a great doctor. Goodness.

81
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,819
When he worked at the hospital,
he was nice.

82
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,889
Although he was a perfectionist,
he was still down-to-earth.

83
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,789
He was even in a relationship
with a nurse named Han So Hee.

84
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,330
- But after she died...
- You mean the car accident?

85
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,469
You know it too.

86
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,099
He proposed to her but got rejected.

87
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,139
So when he was driving
in the heat of the moment,

88
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,370
he got into a car accident.
That's what I heard.

89
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,009
How was his relationship
with Dr. Kang Yong?

90
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,879
There was a rumor that
Ms. Han rejected Dr. Baek...

91
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
because of Dr. Kang.

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,949
They were best friends.

93
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,020
Must I say more? After they fought,

94
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,090
Dr. Kang was found dead.

95
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,629
- Everything was Dr. Baek's fault.
- Is that why he left the hospital?

96
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,329
No, it was the opposite.

97
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,310
He started performing surgeries like
a mad man and caused a malpractice.

98
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,970
(Restricted Area)

99
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,720
It was because of his right hand
which he injured from the accident.

100
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,050
That's why he was kicked out.

101
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,490
After Dr. Kang passed away,

102
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,189
there was a big scene because some
of the medical supplies were gone.

103
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,399
Everyone kept it quiet
and swept it under the rug.

104
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,569
What were the drugs that were gone?

105
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,300
They were succinylcholine...

106
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,439
and sodium pentothal.

107
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,209
(Halt at the stop line,
and follow the guard's orders.)

108
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,009
Why did you come?
I told you not to visit me.

109
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,920
How are you holding up there?

110
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,319
I'm fine.

111
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,360
You don't look too good, Dad.

112
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,620
It's not the time to worry about me.

113
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,189
I heard
you refused to hire an attorney.

114
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,730
Why did you do that?

115
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,000
I caused this, Dad, so...

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,800
Until when will you punish yourself?

117
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,439
After that accident
with that girl, So Hee,

118
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,379
I shouldn't have let
you be like that.

119
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,680
- I should've done everything to...
- No, Dad.

120
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,220
You must be strong, Beom. Okay?

121
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,819
You must get yourself together.

122
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:22,589
This is nothing. I cannot...

123
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,160
see my son crumble down like this.

124
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,899
Quit your job at the NFS,
and come back to the hospital.

125
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,500
I got you an attorney.
This will be over soon.

126
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,980
I see a bite mark
on the left side of his neck.

127
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,439
"A bite mark on the left side".

128
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,110
And make a mold for his teeth.

129
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,220
What are you doing? Take the photos.

130
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:55,649
- And make a teeth mold too.
- Oh, right. I'm sorry.

131
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,860
Get out.

132
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,600
Dr. Baek.

133
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,529
Hey, we're going to cut his body
in half and split open his head.

134
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,370
Do it right. Otherwise, we are
no better than psychopaths.

135
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,810
- Dr. Baek.
- Put down your camera.

136
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,980
- Mr. Baek.
- Get out.

137
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,939
Get out!

138
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,449
I'll get out. I'm leaving.

139
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,480
Where are you going
in the middle of an autopsy?

140
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,490
What?

141
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,930
I... I'm sorry.

142
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,100
I'll take the photos again.

143
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,399
Darn it.

144
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,000
I just need 5cc of that.
You can't even get me that?

145
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,939
Okay. I understand. Bye.

146
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,810
Dr. Pyo said no.

147
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,339
You saw those needle marks
during the autopsy, right?

148
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,110
The drug is
the decisive thing in this case.

149
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,680
We can only solve the mystery of
those marks with his blood.

150
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,449
If you do that, can we prove
Dr. Baek's innocence?

151
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,149
Trust me.

152
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,589
Gosh, it's not like
I can just barge in.

153
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,360
I got an idea.

154
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:08,990
(Animal Hospital)

155
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,000
Hey, start the car.

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,470
He won't come
even if we stayed here all day.

157
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,470
What?

158
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,370
If you were him,

159
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,670
would you come back to this place
after you killed someone?

160
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,870
He's not coming.

161
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,310
- Then what should we do?
- What do you think?

162
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,550
We need a change of plan.

163
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,720
Who's calling me?

164
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,549
(Stella)

165
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,120
- Why? Who is it?
- Quiet.

166
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,629
Hi, Stella.

167
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Lieutenant Cha Soo Ho
of Gangdong Police Station.

168
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,470
I am here to get a blood sample...

169
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,600
of Deputy Seo Jeong Min for
a toxic substance analysis.

170
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,600
We've decided to
take up the analysis...

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,240
I need the evidence to investigate.
Please hand it over immediately.

172
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,120
(Forensic Chemistry Analysis)

173
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,990
You probably wouldn't understand
anyway. Just keep it cool.

174
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,259
What are you doing?

175
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,500
Professor Pyo, the police
wants the analysis result.

176
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:25,500
Did you show them a warrant?

177
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,610
We were in a hurry,
so we didn't get one.

178
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,110
Hello, Professor Pyo.

179
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,580
Are you from the NFS?

180
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,679
I'm Stella of
Toxic Substances Division.

181
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,250
Where is the raw data of LC and MS?

182
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,750
Why do you want that?

183
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,950
We already finished
analyzing everything.

184
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,389
Did you take the peripheral blood
or from the heart?

185
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,289
I just...

186
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,730
Oh, my gosh.

187
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,429
Levels of toxic substances in blood
can be 1.2 to 1.5 times higher...

188
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:55,230
in blood taken from the heart
compared to peripheral blood.

189
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,139
The drug bottle was already
found on the scene so...

190
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,669
How can you be sure that he was
only injected with that drug?

191
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,240
Do you analyze things
after you decide on the result?

192
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,110
Did you conduct a quantitative
analysis of the toxic substance...

193
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:07,110
and the metabolome?

194
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,809
Why do we need to conduct
a quantitative analysis?

195
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,620
We can only see if he was injected
before or after his death...

196
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,620
after we see the ratio of
the substance and the metabolome.

197
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,360
Give me the blood sample.
I will analyze this myself.

198
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,259
That is impossible.

199
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,399
Come back with a warrant.

200
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,309
The suspect refuses to make
any kind of statement.

201
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,940
He is not being cooperative.

202
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,210
We conduct this search and seizure
to find out his true nature.

203
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,179
You must not leave out
even the smallest evidence.

204
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,480
Let us go.

205
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,389
- This way.
- Yes, sir.

206
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,019
What are these?

207
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,519
Does he think
he's Rambo or something?

208
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,690
Let us begin.

209
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,960
It's as if he's a terrorist.

210
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,730
This is quite scary.

211
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,029
This is just his house.
It's not like there's a ghost here.

212
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,029
What are those?

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,669
What? Why?

214
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:42,509
My goodness. I'm sorry.

215
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,179
- That was shocking.
- Why did you touch that?

216
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,049
- My gosh.
- What is this?

217
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,419
Do you know why I shoot?

218
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,190
I'm proving to myself
that my hands are fine.

219
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,330
It's not a house of someone
who has a normal thought process.

220
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,759
He said he obsesses over shooting...

221
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,559
because of the wound
on his right hand.

222
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,700
Wound?

223
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,899
Normal people would play the piano
or get rehabilitation.

224
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,460
A woman's ring.

225
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,730
He proposed to her but got rejected.

226
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,470
So when he was driving
in the heat of the moment,

227
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,230
he got into a car accident.
That's what I heard.

228
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,940
He saw the obstacle
in the middle of the road,

229
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,809
but he didn't avoid it.

230
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,340
And the damage was...

231
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,679
focused on the passenger's seat.

232
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,049
Prosecutor Kang.

233
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,090
Take a look at this.

234
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:11,259
Succinylcholine
and pentothal sodium.

235
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,629
The drugs that killed Mr. Seo.

236
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,370
We found the decisive evidence.

237
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,639
- There he is.
- They're coming.

238
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,210
- Stop right here.
- Back off.

239
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,049
Please say something.

240
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,080
- Say something.
- Why did you kill him?

241
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,019
What's the reason?

242
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,919
- Did you use your knowledge?
- Say something.

243
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,049
- Say something.
- Say a word.

244
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,490
Over here.

245
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,639
(Victim)

246
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,210
At first, they probably talked.

247
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,480
Then you probably began to quarrel.

248
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,120
Take a seat.

249
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,669
You knew about Mr. Seo
and Ms. Han's relationship, right?

250
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,509
You flipped out
after you saw this picture.

251
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,440
You didn't want anyone to find out
about your crime from 10 years ago,

252
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,309
so you decided to kill him.

253
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,350
You pushed the victim.
When he became defenseless,

254
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:42,590
you took out a syringe.

255
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,659
How did you inject him?

256
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,570
Say it.

257
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,710
How did you do it?

258
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,710
Tell me!

259
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,019
Prosecutor Kang, calm down.

260
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,889
Why? Do you feel guilty
now that you see this again?

261
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,259
Show me.

262
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:29,899
How did you inject this into him?
Show me how you did it!

263
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,139
Why? Why did my brother
and Jeong Min have to die,

264
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,139
not you?

265
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,210
If you weren't there 10 years ago,

266
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,850
my brother, So Hee,
and the baby in her womb...

267
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:47,250
would've lived happily ever after.

268
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,299
Yes, I did it.

269
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,200
Happy now?

270
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,110
So stop it.

271
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,480
Yes. Everything is over.

272
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,750
I'll indict him as soon as
we get the autopsy analysis.

273
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,830
This way.

274
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:04,759
This is Baek Beom.

275
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,730
I'm Deputy Seo Jeong Min of
Seoul Eastern District.

276
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,200
- And?
- Do you know what day it is?

277
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,170
It's Ms. Han So Hee's birthday.

278
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,569
- How do you know her birthday?
- Because it's my birthday too.

279
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,680

(Death: Suicide)

288
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,210
Professor.

289
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,279
What's this? Suicide?

290
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,680
Yes.

291
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,089
That is the conclusion
my department has reached.

292
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,319
He was pushed down,
injected, and murdered.

293
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,359
No.

294
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,160
The order's wrong.

295
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,299
He was injected with sodium
pentothal and succinylcholine.

296
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,829
His muscles relaxed,
and he lost control of his body.

297
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:51,039
He fell over,
and that caused the bleeding,

298
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,240
the skull fracture,
and the subdural hemorrhage.

299
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,410
That's the most
reasonable conclusion.

300
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,680
But... That's not...

301
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,150
The injection marks showed
no signs...

302
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,680
of others' involvement.
And on the syringe,

303
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,420
we only found the fingerprints
of the victim himself.

304
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,589
Mr. Seo would've never
killed himself.

305
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:11,859
Prosecutor Kang.

306
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,359
I know how you feel,

307
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,759
- but these are the facts.
- No, sir.

308
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,029
Something's wrong.
Baek Beom did it!

309
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:26,039
- Prosecutor Kang.
- My brother and then now.

310
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,869
You were wrong both times.

311
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,910
I will reveal the truth.

312
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,109
Wait. Prosecutor Kang.

313
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:35,410
- Prosecutor Kang.
- Oh dear.

314
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,980
Why would Mr. Seo
suddenly kill himself?

315
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,920
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

316
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:44,660
There were no hesitation marks.

317
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
- What?
- What?

318
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,990
(Marks of a suicide attempt)

319

People who kill themselves
sometimes leave hesitation marks.

320
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,759
There were exactly two
injection marks on Mr. Seo's arm,

321
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,170
and he's no doctor.

322
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,670
It might not be suicide.

323
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,470
Only two companies supply
the animal hospitals...

324
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,269
with succinylcholine.

325
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,480
The vet that
Jang Tae Joo worked at...

326
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,039
got their supply from here.

329
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,619
Is anyone in?

330
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,250
Yes, hello.

331
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,390
Hello, we're from
Gangdong Police Station.

332
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,359
Do you supply succinylcholine?

333
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,930
Yes, we do. What is this about?

334
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,190
Someone was killed with the drug.

335
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,460
Did anyone steal your products?

336
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,799
Oh, right.

337
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,930
A few vials did go missing
a few days ago.

338
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,940
Really? Could we check
the security footage from that day?

339
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
Sure.

340
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,690
It's Jang Tae Joo.

341
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,019
Is that succinylcholine?

342
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:53,359
- Yes.
- How many vials went missing?

343
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,829
I counted three.

344
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:55,829
Three vials?

345
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,299
Cause of death was asphyxia
due to a succinylcholine injection.

346
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:07,240
Type of death...

347
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,809
was suicide.

348
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,309
We will release you soon.

349
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:22,450
The day of the reenactment...

350
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,990
was the first time you'd been
to that place, right?

351
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,000
Why did you confess?

352
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:38,900
To take it all on yourself?

353
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,579
- Don't write a novel.
- No, I'll write one today.

354
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:46,279
You didn't do it.

355
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,049
But you think it's all your fault.

356
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,579
That's why...

357
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,519
you turned into an ill-tempered man
who tortures himself.

Han So Hee and Kang Yong...

used to mean a lot to you.

360
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,500
If there's a misunderstanding,
explain it.

361

Revealing the truth behind a death.

362

That's your specialty.

363
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,750
With the way things are,

364
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,880
we'll close this case as suicide.

365
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,420
Wait.

366
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,059

Short fingernails.

372
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,019
Stop it and go to sleep.

373
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,700

Did the suicide conclusion...

376
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,079
make you want to
recant your confession?

377
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,250
You can't rule out murder.

378
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,480
- What?
- Redo the autopsy.

379
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,150
- I can prove it.
- If you do that,

380
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,450
- it works against you.
- I don't care.

381
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,190
Why?
You'll pretend to do an autopsy...

382
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:39,289
and destroy evidence?

383
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:40,960
Quit writing a novel.

384
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,400
- What are you up to?
- Think what you will.

385

But an autopsy must be done.

What are you doing?

391
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,930
- Get my uniform.
- Okay.

- The body.
- It's not here yet.

lurked around Mr. Seo.

other than Mr. Seo.

he could have grudges on.
