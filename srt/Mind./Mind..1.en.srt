1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,120
MIND
Have you ever been to Fukuoka?

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,450
No, I haven't.

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,700
There are many good hot-springs...

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,870
Also, as I am a barista,

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,330
I usually go to coffee places
when I travel.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,080
I'm not very good at taking pictures
but...

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,700
Isn't it beautiful?

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,910
Yes, it is.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,950
I went to Hokkaido this time,
so I want to go Osaka next time.

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,280
Have you ever been to Osaka?

11
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,870
Osaka... I haven't been there yet.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,450
I actually didn't
look around Japan properly,

13
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,830
because I just went for
a school field trip when I was young.

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,780
Then, where do you usually travel?

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,120
Mostly domestic.

16
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,740
Oh, yes.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,530
There are many beautiful places
in Korea, too.

18
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,910
There are so many places
I haven't been yet.

19
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,200
Where is the most memorable place
for you?

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,530
Have you ever been to the Sky Park?

21
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,410
There is this huge field
of tall wildgrass,

22
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,410
and it is very pretty during the sunset.

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,490
Then we can go there next time we meet.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,450
No. Nothing's wrong.

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,870
I didn't know you called. I'm sorry.

26
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,030
Okay. I'll send it right away.

27
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,870
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Okay.

29
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,910
Is it too salty?

30
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
No, It's fine.

31
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,330
I think it is.
Should I put more rice in it?

32
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,660
What's wrong?

33
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,370
Is something not going well?

34
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,580
Let me see.

35
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,740
He's nice. He has a good vibe.

36
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,830
Hasn't he?

37
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,450
Maybe just for me.

38
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,660
But I think, he looks fine.

39
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,620
Tae-Gyu.

40
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,370
What.

41
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,490
What do you get out of holding on
like that?

42
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,410
You need to take a break.

43
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,780
How was the person you met today?

44
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,410
He seemed nice and good-looking.

45
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,080
Yeah, He was fine.

46
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,830
I guess he has a lot of money
and he travels often.

47
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,870
Why did you just come?

48
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,990
What do you mean?

49
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,370
You said he was fine.

50
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,910
There's no need to rush.

51
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,530
You should.

52
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,120
You haven't had a sex in a while.

53
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,780
Hey.

54
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,450
What?

55
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,990
I'm not an animal.

56
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,740
Stop.

57
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,370
Good work, everyone.

58
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,780
What are you doing?

59
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,660
Pardon?

60
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,490
What are you doing now?

61
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,080
Don't make a splash.

62
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,740
How many more opportunities
do I have to give you?

63
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,950
I'm sorry.

64
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,490
Take your work more seriously,
or don't start at all.

65
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,780
Did you ever go through
your model profiles?

66
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,740
Are you even going to finish it?

67
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,910
I haven't made up my mind.

68
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,280
Then why don't you seek for a compromise?

69
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,950
Or look through the models
you've worked with before.

70
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,530
Thanks for everything today.

71
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,870
Come to my office before you leave.

72
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Yes. sir.

73
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,580
It's been a while
since you guys broke up.

74
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,580
You should get over it by now
and focus on your work.

75
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,950
I mean it wasn't yesterday.

76
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,580
Well...

77
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,740
It's not like I'm an expert of love.

78
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,910
But pictures don't lie.

79
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,160
Like today.

80
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,030
If your mind is authentic,
it's in the picture.

81
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,240
You're right.

82
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,910
Or are you something like him?

83
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
What was his name?

84
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,490
You know the person
who's a professor in Harry Potter.

85
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,030
You know, the one with the bobbed hair
and wearing a tatters thing.

86
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,030
Severus Snape.　-Oh yes, that's him.

87
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,530
He didn't stop loving Harry Potter's mom
until he died.

88
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,740
Are you like him?

89
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,990
A love that will stay with you
until you die?

90
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,780
No way.

91
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,200
Don't you see each other quickly
and get old easily on your age?

92
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,780
I don't know.

93
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,120
What a pity.

94
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,160
You don't get anything else
until you empty it.

95
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,240
Excuse me.

96
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,530
Hey, baby.

97
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,450
No. I just finished.

98
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,410
Then, what do you usually do
when you are not working?

99
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,830
You know.

100
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,700
I don't have many gay friends.

101
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,120
I just go out drinking alone.

102
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Why? Haven't you try online dating?

103
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,240
I don't mean to say I haven't, but...

104
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,450
Once I tried it before.

105
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,910
But after a few moments,
it didn't suit me well.

106
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,330
Were you surprised that
I talked to you at the bar?

107
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,910
You know.

108
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,370
People don't usually come to such place
like that by themselves.

109
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
I was...

110
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,030
wondering if you felt the same way
like I did.

111
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,660
It's very good here.

112
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,780
I've never known such place like this
in Seoul.

113
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,030
Then, do you come here often
to take pictures?

114
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,910
Yes. And sometimes I come here
to get some fresh air.

115
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,990
Is it a special place for you?

116
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,030
Special...

117
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,160
Maybe with your ex-boyfriend I guess.

118
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,780
No, It's not.

119
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,530
What is?

120
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,780
No, it really isn't.

121
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,830
It kind of hurts me
to see who is on your mind.

122
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,990
I'm sorry.

123
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,450
Never mind.

124
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,950
I don't think it's their first time,

125
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,780
for a couple over there to be here
either.

126
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,990
Hello?

127
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,120
It's been a while.

128
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,990
Oh, did I call you? I'm sorry.

129
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,910
Me?

130
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,370
I'm doing great.

131
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,080
Oh, you mean the ad?

132
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,370
The exhibition is getting closer,
so I'm looking for someone to work with.

133
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,030
Oh really? Thanks.

134
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,030
I'm glad to hear from you anyway.

135
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,330
Hello.

136
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,330
Yes. I just woke up.

137
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,780
Why didn't you tell me
that you're leaving?

138
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,410
On the table?

139
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,950
Okay.

140
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,370
Bye.

141
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,950
According to your profile,
it looked like

142
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,160
you are working on your pictures
in black and white.

143
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,910
Yes. Recently.

144
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,950
Is there a reason?

145
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,030
You loved working in colors.

146
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,530
I don't remember when,

147
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,530
but I suddenly feel like
the colors are a bit too heavy for me.

148
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,910
Suddenly?

149
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,120
Something simple...
That's what I like these days.

150
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,370
Well,
how would you like me to interpret it?

151
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,660
Well.

152
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,490
Just be the way you are.

153
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Ah.

154
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,450
Can I ask you a favor?

155
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,370
Why not?

156
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,990
It's not a big thing.

157
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,490
Can I bring someone
that I know who is a makeup artist?

158
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,780
If you don't mind.

159
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,740
We'd appreciate it if you do that.

160
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,530
Are you seeing someone?

161
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,160
I guess you are.

162
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,030
Well...

163
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,530
Hyun-woo.

164
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,490
Do your best.

165
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,830
The lights will be turned off.

166
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,740
We need to go get some make-up fixed.

167
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,410
Hyun-woo.
