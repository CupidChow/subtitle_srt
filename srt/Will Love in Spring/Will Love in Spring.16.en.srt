1
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,950
It is said that
casual connections are unreliable.

2
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,120
Sure enough, it's short-lasting.

3
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,519
Zhuang Jie,

4
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,239
my skills won't
stand a chance against you.

5
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,640
So,

6
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,159
just let it be.

7
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,400
=Will Love In Spring=

8
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,530
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

9
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,460
=Episode 16=

10
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,599
Grandma.

11
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:49,257
Remember to unplug the charger
once it's fully charged.

12
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,520
I've also placed a box of nuts
under your bed.

13
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,240
Got it.

14
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,571
I have a gathering tonight.
I won't be back for dinner.

15
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,639
Go order something nice
from that food court.

16
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,990
Have something freshly cooked.

17
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,120
I hear you, now go.

18
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,960
How naggy can you be?

19
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,960
Who's there?

20
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,960
Grandma. It's me.

21
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,919
Why didn't you come inside?
You scared me.

22
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,399
Grandma. I brought you
some local produce.

23
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,319
We have shredded beef jerky,

24
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,759
cold rice cakes, and shelled peanuts.

25
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,720
These peanut candies are delicious.

26
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
They're all snacks,

27
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,319
be careful not to
let them ruin your appetite.

28
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,560
Dong said you were working.

29
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,720
He didn't even tell me where you went.

30
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,360
Look at you.

31
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,560
You still buy so many things for me
despite your busy schedule.

32
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,279
Grandma, don't need to play host.

33
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,680
I'll go back
after leaving this stuff with you.

34
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,639
Apart from telling you
that I'm working, did Chen Maidong

35
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,600
tell you anything else?

36
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,240
No.

37
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,319
He said you're quite busy lately
and didn't have time to see me.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,360
Here.

39
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:01,400
Thanks.

40
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,439
Grandma.

41
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,560
Don't sit too close. I'm having a cold.

42
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,079
No wonder your face looks so skinny.

43
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,120
I think you've worked too hard.

44
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,360
Why are you still working
on New Year's Day?

45
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,879
You must be exhausted.

46
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,319
All right.

47
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,920
Grandma, I really have to go now.

48
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,371
I wouldn't want you to catch it.

49
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,839
I'll let you clean this up.

50
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
Visit you again when I get better.

51
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,800
Okay. Get some rest.

52
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,800
Bye.

53
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,240
One has unbearable nagging,

54
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,639
and the other one always
has someplace to go.

55
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:38,680
How I wish they could
balance each other out.

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,959
I've been looking forward to

57
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,879
our annual class reunion
since last year.

58
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,839
And we have a special guest today.

59
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,519
It's her first time joining us.

60
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,480
Really? I can't wait to find out.

61
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,519
Relax. Someone's not here yet.

62
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,270
There she is.

63
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:54,430
Hey, there.

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,360
Showing up late just like a superstar.

65
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,720
Oh, Zhuang Jie,
you've completely transformed.

66
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,480
Exactly.

67
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,110
I couldn't recognize her
on the streets.

68
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,839
Don't exaggerate.

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,279
You all looked pretty good, too.

70
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,680
Look at your radiant faces.

71
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,000
Why don't you sit here?

72
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
I'd rather not. I'm having a cold.

73
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,110
I don't want Chen Maidong to catch it.

74
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,759
Sit here with me.

75
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,720
If you sit here,
I might catch it, right?

76
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
Come on, you're healthy.

77
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,439
Stop flattering yourself.

78
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,839
Do you think Zhuang Jie's targeting you?

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,519
She's targeting Li Pei.

80
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,920
They're both business elites,
handsome and beautiful.

81
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,000
Perhaps, they could even

82
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:27,240
spark an interesting conversation
among themselves.

83
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,639
If I remember correctly,
you must be Liang Wei.

84
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,300
You used to love
picking up on conversations.

85
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,000
Unsurprisingly,
you haven't changed at all.

86
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,839
I'm so sorry, guys.

87
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,879
I can't drink alcohol,
so I'll substitute it with tea.

88
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,060
Here's a toast to you. Come on.

89
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:41,639
Come on, guys.

90
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,319
Cheers.

91
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,399
Cheers! Cheers!

92
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,120
It's been so long.

93
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,879
Let's eat.

94
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:53,390
Let's eat.

95
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,240
Come on, let's eat.

96
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,319
You know me.

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,310
We've been drinking for three rounds.

98
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,800
Remember, we must drink
until we are thoroughly drunk.

99
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,399
Li Pei.

100
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:05,285
The refinancing optimization policy
will soon be implemented.

101
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,079
Its regulatory arrangements

102
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,439
that were implemented last year

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
saw a direct polarization between
blue chip stocks and junk stocks.

104
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,560
As soon as this policy was launched,

105
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,160
the number of backdoor listings
started to decrease.

106
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,079
Don't you think that it's senseless?

107
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:20,480
Different trades but worlds apart.

108
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,279
I've learned much.

109
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,542
They're whispering to each other again.

110
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,040
Like I said just now,
whenever they get together,

111
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,560
things will surely get interesting.

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Liang, enough of that nonsense.

113
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,680
Let's drink.

114
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:34,390
Why don't you ask Chen Maidong

115
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,485
to drink with you instead?

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,680
He hasn't even taken a sip yet.
What is this all about?

117
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,199
I can't drink with you
due to my profession.

118
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,319
Speaking of your profession,

119
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,879
I'm here today to tell you this.

120
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,720
Your dad's company
is currently our biggest supplier.

121
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,279
Indeed, his dad runs
a huge and successful business.

122
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,399
I'm so envious of you
for having a good father.

123
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,120
Here.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,759
I really can't.

125
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,439
However, you chose to disregard

126
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,399
your family's fortune
by not inheriting your dad's business.

127
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,971
Everyone has their own ambition.

128
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,120
What about your ambition?

129
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,920
All I know is poverty stunts ambition.

130
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,680
That's you.

131
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,079
Chen Maidong. Listen to my advice.

132
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,920
Stop working with dead people.
There's no future in it.

133
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Liang Wei, keep your mouth shut
if you're drunk.

134
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,620
Woman, keep quiet
when a man is speaking.

135
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,279
Liang.

136
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,039
I've had enough of this conversation.
Enough is enough.

137
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,039
Am I wrong?

138
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,039
She clearly lacks discipline. I don't
need her to teach me what to say.

139
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you need me to teach you?

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,320
Come on, teach me.

141
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,519
Show me. Let me see what you have.

142
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,320
Come on.

143
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,840
Enough.

144
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,279
Liang, you're drunk.

145
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,080
Sit down. Waiter.

146
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,942
Bring us some peanuts
to let him sober up.

147
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,120
Dong.

148
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:08,720
Dong.

149
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,240
Dong!

150
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,080
Chen Maidong.

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,000
Wait for me, Chen Maidong.

152
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,639
Wait up.

153
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Chen Maidong, I was wrong.

154
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,120
I was so wrong. Please forgive me.

155
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

156
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,000
I've said some hurtful things.

157
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,120
I shouldn't have said that to you.

158
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,039
Chen Maidong,
can you forgive me like a gentleman?

159
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,914
There were many gentlemen back there.

160
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,879
Go back.
Don't follow me, I'm just a rogue.

161
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,080
You finally paid attention to me.

162
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,960
Get angry at me all you want,

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,514
but don't give me the silent treatment.

164
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,440
No, don't run away.
My legs are very tired.

165
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,457
I didn't ask you to follow me.

166
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,399
But I want to follow you.

167
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,399
I'm already willing to lower my voice
and stifle my anger,

168
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,519
so stop making a fuss about nothing

169
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,028
and offer me a less
embarrassing way out.

170
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
That day, you could've told me nicely
if you were unwilling.

171
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,879
Why slander me with those words?

172
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm a human being, I have dignity too.

173
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,679
I'm really sorry.

174
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,440
How can I make you cool off?

175
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,480
I can kneel.

176
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:44,628
Or you can slap me in the face.

177
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,320
Go on, slap me.

178
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
Stop it, Zhuang Jie.

179
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,679
I'm annoyed by your presence.

180
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,000
What do you mean?

181
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,720
Can you say that again?

182
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,440
Go on, say that again.

183
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,120
I said you're annoying.

184
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:16,685
Is this how you apologize to someone?

185
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,314
Whoever cares about you is a dog.

186
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,159
You're indeed a dog.

187
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,314
You're worse than a dog!

188
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,140
♪If♪

189
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,540

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,660

192
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,919
Niaoniao.

193
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:16,600
How's your sister doing?

194
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,840
Much better.

195
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,885
She fell asleep
after taking her medicine.

196
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:24,771
My mom said she was like this when
she was little due to poor immunity.

197
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,342
I feel less worried now.

198
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:30,114
You should've thought of
the consequences of your actions.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,114
Did you make her angry?

200
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,960
I knew it. I was already angry at you.

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
If my brother
hadn't asked me to tell you

202
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,942
about my sister's condition,
I wouldn't care about you either.

203
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,720
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,320
I had no idea
her condition was that bad.

205
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,485
My sister has always been over-anxious,

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,440
but she manages to hide it well.

207
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:52,320
My brother and I knew a long time ago

208
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,114
that she's been forcing a smile lately.

209
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,120
Ever since her quarrel with Mom
on New Year's Eve,

210
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,571
she's never really recovered.

211
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:00,879
Forget it.

212
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Dong, don't blame yourself too much.

213
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,228
She still has me and my brother.

214
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,200
I'll let you know again
if there's anything.

215
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,240
Thanks, Niaoniao.

216
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,771
You should get back inside.

217
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,480
What took you so long
just to lock the main gate?

218
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,320
So slow.

219
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,360
Mom.

220
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,039
We need to talk to you.

221
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,200
Mom, sit down here.

222
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,440
Talk about what?

223
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,879
It's late already.
Save it for tomorrow...

224
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:21,679
Mom.

225
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,279
I'm sure you can sense
that Jie is too anxious.

226
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,159
She got what she asked for,
isn't that right?

227
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,039
That temper of hers...

228
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,679
What's wrong with her temper?

229
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,057
Do you think she'd pass out
if she hadn't been holding things back?

230
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,240
I wonder who made her so angry.

231
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,320
She used to be madly in love
with Chen Maidong.

232
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,120
How could they end up like this
if no one's interfering?

233
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,720
Mom.

234
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,799
She's the most obedient
member of our family.

235
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,320
Since young, she has never been
disobedient to you.

236
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,440
You might not know this,

237
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,879
but she'd always remind us in secret

238
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
that although you've failed
to speak to us nicely,

239
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,440
you're still the most understanding one.

240
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,039
That's why we'd still listen to you.

241
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,240
When you said there's
a river ahead, we'd wade across it.

242
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,485
When you said there's
a ditch ahead, we'd go around it.

243
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,240
Because most of the time,
our parents will be right.

244
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,159
We can never have

245
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,279
the same amount of experience
and intuition as you.

246
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,720
But Mom, there's no guarantee that

247
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,971
you'll keep us safe
from harm our entire life, right?

248
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,039
Even when there's a net or a pit ahead,

249
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,759
if she insists on continuing that path,

250
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,120
just let her be

251
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,039
as she's rarely that persistent.

252
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,371
What are you looking at?

253
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,080
Are you happy now that it's my turn
to be lectured by them?

254
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,085
I won't interfere from now on.

255
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,285
The younger generations
will be fine on their own.

256
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,600
But here's the thing.

257
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,440
When we meet again in the future,

258
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,240
don't you dare say that I didn't
fulfill my responsibilities.

259
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:16,920
For a second,

260
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,510
I thought you were spraying pesticides.

261
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,457
I'm sure that's going
to make me sick eventually.

262
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,839
You are the largest vermin
in our family.

263
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,960
I'll disinfect here thoroughly

264
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,540
to protect your siblings.

265
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,440
Aren't you afraid?

266
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,119
I am your mother.

267
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
The virus should sit in awe of me.

268
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,279
Let me check.

269
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
The fever is gone.

270
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,720
I'm fine. I feel much better now.

271
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,119
I'm not that delicate.

272
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,440
Here.

273
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,280
Can this medicinal patch Xixia sent you

274
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,839
really treat nerve pains?

275
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,799
It won't treat it completely
but it's incredibly effective for me.

276
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,480
I've told you.

277
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,160
You should know more people

278
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,279
who care about your leg.

279
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,400
Did that person send you
the previous medicinal patches?

280
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,000
Who?

281
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,599
Chen Maidong.

282
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,680
Why can't you say his name?
Does calling his name hurt?

283
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,799
It's none of your business.

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,319
It's awkward for both of us

285
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,240
because I've never talked to you
about my boyfriend.

286
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,359
Probably.

287
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,079
My first reaction was
no one deserves you.

288
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,200
No guy should
dream about stealing my daughter.

289
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,240
I understand.

290
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,559
Tell me.

291
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,720
What is the difference

292
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:12,400
between Chen Maidong
and the arrogant one?

293
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,079
My love for Ji Tong was one-sided.

294
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Towards Chen Maidong, it's real love.

295
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,720
Fine. I can't listen anymore.

296
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,759
What is that? You disgust me.

297
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,880
How is that disgusting?

298
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,190
Have you never been a young girl?

299
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,359
I've never felt what you feel.

300
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,400
I don't get it.

301
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,279
Look at my goosebumps.

302
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,200
Nonsense.

303
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,640
We must deal with reality
regardless of the kind of love.

304
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Just face it.

305
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,680
I couldn't accept
how you take it one day at a time.

306
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,119
If both of you are sincere,
you should plan it well.

307
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,799
There are many
long-distance relationship couples.

308
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,559
Why can't you solve
your own relationship problem?

309
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,039
It's not about what I want now.

310
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,400
He is ignoring me.

311
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,759
He's acting arrogant now?

312
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,000
Madam Wu said the ratio of

313
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,240
men to women in nearby towns

314
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,114
at a suitable age for marriage
is eight to one according to statistics.

315
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,279
There are many men left over
with not many women.

316
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,200
Even the ugly ones can get married.

317
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,119
I'll go talk to him later.

318
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,839
Don't do that.

319
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,880
You might scare him.

320
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,519
Besides, love cannot be forced.

321
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,519
I'll try my best.

322
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,039
Just wait. I'll see how long
he can keep doing this.

323
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,860
(Great Man: Feeling better?)

324
00:21:54,457 --> 00:21:55,650
(Zhuang Jie: extremely bad.)

325
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,260
(I'm suffering. No one cares.)

326
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,900
(I'm outside your house.)

327
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,680
You...

328
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,200
What are you doing?

329
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,119
I... I'm looking for you.

330
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,350
What are you wearing?

331
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,640
Where's your jacket?
I can't wait to see you.

332
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:49,714
Do you want to die from illness?

333
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,400
Sorry. I'm ugly and smelly.

334
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,759
I don't think so.

335
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,799
You are just a good liar.
You were so active.

336
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,759
Do you think I'm so sick

337
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,240
that you need to see me in my bed?

338
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,559
Anyway, you are too conceited.

339
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:11,657
You always make people
play into your hands.

340
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,799
That's because you care about me.

341
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,720
That's so corny. I can't take it.

342
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:22,971
I'm glad that you are fine.

343
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:23,960
I'm leaving then.

344
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,440
Sure. Go on.

345
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,599
You are letting me go easily this time.

346
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,440
Although I want to kiss you,

347
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:50,142
I'm afraid
I might spread the illness to you.

348
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,542
Whatever. I want you
to owe me a big one.

349
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,519
Nonsense. Being sick is torturing.

350
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,039
I can't bear to see you suffer.

351
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,960
Enough with the sweet talk.

352
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,799
I'll give you a chance
to give me an explanation.

353
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,519
Chen Maidong.

354
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,759
I sincerely apologize to you.

355
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,400
That day, I ran my mouth because...

356
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,440
I dare not remove my prosthetics
in front of any men.

357
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,571
I was scared.

358
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,319
Sorry.

359
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,457
I understand.

360
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,680
I forgive you.

361
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,480
Go back.

362
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,480
When you've recovered,
I'll date you again.

363
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:08,920
Stay for a while longer.

364
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,319
(In the vast galaxies
and among so many people,)

365
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,250
(knowing each other and falling in love
is such an incredible feeling.)

366
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,599
(Why is God so good at creating people?)

367
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,039
(It gives people joy, rage, worry,
love, lust, and hatred.)

368
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,160
(It makes people suffer
and extremely happy.)

369
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,980
(Zhuang Jie tickled Great Man)

370
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,940
(Look at my Moments!)

371
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,400
(Why is God so good at creating people?
It gives people joy, rage, worry, love, lust,)

372
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,600
(and hatred. It makes people suffer
and extremely happy.)

373
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
(Like)

374
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,160
(Great Man liked your post)

375
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:55,359
I'm so tired. Has Mom gone mad?

376
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,279
It's just 6 am.

377
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,200
I wonder if she's getting revenge.

378
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,079
Don't talk behind someone's back.

379
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,359
I don't do petty things like that.

380
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,599
I'm so tired.

381
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,039
Coming.

382
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,119
Don't worry.

383
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,990
The eggs are not broken.
The porridge is not burnt.

384
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,319
The side dishes are my signature.

385
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,400
Take what you want.

386
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,160
Jie, have you recovered?

387
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,160
I've completely recovered.

388
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,519
I felt refreshed
when I woke up this morning.

389
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,000
Doing nothing felt like a torture.

390
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,200
Jie. You are the only one
who has enough sleep.

391
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,780
Go back to sleep
after you finish eating.

392
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,240
I'll do all the work today.

393
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,880
All of you have suffered
because of my illness.

394
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,279
Mom, why do you look so swollen?

395
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,640
Did you not sleep well last night?

396
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:52,028
None of us could sleep well.

397
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,279
Last night, in the yard,

398
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,359
there were two rats
talking the whole night.

399
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,150
I was afraid
that the male rat might sneak in.

400
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,880
I kept looking for rat poison.

401
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,680
If you hear any rats from now on,

402
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,359
just continue sleeping.

403
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,279
Cats and rats go their separate ways.

404
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,200
They won't come inside the house
no matter what.

405
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,119
Stop it!

406
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,559
You kicked me.

407
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,759
Wait.

408
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,314
What do you want?

409
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,680
Are you not working today?

410
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,279
Why are you alone?

411
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:54,685
Where are your siblings?

412
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,839
They are sleeping.

413
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,400
Apparently, they couldn't sleep well

414
00:28:57,428 --> 00:28:59,571
because there were
two noisy rats outside last night.

415
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,171
Your whole family are good listeners.

416
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,359
You are right.

417
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,240
It's tough being a rat recently.

418
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,920
Stop standing here.
You are disturbing my work.

419
00:29:11,514 --> 00:29:12,940
Is your mother not around as well?

420
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,150
I'm letting her take a break.

421
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,640
She is probably cleaning the house.

422
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,960
Go inside.
I'll manage the stall for you.

423
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,519
Can you do it?

424
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,310
Am I worse than
the two rats at your home?

425
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:27,780
Don't underestimate me.

426
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,914
One of them is pretty
and the other is good at shouting.

427
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,599
Sorry. I'm good at both.

428
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,599
Go in. It's cold out here.

429
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,240
Wait. What is this?

430
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,720
Zhuang Jie, let's have another date.

431
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,319
A proper and grand date.

432
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,000
Sure.

433
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
This time, it will be successful.

434
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,210
(Recently, cold air will
continue to move south.)

435
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,710
(Cold wave warnings
have been issued.)

436
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,630
(Temperatures in many areas
are decreasing.)

437
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,490
(Our area will experience a flash freeze
that hasn't been seen for decades)

438
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,160
(Experts say that the low temperature)

439
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,519
(will continue for a week.
It'll be damp.)

440
00:30:48,571 --> 00:30:51,030
(The public is advised to
keep themselves warm when going out.)

441
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,839
How do you make this 10,000 times

442
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,039
better than us
with the same ingredients?

443
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,039
It's our first proper date after all.

444
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,079
I must use some of my unique skills.

445
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,039
Teach me.

446
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,200
No need.

447
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,971
I'll make it for you if you want.

448
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,799
Chen Maidong,
you are good at scheming.

449
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,839
You use this method
so I can't leave you.

450
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:27,457
What's wrong with that?

451
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,359
Everything needs to be managed.

452
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,519
I'm scheming so you know that.

453
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,720
I overestimated you previously.

454
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,599
I thought you were the type
to contribute silently.

455
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,079
That's a fool.

456
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,069
From now on, I will tell you

457
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,371
about everything I do for you.

458
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,880
I'll exaggerate everything.

459
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:51,920
Otherwise, someone ungrateful like you
won't remember anything in the future.

460
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,839
I agree.

461
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,839
I completely agree with this point.

462
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,150
I was so touched after reading
"Letter from an Unknown Woman"

463
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,200
when I was young.

464
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,839
However, I knew I couldn't do it.

465
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,240
Sacrificing your whole life
for love is too stupid.

466
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:13,759
One can only know how to love others

467
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,920
when he knows how to love himself first.

468
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,400
Moreover, even family ties bound
by blood are unreliable.

469
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,960
Gambling your life with love

470
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,240
is a burden for both people.

471
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,079
Both of us are so tacky.

472
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,039
Modern people are smart.
They are usually calculative.

473
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,542
It's not good as well.

474
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,342
They made love appear
to not be worth mentioning.

475
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,640
True love won't depreciate
no matter what.

476
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,480
Lovers, friends,
and beloved are just names.

477
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,839
The term I like most is sweetheart.

478
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,759
It's called sweetheart
in Western countries.

479
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,171
The brain is not required in love.

480
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,599
You just need your heart.

481
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,559
People who work in sales
like you are good at talking.

482
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:44,640
Come here.

483
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,240
I dare not.

484
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,359
Why?

485
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,559
I have a trauma.

486
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,400
Cut the nonsense.

487
00:33:54,914 --> 00:33:55,942
Are you coming or not?

488
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,119
No. What will you do?

489
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
You won't come to me?

490
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,240
I'll go to you.

491
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,400
I'll say this first.

492
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
No matter what you do tonight,

493
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,519
I won't be fooled again.

494
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,639
Fine.

495
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,840
Let me think about what I can do.

496
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,119
You better be good.

497
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:31,440
If you do it again,

498
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,920
something bad might happen to me.

499
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,800
Zhuang Jie.

500
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,079
What?

501
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,519
It's snowing.

502
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,119
It's true.

503
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,800

you are not ready.

530
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,159
I can wait.

531
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,599
What?

532
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:10,679
Are you missing me so soon?

533

534
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,880
I'm not a frivolous person.

535
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,519
I know.

536
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,800
When I was in high school,

537
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,079
a matchmaker came to my house.

538
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,159
The guy had polio, but he was kind.

539
00:39:38,057 --> 00:39:40,030
The matchmaker
asked my mother to be realistic.

540
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:43,239
She said a girl like me
shouldn't study too much.

541
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,679
Learning a life skill
and living a normal life

542
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
was better than anything.

543
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,440
I was almost persuaded back then.

544
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,519
However, my mother
scolded the matchmaker

545
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,519
and told me studying was the only thing

546
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,719
that could help change my fate.

547
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,760
It's as if everyone has agreed

548
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,400
that a girl like me should deserve

549
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,920
someone with a physical disability.

550
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,039
That's the reality.

551
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,119
However, my mother taught me

552
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,599
to teach reality a lesson.

553
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,440
If I am excellent enough,
my disability is no longer a problem.

554
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,320
So, I live harder than anyone else.

555
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,679
I want to take control of everything.

556
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,360
I want to choose someone

557
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,639
instead of
letting someone else choose me.

558
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,719
I thought I did it.

559
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,880
When I went to university,
I had a boyfriend.

560
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,440
He was good in all aspects.

561
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,657
However,

562
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,485
when we wanted to be intimate
for the first time,

563
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,840
he was obviously shocked by my leg.

564
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:08,079
When I first did
the amputation surgery,

565
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,360
my family was poor.

566
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,239
I was discharged
before my wounds were healed.

567
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,119
The socket didn't fit as well.

568
00:41:18,885 --> 00:41:21,510
My wound was infected
and I had a high fever. I almost died.

569
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,400
So, the stump looked hideous.

570
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,360
Since that day,

571
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,920
I never showed anyone my prosthetic.

572
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,599
So, Chen Maidong,

573
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,159
I was only pretending in front of you.

574
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,920
I've never done
anything intimate with anyone else.

575
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,519
It's nothing humiliating.

576
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,000
After I started my current job,
I never got close to anyone.

577
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,400
Zhuang Jie, I've thought it through.

578
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,280
Friends, lovers, or sweetheart.

579
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,857
Anything is fine by me.

580
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,514
As long as we can be together,

581
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,600
I can be with you forever.

582
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,119
Because of you,

583
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,000
I can do it.

584
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,239
Chen Maidong,

585
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,400
do you

586
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,880
