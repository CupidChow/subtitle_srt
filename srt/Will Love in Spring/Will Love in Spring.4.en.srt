1
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,278
What's with the cocky look?

2
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,897
Everyone knows about your family.

3
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:13,747
That's right.

4
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:14,988
Your father had a mistress.

5
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:16,107
Everyone knew about that.

6
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:16,747
Precisely.

7
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:17,598
Are you acting cocky

8
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,668
just because you're rich?

9
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:21,811
Since your father is having an affair,
is your mother not returning home as well?

10
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:23,789
Maybe she's having an affair too.

11
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:25,709
I'm sure of it.

12
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:28,588
You want to fight?

13
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:30,709
Try and touch me if you dare!

14
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:36,748
Come on.

15
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:40,269
What are you doing?

16
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,429
How dare you hit me?

17
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,069
My goodness.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,069
He's quite good at putting on a front.

19
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:49,828
Let's go.

20
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:51,468
Let's just ignore him.

21
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:53,429
Hurry up. Let's go.

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,321
Wait for me.

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,720
Chen Maidong!

24
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,321
What are you doing?

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,681
Chen Maidong!

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
Come back!

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,201
You're fighting for real, huh?

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,879
Let go of me!

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,561
Chen Maidong, let go!

(People's Government of Nanping Town)

34
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:02,240
I'm not late, aren't I?

35
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,240
Jie, you're here.

36
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,680
Not at all. You're not late.

37
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,321
Get a seat.

38
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,120
Madam Wu,

39
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,120
there's no need to rush.

40
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,039
I usually run around

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,750
during work hours.

42
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,012
I'm already used to it.

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,041
Hi, everyone. I'm Zhuang Jie.

44
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,960
You're Song Xinran, am I right?

45
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:16,759
The first student

46
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,970
who majored in Arabic Studies.

47
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,480
Let's add each other on WeChat later.

48
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,800
What's your current occupation?

49
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,800
I felt inadequate

50
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:23,039
working in the past few years.

51
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
Now, I'm focusing on my PhD study.

52
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,080
You're so good at studying.

53
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,640
I was less intelligent after pregnancy.

54
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,480
I already forgot everything
I learned in university.

55
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,120
Me too.

56
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:31,801
I feel sleepy when I read books now.

57
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,960
Everyone has their own expertise.

58
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,959
Raising a child
is an exceptional ability too.

59
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,540
Come.

60
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,960
Let's add each other on WeChat.

61
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,901
Come. Scan my profile.

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,441
Zhuang Jie,

63
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,000
where are you working now?

64
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,120
It's still the same.

65
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm still working for
Dalton Medical Products,

66
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:49,960
a French company since I graduated.

67
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm envious of
white-collared workers like you all.

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,720
Businessmen like us
have to spend much effort.

69
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,321
My hair grew white in just a few years.

70
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:57,000
It doesn't matter even if it's white.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
At least it's better

72
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:58,920
than going bald, like me.

73
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,600
Alright, I'll add you.

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
No jobs are easy.

75
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:03,759
To be honest,

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,519
guys,

77
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,570
please come and find me

78
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,879
if you need any medical products.

79
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,319
Although I didn't major in that,

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,160
I've learned a lot

81
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:10,450
by being in the industry.

82
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:13,080
Since we're all from the same town,
we should help each other out.

83
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,600
That's right.

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,760
One more friend, one more way.

85
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,399
Let's create a group chat
and keep in touch.

86
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,361
Precisely.

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,440
I worked in another state,

88
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,639
but I feel that my friends here

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,160
are the closest to me.

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,982
If we make friends

91
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:22,959
in all kinds of trades,

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,160
we won't get scammed

93
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,520
when we buy something, right?

94
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,920
Come, old friend.

95
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,669
Let's add each other on WeChat.

96
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,212
You wish to add me
when I'm in this industry?

97
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Why can't I add you
when you're in this industry?

98
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:40,831
I came out in a hurry.

99
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,983
I left my phone in the funeral parlor.

100
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:06,680
Sorry about that.

101
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:07,761
Sorry for the wait.

102
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,719
Mayor.

103
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,121
- Everyone has arrived.
- Okay.

104
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,399
These are the local specialties

105
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,319
of our town.

106
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,681
Distribute them to everyone.

107
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,190
Let's thank the mayor

108
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:17,269
for preparing
such wonderful hometown snacks.

109
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,279
Greetings, Mayor.

110
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,360
Hello, everyone.

111
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:20,600
Please be seated.

112
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:21,600
Okay.

113
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:22,930
Actually,

114
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:24,959
I wanted to hold
a gathering with you all long ago.

115
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,040
Initially, I wanted to hold it
during Chinese New Year.

116
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:27,960
But you returned during

117
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,080
the Labor Day holiday.

118
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,361
If that's the case,
there's no time better than now.

119
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:33,720
I know many of you

120
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,000
were born in Nanping

121
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,040
and grew up here.

122
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,120
But please pardon me for being straight.

123
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,760
You guys might not know

124
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:41,298
your hometown as well as you think.

125
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,681
You might not understand

126
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,240
how urgently we need you guys

127
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,400
to come back.

128
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:46,840
Ma.

129
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:48,621
(Beautiful Hometown)

130
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,080
All of us know

131
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,031
that Nanping is quite a wealthy town.

132
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,680
We have listed pharmaceutical factories,

133
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,399
(Map of Nanping Town)
large-scale electric appliance factories,

134
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,759
(Map of Nanping Town)
and internationally renowned porcelain factories.

135
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,801
Our tourism and aquaculture sectors
are commendable as well.

136
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:01,959
I'll stop bragging

137
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,160
about our hometown.

138
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,468
I'll talk about

139
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:05,868
the things we're worried about.

140
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:07,391
The pharmaceutical factories here

141
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,879
plan to relocate to the city

142
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,920
in five years.

143
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:12,681
This will cause thousands of people
to lose their jobs directly.

144
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:15,212
(Views of Nanping Town)
Our tourism sector

145
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,160
isn't as vibrant

146
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,319
as what people say.

147
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,740
The disparity between
peak season

148
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:20,511
and non-peak season
is a cause of concern.

149
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:21,759
And,

150
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,761
the industrial zone
that's being built right now

151
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,399
has empty factories

152
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,681
as far as our eyes can see.

153
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,360
Therefore,

154
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:30,040
I'm here to seek the help

155
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,121
of all of you sincerely.

156
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,354
I hope you guys can think of a solution

157
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,469
for our town based on

158
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,960
your experience and knowledge.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,039
(Letter to youth of Nanping town)
Our town doesn't lack money.

160
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,297
We lack talented individuals.

161
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:43,040
Capable youngsters

162
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,554
like you all

163
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:47,183
usually don't come back after
getting accepted into universities.

164
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,440
I don't expect you guys

165
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:50,280
to remain in this town.

166
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:51,920
I just hope

167
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,440
that you guys can visit

168
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,201
your hometown often.

169
00:07:55,831 --> 00:07:57,098
Just give us some ideas

170
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,641
to help out the town.

171
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,361
My gratitude knows no bounds.

172
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,279
Besides that,

173
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,839
over here,

174
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,400
I would like to introduce someone.

175
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,881
Chen Maidong.

176
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,310
He's the first person

177
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:15,955
to return here from a first-tier city.

178
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:17,400
He's a talented youth

179
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,639
who takes care of his grandmother

180
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,321
while helping the town out.

181
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:24,720
And, he's working in a funeral parlor,
which is a noble occupation.

182
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,160
Our town

183
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:29,000
is always filled with lonely old folks.

184
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,668
Their bodies were only discovered

185
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,269
after they passed away for some time.

186
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:34,241
Ever since his return,

187
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,960
not only did he help the deceased

188
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,121
regain their pride,

189
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,440
but he also helped out
the old folks' homes

190
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,440
and lonely old folks
whose names were registered.

191
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:42,319
Even the province

192
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,480
sent a team here just to learn from him.

193
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
This is what I was saying just now.

194
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,001
As long as we have talented individuals,

195
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,800
all obstacles

196
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:51,740
will be resolved.

197
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,981
(Keep oneself when in distress
and benefit others when in power)

198
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,680
However,

199
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:58,320
it's our negligence

200
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:00,441
for not being able to find a partner

201
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,761
for our role model here.

202
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:04,761
Since

203
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,160
all of you are here,

204
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,001
those who are single

205
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,081
should take a look around.

206
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,481
We should resolve this internally

207
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:13,680
if it's possible.

208
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,800
We should
keep the goodies within the family.

209
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:16,961
Am I right?

210
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:18,601
I'm sure all of you know

211
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,920
whether you're single or not.

212
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,601
Don't force me to call out your names.

213
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:26,160
You guys may not be worried,
but your parents are very worried.

214
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:27,359
Of course,

215
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,241
this is an important event for the town.

216
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,470
He's still pretending to be cool.

217
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,400
If you don't believe me,
you can look at Madam Wu.

218
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,841
She's so worried
that she's constantly frowning.

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,560
Alright.

220
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:41,761
That's all I have to say today.

221
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,160
I have a meeting to attend later.

222
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:44,880
You guys don't need
to leave immediately.

223
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:47,319
You guys can talk
and interact with each other.

224
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,481
Chat with each other, okay?

225
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:50,479
I'll make a move first.

226
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,119
Thank you, Mayor.

227
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,599
Okay. See you guys around.

228
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,361
Goodbye.

229
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:55,560
Let them chat.

230
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,710
Okay.

231
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't leave yet.
I'll come back soon.

232
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,081
Have a nice chat.

233
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:01,440
That's what you get.

234
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,481
Did you drive here?

235
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,160
I did.

236
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,151
It's the workplace vehicle.

237
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,560
What do you mean?

238
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:11,800
It's a hearse.

239
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:15,320
Fine.

240
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:16,319
I won't bother you.

241
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,280
See you around.

242
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:19,881
You brought that upon yourself.

243
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:33,800
Wasn't the prosthetic limb
made with the newest materials?

244
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,440
Buddy, it's faulty
only after six months.

245
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,881
Did you scam me?

246
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:38,440
Wait.

247
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:40,382
I'm sure it got deformed
due to wear and tear.

248
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:41,520
But why can't I walk straight

249
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:42,841
after bumping into something?

250
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,319
Wait.

251
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,120
What do you mean by
my strides are too wide?

252
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,280
Don't try to be a smart alec.

253
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,359
I know it has vertical damping

254
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,690
and rotational torque functions.

255
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,470
If not, why would I

256
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:59,041
pay you so much in the first place?

257
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,068
Forget it.

258
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:05,326
I'll settle my debts with you
when I return to Shanghai.

259
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,121
Hop on.

That's kind of dangerous.

278
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,355
You do cherish your life, huh?

279
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,680
A grown man like you
is afraid of people hugging your waist?

280
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,869
You have a spare tire?

281
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,680
Why are you so talkative now?

282
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:53,241
I was talkative from the start.

283
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:54,960
You weren't like this
when you were young.

284
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,812
What do you mean?

285
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:57,155
You're extrovert.

286
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:57,920
Isn't that good?

287
00:14:58,012 --> 00:14:58,719
Didn't you realize

288
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,690
that I alone

289
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,755
changed the awkward vibe
of the meeting just now?

290
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,640
Please be quiet.

291
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,040
At least you won't be that annoying.

292
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:05,839
Not at all.

293
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,881
I think everyone likes me.

294
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:10,881
Chen Maidong,

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,881
do you feel uncomfortable?

296
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,440
Chen Maidong,

297
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:18,001
don't tell me you still
think I have feelings for you.

298
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:22,880
To be honest, when I saw you

299
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,839
in the bullet train,

300
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,680
even though I didn't

301
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:25,520
recognize you,

302
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:26,280
I think

303
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:27,359
my heart

304
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,680
still skipped a beat.

305
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:29,755
I thought to myself

306
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,719
that this guy looked so refined.

307
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,110
He looked like my cup of tea.

308
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:34,412
When I take a closer look,

309
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:36,119
it's you, Chen Maidong,

310
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,520
my old flame.

311
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:40,119
What's with the emergency brake?

312
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,920
Get off.

313
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,121
Give me your crutch.

314
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:43,599
Which eye of yours

315
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,001
still saw me using crutches?

316
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,640
Hey, I was just saying.
Why are you robbing me?

317
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:49,800
How dare you throw my bag?

318
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:50,880
Old man, what are you doing?

319
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:51,961
I'll call the cops!

320
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:04,079
You keep feeding me sweet food

321
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,721
even when I'm at this age.

322
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,841
Are you up to no good?

323
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,881
At your age,

324
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,719
I'll be up to no good

325
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,280
if I don't allow you to take sweet food.

326
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,881
I guess I'm old now.

327
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,079
Everyone calls me Granny

328
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,920
when they see me on the streets.

329
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,199
Time

330
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,841
is just like a bridge.

331
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:25,119
Every one of us
has to walk from one side

332
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
to the other side.

333
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:27,999
At our age,

334
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,119
we've almost

335
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,641
reached the other side.

336
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,081
Now, we can just sit and wait

337
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,800
for the others to cross the bridge.

338
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,800
Although that's the case,

339
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:38,320
times are different now.

340
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:39,940
Now that we're
waiting on the other side,

341
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:41,680
I wanted to see what the youth are doing

342
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,560
and impart some
life experiences to them.

343
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,560
But now, I feel like

344
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm useless.

345
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,999
I have to depend
on my grandson to teach me.

346
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,479
The older you get,

347
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,241
the more questions you have.

348
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,211
That's why

349
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,001
you wanted to do divination
all the time.

350
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,040
Speaking of which,

351
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,040
those cards of yours,

352
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,520
the tarot cards,

353
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,959
those are nonsense.

354
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,920
After that,

355
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,640
I intimidated the two

356
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,640
by telling them

357
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:07,320
that they were destined to be together.

358
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,081
You need affinity

359
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,761
to be able to intimidate them too.

360
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,400
For some reason,

361
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,400
I like Jie.

362
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,200
She's just like
the younger version of me.

363
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,400
But after that,

364
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:23,601
she told me wholeheartedly

365
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,097
that she wasn't willing to stay here.

366
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:27,640
She's going to return to Shanghai.

367
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:29,383
I felt like
she wasn't like me after that.

368
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,041
I spent my entire life

369
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:32,601
in this very town.

370
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,200
Even now, I think

371
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,680
that it's a great place

372
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,240
since it has natural sceneries,

373
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,799
buildings, houses,

374
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,160
and nice people.

375
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,080
Look at all those big cities filled
with concrete and cement.

376
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,040
And, it's so noisy there.
What's so good about it?

377
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,200
You can't just

378
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,279
compare yourself

379
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,801
to women nowadays.

380
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:53,360
Women of this generation

381
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:55,121
are very independent.

382
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,840
The home they're looking for

383
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:59,281
is a place where they can rest

384
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,041
both their body and soul.

385
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Speaking of which,

386
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,281
the poem you taught me to recite

387
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:07,281
is truly fitting.

388
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,321
"I was born without a home.

389
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,680
Home is where the heart is."

390
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,760
To Jie,

391
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,521
Nanping is a great place.

392
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't think
it'll be difficult to keep her here.

393
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,240
Now, it depends on

394
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:25,759
whether or not Dong is lucky enough

395
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
to win her heart.

396
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:40,561
Chen Maidong.

397
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:41,881
You're ruthless.

398
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,183
This bag is more precious
than me, you know?

399
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,321
Zhuang Jie,

400
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,760
your legs looked fine

401
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,298
when you kicked that person.

402
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,600
It's all thanks to adrenaline.

403
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,521
Got it?

404
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:57,550
But speaking of which,

405
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:59,600
the prosthetic limb I ordered
isn't free, you know?

406
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,231
Although something went wrong,

407
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,080
it can still be used

408
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:03,561
after I get used to it.

409
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,041
So,

410
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:08,012
you were joking with me all along?

411
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,521
Don't tell me you think I...

412
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:16,160
Joking with you?

413
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
Which part do you mean?

414
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:20,519
The part where I pretended to limp?

415
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,760
Or the part where

416
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,479
I said you were my cup of tea

417
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,680
and my old flame?

418
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:29,680
Both.

419
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,081
Both are true.

420
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,680
But both can be false as well.

421
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,000
It depends on how you understand it.

422
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,160
You're something else.

423
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,801
You've changed entirely.

424
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,000
It's not that bad.

425
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,199
Life is short.

426
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,960
There's no need to be serious.

427
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,279
For example, all those youngsters
who joined the meeting this afternoon

428
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,920
were passionate and hot-blooded.

429
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:06,999
But once they leave the door,

430
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,920
when the wind blows
and the dust settles,

431
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,039
no one will remember

432
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,400
their promise.

433
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,498
The meat processing plant in the town

434
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:14,990
was an investment
by the second son

435
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:17,012
of the Wang family
from Beijing to our town.

436
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:19,121
Terraced fields
will be built on the hills.

437
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:20,600
Yanggou Village has planted

438
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:21,920
tens of mus of Chinese yams.

439
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:23,799
All of these were contributed

440
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,719
by youngsters

441
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,960
working in other provinces.

442
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:28,480
Zhuang Jie,

443
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:31,268
you came here
when you were over ten years old.

444
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:33,183
You couldn't understand the town.

445
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:34,750
But that doesn't mean

446
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,955
that everyone
loves to speak gibberish like you.

447
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:43,510
Chen Maidong, do you think

448
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:45,298
my sense of awareness
is lower than yours?

449
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:47,160
Did you think
I became the top saleswoman

450
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,281
due to pure luck?

451
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:49,641
Tomorrow, I'll show you.

452
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,041
I'll show you!

453
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:52,279
I'll show you the kind

454
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,281
of contributions I can make
to my hometown!

455
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,121
Mom!

456
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:03,841
Mom!

457
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,720
Mom!

458
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,121
I need the crutch.

459
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:11,281
Yan,

460
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,361
now, you believe me, right?

461
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:15,960
Our sister is being gaslighted.

462
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
That might be true.

463
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:23,719
Keep an eye on

464
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,000
Taixin Health Care.

465
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:26,440
Their respiratory pumps should've

466
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:27,497
been replaced long ago.

467
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:29,383
I'll do a follow-up
once I return to Shanghai.

468
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:30,880
Don't worry about it.

469
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,561
I won't let anything escape me.

470
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:33,680
The new girl

471
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:34,680
who joined our company

472
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:36,281
wanted to proceed with the deal.

473
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,400
I dealt with her.

474
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:38,983
She has no respect for us at all.

475
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:41,281
She's new, huh?

476
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,890
It's common for her

477
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:44,326
to try to make a name for herself.

478
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:45,239
But she won't be able

479
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,321
to close the deal.

480
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:47,039
Yeah.

481
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,880
They're ice cold.

482
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,521
Ordinary salespeople cannot stand them.

483
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,080
You're the only person

484
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:52,121
who can close the deal.

485
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:54,841
To be honest, I didn't really
suffer under their hands.

486
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,279
Since I'm a disabled individual,

487
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,199
they showed me

488
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,199
a lot of respect.

489
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,320
It takes a strong heart for

490
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:01,279
one to turn their disabilities
into their strengths

491
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,081
with an open heart.

492
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,841
How did you manage to do it?

493
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:06,920
I remember that you were

494
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:08,120
introvert in high school.

495
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:10,240
You avoided people
when you went to the restroom.

496
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,521
I was enlightened by a saint.

497
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:12,880
Really?

498
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:13,600
Who is it?

499
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,098
How could I not know about that?

500
00:22:15,155 --> 00:22:17,583
What? You think you know
everything there is in life?

501
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:19,601
You do have a point.

502
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,959
Back then,

503
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,440
you were already very creative.

504
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,298
You were super mysterious
and unpredictable.

505
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:25,182
Nonsense.

506
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:27,999
High school students are silly.
There's nothing mysterious about me.

507
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,400
Tell me, then.

508
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,521
Who was it?

509
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,561
It was Chen Maidong.

510
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,382
He was the first person who told me

511
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:37,190
that a crutch

512
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,812
could be used as a weapon too.

513
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:43,521
You two actually
talked about that before?

514
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,400
When did it happen?

515
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,940
Enough already.

516
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:47,759
I can already imagine

517
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,321
that nosy look on your face.

518
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:51,920
It's because
there's something fishy about your tone.

519
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,121
Tell me about it.

520
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,160
How did you two

521
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,320
get together back then?

522
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:56,279
What are you saying?

523
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,039
We didn't even speak much to each other.

524
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,440
Stop pretending.

525
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:00,990
The intimate way of you guys

526
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:03,183
is enough for us
to gossip about it for years, okay?

527
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:17,680
Is someone else in there?

528
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,641
I...

529
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
I'm the only person.

530
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,521
Here.

531
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:32,641
I have to deliver it to you
personally too?

532
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,801
Why don't you use me as your crutch?

533
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:36,760
Take it.

534
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,041
I'm a disabled individual.

535
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:49,760
My limbs aren't as good as yours.

536
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,160
You didn't apologize to me

537
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:57,361
or

538
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,920
thank me for it.

539
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
I was teaching you.

540
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:07,641
A crutch

541
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,081
can be used as a weapon too.

542
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,601
Your crutch is such a waste on you.

543
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,719
Who are you trying

544
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,321
to show your pitiful face to?

545
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,440
Speak for yourself.

546
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:19,281
Who are you trying

547
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:20,955
to show your spiteful face to?

548
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:33,955
Don't tell me you're going to hit

549
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,121
a female disabled individual!

550
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:43,680
No one will treat you

551
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,160
as a disabled individual

552
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,960
if you don't talk about it all the time.

553
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,121
Speak for yourself.

554
00:24:53,683 --> 00:24:56,320
You don't like hearing gossip
because you have a guilty conscience.

555
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:58,960
If you don't want to listen to them,
just close your ears.

556
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:00,755
You keep getting into fights.

557
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:02,081
Can you defeat all of them?

558
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:14,641
The crutch is wet.

559
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,641
I can walk by myself.

560
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:21,041
As if I'm concerned about you.

561
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:26,920
Chen Maidong,

562
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,720
you owe me a favor.

563
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,160
Fine.

564
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,920
I'll return the favor
the way you want it.

565
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,601
What about Chen Maidong?

566
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,841
He has no role in the play.

567
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,760
He and I will play the two trees.

568
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,440
Zhuang Jie,

569
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,160
you're pretty courageous, aren't you?

570
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,440
Seems like

571
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,881
everyone was wrong about you back then.

572
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,360
Maybe the crutch I used during my youth

573
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:19,281
sealed me away for
that particular moment.

574
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,400
But I started living my life

575
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:23,412
after Chen Maidong undid the seal on it.

576
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,160
If that's the case,

577
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,160
all those

578
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:33,200
intimate moments between you and him,

579
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,720
did you plan for them from the start?

580
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
Go away.

581
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,080
Why does everything sound wrong

582
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:41,241
when you talk about it?

583
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,160
I'll hang up now.

584
00:26:44,441 --> 00:26:45,361
Hello?

585
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,881
Zhuang Jie, we'll go now. Goodbye.

586
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:29,555
Are you dumb?
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

587
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,120
You're the dumb one here.

588
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:33,519
It's inconvenient for me
to use an umbrella.

589
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,640
It's a burden for me.

590
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,983
Can't you afford a raincoat, then?

591
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,361
I don't like it.

592
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:41,480
It looks ugly.

593
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:51,920
Get on.

594
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:55,955
I can't jump onto your back.

595
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,561
You're so heavy.

596
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,321
Look. It's Chen Maidong and Zhuang Jie.

597
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,561
Yeah.

598
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,041
Since when were they this close?

599
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:45,211
Chen Maidong,

600
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:46,959
you must've done something wrong again.

601
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,801
Did our teacher make you
carry Zhuang Jie?

602
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,881
Do you need any help?

603
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:53,440
Look at him. He's as cocky as ever.

604
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,321
Precisely.

605
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:55,720
Let's go.

606
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:15,471
Where did you go?
It's late now, you know?

607
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,759
You know that it's late too, huh?

608
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,920
I was planning to find you.

609
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,160
Of all the functions
to learn on a smartphone,

610
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,400
you could put it
on silent and turn off.

611
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:23,799
I can't even find you.

612
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,999
Enough. Stop nagging.

613
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,199
You nag like an old man.

614
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
It's dark now, you know?

615
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,600
You should send me a voice message

616
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,160
or told me what time you'd come back.

617
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:31,669
How many times have I told you this?

618
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,080
I don't like to be interrupted

619
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:34,370
when I chat with my friends.

620
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:36,120
I've been taking
the same path my entire life.

621
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,081
Why would I get lost?

622
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:38,480
You're worried for nothing.

623
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,000
Fine. It's my fault.

624
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,641
Tell me what's your fault.

625
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:45,081
Everything's my fault.

626
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:46,269
You're brushing me off.

627
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:47,840
It's your fault

628
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:49,199
for not having a nightlife.

629
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,641
That's why you keep bothering me.

630
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:52,360
I was pretty happy

631
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:53,841
when I saw that you were leaving.

632
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,719
I thought "You're grown up
and asked Jie out..."

633
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,521
Please stop.

634
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,841
Stop right there.

635
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,498
What the heck is wrong with her?

636
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,601
I'm sure she's gone mad.

637
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:16,400
You two must've lost your mind!

638
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,841
Speak for yourself!

639
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,120
What? Anything else?

640
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:21,526
If not, return to your rooms.

641
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,281
Jie,

642
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
actually,

643
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,519
let me say this first.

644
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,559
What is this?

645
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,841
Is this a facial mask?

646
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:33,790
Jie, why are you

647
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,726
wearing a helmet
when you're going to sleep?

648
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,561
Are you addicted to riding motorcycles?

649
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,759
Although I'm wearing a mask,

650
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,719
I'm not blind.

651
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,160
I can see what you two are doing,

652
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:46,041
you know?

653
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,601
Jie,

654
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:49,200
we're truly worried about you.

655
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,521
Why do you say so?

656
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,470
Actually, we found out

657
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:54,241
about your relationship
with Chen Maidong.

658
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:56,400
Which part?

659
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,755
Stop trying to avoid the topic.

660
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,920
Chen Maidong does have a great image.

661
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:02,400
He Niaoniao.

662
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:03,321
However,

663
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,080
this playboy

664
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:07,519
relied on his good looks
and toyed with our sister back then.

665
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,361
And now,
he's trying to do the same thing.

666
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,041
We'll never agree to it.

667
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,199
Chen Maidong? Playboy?

668
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,190
Who told you?

669
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:15,640
Actually, I don't believe her either.

670
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,760
I have the feeling
that she watched too many dramas.

671
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,561
Yan, how could you say that?

672
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:23,370
You were the one who said Jie
was the local ugly duckling.

673
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:25,321
You said she had the potential
of getting gaslighted.

674
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:26,550
That's a private conversation.

675
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,183
You didn't have to tell her about it.

676
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,720
- It's like you're revealing our chat history.
- You betrayed.

677
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:32,041
You're a terrible teammate.

678
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,081
There's nothing

679
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:39,400
between us.

680
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,521
Chen Maidong is pretty nice.

681
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:43,183
He helped me out before.

682
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:44,680
But you see,

683
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,680
he never fell for me.

684
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,081
We were just classmates.

685
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,869
What gives him the right
to not fall for you?

686
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,199
That's not it.
He just didn't fall for her.

687
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,750
He Niaoniao,

688
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:56,955
there's an issue
with the way you analyze things.

689
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:59,080
What gives him the right
to not fall for you?

690
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:00,080
Who knows?

691
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:01,360
I didn't do any research on it.

692
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:02,160
If so,

693
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,480
Jie, do you like him?

694
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:14,720
To be honest,

695
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,680
I don't know what it feels like

696
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:18,680
to like someone

697
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:19,841
genuinely.

698
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,480
Here, give it a try.

699
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,641
Chen Maidong.

700
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:38,641
Talk.

701
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,720
About what?

702
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:42,440
Stop pretending.

703
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,269
I attended the meeting this afternoon.

704
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:49,960
I encountered Zhuang Jie.

705
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,801
But we didn't have a chance to talk.

706
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:55,470
After that, her legs started aching.

707
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:57,126
I rode my bike and sent her home.

708
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,321
And then?

709
00:32:58,881 --> 00:32:59,881
That's all.

710
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,081
I rebuked her.

711
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:02,601
You actually rebuked Jie?

712
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,400
She doesn't speak nicely at all.

713
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:07,669
She was much better when she was younger.

714
00:33:08,081 --> 00:33:09,640
And, she's noisy too.

715
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:10,801
Even a dog hates her.

716
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:11,720
You!

717
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,000
More like the dog hates you!

718
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:15,881
Chen Maidong,

719
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,360
are you

720
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:18,601
mentally ill?

721
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:19,999
You're actually picking faults

722
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,720
with a fine girl like Jie?

723
00:33:23,681 --> 00:33:26,160
Our personalities don't match at all.

724
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,641
You have two choices.

725
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,281
First choice,

726
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:33,400
come with me to the TCM center tomorrow

727
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:35,039
and see if you're sick up in the head

728
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,400
or down below.

729
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,759
Grandma...

730
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,881
If you're sick,

731
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,479
I'll sell everything I have

732
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,321
to treat your disease.

733
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,240
If you're not sick,

734
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,279
here's your second choice.

735
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,411
From now on,

736
00:33:47,412 --> 00:33:49,320
you better court Jie
with everything you have.

737
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:50,999
If you dare to offend her,

738
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,601
I'll break your legs.

739
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:55,519
You better do everything you can

740
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,600
to please her

741
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:58,920
as long as she's still here.

742
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:03,600
Chen Maidong,

743
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:04,360
what's your choice?

744
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:05,321
Did you hear me?

745
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:07,041
I did.

746
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,480
I'll court her.

747
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,880
You better start tomorrow.

748
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,081
I'm busy tomorrow.

749
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:12,200
You!

750
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,160
You're forcing me to
make an appearance, aren't you?

751
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,440
You better don't regret it!

752
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,880
I once read about this
in a picture book.

753
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,069
The feeling of liking someone

754
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,401
is the kind of feeling
that makes you smile

755
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,999
even when

756
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,401
you're exhausted.

757
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:40,783
Have you not read it before?

758
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:44,121
Seems like our sister is a rare gem.

759
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:48,001
Please enlighten me as well.

760
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,840
If so, have you ever

761
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:51,121
felt lost all of a sudden

762
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:52,726
when you look into the mirror,

763
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:53,920
as if your reflection

764
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:54,926
is a stranger to you?

765
00:34:57,401 --> 00:34:58,720
Nope.

766
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:00,800
It's because I'm so pretty.

767
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,961
I'll only

768
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,411
become illiterate when I'm forced

769
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:07,155
to make corrections to my workbooks.

770
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:11,240
Jie,

771
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,840
why are you

772
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:14,869
staying home so long this time around?

773
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:16,121
Yan and I feel the same.

774
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:17,679
We don't believe

775
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,320
that you're on your annual leave.

776
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,441
You see,

777
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:23,441
I went for gallbladder surgery.

778
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,325
In addition, I fell out of love.

779
00:35:25,326 --> 00:35:26,897
That's why I wish to recuperate at home.

780
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:28,760
- You went for surgery?
- You were in love?

781
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:29,921
Don't shout.

782
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,880
It's just a minor surgery.

783
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,081
It's nothing.

784
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:35,670
I didn't get into a relationship.

785
00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:37,221
It was an unsuccessful relationship.

786
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:38,280
So,

787
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,760
you didn't miss Chen Maidong at all.

788
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:43,041
You weren't
psychologically wounded either.

789
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,079
Do you know how old I am?

790
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,401
I'm not that dramatic.

791
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:48,880
But I was happy

792
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,320
when I saw Chen Maidong.

793
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,081
I'll still survive
even when I don't see him.

794
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,840
If so, between the guy

795
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:56,921
whom you almost dated

796
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,081
and Chen Maidong,

797
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,601
who's better?

798
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,081
Chen Maidong.

799
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,400
If so, that guy...

800
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:17,840
Let's not bring him up, okay?

801
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:21,961
Relationships are tough.

802
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,240
So are our lives.

803
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,280
There's no end to our suffering.

804
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:31,880
Let me give you a piece of advice.

805
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,081
What is it?

806
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,840
Stop looking into the mirror.

807
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:37,241
Go and socialize with people.

808
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,754
By the way, Jie,

809
00:36:41,755 --> 00:36:43,400
you have to help me
look after Jisan Goose

810
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,121
when I return to school tomorrow.

811
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:46,521
Don't let Mom braise it.

812
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:48,212
Are you not quitting school anymore?

813
00:36:49,326 --> 00:36:51,041
I've straightened out my thoughts.

814
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:53,311
I have to be educated
before doing anything.

815
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:57,200
I knew that my brother
would figure things out.

816
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,599
As for your goose,
you have to depend on He Niaoniao.

817
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,521
After all, I won't be staying here for long.

818
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,155
I may be a terrible teammate,

819
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,320
but she isn't.

820
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:14,800
Actually,
she's the most reliable sibling

821
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,441
among us.

822
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:19,320
After all, she inherited Mr. He's genes.
