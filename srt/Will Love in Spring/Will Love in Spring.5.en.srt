1
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,659
Master.

2
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:31,619
Master,

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,559
we came here

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,850
at the agreed time.

5
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:35,559
But he suddenly changed his mind.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,237
He wouldn't let us take the deceased.

7
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:38,259
Look at him.

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,059
Hello,

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,665
we are with the funeral parlor.

10
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,900
How may I

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,779
help you?

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,399
Stop rushing me.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,838
I have told you already.

14
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,518
You can take my dad

15
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:00,059
when the hour comes.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,499
What exact hour

17
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:05,118
do you mean?

18
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,900
Not now, anyway.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,580
My dad hasn't departed yet.

20
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,419
He still has something to say to me.

21
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,980
You must think

22
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,199
I'm out of my mind,

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,179
right?

24
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,020
You are perfectly all right.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,819
If I'm not mistaken,

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,899
your family has many customs to follow.

27
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,860
You are just

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,020
following your dad's last wishes.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,860
I have heard before

30
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,593
that if the deceased person

31
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:47,759
is reflected in a mirror

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,259
or any reflective object,

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,979
they won't rest in peace.

34
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,751
So, they must be covered.

35
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,619
You know this?

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,479
We will try our best to understand

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,580
and respect the traditions
of each family.

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,539
I believe your dad told you

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,819
not to cry

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,459
after his passing.

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,739
He said

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,940
there is a process

43
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,300
when consciousness leaves the body.

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,099
So I don't want to disturb him.

45
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:30,900
After this,

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,620
it's truly considered his departure.

47
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,539
All right, then.

48
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,259
We will wait with you.

49
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,518
I need their help.

50
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,079
On the count of three,
open the curtains.

51
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,340
You have to be fast, okay?

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,660
One,

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,180
two,

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,380
three.

55
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,739
=Will Love in Spring=

56
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,680
=Episode 5=

57
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,239
Dad, hurry up!

58
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,100
My class rep doesn't like us to be late.

59
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,038
One moment.

60
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,958
I will send Yan first.
The train won't wait.

61
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,980
Wait here.

62
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:01,509
He Zhangyue, don't bring that.

63
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,358
It contains additives.

64
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,319
How did I not see it?

65
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,038
Mr. He,

66
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:04,949
you said

67
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,079
the business of Yan Village's vegetables
was slow.

68
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,158
Not anymore.

69
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,879
The town has contacted
a supermarket chain.

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,838
They purchase directly from the fields.

71
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,718
He Zhangyue,

72
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,799
did you wash

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,559
Yan's sports shoes?

74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,980
They are dried downstairs.

75
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,038
He Niaoniao,

76
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,699
bring Yan's shoes up.

77
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,380
All right.

78
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:21,759
Mr. He,

79
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,718
when will the seaside resort
in the town open?

80
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:25,239
I can help with publicity.

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,119
Really?

82
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,718
Zhuang Jie,

83
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:27,907
you are annoying.

84
00:05:27,908 --> 00:05:28,879
Why keep interrupting us

85
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,679
when you are not in a hurry to leave?

86
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,639
I want to do something

87
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,980
for the town.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,889
Jie, no rush.

89
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,589
I will ask around

90
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,759
about the seaside resort.

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,679
Hurry up.

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,100
I'm zipping up the case.

93
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,459
There is more here.

94
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,940
More?

95
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:42,199
Mr. He,

96
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,149
you send Niaoniao first.

97
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,119
Mom is here with me.

98
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,219
I beg your pardon.

99
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,119
You should have done this
last night.

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,259
It is always a mess

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,879
every time before you leave home.

102
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,719
You can't blame me.

103
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
Your two daughters are annoying.

104
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,559
I will do it. No rush.
I drop her off first.

105
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,559
- Dad!
- Don't bother with him.

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,158
Come down now!

107
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,139
He can take a cab.

108
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,839
Coming.

109
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,320
We have to go to the development zone
to see the factory later.

110
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,239
Sign the contract soon.

111
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,779
There is a lot to deal with afterward.

112
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:02,800
That will be in the evening.

113
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,890
I'm going to Yanggou Village

114
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,639
to help load Chinese Yams
for transportation.

115
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,450
You are so occupied.

116
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,421
I bet those Chinese yams

117
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:09,164
will end up being consumed
by the town itself.

118
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:11,269
Spending a great deal of money,
yet can't absorb the yields.

119
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,598
The Chinese Yams aren't selling well?

120
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,336
How large is the yield?
Who takes charge of this?

121
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:15,079
Mr. He.

122
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,918
We are leaving.

123
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,540
Jie, make sure my goose is safe!

124
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,559
Just go already.

125
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,339
My goose.

126
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,500
Mom.

127
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,038
Where is the Yanggou Village?

128
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,398
Let's go there this afternoon.

129
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,119
Mom?

130
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,799
Mom.

131
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,439
Mom!

132
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,518
Shut your mouth. Stop calling me.

133
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,980
Enough of the noise.

134
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,819
Maidong.

135
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,899
Maidong, are you home?

136
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:44,779
Maidong,

137
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,420
are you home?

138
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,219
I heard you were
on the night shift yesterday.

139
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,319
Then, you must know

140
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,860
he needs to sleep.

141
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,500
Grandma Chen,

142
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:55,559
the town is conducting

143
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,759
a census,

144
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,598
so I need to confirm something
with Maidong.

145
00:06:58,599 --> 00:06:59,918
Is Maidong inside?

146
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,899
I will go in.

147
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,980
He's not in.

148
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,918
He ran out after taking a call.

149
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,500
He didn't sleep a wink.

150
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,380
I wonder what the urgent matter is.

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,420
Oh, bad timing.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,439
Well, then.

153
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,358
If he's not in,

154
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,199
I should get going.

155
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,980
Ask him to give me a call
when he is back.

156
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,339
Why the rush?

157
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,940
I won't eat you.

158
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,019
Come and have some tea.

159
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,259
Grandma Chen,

160
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,358
I can't stay

161
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,319
for tea today.

162
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,838
I...

163
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,319
I need to visit some other places.

164
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,358
Don't pretend.

165
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,579
I know you all are annoyed.

166
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,380
You are avoiding me.

167
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:39,940
That's not true.

168
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,199
Grandma Chen,

169
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,639
you have overthought.

170
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,158
You... You asked me to look for a girl

171
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,259
for Maidong,

172
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,358
I didn't forget that.

173
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:48,300
That's my job.

174
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,278
Besides,

175
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,358
the mayor is concerned about this too.

176
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,278
So don't worry.

177
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,019
I promise I will accomplish the task.

178
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,518
Now, I will offer

179
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,019
another chance.

180
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,265
What do you say?

181
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,339
What is it?

182
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,909
Does the town broadcast station

183
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,694
can still read appreciation letters?

184
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,779
Oh, I see.

185
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,598
A few months ago,

186
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,964
they focused on legal education.

187
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:10,029
- They bring it back...
- Perfect.

188
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,780
I will provide you with some material.

189
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,040
(Yanggou Village)

190
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,679
It's heavy. Slow down.

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,779
Be careful.

192
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,620
Slowly.

193
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,958
Can your back handle the weight?

194
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,736
Yeah.

195
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:31,980
- It's an old injury, so do be careful.
- All right.

196
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,259
Come.

197
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,139
Slowly.

198
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,364
Mr. Yang,

199
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,559
why are these Chinese yams

200
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,079
so well-preserved?

201
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,799
We dig them up every autumn,

202
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,679
but can't sell them all at once.

203
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,039
So, we came up with

204
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,079
a sand preservation method.

205
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,379
A layer of Chinese yams,
followed by a layer of fine sand,

206
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,821
then sealed with soil on top.

207
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:56,519
When the spring comes,
we must think of a way

208
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,450
to sell them.

209
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:59,319
How come these high-quality Chinese yams

210
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,679
are unsold?

211
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,179
That's the point.

212
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,458
As you know,
the location of Yanggou village

213
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,939
is quite remote.

214
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:06,919
Plus, we don't

215
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,079
have a distribution channel.

216
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,694
This bugs us big time every year.

217
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,479
Previously, a small factory
from the province

218
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,638
only came to collect before
the procurement period ended.

219
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,638
The more anxious we are,

220
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,118
the lower they drive the price down.

221
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,419
It's infuriating.

222
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,539
Scoundrels.

223
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:20,799
They are taking advantage

224
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,259
of us.

225
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,700
Mr. He,

226
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,980
Mr. Yang.

227
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,620
Leave the distribution channels to me.

228
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,838
I promise

229
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:29,878
I will bring the price up

230
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,821
this year.

231
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,039
Soon, these small factories

232
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,580
will have to queue up to buy.

233
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,139
Did you hear that?

234
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,336
Jie,

235
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:38,478
we will count on you, then.

236
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,364
I'm going to make you

237
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:40,922
the shredded Chinese Yam tonight.

238
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,500
Come on, keep on.

239
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,598
I'm motivated now.

240
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,460
Come.

241
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,598
Come. One, two.

242
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,559
Be careful.

243
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,659
Right, be careful.

244
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:51,958
Perhaps I'm just inexperienced.

245
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,079
The guy this morning

246
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,220
was strange.

247
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,751
What a tradition he has.

248
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,899
Hai, hey.

249
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,019
What did you see this morning?

250
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,340
Nothing.

251
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,779
The sun was too bright.

252
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,620
Nothing?

253
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,238
Master,

254
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,380
what did you see?

255
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,539
(Townfolks, good afternoon.)

256
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,659
(Attention.)

257
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,758
Open the window.

258
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,460
Is it an announcement?

259
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,059
(Please pay attention to this.)

260
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,980
(Just now, we mentioned...)

261
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,290
It has been tough for those villagers.

262
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,529
If I were to handle that,

263
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,478
I might lose money,

264
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,519
instead of making money.

265
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,799
Impossible.

266
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,380
From what I know about you,

267
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,659
you will succeed in everything you do.

268
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,679
Mr. He,

269
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,239
you are flattering me too much.

270
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,638
My mom would scold you
if she heard it.

271
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,638
Actually, she probably

272
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,980
thinks this way deep inside.

273
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,199
(Next,)

274
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,700
(we will revive a good tradition)

275
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,539
(of reading appreciation letters.)

276
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,279
Mr. He,

277
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,500
what is that?

278
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:58,010
It's the "Village-wide Broadcast"
project in town.

279
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,299
Villages from miles away

280
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,758
can hear it when the speaker plays.

281
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,718
It's quite convenient.

282
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,100
(...To Chen Maidong.)

283
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,539
(Her letter says,)

284
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,878
("I'm the wife)

285
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,820
(of an American Chinese.)

286
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,220
(This May,)

287
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,118
(my husband suddenly passed away)

288
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,539
(on the trip.)

289
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,139
(It was Chen Maidong of your town)

290
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:21,039
(who used his most professional skills
and greatest patience to explain to us.")

291
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,079
The second son of the Wang family
brought an investment from Beijing

292
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,740
to build the meat packaging plant.

293
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,299
Terraces on the Xingshan Mountain

294
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,399
and several acres of Chinese yam fields
in Yanggou Village

295
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,958
are all done

296
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,500
by young people who work out of province
for the town.

297
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,089
(Zhuang Jie, you came to Nanping
during your teenage years.)

298
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,478
(You don't feel a connection here.)

299
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,478
(But not everyone)

300
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,238
(is a fast talker)

301
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,620
(like you.)

302
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,460
(...Respect lives and compassionate.)

303
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:49,820
Mom.

304
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,939
My goodness.

305
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,820
Why is your face burned?

306
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,319
It doesn't matter.

307
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,139
Mom.

308
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,621
I promise you,

309
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:00,238
I'm going to use my skills

310
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,598
to help the town.

311
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,393
You can depend on me about those

312
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:05,265
unsold Chinese yams of Yanggou Village.

313
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,478
(Thank you for grooming)

314
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,659
(such a great civil servant.)

315
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:15,399
(Besides, I appreciate your consideration
for the family)

316
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,500
(and respect for life.)

317
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,419
(All right.)

318
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,279
(The final round)

319
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,779
(of reading letters is now over.)

320
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,220
Grandma,

321
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:31,500
why is the letter from my drawer
appearing on the broadcast?

322
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,139
Don't you feel embarrassed

323
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,598
to force them

324
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,820
to play it on a loop?

325
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,380
I feel so ashamed.

326
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,319
Wu,

327
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,638
I'm leaving.

328
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,319
Tomorrow,

329
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,659
I will write you
a letter of appreciation.

330
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,358
All right, get rest early.

331
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,460
Grandma,

332
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,319
could you please stop all this?

333
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,279
If you don't woo Jie,

334
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,265
I will have to take matters
into my own hands.

335
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,279
I will take care

336
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,019
of my own business.

337
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,460
So, please.

338
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,419
Stay out of it.

339
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,364
"Returning from the Forbidden City
at dawn,

340
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:07,850
leaving from the east gate
of Chang'an City in the dusk.

341
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:10,399
I no longer speak about
whatever happened behind that gate,

342
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,358
this journey ahead
is heading off to Jiangnan.

343
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,500
The raised whip urges
the carriage forward,

344
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,100
waving my loved ones and hometown off.

345
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,620
I wasn't born belonging to any place,

346
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,980
but I belong anywhere
my heart finds peace."

347
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,718
I feel uneasy now.

348
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,380
Don't ever do this again, Grandma.

349
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,159
I don't always care about you.

350
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,358
Just this time.

351
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,519
The rest

352
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,539
is up to you.

353
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,559
What's wrong with Chinese yams?

354
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,539
The promoting techniques
are all the same.

355
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,718
Aren't you part of Nanping?

356
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,019
You have to do something.

357
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,079
Wang Xixia,

358
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,170
have you sent the message
to the medicine supplier?

359
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,820
Don't miss a single one.

360
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,878
It's not that I'm pushing it.

361
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,399
I just want to find

362
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,598
more purchasers.

363
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,238
Right.

364
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:24,460
Get back to me by tomorrow morning
at the latest.

365
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,638
Careful, it's hot.

366
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,860
Thank you, Mr. He.

367
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:38,919
Mr. Shen,

368
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,159
the purchaser you introduced
to me isn't reliable.

369
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,199
He straightaway demanded

370
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,638
sand-grown Chinese yams.

371
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,718
If I had that,

372
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,238
I wouldn't have needed him.

373
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,039
So,

374
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,039
I found

375
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,358
a Chinese yam product factory

376
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,736
through a friend of mine.

377
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,118
They request to inspect the site

378
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,659
before making a decision.

379
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,478
That's why

380
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,039
I need another option.

381
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,536
Please help me to ask around.

382
00:14:57,537 --> 00:14:59,837
I will treat you to a meal
when I'm back in Shanghai.

383
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,919
Mom,

384
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,439
can I not practice writing today?

385
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,740
She is so noisy.

386
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,559
Why don't you say

387
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,838
that she is full of energy?

388
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,189
Of course, she is.

389
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,399
She is trying to prove herself

390
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,336
to someone.

391
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,922
He Niaoniao,
you want a beating?

392
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,319
I'm just guessing.

393
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,299
Jie is smart.

394
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,519
She will be praised over the broadcast
and prove herself to the entire town.

395
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,199
The entire town?

396
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,100
Not everyone

397
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,980
always dreams about

398
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,399
being on TV

399
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,638
or becoming a star like you.

400
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,998
To be honest,

401
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:27,519
if someone in the family were on TV,

402
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,980
it would be Jie.

403
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,679
Look at you. You are like a potato.

404
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,079
Jie looks more like a potato.

405
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,179
Look at her face, it's peeling.

406
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,019
Zhuang Jie.

407
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,580
Gosh, your face.

408
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,279
I should try Granny's method on you.

409
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,400
I don't need that old remedy.

410
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,559
I will use the repair mask.

411
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,159
Try this.

412
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,199
Jie,

413
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,380
don't disappoint Mom.

414
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,199
What are you doing here?

415
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,519
Let's both take a break.

416
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,779
Rest up.

417
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,820
Come.

418
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,838
Jeez, He Zhangyue.

419
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,419
Look at what you have done to my girl.

420
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,559
Since she was little,
you have always taken her

421
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,879
to the mountain or the river,

422
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,294
she never once came back home
looking like a fair girl.

423
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,439
I'm to blame.

424
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,179
Don't be harsh on him.

425
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,019
Mr. He,

426
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,878
if I get recognized by the town later,

427
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,439
I will give you an appreciation pennant.

428
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,238
Sure.

429
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,100
That's right.

430
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,679
Without my dad,

431
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,299
I would've run away from home.

432
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,340
Fine.

433
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,478
Your dad is the best,

434
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,638
and I'm the bad egg.

435
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,478
Satisfied?

436
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:27,059
Not really.

437
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,860
He Zhangyue.

438
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,958
Let me put the rest for you.

439
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,958
I'm not using that.

440
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,740
Don't waste it.

441
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,958
No, I mean it.

442
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,958
Hurry up and use it.

443
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:36,838
Keep it for yourself.

444
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:37,980
Seriously?

445
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,358
Of course.

446
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:40,500
This is so scary.

447
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,599
He Zhangyue, stand right there!

448
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,221
I'll fly the kite. You can't be serious.

449
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:44,998
Why are you running?

450
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,259
- Stand right there!
- No!

451
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,118
Hurry.

452
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,299
It got in my eyes.

453
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,500
It's fine.

454
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,838
Jeez, your aged skin.

455
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,519
It's got in my eyes. It hurts.

456
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,019
Help!

457
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:01,878
(Liaogen Chicken)
A free pair of wings for you.

458
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,159
It's a new flavor.

459
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,500
Please try it.

460
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,679
Great.

461
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,899
Thank you, Liao.

462
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:08,439
Your daughter

463
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,100
is so amazing.

464
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,380
It's nothing.

465
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,621
I want a chicken.

466
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:14,159
Please give me a pair of wings.

467
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,179
No problem.

468
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,199
Your daughter is so capable.

469
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,638
Yanggou Village finally gets a break

470
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,799
after years.

471
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,799
Exactly.

472
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,389
They found a distribution channel

473
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,519
for three consecutive years.

474
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,158
Young people

475
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,979
are educated and well-connected.

476
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,239
Don't praise her too much.

477
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,079
You flattered her.

478
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,759
(Next, let's replay)

479
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,279
(the appreciation letter
from the Yanggou Village committee)

480
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,918
(to Zhuang Jie.)

481
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:37,529
You see,

482
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,838
they are praising your daughter.

483
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,959
Why is it playing on a loop?

484
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,999
Gosh, I'm shy.

485
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,300
She is excellent.

486
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,158
Everyone here gets a share.

487
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,118
No matter what you buy,

488
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:47,909
Liaogen Chicken

489
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,630
will give you a pair of chicken wings.

490
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,879
You see,

491
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,665
she is giving out free chicken pairs.

492
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,279
Thank you. Good job. Bye.

493
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,380
Bye.

494
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,739
Grandma?

495
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,878
What are you doing here?

496
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:05,939
I'm waiting for you.

497
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,899
Me?

498
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:08,039
Anything I can help with?

499
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,398
I want to buy the town's hero

500
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:10,638
a meal.

501
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:13,060
I wonder if you would honor me
with a favor.

502
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,459
You flatter me.

503
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,020
Are you coming or not?

504
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,438
I'm not quite good at cooking,

505
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,239
but I make the most delicious desserts.

506
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,918
I'm down.

507
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,060
I know

508
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,860
Jie is the best.

509
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,959
I have been

510
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,719
eating alone

511
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,499
for days.

512
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,699
Where is Chen Maidong?

513
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,779
He went to the city to help out.

514
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,878
He has gone for a few days

515
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,580
and didn't say when he would be back.

516
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,189
Anyway,

517
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,079
it doesn't matter
whether he is here or not.

518
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,999
I have recorded

519
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,438
your glorious contributions

520
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,820
and sent them to him

521
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,759
on WeChat.

522
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,158
I want this brat

523
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,239
to learn from you.

524
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,509
Grandma, you must be kidding.

525
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,179
Your grandson is mentioned on broadcast
way more than I am.

526
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:52,438
It's useless, though.

527
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,540
That brat never listens to me.

528
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,039
How about this?

529
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,838
You go home first.

530
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,918
I'll come to you later.

531
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,918
It's sunny out here.

532
00:18:58,919 --> 00:18:59,598
All right.

533
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,398
I will wait for you.

534
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:01,499
Watch out for cars.

535
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,118
Not just anyone

536
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,479
gets praised on the broadcast.

537
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,559
You two

538
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,536
are equally outstanding.

539
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:22,358
What a perfect match.

540
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,979
Grandma, please give me a break.

541
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:25,237
Let's look at the photos.

542
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,519
When was this?

543
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,918
I remember he wasn't like this

544
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,100
in Grades 10 and 11.

545
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,260
It was when he was in Grade 12.

546
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,100
He just went wild.

547
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,107
He had a good-looking face

548
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,638
but with the wrong hairstyle.

549
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:38,678
He may look

550
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:39,878
decent and honest now,

551
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,158
but he was difficult back then.

552
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:44,638
His grandpa and I were so worried.

553
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:45,398
It's normal.

554
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:46,079
My mom also says

555
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,759
I was an annoying teenage girl.

556
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,060
When Dong was little,

557
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,540
the whole family doted on him.

558
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,419
He used to be mild

559
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,279
until his parents began

560
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,198
to have rough patches,

561
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,519
which then provoked Dong

562
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,419
into being rebellious.

563
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,860
Speaking of his parents,

564
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,979
well...

565
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,860
You are back. What a coincidence.

566
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,780
As if.

567
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,340
This is my home.

568
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,139
Refill the water.

569
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:16,580
Isn't it full already?

570
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,899
Just do what I say.

571
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,979
Sit.

572
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,465
Get off your phone.

573
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,620
That's rude.

574
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,300
Dong,

575
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:10,536
Jie helps to promote

576
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,665
the agricultural products
of Yanggou Village.

577
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,979
She closed a three-year contract deal.

578
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,499
You told me about this.

579
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,100
Did I?

580
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,678
You see, I'm so forgetful.

581
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,499
Indeed,

582
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,739
you are.

583
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,559
I told you I came back today.

584
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,519
But you didn't tell me

585
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,060
you have a guest.

586
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,559
Jie,

587
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,419
drink some tea before leaving.

588
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,300
It's my walking time now.

589
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,039
Grandma,

590
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,540
I didn't know you had this hobby.

591
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,999
It's a crutch

592
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,799
to get me through
Dong's rebellious phase.

593
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,820
Or else, I would have died long ago.

594
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,860
I'm getting up in years.

595
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:50,580
There is no hope in life

596
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,100
if my grandson wouldn't be braver.

597
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,398
Not at all.

598
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,799
You are full of energy.

599
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,540
You will live to be 199.

600
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,499
I'm not a monster.

601
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,319
Grandma,

602
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,340
take care.

603
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,265
What should we talk about?

604
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,358
About why

605
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,739
I can't stay in Nanping.

606
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,179
Why?

607
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,739
The life here is too slow.

608
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,519
It doesn't fit me.

609
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,699
It will drive me crazy.

610
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,659
When are you leaving?

611
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,459
Tomorrow.

612
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,139
Let's go. I will see you off.

613
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,620
Is this how you treat your guests?

614
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,699
How do you treat your guests then?

615
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,479
You should at least

616
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,559
give your guests a tour

617
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,294
when they first come to your place.

618
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:00,580
This is the living room.

619
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,060
That's the bedroom.

620
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,149
The kitchen

621
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,598
and Grandma's room are downstairs.

622
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,540
That's all.

623
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,239
I have visited the kitchen

624
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,620
and Grandma's room.

625
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,260
Let's visit yours.

626
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,699
Classical music.

627
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:28,620
Is this one of your secrets too?

628
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,380
Zhuang Jie.

629
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,979
Is this what you do with everyone?

630
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,638
Chen Maidong,

631
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:38,340
is this what you do to everyone?

632
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,340
What about me?

633
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:41,939
Aloof.

634
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,300
What about me?

635
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,860
Frivolous.

636
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,300
Does that concern you?

637
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:00,239
Let me walk you home...

638
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,260
Bugger off.

639
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,020
(I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.)

640
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,739
(I will buy you dinner as an apology.)

641
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,540
(I'm ill-mannered.)

642
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,522
(Don't let my stupid behavior
get to you.)

643
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:55,060
(I wish you a safe journey tomorrow.)

644
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,336
(Zhang's Porridge Stall.)

645
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:00,894
(See you there in ten minutes.)

646
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,979
Do you have to keep staring at me?

647
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,580
Because I'm frivolous.

648
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,699
Do I need to apologize to you properly?

649
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,060
Forget it. I don't hold grudges.

650
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,179
Chen Maidong,

651
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,100
you have a nice profile.

652
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,139
You sit in front of me,

653
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,079
and you say I have a nice profile.

654
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,739
Isn't that not convincing enough?

655
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,899
Who did you get my number?

656
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,020
Grandma?

657
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,179
It's Madam Wu.

658
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,699
Order anything. I will pay.

659
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,878
Excuse me.

660
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:57,838
I would like two orders
of vegetable congee,

661
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,139
one order of beef dumplings,

662
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,959
and a vegetable salad.

663
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,638
Thank you.

664
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:03,780
That's light.

665
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,479
Not drinking?

666
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,751
Will you drink with me?

667
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,139
I can't.

668
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,039
But I thought the top salesperson

669
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,608
could hold their liquor quite well.

670
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,340
You have so many stereotypes about me.

671
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,198
Did I say anything wrong again?

672
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,739
No, I'm a good drinker.

673
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,540
But I'm not drinking now.

674
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:24,598
I had my gallbladder removed
not long ago.

675
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,699
I'm resting.

676
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,499
But it seems to me

677
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,380
that you aren't resting.

678
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,380
I didn't dare to tell my mom about that.

679
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:36,559
I was forced to do the food delivery.

680
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,179
I have to swallow my pain.

681
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,300
Chen Maidong.

682
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,398
So you do smile.

683
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:46,300
Why don't you often smile?

684
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,300
It's my job.

685
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,294
I have to keep my emotions in check.

686
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,260
Over time, it becomes a habit.

687
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:54,829
I don't join in

688
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,429
whenever there is an exciting crowd.

689
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,780
People might find me annoying.

690
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,999
You don't drink because of your job?

691
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,860
Right.

692
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,719
I demand

693
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,799
to be on call 24/7

694
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,118
and always stay sober.

695
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,620
If anything happens,

696
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:07,580
I can't go back to work
reeking of alcohol.

697
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,620
Your profession is noble.

698
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,060
It's the same for every profession.

699
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,398
Thank you.

700
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:20,340
Thank you.

701
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,620
Chen Maidong,

702
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,139
have you ever seen a ghost
while working?

703
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,358
You are always so facetious.

704
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,739
I'm asking seriously.

705
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,300
I believe in science.

706
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:44,519
Still, I also believe

707
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,118
in phenomena that science can't explain.

708
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,179
Me too.

709
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,020
We should have a sense of reverence.

710
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:53,494
Have you ever encountered
any supernatural events?

711
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,319
A few days ago,

712
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,079
we went to pick up

713
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,419
a deceased man.

714
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,649
His son believed

715
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,079
that if he placed a basin of water

716
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,540
in the house at noon,

717
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:06,580
the sunlight reflection on the wall

718
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,659
would show his father's soul.

719
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,158
So we had to

720
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,459
wait with him.

721
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,580
What happened then?

722
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,780
Then...

723
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,598
I need their help. On the count of three,

724
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,438
open the curtains.

725
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,319
Be fast, okay?

726
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,219
One,

727
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,580
two,

728
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,659
three.

729
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:32,722
(All my colleagues talked about it
after coming back.)

730
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,939
(They said the wall or the basin)

731
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,300
(didn't show anything.)

732
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,540
That guy was lying.

733
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,780
What about you?

734
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,899
I didn't look at either of them.

735
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:49,659
Because the guy was too excited
when he got up.

736
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,860
He stepped on my foot.

737
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:56,219
I was busy pulling my foot out.

738
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,179
I forgot to tell you

739
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,459
I don't like beef.

740
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,699
This is pork.

741
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,300
Do you think I'm stupid?

742
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,620
Chen Maidong,

743
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,398
now you know

744
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,158
I'm not

745
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:28,519
a fast talker.

746
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,860
Yes, the entire town knows that.

747
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,580
Are these lampposts installed later?

748
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,699
This place used to be dim.

749
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:37,878
I remember you were reserved

750
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:39,179
back then.

751
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,179
Why are you so talkative now?

752
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,398
My mom always complains

753
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,300
that I'm louder than a zoo.

754
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:46,079
No one really remembers

755
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,551
what they were like as a kid.

756
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,580
People change.

757
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:52,398
No one could have expected

758
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,860
a high school bully

759
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,678
to turn out like you have now.

760
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,179
I wasn't a bully.

761
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,860
That's not true.

762
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,999
Yeah, it's a rumor.

763
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,999
Of course, it's a rumor.

764
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,638
I never messed with anyone
if they don't.

765
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:05,899
If they do,
it would be a stand-up fight.

766
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,638
You!

767
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:09,479
What?

768
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,580
Are you trying
to bully a disabled girl again?

769
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,780
I told you

770
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:14,959
not to always mention

771
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,959
that you are disabled,

772
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,540
and no one would see you as one.

773
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,219
You have a good memory.

774
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,899
Chen Maidong,

775
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,060
you haven't

776
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,020
changed much

777
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,820
from how I remember.

778
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,499
You get sidetracked sometimes,

779
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,540
but you are always on the right path.

780
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,139
Well,

781
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,918
don't let others' opinions

782
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,260
hold you back.

783
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,559
Don't look for partners
out of your league

784
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,380
just because of your job.

785
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:48,020
People who understand you

786
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:50,300
will embrace everything about you.

787
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,764
People who don't

788
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:53,970
will never accept you,
even if you change yourself.

789
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,799
Are you speaking

790
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,959
from experience?

791
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,899
Exactly.

792
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,638
I'm giving you

793
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:01,519
honest advice

794
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,918
as a disabled girl.

795
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:03,979
You have to take it.

796
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,780
Why are you single, then?

797
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:07,939
Me?

798
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,499
Well,

799
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:11,899
some reasons hinder us.

800
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,438
Someone just told me

801
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:20,260
I was her ideal man the other day.

802
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,820
Ideals are fantasies,

803
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:27,020
while realities are
when fantasies are over.

804
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,739
I have reached home.

805
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,939
Thank you for walking me home.

806
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,739
Go inside.

807
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,198
Shouldn't we exchange contacts?

808
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:48,340
You didn't leave your phone
at the office, did you?

809
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,560
(Set Remark and Tag; Remark: Great Man)

810
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,865
(Great Man)
It's done.

811
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,100
Aren't you going to set one for me?

812
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,799
Can't I even touch you?

813
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,118
Like you are gilded with gold.

814
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,340
Force of habit.

815
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,279
People don't like to have

816
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,659
physical contact with us.

817
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,699
Chen Maidong,

818
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,699
I'm leaving.

819
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,340
See you again when I'm back in Nanping.

820
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,459
We don't shake hands

821
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,739
or say, "See you again."

822
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,620
So,

823
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,060
I wish you a safe journey.

824
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:57,860
Oh, come on.

825
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,419
Chen Maidong,

826
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,499
see you again.

827
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,419
Zhuang Jie.

828
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,939
Is the person you can't be with

829
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,100
concerned about

830
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,020
your leg?

831
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,419
Not entirely.

832
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,540
Maybe because

833
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:27,959
he loves himself

834
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,499
more than he loves me.

835
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,020
I understand, honestly.

836
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,459
Because deep down,

837
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,860
we are the same.

838
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,939
It's normal
that we couldn't be together.

839
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,408
(Nanping Guoguang High School,
Nanping Town Inquiry-based Pilot School)

840
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,650
Chen Maidong,

841
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,158
you can never sit still for days
before you get into a fight.

842
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,700
Aren't your grandparents
worried enough about you?

843
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,579
Don't call them again.

844
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,637
Who should I call then?

845
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:40,939
Your parents?

846
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,318
I did

847
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:43,336
call them.

848
00:34:43,337 --> 00:34:45,459
One doesn't answer,
while the other says they're busy.

849
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,399
Besides your grandparents,

850
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,678
you have

851
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,164
no other guardian, you know?

852
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:51,280
You got good grades
in the junior high academic test.

853
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,700
Can't you work harder?

854
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,718
Does getting in fights
solve your problem?

855
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,718
You should ask them if being mean

856
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,140
solves their problems.

857
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:01,820
You don't want your grandparents
to come again, do you?

858
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,300
No.

859
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,740
If so, make up for your mistakes.

860
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:09,359
Your classmate, Zhuang Jie,

861
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,539
has difficulty moving,

862
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:13,090
especially on rainy days
when her parents have to pick her up.

863
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,559
Starting today,

864
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,059
you will help her.

865
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,318
Whenever the weather is bad,

866
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:18,899
take her to the school gate

867
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,220
and watch her get in the car
before you leave.

868
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,059
I don't want to.

869
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:30,919
I have played a tree with her.

870
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,939
I owe her nothing.

871
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,180
Chen Maidong,

872
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,758
I'm giving you a chance

873
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,499
to prove that you haven't past help.

874
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:40,118
If you dare leave Zhuang Jie behind
even for a day,

875
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,820
you may drop out of school.

876
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,220
(Chen Maidong,)

877
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,579
(do you remember)

878
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,579
(the days when you carried me
on your back?)

879
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,593
It was a rainy day

880
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,265
and I waited for you at the entrance
of the classroom building.

881
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,798
But someone told me

882
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:08,718
that your mom came.

883
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,559
You bolted out

884
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,650
without leaving a word.

885
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,198
People were coming and going around me.

886
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,780
I didn't have an umbrella,
I was so helpless.

887
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,959
Because I thought

888
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,860
you wouldn't come back.

889
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,419
It was your mom, after all.

890
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,140
To my surprise,

891
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,700
you did come back.

892
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:27,180
From then on, I knew

893
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:29,158
Chen Maidong was a trustworthy person.

894
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,300
At least not like what others see you.

895
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,860
Do you still remember this?

896
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,740
I forgot.

897
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,519
(I also knew
that you did all those foolish things)

898
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,499
(because you wanted your mom to come back)

899
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,700
(to see you more)

900
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,359
(and to look after you.)

901
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,099
(Stop analyzing.)

902
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,065
Zhuang Jie is going back to Shanghai
tomorrow.

903
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,700
I told you,

904
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:49,499
we can't put hope
on some people and things.

905
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:52,220
Those who are meant to leave

906
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,220
will eventually leave.

907
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,720
(Moments)

908
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,700
Maidong,

909
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:48,419
always remember this:

910
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,198
Only kids who cry get candies.

911
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,340
Those who are leaving
fear they may remain too long.

912
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:06,959
Jie!

913
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,479
She will be back soon.

914
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,860
Why are you crying?

915
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,309
- Jie!
- You better behave yourself.

916
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,808
Where is my feather duster?

917
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,899
Gosh, no!

918
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,439
Jie, help me!

919
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,569
- Come here.
- Help!

920
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,238
Niaoniao, don't get feverish.
I will call you once I reach Shanghai.

921
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,678
Take good care of Yan's goose.

922
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:22,079
Jie, don't go!

923
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,519
Please take me with you.

924
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,879
I miss you.

925
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,519
Enough.

926
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,780
Stop being dramatic.

927
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,140
Stop crying,

928
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,118
or I will beat you.

929
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:30,798
No!

930
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:31,519
- Jie!
- Go now.

931
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,198
Mom.

932
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,359
Jie!

933
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,899
I'm going to beat you.

934
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:35,919
Ow!

935
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,709
You are

936
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,065
such a mischievous girl.

937
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,180
Mr. He.

938
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,099
I will do it.

939
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,278
Get in the car.

940
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,300
All right.

941
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,180
Careful.

942
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,140
Mr. He,

943
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,238
is Mom really going

944
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,700
to beat He Niaoniao?

945
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,758
Don't worry.

946
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:58,300
She knows what she is doing.

947
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:01,780
On top of that, He Niaoniao is smart.
She knows when to keep quiet.

948
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,919
Mr. He, it has been tough for you.

949
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,899
It's lucky to have you in this family.

950
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:08,499
On the contrary,

951
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,700
having all of you

952
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,579
is my luck.

953
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,939
Let's go!

954
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,220
Right-o!

955
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,059
Chen Maidong?

956
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,140
Chen Maidong.

957
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,660
Not so loud.

958
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,579
What a coincidence.

959
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:50,118
I came to see someone off.

960
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,380
Me?

961
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:53,010
What a narcissist you are.

962
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,718
Ask someone to help you

963
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,718
when you get off.

964
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,780
Don't force yourself.

965
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:20,619
You worry about me?

966
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,459
I should get going.

967
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,019
Anything else?

968
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,899
I told you

969
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,899
that you have a nice profile.

970
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:37,019
That's too much.

971
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,899
Chen Maidong.

972
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,059
You came here for me,

973
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,059
right?

974
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,758
How is that any different?

975
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:58,939
Of course, it is.

976
00:42:59,908 --> 00:43:01,700
What is this supposed to mean, then?

977
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,820
I'm not sure.
