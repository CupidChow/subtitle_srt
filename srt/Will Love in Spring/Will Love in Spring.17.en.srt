=Episode 17=

4
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,479
Surprised?

5
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,879
When did you come back?

6
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:39,960
At dawn.

7
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,159
Why didn't you wake me up?

8
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,719
Why would I?

9
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,200
What would you like for breakfast?

10
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,280
I'll rustle it up.

11
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,039
Let's see.

12
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,319
Is there anything Queen Mother
can't cook up?

13
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:07,800
Easy there, Your Highness,

14
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,960
I am not the royal chef.

15
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,280
You have a call.

16
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,279
Hello. Niaoniao.

17
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,160
Jie. Code black. Come home, quick.

18
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,959
What's the matter?

19
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:30,660
Mom's lashing out at Yan
because you've been out all night.

20
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,639
I'm next. Please come home right now.

21
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,000
This is your fault.

22
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,360
You're an adult.
Why do you have a curfew?

23
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,959
All thanks to you.

24
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:42,839
Oh no.

25
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,800
Never mind. It's Xixia.

26
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,399
Hello.

27
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,639
You're back? Perfect.

28
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,920
Look, listen. Hold your horses.

29
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,519
I need you to come over
and soothe my mom.

30
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,839
No.

31
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,560
I was out all night.

32
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,040
I'd rather not say.

33
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,160
I'll tell you next time.

34
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,800
Hurry. Bye.

35
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:22,270
Sounds like breakfast
is out of the question.

36
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,879
I'll give you a ride.

37
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
What?

38
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,480
Allow me.

39
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,120

Bye.

65
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,120
Bunch of heartless kids, all of you.

66
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,960
How can I cheer up?

67
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,549
I'm not in the mood
to work today.

68
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,342
Do you hear me?

69
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,039
Don't try to console me.

70
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,720
You don't know what it's like
to be a parent.

71
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,000
Ms. Liao, calm down.

72
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,639
We're talking business here.

73
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,919
Zhuang Yan,

74
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,039
shoulders back.

75
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:48,000
How can you run a business
with a gloomy face?

76
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Niaoniao, smile.

77
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,960
Niaoniao. Smile.

78
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:56,440
And you, Ms. Liao.

79
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,360
How can you bring emotions
into the workplace?

80
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
I'm a poultry dealer.

81
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,110
Why should I care
about emotion management?

82
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,320
Of course you should.

83
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,120
Aren't you a career woman like us?

84
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,559
How can you let your standards drop?

85
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,320
Am I right? Look around you.

86
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,360
Except for you three,
everyone is smiling.

87
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,159
I don't feel like smiling today.

88
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,919
How can you run a business like that?

89
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,840
Wang Xixia! You're back.

90
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,639
What's going on? Why so serious?

91
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,240
Did you hear that?

92
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,240
This is how a businesswoman should be.

93
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,799
You can't argue with a smile, right?

94
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,519
Right.

95
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,120
See? It's not just me.

96
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,159
Is it not? You've been
blabbering all morning.

97
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,628
And we haven't done any work.

98
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,440
Never mind.

99
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,600
Xixia, are you having dinner with us?

100
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,799
I'll buy a fish.

101
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,639
Chen Maidong?

102
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,360
See? Even Chen Maidong
is in good spirits.

103
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,480
It's a joyous season.
Isn't it, Ms. Liao?

104
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,320
Come on, smile.

105
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,039
Shoo!

106
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,600
Jie...

107
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,639
Say no more. Red packets.

108
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,320
I'll give you each a big red packet.

109
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,440
That's hardly enough
to heal my emotional trauma.

110
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,759
What a morning.

111
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,685
I'm so glad you're back.
Let's do some New Year shopping.

112
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,799
You're not spending New Year with us?

113
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:34,742
I'm spending it with Cui Ge.

114
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:38,200
After the Fifth, we're going to
his sister's house to visit his mom.

115
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,720
Wang Xixia, congratulations.

116
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,039
Congratulate yourself. You set us up.

117
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,279
Cui Ge has been asking me
to send his gratitude.

118
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,919
He is most welcome.

119
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,279
I thought so. He can thank you himself.

120
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,720
Don't skimp on the cash gift, okay?

121
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,320
Sure. It's no big deal.

122
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,960
But...

123
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,840
Are you going to settle down?

124
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,440
You know me, I'm not picky. Unlike you.

125
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,279
Come on.

126
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,519
You know none of
your previous guys worked out.

127
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,480
Is Cui Ge really a good guy?

128
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,519
I can't say what
the future holds for sure.

129
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,485
Just take it one step at a time.

130
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,879
At least for the first time ever,

131
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,960
I am no longer afraid.

132
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,480
Wang Xixia, you've found your family.

133
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,159
I'm so happy for you.

134
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,399
Don't tease me.

135
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,399
So Ms. Nightwalker,
what's going on between you two?

136
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,080
We are...

137
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,360
really close.

138
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,639
What's with that expression?

139
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,039
Maintaining a relationship
needs more than just hormones.

140
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
You also need money and a house.

141
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,000
I know.

142
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:29,200
That's why we're busting
our necks in Shanghai.

143
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,399
No longer young, but not yet old.

144
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:34,257
No longer poor, but not yet successful.

145
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,279
To get ahead in life, we need a miracle.

146
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
Yet we're too stubborn to quit.

147
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,480
I've been feeling anxious.

148
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,159
I work from 9 AM to 5 PM every day.

149
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,519
Even when I'm 40, nothing will change.

150
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,399
Even if Chen Maidong loves me,
it would be too late.

151
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
The only solution is to
become an entrepreneur.

152
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:53,960
You're right.

153
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,440
Forget about financial freedom.
Personal freedom comes first.

154
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,559
Even though I live in Nanping,
I haven't lost my savvy.

155
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,879
I've been talking to Ms. Huang.

156
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,960
Our ex-boss?

157
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,240
I've always admired
her career foresight.

158
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,120
I heard she's working on
a medical data integration platform.

159
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,080
Perhaps she might need us in the future.

160
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,600
That's wonderful. You pave the way.

161
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,800
When the opportunity comes,
we'll seize it together.

162
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,159
Lin, look.

163
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,759
That's not all.

164
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,159
Well? Aren't I lucky?

165
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,159
This year, I don't even
need to lift a finger

166
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,919
during spring cleaning.

167
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,519
Jie is such a meticulous cleaner
compared to Dong.

168
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,159
Look, how clean and bright the house is.

169
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,159
Even a fly will slip.

170
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,600
Grandma Lin.

171
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,200
Grandma Lin,
I hear you're feeling better.

172
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,919
How about spending the New Year with us?

173
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,600
I'll pick you up.

174
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:17,879
Thank you, Jie.
My appetite has recovered.

175
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,399
But I look terrible. It's embarrassing.

176
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,399
Maybe next time.

177
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,600
You've been to hell and back,

178
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:30,000
and you're worried about your looks?

179
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
Come on. Let me see you.

180
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,720
No one's going to mind.

181
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,639
But I do mind, okay?

182
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:39,320
All right.

183
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,039
Time to go home. I'll take it from here.

184
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,720
What's the hurry?

185
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,159
My family isn't exactly short-handed.

186
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,840
You've been standing for ages.

187
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,000
Get down.

188
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,440
There they go again.

189
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,159
They've been acting corny.

190
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,960
The internet calls it
a "public display of affection".

191
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,240
Grandma, we're off.

192
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,240
Okay. Get some rest.

193
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:14,639
I'm going to share some jokes
with Grandma Lin.

194
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,600
Grandma Lin, see you.

195
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,679
Grandma, Happy New Year!

196
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,080
Let's go.

197
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,759
Let's see.

198
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,480
You're going to love these jokes.

199
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,960
An old woman said she hoped one day...

200
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,600
Come on.

201
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:40,942
I'll give you a ride.

202
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,039
What about these?

203
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,840
Take them.

204
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,720
Sure.

205
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,200
Chen Maidong,

206
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,279
Happy New Year.

207
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,200
Same to you. Happy New Year.

208
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,720
Let's go!

209
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,799
I don't want to let you go.

210
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,440
Let's never be apart. Chen Maidong.

211
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,080
Cut it out. I need to go.

212
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,159
No! Please stay.

213
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,159
Cut it out.

214
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,320
Your mom might see us.

215
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,679
Wait. You haven't kissed me today.

216
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:31,870
Are you a fish?
Do you have a 7-second memory?

217
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,639
Yes, I'm a fish. Kiss me?

218
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:37,799
This side.

219
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,320
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

220
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,759
Seven seconds. Once more.

221
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,799
So greedy. Get off.

222
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,240
Stop it. Your mom hates me.

223
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,039
Mom doesn't hate you anymore.

224
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,080
Why don't you come in?

225
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,799
I'm not suicidal.

226
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,790
Just the thought of her makes me scared.

227
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,519
If I meet her, I'm going to stutter.

228
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,320
You have to meet your
mother-in-law eventually.

229
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,960
I'm not mentally prepared.

230
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,519
I can't stand it anymore.

231
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,480
Why don't you lovebirds come in?

232
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,228
No thanks, Zhuang Yan.

233
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,559
I'll pass.

234
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,839
Mom's not in?

235
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,119
She's at Madam Wu's.

236
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,257
And she's not coming back.

237
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,200
Dong, would you like to come in?

238
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,119
Please come in! Just for a while!

239
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,799
For a while...

240
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,240
Have a seat.

241
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,228
There's so much to be done here.

242
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,480
Why did you come to my house?

243
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:13,550
Because I wanted to.

244
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,640
Having an attitude?

245
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,400
Niaoniao. Any chores left? I can help.

246
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,519
Dong, I have my principles.

247
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,000
Are you my brother-in-law?

248
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,119
If not, I can't order you around.

249
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,039
Well...

250
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:36,885
It's a bit early to tell.

251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,200
Then what's your relationship?

252
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,319
- We're...
- Lovers.

253
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,640
Hey, that's nonsense.

254
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,800
How would you define it, then?

255
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,400
Ex-schoolmates? Soulmates?
Lovers? Sweethearts?

256
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,839
Dong, I have a favor to ask you.

257
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,857
Are you good at calligraphy?

258
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,480
It's not festive enough.

259
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,390
You're the one to talk.

260
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,720
This phrase doesn't make sense.

261
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,599
How about this?

262
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
"May food fortune await you outside."

263
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,119
"May peace embrace you at home."

264
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,000
How about this?

265
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,750
"When conditions align,
a path will open."

266
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,790
"Bestowing prosperity on the nation
and the people."

267
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,759
Jie, are you plagiarizing
from the internet?

268
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,400
Dad was an original content creator.

269
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:30,200
Every generation is getting worse.

270
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,457
Who has the time to be original?

271
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,571
What about the horizontal banner?

272
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,400
There are no examples on this website.

273
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,440
He Niaoniao,
you're almost in high school.

274
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,085
Can you create a horizontal banner?

275
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,440
All my friends have a banner that says

276
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,371
"Five blessings be upon us."
Let's go with that.

277
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,039
Can you be more original?

278
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,720
I wanted to say
"Good grades be upon us".

279
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,880
But that's a lot of pressure.

280
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,599
Please.

281
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,759
Make up your mind.

282
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:56,039
I've written so many banners.
I'm getting tired.

283
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,519
It's okay.

284
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,160
That pot has already been scrubbed.

285
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,300
If you scrub it again,
the coating will peel off.

286
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,039
Why do you care?

287
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,319
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him home?

288
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,680
I didn't plan for it to happen.

289
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,960
He happened to drop by.

290
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,640
Dong, the banner.

291
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,720
Okay.

292
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,400
You may as well say hi.

293
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,960
I'm not mentally prepared.

294
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,039
Prepared? For what?

295
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
I get that it's scary to
meet the mother-in-law.

296
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,920
But why are you scared?

297
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,640
Have you no shame?

298
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,079
"Mother-in-law"? You two have just met!

299
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,119
Okay.

300
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,240
Then think of him as my friend.

301
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,279
Go and say hi.

302
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,079
I will not.

303
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,839
If this were a proper
matchmaking meeting,

304
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,519
I would be all for it.

305
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,599
But you, you left without any warning,

306
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,839
leaving us in an awkward situation.

307
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,640
I'd rather pretend not to know him.

308
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,400
You worry too much.

309
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,759
You worry too little.

310
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,359
If you hurt him, he's going to hate me.

311
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,000
Ms. Liao.

312
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,720
Sorry.

313
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,519
I barged in without saying hi.

314
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:36,350
I'll leave at once.

315
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,839
No, I...

316
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,599
Leave? Silly child.

317
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,359
I was just about
to serve you some fruit.

318
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,960
You're our first-time guest,

319
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,640
and we didn't even feed you.

320
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,160
Jie is so thoughtless.
She didn't plan anything.

321
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,519
It's my fault.

322
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,828
I dropped by so suddenly
and without a gift.

323
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:53,720
Please forgive me.

324
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,759
Not at all.

325
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,359
Please, make yourself at home.

326
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,200
The children are delighted to see you.

327
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,079
Come on in. Let's chit-chat.

328
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,119
Sure.

329
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,119
You always seemed so busy.
I did not want to bother you.

330
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,960
Busy? Heavens no! Please, have a seat.

331
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,359
You youngsters are the ones
doing the important work.

332
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,880
Have a seat. Have some fruit.

333
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,759
Allow me.

334
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,079
Have a seat.

335
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,200
How is your grandma?

336
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,640
It was quite an incident.

337
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,079
I was worried for days.

338
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Thanks for your concern.

339
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:25,680
My grandma is fine.

340
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,060
She has a strong constitution
and she exercises frequently.

341
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,359
Good.

342
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,680
Even a busy man like you
should not forget to exercise.

343
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,039
I never realized
how incredibly tall you are.

344
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:38,480
Yes.

345
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,640
I take after my grandpa.
He was 1.85m tall.

346
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,599
Good.

347
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Good genes, I see.

348
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,799
Your family has better genes.

349
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,160
Your children owe it all to you.

350
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,480
Those three rascals?
Please, have some fruit.

351
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,079
Thanks.

352
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,599
Maidong, sorry for today.

353
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,759
Do come again on the Second,
it's Jie's birthday.

354
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll prepare a nice meal.

355
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,914
(Liaogen Chicken Time-honored brand
May our wishes come true)

356
00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:18,340
(May lucky star shine on you. Five
blessings be upon us. Safety and peace.)

357
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,599
Check out all these features.

358
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,119
Hot compress, massage, flip...

359
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,160
It can even give you a foot massage.

360
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,480
Everything is so high-tech nowadays.

361
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,200
Look at that.

362
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,119
I've never received
such a thoughtful gift.

363
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,640
Maidong, thank you so much.

364
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,759
Don't mention it.

365
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,279
This is so much more powerful
than the "trash cans"

366
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,000
without Chinese instructions
you gave me.

367
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,440
Hey! Are you neglecting us,

368
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,319
now that you have Maidong?

369
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,960
How unappreciative.

370
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:59,160
Yan, this year is going to be different.

371
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,279
This year, everyone
including our two dads

372
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,960
are going to have a blast.

373
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,079
Indeed.

374
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,960
Dong is our lucky star.

375
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,279
You said it.

376
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,279
Happy New Year!

377
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,839
And a Happy Birthday to Jie.

378
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,440
Happy Birthday.

379
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,279
Happy Birthday.

380
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,680
I'm going to drink to heart's content.
Don't stop me.

381
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,799
Go for it. I've got you covered.

382
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,160
Dong's shrimp is amazing.

383
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,640
His fish isn't bad either.
Much better than Xixia's.

384
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,319
I knew you had an agenda.
I did not underestimate you.

385
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,240
At this rate, you'll replace me.

386
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,960
It's a fair competition.

387
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,440
Life is kind to me.

388
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,920
Although I lost one person,
I gained a "son".

389
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,000
My life is now complete.

390
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:54,880
Ms. Liao.

391
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,440
Jie, I want to eat that cake.

392
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,028
Can you hurry up and blow the candles?

393
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,000
But we haven't finished dinner.

394
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,119
Are you serious?

395
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,240
Please.

396
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,880
All right.

397
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,319
There.

May this year bring new surprises,

407
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,742
and our country prosper.

408
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,920
What a generous wish.

409
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,920
Wait a minute, Jie.

410
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,039
You told me Dong was your lover.

411
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,119
Why is he your darling now?

412
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,519
Little brat.

413
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,039
Stop talking nonsense.

414
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:02,920
Eat your cake.

415
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,920
Such a glutton.

416
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,070
(Nanping Funeral Parlor)
Yeah.

417
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,920
Yes?

418
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,079
Okay.

419
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,559
Got it.

420
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,790
What's the matter?

421
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,720
Sorry, guys. I have to go.

422
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,279
But Dong, you've hardly
touched your food.

423
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,319
Is something wrong?

424
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,279
Emergency at the brigade. I need to go.

425
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,079
Go right ahead.

426
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,680
No worries, we understand.

427
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,571
Thanks, Ms. Liao.

428
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,759
Enjoy your meal.

429
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,580
Don't worry about me.

430
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,039
Go on.

431
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,319
Last night, Grandma lost her layer hen.

432
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,680
Do you think it was stolen?

433
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,359
Who has the appetite for chicken?

434
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Seriously.

435
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,200
We're down to two dishes.

436
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:23,510
Even the Mahjong games
are getting boring.

437
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,519
I hope the holidays end soon.

438
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,640
Celebrating New Year is so tiring.

439
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,160
We're the only ones who feel tired.

440
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,039
Look.

441
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,640
Those loafers.

442
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,680
They make me so angry.

443
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,279
Always whining, never helping.

444
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,200
You said it.

445
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,279
Whenever I look at Sun,
I feel like kicking him.

446
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,640
If you ask me, we should kick
all the men out.

447
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:47,839
Meanwhile,

448
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,759
Ms. Liao's son-in-law is hard at work.

449
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,440
Yeah.

450
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,160
Don't remind me.

451
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,440
Maidong didn't even get to enjoy
his New Year dinner.

452
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,920
I feel bad for him.

453
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,559
That's true.

454
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,640
By the way, have you heard?

455
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,119
The funeral parlor
is the busiest it's ever been.

456
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:05,680
The provincial highway incident
is still unresolved.

457
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,519
Ms. Zhao. Is it serious?

458
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,200
I heard on the radio we're not
supposed to go there, so I didn't.

459
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,839
Jie, you have no idea.
It's a total disaster.

460
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,599
Li came back
from the scene this morning.

461
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,920
He was too shocked to even eat.

462
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:23,519
Mr. Xu from Shangxi Village
had just passed away.

463
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,880
His rich son spent a fortune
and held a big funeral.

464
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,759
It went on for days.

465
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,480
On the final night of the funeral,

466
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,440
on their way to the funeral parlor,

467
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,960
out of nowhere, a truck came charging
and hit the procession.

468
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,240
Can you imagine?

469
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,920
There were dozens of people.

470
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,759
About 7 or 8 died on the spot.

471
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,839
Really?

472
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,519
Are you sure Li didn't exaggerate?

473
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,640
Of course not.

474
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,759
This must be the biggest tragedy
that's ever happened in this town.

475
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,880
Right? So scary.

476
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:54,960
I'm going to check it out.

477
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,000
Jie, I'll go.

478
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,759
Dong could use my help.

479

480
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,599
let him go instead.

Hold up, Hai.

487
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,119
Zhuang Yan, what brings you here?

488
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,480
Dong, we're worried about you.

489
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,480
Do you need any help?

490

Don't worry. Go home.

493

Dong, just give me a task.

494
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:08,440
I have nothing to do anyway.

495
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,480
Okay.

496
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,400
If we need help cleaning up,

497
00:30:14,657 --> 00:30:15,457
I'll let you know.

498
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,599
Go home.

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,280
Of course. Store-bought flowers
just aren't the same.

550
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,639
I'm so touched.

551
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,840
You're so easily pleased. Just you wait.

552
00:38:08,028 --> 00:38:10,342
I'll prepare a surprise for you
every year from now on.

553
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,519
Let's see who is better...

554
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,039
What a riot.

555
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,199
She'll love this one.
I should write it down.

556
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,840
You must be exhausted, aren't you?

557
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,559
Since I moved back,

558
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
I've never faced such a big challenge.

559
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,800
You're always serving the people.

560
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:26,742
Let's not talk about work.

561
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,159
I have a present for you, too.

562
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,840
You've been so busy.
Why trouble yourself?

563
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,400
It's not like I would mind.

564
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,199
But I want to.

565
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,859
Let me see.

566
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,360
Open it back home. It's a bit crude.

567
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,800
You're so mysterious.

568
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,480
As long as it's from you, I'll like it.

569
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,719
What's the matter?

570
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,639
I don't know.

571
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,000
Before I met you,
I was never so emotional.

572
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,679
Sometimes, I'm glad not
to feel any yearning

573
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,039
or be afraid of anything.

574
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,960
What about now?

575
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,342
I'm slightly more afraid.

576
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,800
Afraid of what?

577
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,079
Afraid of dying alone.

578
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,280
What's wrong?

579
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,559
What's happened?
You're making me worried.

580
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,079
I received a call from the hospital.

581
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,679
I must go.

582
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
I'll come with you.

583
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:17,400
Grandma Lin doesn't want
anyone else to know.

584
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,239
We should respect her wish.

585
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,039
What about now?

586
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:16,314
I'm slightly more afraid.

587
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:18,840
Afraid of what?

588
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,960
Afraid of dying alone.
