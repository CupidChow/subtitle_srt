(Hahahaha)

4
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
(Didn't see that coming.
Was it romantic?)

5
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,308
It has to be him. I mean it!

6
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:45,507
No doubt about it.

7
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:47,129
No problem. I'll send it to you.

8
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,787
There's more.

9
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:50,249
Send it to me too.

10
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:52,769
Right?

11
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:54,568
I didn't think he'd be...

12
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:57,769
What's the matter?

13
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,707
What are you guys watching?

14
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:00,928
Let's go.

15
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:02,848
Nothing.

00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,288
Xilun.

17
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:06,288
Master.

18
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:08,529
Hand it over.

19
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,329
What?

20
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:11,368
The phone.

(Mr. He: Jie, are you there yet?
Is everything okay?)

26
00:05:33,429 --> 00:05:35,147
I just got here, Mr. He.

27
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,808
Don't worry.

28
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,228
(Mr. He: Take care of yourself.)

29
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,400
(If you're dating someone, tell us.
Your mum and I will be happy.)

30
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:52,267
Oh...

31
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,969
Where did that come from?

32
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,568
You're home, my darling!

33
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:11,868
Drama queen.

34
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:13,108
I just took a break.

35
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:14,548
I missed you.

36
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:15,228
I couldn't sleep

37
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,089
when you were gone.

38
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,348
Pfft, as if.

39
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,169
I bet you were partying every night.

40
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:24,228
What do we have here?

41
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:25,768
Is it cheat day?

42
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:28,649
You accomplished such a huge feat.

43
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,627
What's a few calories?

44
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:32,928
Here you go, Miss Zhuang.

45
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,808
Allow me to wash my hands.

46
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:38,748
I shall savor

47
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,928
your taste in takeout in a bit.

48
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:43,467
We have to get a good drink tonight.

49
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:45,108
After that, you're going

50
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:46,409
to spill everything.

51
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,507
All I did was sell some Chinese yam.

52
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,147
Why are you making a fuss?

53
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:53,067
Who said anything about Chinese yam?

54
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,827
I meant what went down
at the train station.

55
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:56,328
Don't you play dumb.

56
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,888
The train station?

57
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:01,888
How'd you know about that?

58
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:03,868
The whole town probably knows

59
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:05,248
by now.

60
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:09,616
Let me see that.

61
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:10,988
What's going on? Let me see it.

62
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:12,289
Let me see...

63
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,428
Okay, okay. Stop.

64
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:14,649
You can have it.

65
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,969
Where'd this come from?

66
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:19,888
There's even a video.

67
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,209
Getting steamy, aren't we?

68
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:23,489
Who recorded this?

69
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:26,448
Who's this?

70
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,649
Who filmed this?

71
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:30,467
You're in Nanping.

72
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:32,908
This isn't Shanghai.

73
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,027
It's a train station.

74
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:36,102
Probably everyone knows someone.

75
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:37,827
Never mind the fact
that it's Chen Maidong.

76
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:39,587
He works in public service.

77
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:41,008
More people are bound to know him.

78
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,507
Doing it is basically serving gossip

79
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:44,688
to everyone on a silver platter.

80
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,267
I bet someone has already
posted it on social media

81
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:48,788
while you two were busy locking lips.

82
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,027
In less than ten minutes,

83
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:51,228
it's spread to all community

84
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:52,729
and alumni groups.

85
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:56,108
No wonder Mr. He

86
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,473
sent me that text.

87
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:58,458
But he's got tight lips.

88
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,507
He won't be saying things.

89
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:00,928
As for my mum...

90
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,808
My mum doesn't really use WeChat.

91
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:03,845
He Niaoniao.

92
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:05,467
He Niaoniao had her phone confiscated.

93
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:06,387
Thank goodness.

94
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:07,908
The house isn't going to blow up.

95
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:09,748
Oh, so now you worry.

96
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,587
I mean, what were you guys doing?

97
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:13,128
Kissing for so long

98
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,849
in a public space.

99
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,448
Trying to reenact a Korean drama?

100
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,568
Stop teasing me.

101
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,947
Chen Maidong must be

102
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:23,688
freaking out by now.

103
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,560
(A free-spirited woman)

104
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:24,688
It's come to this.

105
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,827
Why are you still denying it?

106
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:27,188
Just come clean about it.

107
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:28,969
The problem is we're not together!

108
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,288
I...

109
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,008
I kissed Chen Maidong

110
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,329
in the heat of the moment.

111
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:42,768
You kissed him? By force?

112
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:47,107
I played the rogue

113
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,987
just this once in my life.

114
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,867
How did it end up

115
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,329
becoming a town spectacle?

116
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:58,408
Zhuang Jie!

117
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,628
You...

118
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:01,408
What's he to do?

119
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:07,698
Master.

120
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:08,939
Knock before you come in.

121
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,248
Master, are you off duty?

122
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:20,329
Out with it.

123
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,308
I just wanted to talk to you
about something.

124
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:23,227
Today, the town committee

125
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:24,467
brought over an elderly widow.

126
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:25,788
She passed away in her nap.

127
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:26,747
It was peaceful.

128
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:28,148
But we can't

129
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:28,938
reach her family.

130
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:29,988
What we should do?

131
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:31,639
Finish what needs to be done today.

132
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:34,008
But it's my mom's birthday.

133
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,048
I'll cover for you.

134
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:41,209
Really?

135
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:42,209
Go home.

136
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:43,188
Thanks, Master.

137
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:44,809
Your kindness will be repaid.

138
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,508
Master?

139
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,368
What's your problem?

140
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:54,028
Just wanted to let you know.

141
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:54,987
If, in the future,

142
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,108
you suddenly decide to elope

143
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:57,508
or go on a honeymoon or something,

144
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,388
I'll cover all your shifts for you.

145
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:00,108
I promise

146
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:01,628
you and your wife won't be disturbed.

147
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:02,929
No complaints!

148
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:16,849
Grandma,

149
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,747
I have to work late tonight.

150
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:20,648
Rest early.

151
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:22,528
Don't be nosy.

152
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:12,128
Hello.

153
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,803
My name is Chen Maidong.

154
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,768
What's your name?

155
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:23,428
Is she your maternal grandma

156
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:24,660
or paternal grandma?

157
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,248
Paternal grandma.

158
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,148
Did you sneak in here

159
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,528
to be with her?

160
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:34,148
But this is

161
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:35,329
where I work.

162
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:37,008
No outsiders are allowed.

163
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:38,648
Do you understand?

164
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:39,867
Mister,

165
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:41,467
I want to go home with Grandma.

166
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,528
Can you wake her up?

167
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,067
I won't make Grandma angry anymore.

168
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:47,947
I won't ask her for Mummy and Daddy.

169
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,729
I won't do it anymore.

170
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:55,528
Let's go outside first, shall we?

171
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,168
It's cold in here.

172
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:01,849
I can't go.

173
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,574
I have to make Grandma
not angry with me.

174
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:10,609
I used to brush her hair

175
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,528
when she got mad at me.

176
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:14,368
That always cheered her up.

177
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,168
Your grandma...

178
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:25,929
isn't mad at you.

179
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:28,128
She is.

180
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:29,668
I've been begging her to wake up,

181
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:30,827
but she just won't.

182
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:33,048
Grandma's never been like this.

183
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:37,209
Your grandma's just tired.

184
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:39,569
She needs rest.

185
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:41,368
I'll stay with you.

186
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:47,028
Then, Mister,

187
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:49,067
don't forget to ask Grandma

188
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:50,628
what I did wrong.

189
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,929
I'll change.

190
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,008
I don't want her to leave me.

191
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:59,089
I don't want her to go
like Mummy and Daddy did. Please?

192
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,569
Your grandma

193
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,128
would never do that.

194
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:21,089
She will always,

195
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:23,849
always love you.

196
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:40,908
So it's really impossible

197
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:42,368
for you and Chen Maidong?

198
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:48,489
His grandma needs him.

199
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:50,888
The town needs him.

200
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,008
He can't leave just like that.

201
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:55,689
And what about you?

202
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:56,988
Are you going to stay

203
00:14:56,989 --> 00:14:58,803
in Shanghai for the rest of your life?

204
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:04,288
I just love Shanghai so much.

205
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,408
I love the streets here.

206
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,689
Hengshan Road.

207
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:09,908
Fumin Road.

208
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,048
Wukang Road.

209
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,128
Love the bridges too.

210
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:14,628
Yangpu.

211
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,368
Nanpu. Donghai.

212
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:19,168
And I love the buildings here.

213
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,248
Maybe what we love more

214
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:28,548
than Shanghai itself

215
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,128
is who we are here.

216
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,008
Especially me.

217
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,008
For someone

218
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,148
who once had to measure

219
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,609
the world with a cane,

220
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:42,528
it's a miracle that I managed

221
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,489
to settle down here.

222
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:48,609
When I walk the streets of Shanghai,

223
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:51,609
no one notices my legs.

224
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:53,908
I pass every bridge

225
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:54,827
and no one cares

226
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,528
how my dad died.

227
00:15:58,988 --> 00:15:59,929
Here,

228
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,168
as long as you're good enough,

229
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:03,827
anyone can live in a high-rise

230
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:07,128
and gaze at the Oriental Pearl Tower.

231
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,809
Sometimes, I even feel like

232
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,628
everyone's shrewdness and indifference

233
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,168
aren't flaws.

234
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,028
Everyone's racing,

235
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:16,729
trying to get ahead

236
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:18,689
and win the rewards.

237
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,768
The rules are clear.

238
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,569
It's just a shame about Chen Maidong.

239
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,929
Can't give up the whole city
for one man.

240
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:37,128
I do like Chen Maidong,

241
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,609
I always have.

242
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,128
But I love Shanghai

243
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,569
and myself even more.

244
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:15,368
But you know what?

245
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,648
At least you kissed Chen Maidong,

246
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:19,489
and he kissed you back.

247
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,908
Shanghai might not return your feelings.

248
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,507
It's such an alluring city.

249
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,449
It takes everyone's love for it.

250
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:27,307
Take those newbies in the company,

251
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:28,738
for example.

252
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:31,808
All of them with master's degrees
or higher, full of vitality.

253
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:34,048
It's really hard to keep up with them.

254
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:35,787
Sometimes when I see them,

255
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,068
I feel a sense of crisis

256
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,129
about getting old.

257
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:39,188
Lately,

258
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:40,768
I've even developed insomnia.

259
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:44,169
Let's save up

260
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:45,787
and then start our own business

261
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:46,778
like our former boss did

262
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,060
and show them who's boss.

263
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:49,799
Thanks for the encouragement.

264
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:52,307
As someone with insomnia,

265
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:53,848
I should go to bed now.

266
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,768
But let me remind you one last thing.

267
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:56,947
Your reputation in Nanping

268
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,848
is in shambles.

269
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:00,848
Consider plastic surgery.

270
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:02,768
I know.

271
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,079
I let it get the better of me.

272
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:06,467
I kissed Chen Maidong.

273
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:07,649
No regrets.

274
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:09,689
All right.

275
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,008
Good night.

276
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:37,720

For you, dear Grandma.

295
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:20,588
Come on, Grandma.

296
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:21,649
Let's eat.

297
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,008
When my grandson makes breakfast,

298
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:28,848
there must be something good.

299
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:36,547
My grandson does everything so well.

300
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:37,729
Even better than me.

301
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,169
Soft-boiled egg?

302
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:44,388
I could never

303
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:45,848
get this thing right.

304
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:53,169
The last time you made soft-boiled eggs

305
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:54,787
was to tell me

306
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:57,248
you broke up with Song Yi.

307
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,031
It's just a coincidence.

308
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:00,568
You're not fooling me.

309
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,288
Soft-boiled eggs.

310
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:04,209
Never a good sign.

311
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:06,947
Isn't it good

312
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:07,588
for you

313
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:08,787
that I broke up with Song Yi?

314
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:09,747
It's not good for me

315
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:11,729
that you broke up with anyone.

316
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:16,489
Grandma,

317
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,747
you've been worrying about me

318
00:22:18,748 --> 00:22:20,248
all these years.

319
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,088
Even though I haven't said it,

320
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:25,929
it doesn't mean I don't appreciate it.

321
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:27,568
Oh no.

322
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,969
This is bad.

323
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:31,929
Grandma,

324
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:34,328
I'm already grown up.

325
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:36,307
You should trust me.

326
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:37,209
There you go.

327
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:40,568
The more you set the stage,
the harder it's going to be.

328
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:42,209
Just say it.

329
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:44,449
I can take it.

330
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:48,689
I'm cutting off Zhuang Jie.

331
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:51,088
We won't meet again.

332
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:53,768
Didn't you guys just...

333
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,868
It was a moment of impulsiveness.
I lost my senses.

334
00:22:56,869 --> 00:22:58,668
You can't say that.

335
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,787
You made a spectacle.
Everyone knows about it.

336
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:02,188
Let them say what they want.

337
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,248
I don't care.

338
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,129
You...

339
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:06,428
Aren't you going to consider Jie at all?

340
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:08,288
She's a girl!

341
00:23:08,508 --> 00:23:09,649
She's in Shanghai.

342
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,027
Who knows when

343
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:12,489
she'll come back again?

344
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:14,449
These rumors

345
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:16,088
will blow over soon enough.

346
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:17,987
How did I end up

347
00:23:17,988 --> 00:23:19,489
raising such a rascal!

348
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:23,008
Forget it.

349
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:25,449
From now on,
I won't care about you anymore.

350
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:35,231
If you don't care about me,
then who will?

351
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,568
Do you want to be like my parents?

352
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,008
I still want to live longer.

353
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,328
You, ungrateful child,

354
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:46,729
will die alone and lonely.

355
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:49,369
Grandma,

356
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,689
I promise

357
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:53,608
I won't upset you again.

358
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:55,298
You have the final say

359
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:56,660
in my matchmaking matters.

360
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:58,649
I'll marry

361
00:23:58,948 --> 00:24:00,088
whoever you like.

362
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,089
Except for Zhuang Jie.

363
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:06,428
What's wrong with Zhuang Jie?

364
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:07,489
Nothing.

365
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:10,117
I'm the one who isn't good for her.

366
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:11,889
We can never seem

367
00:24:12,948 --> 00:24:14,130
to talk peacefully.

368
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:15,774
We always jab and poke at each other.

369
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:17,689
I don't know why.

370
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:19,987
Isn't this how family behaves?

371
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:21,828
You don't talk nicely to me either.

372
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:22,848
Grandma,

373
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:25,328
let me be honest.

374
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:30,231
Zhuang Jie doesn't like me
that much either.

375
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:33,460
She wouldn't come back
to Nanping for me.

376
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,649
You act like matchmaking

377
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:39,288
is the end of the world.

378
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:42,729
Chen Maidong,

379
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:45,689
I'm old.

380
00:24:46,308 --> 00:24:48,489
I can't be with you forever.

381
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:52,129
Sooner or later,
you'll have to start a family.

382
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:56,248
As you say.

383
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:00,568
Let's eat.

384
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:03,969
I'll find Wu Xuehua later.

385
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:07,689
I really like

386
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:10,768
Jie.

387
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:18,288
She's an invaluable girl.

388
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:21,608
Oh well.

389
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,288
It's not meant to be.

390
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,388
Zhuang Jie, you're back to work.

391
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:45,588
We've been bored

392
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:47,169
without you.

393
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:48,467
I ordered too much.

394
00:25:48,468 --> 00:25:49,689
Have some.

395
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:51,987
What goodies do we have here?

396
00:25:51,988 --> 00:25:52,787
I'll take some too.

397
00:25:52,788 --> 00:25:53,868
You don't get any.

398
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:56,048
Every time you fail to lose weight,
you blame me.

399
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:58,599
Well, I wouldn't eat
if it weren't yours.

400
00:25:58,748 --> 00:25:59,658
That reminds me.

401
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,148
The other day I was
talking to them about you.

402
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:02,188
If you take

403
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:03,409
a longer leave,

404
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:05,108
someone will snatch up

405
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:06,227
your respiratory pump order.

406
00:26:06,228 --> 00:26:07,148
That's right.

407
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,868
That new employee in your company, Jia,

408
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,558
is always going
to the equipment department.

409
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,388
She's helping me
maintain client relationships.

410
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:13,188
Sure, sure.

411
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:14,489
You're so trusting.

412
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:15,388
All right.

413
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:16,947
I'm going to the equipment department,

414
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:19,008
so you guys don't worry.

415
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:21,388
Zhuang Jie is the one
who gets things done.

416
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:22,388
If you ask me,

417
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:23,768
Jia doesn't stand a chance.

418
00:26:24,948 --> 00:26:26,689
Can't find out what's wrong at all?

419
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:29,328
This is the second time this month.

420
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,248
What are those
after-sales people even doing?

421
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:34,528
What's wrong, Jia?

422
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:37,027
Miss Zhuang, you're back.

423
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,129
The boss asked me to help you follow up.

424
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,428
But I'm just a small fry.

425
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:41,227
I can't handle it.

426
00:26:41,228 --> 00:26:42,348
It's just a follow-up.

427
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:43,828
No need for you
to handle anything,

428
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:44,768
right?

429
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:46,449
You're right.

430
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:48,409
I'm just really bad with conflicts.

431
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:50,188
Director Liu here is always yelling.

432
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:51,348
He scares me.

433
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:52,428
Listen.

434
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:53,348
I never eavesdrop.

435
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:54,808
Tell them I said it!

436
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:00,959
What did Qin do?

437
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,637
Making Director Liu,
who has a good temper,

438
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:04,169
lose his cool and start cursing?

439
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:05,768
Spare me the sarcasm.

440
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:07,148
Me? Good temper?

441
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:09,008
You're really mad.

442
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:13,302
I'm telling you, Zhuang Jie,

443
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:15,302
it doesn't matter
how well-informed you are.

444
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:17,108
I'm not changing
the respiratory pumps yet.

445
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,947
No need to keep sending them coming.

446
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:20,227
I know.

447
00:27:20,228 --> 00:27:21,507
Al least six months in them.

448
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:22,668
I'm aware of that.

449
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:23,816
Six months?

450
00:27:23,817 --> 00:27:26,227
For another half a month, I...
I'll be a goner.

451
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,348
Well, you've got me.

452
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:29,267
Although they're not our machines,

453
00:27:29,268 --> 00:27:30,747
the technical parameters are the same.

454
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:31,908
Send me the problem feedback.

455
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:34,068
I'll call a meeting with our engineers.

456
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:34,628
Wait here.

457
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:35,729
I'll go get it.

458
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:38,148
You salespeople never do anything

459
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:39,467
that isn't for profit.

460
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:40,528
I know.

461
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,947
If you solve the pump problem,

462
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:45,707
I'll order my next batch of monitors

463
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:47,048
from you.

464
00:27:47,189 --> 00:27:48,068
Director Liu,

465
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,987
that's not fair.

466
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:51,348
I've been with Taixin Health Care

467
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:52,267
for so long.

468
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:53,507
When have I ever taken advantage

469
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:54,987
of someone's weakness?

470
00:27:54,988 --> 00:27:56,468
We only provide the best equipment,

471
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:57,467
technical support,

472
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,502
and high-quality service.

473
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:00,203
That's where my confidence comes from.

474
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:02,108
We have a code of ethics in sales,

475
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:02,738
okay?

476
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:04,467
Okay, okay, I can't argue with you.

477
00:28:04,468 --> 00:28:05,828
Just do your thing.

478
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:06,428
Hurry up.

479
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:07,328
Here.

480
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:10,409
All right.

481
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:11,608
Leave it to me.

482
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,707
Jia, contact the technical specialist

483
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:18,988
for the respiratory pump.

484
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,547
There's a conference call
in 15 minutes.

485
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:21,428
You're included.

486
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:22,546
Yes, Miss Zhuang.

487
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:41,828
Grandma Chen.

488
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:43,307
Here, have some water.

489
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:44,288
Thank you.

490
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:48,987
Don't worry.

491
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,707
I've made all the arrangements.

492
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,707
I'm glad that Maidong can

493
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:52,588
go on the blind dates.

494
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:54,248
Thank you, Wu.

495
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:55,889
Grandma Chen,

496
00:28:56,228 --> 00:28:57,668
why don't we go inside?

497
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,348
The sun is so hot.

498
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:01,507
We don't want you to get a bad sunburn.

499
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:02,689
I'm fine.

500
00:29:03,948 --> 00:29:05,787
I want to stay here for a bit.

501
00:29:05,788 --> 00:29:07,628
Wu, don't worry.

502
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,649
I won't cause you any more trouble.

503
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:11,449
Here, have an orange.

504
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:12,689
Thank you.

505
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:20,449
Remember.

506
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:23,467
Whenever it involves the work

507
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:24,227
with the elderly

508
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:25,588
and the left-behind children,

509
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:26,988
you must be especially meticulous.

510
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:28,507
- Got it.
- You'll have to handle tasks

511
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:30,048
in the future.

512
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:33,328
Is he that Chen Maidong?

513
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:36,707
Pay attention.

514
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,227
Did you hear what I just said?

515
00:29:38,228 --> 00:29:39,608
Yes, Madam Wu.

516
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:42,008
It's him, right?
The guy at the train station.

517
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:45,130
It's me.

518
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,460
Is there a problem?

519
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:55,608
All right.

520
00:29:56,788 --> 00:29:57,689
Madam Wu,

521
00:29:58,268 --> 00:30:00,449
have arrangements been made for the boy?

522
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:03,519
He's already been sent
to his aunt's house in the city.

523
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:04,868
I heard his aunt and uncle

524
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,987
are good folks.

525
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:08,027
Much better than his parents.

526
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:09,808
They're simply inhuman.

527
00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:10,947
Okay. I should go.

528
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:11,787
I'll get busy.

529
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:12,689
Maidong.

530
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:13,969
Come here.

531
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:19,328
Your grandma came to me again
the other day.

532
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:21,489
About the matchmaking?

533
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:22,729
Yes.

534
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:24,027
The old lady

535
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:25,227
worries too much.

536
00:30:25,228 --> 00:30:26,227
She must not know

537
00:30:26,228 --> 00:30:27,707
about you and Zhuang Jie.

538
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,169
There's nothing between us.

539
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,707
Glad I didn't mention it to anyone else.

540
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,148
Not even

541
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:37,328
Zhuang Jie's mother.

542
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,649
After all,
it's your young people's business.

543
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:42,174
Regarding the arranged dates,

544
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:43,917
I'll do as my grandma wants.

545
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:45,699
I'll be troubling you, Madam Wu.

546
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:48,369
So you're going to do it?

547
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:49,808
Yes.

548
00:30:50,508 --> 00:30:52,328
You make the arrangements. I'll go.

549
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:54,119
- I'm going back to work.
- Okay.

550
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:03,248
He said yes to the arranged dates.

551
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:07,088
My, what is with these young people?

552
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:09,346
Do they think this is all a game?

553
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:11,248
Madam Wu.

554
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:15,169
What do you think about me?

555
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:17,608
For what?

556
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:20,489
As a marriage candidate
for Chen Maidong.

557
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:21,848
You...

558
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:24,027
He pulled that stunt
at the train station,

559
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:25,689
and you still want him?

560
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:26,707
No, it's not like that.

561
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:27,988
You don't understand.

562
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:29,108
Everyone outside is saying

563
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:31,369
they either didn't really date
or they broke up.

564
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:33,348
As long as it's a clean break,
it's fine.

565
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:36,738
People are more valuable
when more people like them.

566
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:38,668
The photos they took of him
at the station

567
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:40,108
look like they're from a magazine.

568
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:42,048
I even saved them. Want to see?

569
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:43,668
Let me stop you right there.

570
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,148
How old do you think you are?

571
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:46,227
Can you focus on your work

572
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:47,108
instead of this?

573
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,048
Please?

574
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:50,248
You've lost your mind.

575
00:31:54,189 --> 00:31:56,628
No wonder so many girls have been asking me

576
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:59,209
about Chen Maidong recently.

577
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:02,008
What's wrong with these girls?

578
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:03,608
Madam Wu!

579
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:04,929

(Three months later)

608
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:49,730
What's the matter with you?

609
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,427
The girl already said she doesn't mind

610
00:35:51,428 --> 00:35:52,969
your job

611
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,168
at the funeral parlor

612
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:56,599
and doesn't insist on
buying a house in the city.

613
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:59,267
And she doesn't care
about your past!

614
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:01,128
What more do you want?

615
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:02,528
What do you want?

616
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,148
I get sleepy when she talks.

617
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:05,488
I can't help it.

618
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:07,588
Who doesn't make you feel sleepy
when they talk?

619
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:09,608
You tell me!

620
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:11,307
Okay...

621
00:36:11,308 --> 00:36:12,188
Let's take a break.

622
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:13,449
Don't tire yourself out.

623
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:16,769
What's the rush?

624
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:18,746
I'll just keep seeing other girls.

625
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:20,148
Don't fool me.

626
00:36:20,149 --> 00:36:21,028
By looking at photos,

627
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:22,248
you've eliminated half of them.

628
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:24,028
When you meet in person,
you're not interested.

629
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:24,588
Tell me...

630
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:25,387
Wait...

631
00:36:25,388 --> 00:36:26,568
Got a call.

632
00:36:29,268 --> 00:36:30,128
Yes?

633
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:36,608
Got it. I'll be right there.

634
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:38,128
Something wrong?

635
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:39,907
A major accident
at the industrial plant.

636
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:40,707
I have to go.

637
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,048
Go on, then. Get going.

638
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:48,346
I wonder whose family
has been affected this time.

639
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:51,998
Have some water.

640
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:54,203
- Thanks, Director Liu.
- Qin went to get the contract.

641
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:55,849
Zhuang Jie,

642
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:57,702
I'm not flattering you,

643
00:36:57,703 --> 00:36:59,788
but you are a woman
with foresight and magnanimity.

644
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:02,068
You always bring Jia along
no matter what you do.

645
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:03,267
I thought she was the wave

646
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:04,707
that was going

647
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,329
to wipe you out.

648
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:09,148
Everyone starts out as a rookie.

649
00:37:09,149 --> 00:37:10,688
We all need guidance.

650
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:11,867
I've still got ways to go.

651
00:37:11,868 --> 00:37:13,809
I've got much to learn
from Miss Zhuang.

652
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:16,409
Anyway, with this batch of monitors,

653
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:19,008
Zhuang Jie, I'll be honest.

654
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:21,267
I need you
to keep your eyes peeled for me.

655
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:22,548
I pre-ordered in advance

656
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:25,528
because I trust your professionalism.

657
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:27,774
Rest assured, Director Liu...

658
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:31,148
It's my little sister.

659
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,588
She hardly ever calls me. I...

660
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:33,769
Go ahead.

661
00:37:38,428 --> 00:37:40,329
Niaoniao? What is it?

662
00:37:42,228 --> 00:37:44,528
Calm down. Take your time.

663
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,088
What happened?

664
00:37:49,629 --> 00:37:50,728
Got it.

665
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:52,929
I'll be there.

666
00:38:03,868 --> 00:38:04,809
I'm so sorry,

667
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:05,849
Director Liu.

668
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,548
Something came up at home.

669
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:09,289
I have to go. I...

670
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,208
Zhuang Jie, the contract.

671
00:38:22,874 --> 00:38:25,117
To the train station.
Drive fast. I'm in a hurry.

672
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:29,468
We lost him when he reached here.

673
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:30,969
He came straight to us.

674
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,907
A heavy object to the face?

675
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:34,387
Yes.

676
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:35,707
They finished
renovating factory

677
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:36,787
and had some relatives come

678
00:38:36,788 --> 00:38:37,548
to help move

679
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:38,948
the large equipment for production

680
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:39,867
into the building.

681
00:38:39,868 --> 00:38:41,330
Somehow it tilted and ended up

682
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:42,307
crushing two people.

683
00:38:42,308 --> 00:38:43,628
The other person got lucky.

684
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:45,079
No life-threatening injuries.

685
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:46,860
What's the name of the deceased?

686
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:49,568
(Deceased information card)
He Zhangyue.

687
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:51,528
From Liaogen Chicken.

688
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:54,128
