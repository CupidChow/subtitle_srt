1
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,320
You...

2
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,720
Look... Look at here.

3
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,240
They said that the other day

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,440
at the train station,

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,960
a chic lass and Chen Maidong
from the funeral parlor

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,630
shared a passionate kiss.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,000
Passionate kiss? Do you

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,760
even know what a passionate kiss is?

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,960
I guess that lad has no shame.

10
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:44,710
Don't poke your nose into that.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,510
What's wrong with them kissing?

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,114
Come.

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,960
That's easy for you to say.

14
00:00:54,142 --> 00:00:55,790
You never have
to worry about Zhuang Jie.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,520
If Zhuang Jie dares do something indecent

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,710
like having a fling
or kissing someone in this town,

17
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:03,640
instead of reading her fortune,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
I will seal her fate.

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,180
(Lin Baobao's Veterinary Clinic)

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,280
Grandma Lin.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,280
Grandma Lin.

22
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,040
It's me, Wu.

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:39,940
Grandma Lin.

24
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,290
Why are you here this late at night?

25
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,200
I'm sorry

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,590
to disturb you at late hours.

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,840
She has gone crazy too.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,150
Grandma Lin,

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,200
what's wrong with you?

30
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:50,200
You are sweating.

31
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm good.

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,200
Come in.

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,920
Come in.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,710
Come on in.

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,040
Grandma Lin.

36
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,870
My... My daughter...

37
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,710
I...

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,870
I'm done for!

39
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,800
=Will Love In Spring=

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,420
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

41
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,420
=Episode 13=

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,910
He Niaoniao,

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
back to your room.

44
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,590
Don't be ungrateful.

45
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,085
I'm warming up the bed for you.

46
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,750
Where is Mom?

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,120
Beats me.

48
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,240
No one was home.

49
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,150
I'm afraid.

50
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,942
I want to sleep with you.

51
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,870
All right.

52
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,030
Little tyke.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,630
Get to sleep.

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm coming after washing up.

55
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,485
(Zhuang Jie: Chen Maidong,
I know you are serious.)

56
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,914
(Honestly, I'm impressed.
After seeing the outside world,)

57
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,420
(you still choose to return
and stay undisturbedly in the town.)

58
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,580
(But I can't do that. I have
many pursuits, so I can't come back.)

59
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,020
(Maybe my insecurity urges me to equip
myself with success to prove my worth.)

60
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,060
(So... Could you please
not force me to change?)

61
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,780
(No need to change.
I accept who you are.)

62
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,920
No need to change.

63
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,028
I accept who you are.

64
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,190
Jie.

65
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,430
Jie, get up.

66
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,000
It's 8:30 AM. I'm late.

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,720
Where is Mom?

68
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,160
Why didn't she wake us up?

69
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,310
I don't know.

70
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,160
It's quiet outside.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,750
Mom didn't come home last night?

72
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,600
Madam Wu,

73
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,900
are you sure my mom is all right?

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,560
Oh, my. Both of you are not youngsters

75
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,750
who get drunk easily.

76
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,870
Let her get some more sleep.

77
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,240
I will mind the store today.

78
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:19,430
Jie, bring me the chocolate.

79
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:19,950
Where is it?

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,771
On the coffee table.

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,720
Put it in my bag.

82
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,120
No wonder Mom finds you annoying.

83
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,820
You need us to serve you for school.

84
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,950
And how about you?

85
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,914
You make such a fuss
just to make awful toast?

86
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,040
Don't eat so much chocolate.

87
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,160
Look at your belly.

88
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,560
I don't deserve to eat that.

89
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,300
That's the New Year's gift
for my classmate.

90
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,270
Classmate?

91
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,510
Price doesn't matter much,

92
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,710
but it's the thought that counts.

93
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,180
You bought it from a supermarket, right?

94
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,390
Everyone gives gifts.

95
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,630
I have to follow suit.

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,270
If not, I will be isolated.

97
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,240
He Niaoniao,

98
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,190
don't talk nonsense.

99
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,350
I went to your school.

100
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,630
You won't be isolated.

101
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:50,800
You don't understand.

102
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,600
I'm too pretty.

103
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,950
Girls in my class don't like me.

104
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,160
It's impossible to be liked by everyone.

105
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,430
Improve your grades.

106
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:01,560
I will prepare a new gift for you.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,890
My sister is the best.

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,750
Unlike Mom,

109
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,510
she doesn't care about me.

110
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:12,085
She never replies to messages
in the class group chat.

111
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,870
That's why I can't be the class rep.

112
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:16,260
When she comes back later,
I'm going to tell Mom

113
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,310
to fix your unhealthy thinking.

114
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,190
Hurry and go.

115
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,040
Wait.

116
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,190
Bye-bye.

117
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,480
Here.

118
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,480
Eat some.

119
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,560
I don't want to.

120
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,510
Look at you.

121
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,270
Do you have to be so angry?

122
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,390
It's normal for Jie to date a man

123
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,440
at her age.

124
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,550
It depends on
who the man she is seeing.

125
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,790
Chen Maidong is a pretty good guy.

126
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,720
Yes, he's pretty good as a neighbor.

127
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,870
When He passed away,

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,480
I was really grateful to him.

129
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,030
But now is a different case.

130
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,630
As for the son-in-law,

131
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,120
his family background matters here.

132
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
Is his family decent?

133
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,840
Chen Maidong

134
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,550
is young and talented.

135
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,030
His dad has been doing business
in the province for years.

136
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
They are rich.

137
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm not after his money.

138
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,200
His grandma broke into
someone's yard with a sickle.

139
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,260
When I think about that now,

140
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,120
I still get the jitters.

141
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,800
You see, if something goes wrong
in the future,

142
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,080
she might come after me
and my daughter with that sickle.

143
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,910
Besides,

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,910
my own family has been through a lot.

145
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,720
You see, Chen Maidong's family
isn't complete either.

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,790
It will only be bad
for them to be together.

147
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,142
Zhuang Jie keeps saying
that she wants to go back to Shanghai.

148
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,960
Yet now,

149
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,320
she did such an indecent thing
in the public area.

150
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,120
What exactly does she want?

151
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:56,840
Come.

152
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,630
You are to blame too.

153
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,120
You always claim
to find Chen Maidong a match.

154
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,914
Don't you know how they got together?

155
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,550
They were classmates
during high school days.

156
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,670
You are her mom,

157
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,070
and you are clueless about it.

158
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,240
How would I know that?

159
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,440
Let me tell you this.

160
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,550
You can turn a blind eye to them.

161
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,390
Honestly, I think Chen Maidong

162
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,360
truly likes Zhuang Jie.

163
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,960
His grandma forced me
to introduce so many girls to him.

164
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,270
Those girls agreed,

165
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,150
but Chen Maidong
didn't meet any of them.

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,270
It's true. I'm not lying.

167
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,960
And that's the problem.

168
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
Both he and his grandma
are so fickle-minded.

169
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,390
You suffered a lot
when caught between them.

170
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,390
I'm well aware of that.

171
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,480
None of them has a clear mind.

172
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,720
Why must Zhuang Jie

173
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
get involved in this?

174
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,390
Is she even in her right mind?

175
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,270
I used to think she
was smart and ambitious.

176
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,720
At least, she should find a man
who is both physically

177
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,485
and emotionally healthy, but not him.

178
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,960
I can't believe her.

179
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,000
Look,

180
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,150
we are mothers.

181
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,870
I can relate to your feelings.

182
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,440
You see, as the townfolks here,

183
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,910
we only know a little

184
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,440
about the Chen family.

185
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,670
Back then, when her son got divorced,

186
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,600
it had caused quite a stir in the town.

187
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,960
But now,

188
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,630
nobody knows what actually happened.

189
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,440
Chen Maidong

190
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,000
may seem decent now,

191
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,510
but he was a bully when he was young.

192
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,670
He had a girlfriend
for six or seven years.

193
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,100
Supposedly, they should get married,

194
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,360
but they broke up.

195
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:25,790
I didn't know what happened.

196
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,480
You should tell

197
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,900
Zhuang Jie what you just told me.

198
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,840
Goodness.

199
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,790
My own daughter wouldn't listen to me.

200
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,428
Do you think your daughter would?

201
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,030
Chen Maidong,

202
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:48,960
I knew I had come to the right person
to prepare gifts.

203
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,360
You are so skilled.

204
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,030
Only if it were true.

205
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,630
You, on the other hand,
have impressed me.

206
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,390
I thought you had difficulty
with your leg,

207
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,228
I didn't know it was the same
for your hands.

208
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:00,840
Stop it.

209
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,990
Did you forget what happened
when you kicked me last time?

210
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,510
Chen Maidong,

211
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
I have prepared a gift for you.

212
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,870
Your reward.

213
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,480
No thanks.

214
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,630
You snatched it from your sister.

215
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,440
Nonsense.

216
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,885
I specially chose this for you.

217
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,750
It's delicious.

218
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:20,270
Come. Try it.

219
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,270
Later.

220
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,870
Have a look.

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,510
How is it?

222
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,120
Nice.

223
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,200
I think something is missing here.

224
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,790
This is a gift for a kid.

225
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,720
Maybe I will add some decoration.

226
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,200
Perfect.

227
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,200
I can reuse it.

228
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,910
Chen Maidong,
you have a lot of ornaments.

229
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,080
You wouldn't buy these.

230
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,670
Did someone give you these?

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
My ex-girlfriend likes gift-giving.

232
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,720
You keep them all.

233
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,960
Do you mind this?

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,150
Not at all.

235
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:17,440
I couldn't be more grateful

236
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,870
that you are helping me out.

237
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,120
Besides,

238
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,630
you are a grown-up.

239
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,600
How could I mind
if you had an ex-girlfriend?

240
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,270
No flirting.

241
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,030
If you are bored,

242
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,510
we can do something else.

243
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,670
Chen Maidong,

244
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,870
the time we can
spend together is limited.

245
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,840
I won't want to waste it

246
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,750
throwing a tantrum at you
over trivial things.

247
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:49,114
Have you decided on a time
to go back to Shanghai?

248
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,270
After the New Year.

249
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,790
We promised

250
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,510
that when we are together,

251
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,510
you can't hide anything
from me or lie to me.

252
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,550
All right?

253
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,750
Sure.

254
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,200
You should do the same too.

255
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:19,114
I found an ideal way of a relationship.

256
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,270
It's Grandma Lin.

257
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,790
We were in love,

258
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,960
so there are no regrets.

259
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,360
He has been in my heart for my whole life.

260
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,200
It's fair for both of us.

261
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,790
That's nice.

262
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,480
From what I know,

263
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,142
she seems to have stayed single
all her life.

264
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,790
You don't understand.

265
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,480
One manages to
live their whole life on their own

266
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:45,910
because they hold
their memory dearly deep inside.

267
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:47,080
That's why they are at ease.

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,080
When they are in love,

269
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:50,600
they don't hold back their passion.

270
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:54,230
When they lose each other,
they stay tough to get over the pain.

271
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,640
That makes their lives worthwhile.

272
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,028
If a lasting relationship were possible,

273
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:03,685
no one would choose
to be alone for life.

274
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,600
Chen Maidong.

275
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,510
There is something I must tell you.

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,910
It's about Grandma Lin.

277
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,150
Sure.

278
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,270
You were hesitating
on the phone last time.

279
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,150
It is not good news.

280
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,870
I'm home.

281
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,670
Jie, did someone buy you flowers?

282
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,800
Focus on your homework.

283
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,750
He Niaoniao.

284
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,742
Give this to your classmate tomorrow.

285
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,960
Mom.

286
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,510
Go and wash the cherries.

287
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,440
This is your favorite.

288
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,320
I will do it.

289
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,910
Mom has caught a cold.

290
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,840
Cold?

291
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,120
What has happened?

292
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,480
Put the mop down. Let me do it.

293
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,080
Give it to me.

294
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,960
Take a seat.

295
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,480
Wait.

296
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,020
Weren't you and Madam Wu
having a "happy" time last night?

297
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,550
How come you fell sick?

298
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,360
Don't use language I can't understand.

299
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,910
Those cherries are expensive.

300
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,950
You bought a whole box of it.
Did you make big money?

301
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,270
It is a gift.

302
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,030
Mom.

303
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,000
Here.

304
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,630
Mom, try this.

305
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,670
Try this.

306
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,630
Come on, have a taste.

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,550
Is it sweet?

308
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,510
Mom, why are you only eating a little?

309
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,571
It's not my money, though.

310
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:55,085
You can't waste it,
no matter whose money it is.

311
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:57,000
It's like you are
taking advantage of others.

312
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,870
You sound so wrong to me.

313
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:01,480
Besides, I have been poor
since I was little.

314
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,630
I'm a cheapskate.

315
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,630
Does it bother you?

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,670
You have great taste and high standards.

317
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,670
How can you be bought off
with a box of cherries?

318
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,085
Go ahead and
marry a rich and decent man.

319
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,150
You get carried away so easily lately.

320
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:18,857
If you have nothing else to do,
hurry and return to Shanghai.

321
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,628
Stop showing your face in front of me.

322
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,110
What's wrong with Mom?

323
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,550
Before you came back,

324
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,640
I thought it was my problem.

325
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,257
But now it seems like it's yours.

326
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,310
I'm safe now.

327
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,790
I was about to pick you up.

328
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,314
You didn't answer my call again.

329
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:47,270
How many times do I have to tell you

330
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:48,750
that I have walked this road many times.

331
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,880
I won't get lost.

332
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,240
Did you go to Grandma Lin for a chat?

333
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,270
Yeah.

334
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,070
Except for her, who else

335
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,200
would give me these fine things?

336
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,428
Didn't you ask Grandma Lin

337
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,310
why she gave you these?

338
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,240
It's not the first time.

339
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,000
What I have eaten and worn these years

340
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,310
was all given by her.

341
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,830
Well,

342
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,310
at least you have a grandson.

343
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,790
Grandma Lin is all alone.

344
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,028
You never gave her anything in return,

345
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,480
you always took things from her.

346
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,200
We have a fair way of exchange.

347
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,480
She sincerely gives me,

348
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
and I gratefully receive.

349
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,920
We are happy.

350
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,400
The New Year is coming after Christmas.

351
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,160
Did you give Jie anything?

352
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,880
I gave her cherries.

353
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,030
Boring.

354
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,285
She doesn't want anything else.

355
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,440
Grandma,

356
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,270
well,

357
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,830
did Grandma Lin...

358
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Why are you so concerned
about us two old ladies?

359
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
Don't worry about that.

360
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,000
The priority now is you and Jie.

361
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,510
I have been using

362
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,880
this bracelet as prayer beads.

363
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,640
Don't be ungrateful.

364
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,590
We are doing quite well.

365
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,000
A good start isn't enough.

366
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:22,400
When you were with that vixen...

367
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,030
I mean, Song Yi,

368
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,550
it was a waste of time.

369
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:30,285
She even abandoned you in the end.

370
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,200
Dong,

371
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,880
I know

372
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,200
why you chose to stay in Nanping.

373
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,880
At first, it was to fill your master's gap.

374
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,920
But now there are
more staff in your unit.

375
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,885
You don't have to trap yourself here.

376
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,510
If you truly like Jie,

377
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,790
go to Shanghai with her.

378
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,960
I'm serious.

379
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,480
It's rare to meet a kind lady like Jie.

380
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,070
Even if you take her family name,

381
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,070
I wouldn't mind.

382
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,110
I have never thought of that.

383
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,114
Besides, you are getting up in years.

384
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,880
I will stay

385
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,030
where you stay.

386
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,270
I'm already in this age,

387
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,070
I can live just about anywhere.

388
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,240
I go

389
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,640
where you go.

390
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,070
Can you bear

391
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,310
to leave Grandma Lin alone?

392
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,590
Honestly,

393
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:40,685
I have been thinking about this
for a long time.

394
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,680
Grandma Lin is a sensible person.

395
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,680
I can come back here
more often every year.

396
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,160
It is very convenient
to travel by plane or train.

397
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,942
It's not like we won't see
each other again.

398
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,590
Grandma,

399
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,057
there is something...

400
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,750
I have a call.

401
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,830
Hello?

402
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,480
What?

403
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:12,640
I will be on my way.

404
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,480
Ma'am.

405
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,590
What do you want?

406
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,400
What is the best-seller here?

407
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,160
If you want it for yourself,

408
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,150
the whole chicken or chicken wings
are good choices.

409
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,960
If it is a gift,

410
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,628
you can take
the Vacuum Chicken gift box.

411
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,720
Give me two gift boxes

412
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
with refined deco.

413
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,628
Sure, I will choose it for you.

414
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,960
Aren't you Song Yi?

415
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,680
It has been years since we met.

416
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,590
Ma'am.

417
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,830
It has been a long time.

418
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,640
I have left Nanping.

419
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,914
It's good
that you married into the city.

420
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,070
Why?

421
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,590
Are you back for Maidong?

422
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,085
I'm going to visit his grandma.

423
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,480
You should come back often.

424
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,720
Old neighbors still talk about you.

425
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,880
That's your thing.

426
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,550
You bought a lot.

427
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,310
Scan here.

428
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,270
Thank you.

429
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,200
Liao.

430
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,200
Do you know her?

431
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,480
It seems Song Yi

432
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,160
is doing quite well.

433
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,070
She wasn't like this
when she was dating Chen Maidong.

434
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,270
Grandma Chen had her

435
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,070
wrapped around her finger.

436
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,640
But she doesn't blame her.

437
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,440
She is still close with them now.

438
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,480
I haven't bought it yet.

439
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm closing. Come another day.

440
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,270
Seriously?

441
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,030
Niaoniao.

442
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Mom,

443
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,720
I just picked Zhuang Yan up.

444
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,830
We are going for a meal together.

445
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,480
All right, got it.

446
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,070
So impatient.

447
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,510
Hey, the two of you.

448
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,480
It's only a few days.
Don't be so dramatic.

449
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,480
Jie,

450
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,310
take us to eat something good.

451
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,510
Mom wants to see me now.

452
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,480
You guys go first.

453
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,440
It's on me.

454
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,314
My hunch tells me that sounds ominous.

455
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,480
Good luck.

456
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,971
What's wrong with Mom and Jie?

457
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,790
Don't ask.

458
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:55,942
Just tuck your tail
between your legs for the time being.

459
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,550
Americano, thanks.

460
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,270
Madam Liao, you match

461
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,000
the vibe of the coffee house quite well.

462
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:16,790
Look here.

463
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,640
What's the big matter
you want to talk about here?

464
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:30,920
Do you always find it funny
in everything I do?

465
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,680
You are touchy.

466
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,110
What have I done?

467
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,720
Is it about Zhuang Yan or He Niaoniao?

468
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,542
What's your relationship
with Chen Maidong?

469
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,714
We are in a relationship.

470
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:50,740
When will you get married?

471
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,160
Wait, what are you talking about?

472
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,270
Who tells you all relationships
must end up in marriage?

473
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,920
What do you want then? Having fun?

474
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,880
Mom,

475
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,920
I can't control who I like.

476
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,160
You like him.

477
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,350
Does he like you?

478
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,110
Of course.

479
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,160
We both agreed to enjoy our time

480
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,771
while we are in this town.

481
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,740
I will still go back to Shanghai
after the New Year.

482
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,670
Are you saying that you kiss
and hug causally

483
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,160
and then just separate afterward?

484
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:14,510
I'm telling you, Zhuang Jie,

485
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,700
I suffered a lot in life
because I'm not well-educated,

486
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,371
but I understand things better than you.

487
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,550
Don't think for a second
you can walk all over me

488
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,310
because you are well-educated.

489
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,480
I despise it to the bone
you all ranting about

490
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,110
open-mindedness, freedom,

491
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
free will, or whatever.

492
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,200
I won't hold with it no matter what.

493
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,240
Our family are simple
and honest townfolks here.

494
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
As long as you are here,

495
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,830
you have to follow the rules.

496
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Don't you ever humiliate us

497
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,571
and let anyone talk
behind Mr. He's and my back.

498
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:53,880
Mom,

499
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,480
this is too much.

500
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,550
Too much?

501
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,830
I'm holding back what I want to say.

502
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,830
Break up with him.

503
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,590
Impossible.

504
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,270
Do you want me to
lay the ugly truth bare for you?

505
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,030
You are the only victim in the fling.

506
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:12,720
Why are women always the victim
when the relationship is consensual?

507
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,240
It's feudalism at its worst.

508
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,480
Let me tell you what's really the worst.

509
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,210
The pleasure brings you
a ten-month pregnancy

510
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,160
and a lifetime of regret.

511
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,110
Do you want this?

512
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,350
Keep it down.

513
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,100
People are here.

514
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,750
What are you making us out to be?

515
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
Tell me, what are you two?

516
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,350
He won't respect you
if you don't take yourself seriously.

517
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:30,960
Seeing your current conduct,

518
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,400
I doubt you will be cherished.

519
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:34,100
Chen Maidong isn't that kind of person.

520
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,590
As if.

521
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:36,480
How long have you known him?

522
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,680
Like you have known him well.

523
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,350
I just do.

524
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,510
Do you also know his ex-girlfriend came?

525
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,830
Good swimmers are the ones who drown.

526
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:49,720
Experienced drivers
are the ones who crash.

527
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,480
Easy targets are the ones
who think they are smart.

528
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,550
What...

529
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,920
What is this? So bitter.

530
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,350
It tastes like herbal medicine soup.

531
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,510
Grandma.

532
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,880
Are you throwing the chickens away?

533
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,590
I'm not mad about the chickens.

534
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,590
It's about who sent them.

535
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,240
Who was it?

536
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's fine, Grandma.

537
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,830
It's all right if you can't tell.

538
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,240
Chen Maidong isn't home?

539
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,790
He left hurriedly last night.

540
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,000
It must be his work.

541
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,310
Well, I'm off. Grandma.

542
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,110
Jie, um...

543
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
There is no secret between you and me.

544
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,160
Song Yi came here just now.

545
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,680
I know.

546
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,314
Chen Maidong's ex-girlfriend.

547
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,750
What ex-girlfriend?

548
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,510
She is a trouble.

549
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,480
If Dong had never met her,

550
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,270
he would be much better off
than he is now.

551
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,350
He's doing quite well now.

552
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,070
It has been so long.

553
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,640
Chen Maidong doesn't mind it.

554
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,960
Because he's silly.

555
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:32,550
If it weren't for that girl,

556
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,720
he wouldn't have suffered such trauma.

557
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,790
And yet,

558
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,480
she cheated on him.

559
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,510
Why is she back now?

560
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,240
She is living a wonderful life.

561
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,960
She said she came here
for the new seaside resort.

562
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,750
So, she dropped by to visit us.

563
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,160
I don't need that.

564
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,590
I'm not as kind and soft

565
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,590
as Chen Maidong

566
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,790
who gets nervous
when seeing her crying pitifully.

567
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:02,228
Dong always gets distracted

568
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,070
for days every time after meeting her.

569
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,920
No, not like that.

570
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,400
Jie,

571
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,680
Dong cares about you.

572
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,400
Nothing will happen between them.

573
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,640
I'm just angry

574
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,400
about her.

575
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,590
All right.

576
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,400
Anger is bad for your health.

577
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,830
Grandma,
there is somewhere I need to be.

578
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,160
I will visit you another day.

579
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,200
Jie.

580
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,790
I was just nagging.

581
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,400
Don't take it to heart.

582
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,480
I won't.

583
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,400
Excuse me.

584
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,200
You are not here for business, right?

585
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,880
Hello.

586
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:35,285
I'm waiting for Chen Maidong.

587
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,110
Do you know when he will be free?

588
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,200
Dong went to the seaside resort.

589
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,680
Did he go there for work business?

590
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,830
I guess so.

591
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,228
But he doesn't have shifts today.

592
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,160
Chen Maidong,

593
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,630
we promised to be frank with each other.

594
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,342
Tell me if you are meeting someone
and save us from misunderstandings.

595
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,350
If you dare to lie to me,

596
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,030
just you wait.

597
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,680
Ms. Zhang,

598
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,440
it's me,

599
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,030
Zhuang Jie.

600
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,440
I... I would like to ask
if you still work as a janitor

601
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,942
at the homestay of the seaside resort?

602
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,550
Yes.

603
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,171
Have you seen a guest
named Song Yi these two days?

604
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,960
You know her?

605
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,440
Two... Two of them?

606
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,750
All right, got it. Thank you.

607
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,960
Wang Xixia.

608
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,680
Go on.

609
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,960
Have I told you how much I hate

610
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,920
dramatic cheating scenes?

611
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,230
What's that about?
I'm training the new recruits.

612
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,880
Nothing else.

613
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:08,350
I just hate finding out
that I'm also sophisticated.

614
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,160
I think I don't know

615
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,070
Chen Maidong at all.

616
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,880
You are just overthinking.

617
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,830
Misunderstandings
will drive you two apart

618
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,270
if it's left unsolved.

619
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,790
Still, Chen Maidong's
character is guaranteed.

620
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,257
Don't behave like an impulsive robber.

621
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,880
Zhuang Jie.

622
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,240
Zhuang Jie?

623
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:34,830
Zhuang Jie?

624
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,920
Where was I?

625
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,310
You said salespeople
must act like robbers sometimes.

626
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,000
Right, not only that,

627
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,640
but sometimes, you also
need to be bold and wild.

628
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,510
But you said earlier

629
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,240
we need to be sincere.

630
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,750
Does sincerity contradict these?

631
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,790
Let me add something.

632
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,270
The worst thing about salespeople

633
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,885
is cutting off your customer
mid-sentence.

634
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,350
Why are you looking at me?

635
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,440
Note it down.

636
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,510
Who are you?

637
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,510
Are you Song Yi?

638
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,510
Yes, I am.

639
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,750
Who are you looking for?

640
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,110
You are pregnant.

641
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,200
Are... Are you married?

642
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,720
Hey.

643
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,510
Who are you? What is it to you?

644
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,680
I'm sorry.

645
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,640
I'm Zhuang Jie.

646
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:09,540
Here's your coffee.

647
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,070
Thank you.

648
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,000
You are welcome.

649
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,750
I'm sorry about earlier.

650
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,230
I had a bad moment before I came.

651
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,230
That's why I was rude.

652
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,070
It's fine.

653
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,320
Dong told me about you before.

654
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,550
I was hoping to meet you.

655
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,710
Chen Maidong is so talkative?

656
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,000
As you know,

657
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,320
he is reticent.

658
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,510
After meeting my husband,

659
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,400
we rarely stayed in touch.

660
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,000
So, I think

661
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,840
he talked about you

662
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,000
because you were important

663
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,000
and he wanted me

664
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,150
to feel less guilty.

665
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:05,670
Guilty?

666
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:07,960
Yes.

667
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:13,028
Dong and I have been together
for seven years.

668
00:35:14,142 --> 00:35:16,000
It wasn't because
we were deeply in love,

669
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,885
it was about all about guilt.

670
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,630
My brother is Song Ran.

671
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,670
Chen Maidong's best friend.
