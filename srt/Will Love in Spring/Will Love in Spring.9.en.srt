1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,920
(Chicken is braised for two hours)

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,220
(Free shipping)
Nail that sign firmly.

3
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:23,660
(20% off)
Okay.

4
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,910
(Liaogen Chicken)
And two more coats of paint on the sign.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,399
Don't worry. I have enough paint.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,230
Apply a layer of wax

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,079
- on it.
- Mom.

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,519
They'll promote our Vacuum Chicken.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,079
Already?

10
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:31,960
I'm not ready yet.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,880
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,660
No worries,
they'll gather some materials

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,200
and discuss tomorrow's shooting.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,880
Oh, we'll have a meeting first?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,840
Please, come inside.

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,200
- Okay.
- Thank you, ma'am.

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,960
We'll be counting on you
to promote us online.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,200
Make sure to capture more close-ups

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,320
of the awards on our walls.

20
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,159
Thank you.

21
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:47,960
All right.

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,840
Everyone!

23
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:52,960
Zhuang Jie.

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,600
Zhuang Jie's here.

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,119
Our store

26
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,159
will be ready tomorrow.

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,479
Here.

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,119
Take these 20% discount cards.

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,320
- Great.
- Thank you.

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,740
Come by anytime you want some chicken.

31
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,000
Whatever happens won't affect

32
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,719
Liaogen Chicken's quality and taste.

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,359
It's okay to call our family unlucky.

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,300
But the chicken
didn't do anything to anyone.

35
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,079
Nonsense.

36
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,040
We're all neighbors.

37
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,079
No one will talk.

38
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,959
That's right. Time changes.

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,220
No one believes that nonsense.

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,879
Is every card 20% off?

41
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,280
Then give me two.

42
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:17,879
No problem.

43
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,319
Here you go. You can take three.

44
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,840
Thank you, everyone.

45
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,599
Our newly launched Vacuum Chicken
will be available starting next week,

46
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,519
with a 50% discount.

47
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:27,430
Feel free to order
for your relatives and friends.

48
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,470
We'll cover delivery fees.

49
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,680
Help us spread the word.

50
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,079
Okay!

51
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,040
Thank you.

52
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,159
Good luck with your business.

53
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,599
What a great deal.

54
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,080
Let's get a few more chickens.

55
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,640
=Will Love In Spring=

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,140
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

57
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,100
=Episode 9=

58
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,980
(Understanding Children)

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,879
Isn't it too late for you

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,199
to be reading these books?

61
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,520
Don't disturb me.

62
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,840
I just finished reading

63
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,400
about the dangers of rubber nipples.

64
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,719
This one's about potty training.

65
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,960
Dong's already 30 years old.

66
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,199
You can't expect him

67
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
to start over.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,919
Don't be ridiculous.

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,240
Fine.

70
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,840
Don't waste your energy.

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,479
Help me string these beads.

72
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,759
Or I won't be able
to get your gift done in time

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,960
for your birthday.

74
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,000
My birthday wish this year is to read
all the educational books you have here.

75
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,840
To find out

76
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,840
what went wrong

77
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,879
when we raised Dong.

78
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,680
Why is he so different

79
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,759
from normal people?

80
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,280
You should read more books.

81
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,080
Otherwise,
you'll just keep talking nonsense.

82
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,280
Children are always normal.

83
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,960
It's your mindset that's wrong.

84
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:08,971
Oh, I'm the one that's wrong now, am I?

85
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:10,750
He's a young man in his thirties,

86
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,080
spending all his time
fooling around without a girlfriend.

87
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,420
He goes to work and comes home.

88
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,240
He should just stay single like a monk?

89
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:19,480
And what's so good about getting married
and having children?

90
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,759
You're discriminating against me too.

91
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,319
How can men and women be the same?

92
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,279
Women can live their whole lives
without men.

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,399
But men can't live without women.

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,639
Your argument has too many flaws.

95
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,040
If you say this online,

96
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,439
you'll definitely be bashed.

97
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,079
Is a lonely life

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,240
easy?

99
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,480
By the time he gets to my age,

100
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,480
it'll be too late

101
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,600
for regrets.

102
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,920
And what good did it do you,

103
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,319
fussing and worrying so much?

104
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,959
Are you still

105
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,439
thinking

106
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,879
of Zhuang Jie?

107
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,480
No.

108
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,759
I feel like the back-seat driver.

109
00:04:58,342 --> 00:04:59,600
All my efforts are futile.

110
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,120
That's right.

111
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:06,000
I smell something burnt.

112
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:06,360
Quick!

113
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,800
Go get my medicine!

114
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,519
All right.

115
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,390
If you can create a new remedy
to cure Dong's seriousness,

116
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,800
so he can be as lively
and smart as others,

117
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,079
you can have the rest of my life.

118
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,360
Thanks.

119
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,120
I can't figure out

120
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,639
that grandson of yours.

121
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,920
I can't do anything about it.

122
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,600
Slowly...

123
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,439
Tie him up.

124
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,759
Don't make a sound.

125
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,079
I'm here.

126
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,480
Zhang Hongxu!

127
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,279
Chen Maidong.

128
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,079
Answer me.

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,879
Where's Zhang Hongxu?

130
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,480
He said he was tired

131
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,510
and wanted to experience

132
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,790
what it is like to be a parcel.

133
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,680
Get out!

134
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:15,160
Well? Give me a hand.

135
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,120
Come on.

136
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,199
Come here.

137
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,839
Chen Maidong!

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,920
This is all your fault!

139
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,680
Honey,

140
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:27,630
we've been slaving away half the night.

141
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,620
We want to have some fun.

142
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,279
Fun?

143
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,480
All those chickens
that haven't been tagged

144
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,371
and loaded onto the truck,
and you want to play?

145
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,439
Dear,

146
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,199
don't be upset.

147
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:38,440
It's not good
when we're preparing for pregnancy.

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,680
I...

149
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,000
These chickens

150
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,079
are driving me crazy.

151
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,399
They just keep coming.

152
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,720
And she slashed the prices so low.

153
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,171
I say we need to deal
with crafty merchants like Zhuang Jie.

154
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,040
What nonsense

155
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,759
are you spouting now?

156
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,120
Here.

157
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,040
No, you...

158
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,439
I tell you to read

159
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,160
more books.

160
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,759
Did you? Huh? Did you?

161
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,839
Did you?

162
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:01,457
If we're talking about crafty merchants,

163
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,480
no one can beat you two.

164
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,560
I finally have a night off,

165
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,171
and you drag me here to work for free.

166
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,685
Now you're talking, huh?

167
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:10,080
It's fair for you to do some work.

168
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,720
That's right.

169
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,160
You think you can get out
of kissing Zhuang Jie

170
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,590
at the train station just like that?

171
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:16,142
You're not getting out of this.

172
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,720
Chen Maidong!

173
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,371
Counterattack.

174
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,120
Sooner or later,

175
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,114
I'll show Zhuang Jie
what kind of man you are.

176
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,199
You act like a decent guy in public.

177
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,639
But you're the worst of them all.

178
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
What did I do?

179
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,680
I know all those rotten ideas
are all yours.

180
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,240
My husband is a blockhead
compared to you.

181
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:35,920
In summer, you're here
smashing watermelons,

182
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,190
splattering juice
all over walls.

183
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,360
Have you cleaned the walls?

184
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,240
And in winter, organizing
ice-chunk eating contests at the door.

185
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,759
Are you guys crazy?

186
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:44,690
Why didn't the icicles
pierce through all of you?

187
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Okay, okay, stop...

188
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,759
We'll leave, okay?

189
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:47,879
We're leaving.

190
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:48,759
Let's go.

191
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,428
Why are you laughing?

192
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
Go home and be with your wife and kids

193
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,260
and do something.

194
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,600
You keep coming back to my place.

195
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,990
You think I run a board game room?

196
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,240
Go home if you have a wife.

197
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,279
The bachelor,

198
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,190
you stay here.

199
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:00,885
We've got a lot of work here to be done.

200
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,600
Forget it.

201
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,920
He can't even get a wife.

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What good is he for?

203
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:06,371
Even you're better than him.

204
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,399
How can he compare to me?

205
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,000
Hey, bachelor,

206
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,879
I'm going back to my wife too.

207
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,914
It's the hierarchy.

208
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,839
Give up.

209
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:24,120
(Earlier, I mainly shared with everyone)

210
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:25,600
(about the popularity model.)

211
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,639
(That is,)

212
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,279
(how to use popularity)

213
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:30,430
(to increase weighting
and generate traffic.)

214
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,000
(This is the foundation of e-commerce.)

215
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:34,514
(The requirements are quite high.)

216
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,080
(That's all)

217
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,840
(for today.)

218
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,639
(Take notes.)

219
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,799
(Work hard.)

220
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,600
(That's all. Goodbye.)

221
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,000
Jie,

222
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,600
all the other sellers

223
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,990
have machine-printed delivery slips.

224
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,200
No one writes the slips by hand

225
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,914
(Courier, Delivery Details)
like us anymore!

226
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,039
We don't have all the equipment yet.

227
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,371
Just hold on for two more days.

228
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,600
And you still managed to
sell hundreds of chickens?

229
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,679
Isn't that a good thing?

230
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,919
It means online business is worth doing.

231
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,159
They haven't even
formally promoted us yet.

232
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,228
Just a few words mentioned
during the livestream,

233
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,571
and we've received many orders.

234
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,519
Zhuang Jie, at this rate,

235
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,960
I think we should expand the factory.

236
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,639
My goodness,
my hands are going to fall off.

237
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,519
He Niaoniao,

238
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,879
you get paid for what you do.

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,759
I didn't know

240
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,720
it was so hard.

241
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,480
Only 50 cents a piece.

242
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,159
That's low pay.

243
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,960
Protest.

244
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,440
As long as you don't go on strike.

245
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,759
Name your terms.

246
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,799
Jie,

247
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,519
is Liaogen Chicken
getting an official account?

248
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,759
Of course.

249
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,600
Internet celebrities can help us
attract traffic in the initial stage.

250
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,000
We're going to need
our operations team down the line.

251
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,180
And someone will need to be
in charge of the livestreams?

252
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,320
We'll have to hire professionals
for that.

253
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:48,600
Either way, it won't be you.

254
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,720
You're still a child.

255
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,600
Get back to work.

256
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,960
l know.

257
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,799
But I know our business best.

258
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,000
I can help with the planning

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,720
at least.

260
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,240
No.

261
00:09:59,159 --> 00:09:59,720
You're young.

262
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,360
Don't keep aiming for the limelight.

263
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,759
Jie, see?

264
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,200
Mom always discourages me.

265
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,399
I'll never grow up

266
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,360
to be anything.

267
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,759
Mom,

268
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,142
you should change that habit.

269
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,679
Continue your work.

270
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:18,879
Okay.

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,840
Grandma.

272
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,759
Chicken for breakfast again?

273
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,879
We've had it for days in a row now.
I'm sick of it.

274
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,090
Stop complaining
when you get food on the table.

275
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:45,400
How about you do the cooking?

276
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:47,885
You didn't cook the chicken either.

277
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm spending a little money

278
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,879
to help Jie and her family
through a rough patch.

279
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,057
Got a problem with that?

280
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,840
I wouldn't dare.

281
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,639
You're already a grown-up,

282
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,085
yet you do nothing every day.

283
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,039
This old lady
has to do everything for you.

284
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,759
And you?

285
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:05,514
You just complain
when you open your mouth.

286
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,639
Let's eat.

287
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,800
Come on, let's eat.

288
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,879
Chen Maidong,

289
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,600
something so huge happened
to the Zhuang family,

290
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,360
and you don't even care.

291
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,840
You could've bought something
and gone to see them.

292
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,720
The mother and daughter

293
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,799
not only kept the factory going

294
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:23,257
but also expanded their business.

295
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,559
They're doing even better than before.

296
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,840
They held up the sky
even when it fell on them.

297
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,000
They're real heroines.

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,519
One in a million.

299
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,679
If anyone

300
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,159
could marry

301
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,759
a woman like Jie in their lifetime,

302
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:39,480
they ought to go light incense
at their ancestors' graves.

303
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,039
And you?

304
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,200
You wasted a good deck
of cards dealt to you.

305
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,639
Fine. I won't talk about it anymore.

306
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,759
Let's eat.

307
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,399
What business

308
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,720
did they expand into?

309
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,039
Something about a vacuum chamber.

310
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,960
Pretty advanced stuff.

311
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,399
Vacuum what?

312
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,879
You ask a lot of questions.

313
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,720
Vacuum Chicken.

314
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,399
And something about

315
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,519
doing online business.

316
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,879
All that trendy stuff

317
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,720
must be Jie's idea.

318
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,519
So, she's not leaving?

319
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,971
You've got a lot of questions.

320
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,720
Ask her yourself.

321
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,480
Hey, Zhuang Jie.

322
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,759
Ms. Lin,

323
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,200
keep a close eye on things.

324
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Besides hygiene standards,

325
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,900
safety in production
is more important.

326
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,980
(Handwashing and Sanitisation Area)

327
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,240
All right. You get busy.

328
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,430
I'll look at the live stream.

329
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,759
Okay.

330
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,519
All right. See you.

331
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,639
You're here, Jie.

332
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,200
Good work.

333
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,919
Hey, Jie.

334
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,679
Good work.

335
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,240
Everything's ready, Jie.

336
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,480
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's get started.

337
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:57,639
Hello, everyone.

338
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,159
Welcome to my livestream.

339
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,799
Today, I'm introducing

340
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,919
Liaogen Chicken.

341
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,030
One portion of chicken liver.
Six pairs of chicken wings.

342
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,200
Here you go.

343
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,080
Thank you.

344
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,279
Your daughter

345
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,279
is really something.

346
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
She's so capable.

347
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,720
She's all right.

348
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,279
What else can we do?

349
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
It's just us now.

350
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,519
Take care.

351
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,279
I've paid.

352
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,039
All right.

353
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,399
How are your legs?

354
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,549
Everyone in town

355
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,885
has been watching you zooming around.

356
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
It's like teleportation.

357
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,320
I'm fine.

358
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,519
I drive an electric scooter.

359
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,720
You drive like you're flying.

360
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,240
That's not safe.

361
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,320
Maybe we should buy a used truck.

362
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:37,870
Neither of us has a driving license.

363
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,890
Zhuang Yan won't come back.

364
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,919
Who's going to drive it?

365
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,720
That's it. I'll make a few more trips.

366
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,120
Then we'll hire a delivery person.

367
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,314
You focus on
livestream and shipping.

368
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,960
Who was the one who taught me

369
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,159
"It's not just the chicken

370
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,000
we deliver in town,

371
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,080
it's the human touch"?

372
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:52,085
It's not the same
if we hire someone else to do it.

373
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,080
Doing chores makes me remind

374
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,571
of the good of having a man around.

375
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,759
It's one thing that I don't have one.

376
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,171
But you won't find one either.

377
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:01,600
This conversation
is veering towards dangerous territory.

378
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,960
Let's not discuss this further.

379
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,057
Let me stop you there.

380
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,000
You'll work yourself to death.

381
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,399
This is nothing.

382
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,480
I'm just working out.

383
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,960
Wang Xixia even envies me.

384
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,639
Says I naturally have low body fat.

385
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,720
Speaking of Xixia,

386
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,639
they said a while ago

387
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,679
at the train station

388
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,559
there was a fashionable girl

389
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,240
with Chen Maidong
from the funeral parlor,

390
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,639
your classmate.

391
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,799
What about them?

392
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,639
They kissed passionately.

393
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,039
Kissed...

394
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,679
passionately?

395
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,879
Do you even know
what a passionate kiss is?

396
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,080
I do.

397
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,639
Just hearing about it makes me blush.

398
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,399
Well...

399
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,759
But they said the girl was very stylish.

400
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,600
And she works in a big city.
Is it Xixia?

401
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,440
It's not her.

402
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,440
How do you know it's not her?

403
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,559
Have you heard about this too?

404
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,000
No, but...

405
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
She's been going on arranged dates

406
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,960
in Shanghai.

407
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,000
How could it be her?

408
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,600
Who could it be then?

409
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,120
Chen Maidong looks like

410
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,559
a good, mature boy.

411
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,720
It's probably the girl

412
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,759
who has no shame.

413
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,960
Why do you care?

414
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,919
They kissed. So what?

415
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,720
Don't go talking bad
behind someone's back.

416
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,320
Who is?

417
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,720
They brought it up,

418
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,799
so I listened.

419
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,279
As if I like to spread this around.

420
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:21,919
Give me a hand.

421
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,600
I'll do it.

422
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:27,480
We're having hot pot again tonight.

423
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,080
Buy some spinach on your way back.

424
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:32,120
Can we have something else?
Hot pot every day.

425
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
He Niaoniao is sick of it.

426
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,000
You get food. Don't complain.

427
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,440
All this work has worn me out.

428
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,890
Who has the time and energy to cook?

429
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,919
I wish I had a secret housekeeper.

430
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,120
I'll handle that.

431
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,679
Okay.

432
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,919
Here you go.

433
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm starving...

434
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,960
I'm starving...

435
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,119
I'm starving...

436
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,880
Let's have instant noodles.

437
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,720
- Sure.
- Sure.

438
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,359
Throw in a sausage.

439
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,240
And an egg.

440
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,440
Okay.

441
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:46,920
What's the matter?

442
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,150
Go wash your hands.
It's time for dinner.

443
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,319
My goodness!

444
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,119
Heavens!

445
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,920
Braised pork, shrimp, and fish!

446
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,240
- Xixia!
- Wang Xixia.

447
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,880
Are you the secret housekeeper?

448
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,319
You're a lifesaver!

449
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,359
It's New Year when Xixia comes back.

450
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,319
We must have a drink.

451
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,839
Okay.

452
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,160
Why didn't tell me?

453
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,990
It's a huge surprise.

454
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,680
All right.

455
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,039
You're going to
have a drink with me tonight.

456
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:08,519
No problem.

457
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,759
An entire spread of fatty foods.

458
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,780
What are you going to eat?

459
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,200
Are you crazy?

460
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,790
Who will stick to a diet
when they're home?

461
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,720
Eat them!

462
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,440
Drink it!

463
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,390
What am I going to drink?

464
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,000
Soup.

465
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,880
Here.

466
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,160
Cheers!

467
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
You're not young anymore!

468
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,519
Don't just gulp it down!

469
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,119
I'm only 73.

470
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,200
Little girl.

471
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,119
Only 73?

472
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,480
I'm 84.

473
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,720
We'll go to Yama in due time.

474
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:38,771
Touch wood!

475
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,400
Fine.

476
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,920
You spoiled me.

477
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,759
No old lady would have their birthday

478
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,799
like I do.

479
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,640
What's the difference with an old lady?

480
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,759
Some wrinkles won't make you worthless.

481
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,279
This is

482
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,680
completely unnecessary.

483
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,400
I know very well

484
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,000
what's inside.

485
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,319
This thing looks erotic

486
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,119
in the dim light of the night.

487
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,799
Are you serious?

488
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,359
This is my lucky color.

489
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,000
I would never pull a prank on you.

490
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,279
We are Scorpio.

491
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,799
This is who we are.

492
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,799
Remember to put it on every day.

493
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,839
You might just get lucky.

494
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,359
I can't wear it, then.

495
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,720
Dong can have it instead.

496
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,599
Our birthday is on the same day.

497
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,119
He is also Scorpio.

498
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,960
If you have good luck,

499
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,079
your grandson will have it too.

500
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,400
You have a point.

501
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,079
If I do well in life,

502
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,599
it will do him some good.

503
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,640
Dong has a tough life.

504
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,839
His parents failed him.

505
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,759
The divorce was a disaster.

506
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,200
It's no wonder

507
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,680
he was traumatized.

508
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,119
Oh my.

509
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,319
When we celebrated your birthday,

510
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,440
you said Dong was getting dull

511
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,279
because of Song Yi.

512
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,279
Now that they broke up,

513
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,559
you're blaming others.

514
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,279
She was responsible in some way.

515
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,720
Dong didn't meet

516
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,640
the right one.

517
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,319
You are a year older now.

518
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,079
You're a mature old lady.

519
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,440
Stop complaining all the time.

520
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,039
Fine.

521
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:10,640
Go on.

522
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,279
Blow the candles.

523
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,920
Make a wish.

524
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,400
Happy birthday!

525
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,759
Happy birthday!

526
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:30,799
Cut the cake.

527
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,079
Wait.

528
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,440
I need to use the toilet.

529
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,799
Everything here is nice.

530
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,799
But after a long sit,

531
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,920
my legs hurt when I stand up.

532
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,519
Be careful.

533
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,680
Sit down.

534
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,000
Whenever I see these pictures,

535
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,480
the urge to use the toilet
gets even stronger.

536
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,880
You should

537
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,839
steer clear of what you shouldn't see.

538
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,599
Then, you'll have an ease of mind.

539
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,640
I don't get it.

540
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,200
Why must a man

541
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,480
dress like this?

542
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,279
Xixia.

543
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,680
Why are you on a break as well?

544
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:20,759
I thought

545
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,559
you and Zhuang Jie

546
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,440
were the model employees.

547
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,640
A higher-up from France

548
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,119
parachuted into our company.

549
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,880
He bosses us around.

550
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:30,799
Annoying.

551
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,279
It's better not to see him again.

552
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,799
Yes.

553
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,359
We never put up

554
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,880
with mistreatment in any form.

555
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,680
Are you

556
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,200
spending your New Year here?

557
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,519
My brother asked me to get a Visa.

558
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,680
He wants me in Canada

559
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,920
to check on my nephew.

560
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:46,920
He's three

561
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,680
and still hasn't met me.

562
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,559
What about your dad?

563
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Are you and your brother

564
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,759
never going to see him again?

565
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,240
We only met our mom,

566
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,319
and not our dad.

567
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,319
Now,

568
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,720
our mom is gone.

569
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,200
I'll consider he never existed.

570
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,519
Not all parents

571
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,799
deserve to be loved.

572
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,799
People have children

573
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,839
out of selfishness,

574
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,160
not good karma.

575
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,720
If the parents are good,

576
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,880
they can have some attention.

577
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,350
But if they are not worthy,

578
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,839
stay away from them.

579
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,799
They are bad luck.

580
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,759
Well said, my godmother.

581
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,519
Well said.

582
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,799
Always full of surprises.

583
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,880
However,

584
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,079
you can still

585
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,319
choose the right partner.

586
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,799
You need to plan for your future.

587
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:31,480
Oh no.

588
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,600
Here she goes again.

589
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,440
She isn't wrong.

590
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,920
You need real efforts to find true love.

591
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,160
Don't just wait for one

592
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,119
to knock on your door.

593
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,759
That's not dignity, you're lazy.

594
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:43,640
Cheers.

595
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,240
Mom.

596
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,839
Don't fall for Wang Xixia's fancy words.

597
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,319
She may look smart,

598
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,480
but she is hopeless
when it comes to men.

599
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:53,000
Girls always complain

600
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,160
after a blind date.

601
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,400
But her?

602
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,480
She is fine with all of her dates

603
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,759
and thinks she can marry them.

604
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,440
Xixia, that is not good.

605
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,839
You know what?

606
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,039
She ruined my chances

607
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,960
with all of my potential
future husbands.

608
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:10,550
Last time, there was a guy

609
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,799
in the financial industry.

610
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,119
He claimed to be 175 cm tall,

611
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,920
but he had insoles.

612
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,839
Don't height-shame the man.

613
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,079
It's all genetic.

614
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,359
What matters is the character.

615
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,279
Yeah.

616
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,039
But Xixia,

617
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,720
the height does affect

618
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,759
the future generation.

619
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,240
I also met a guy

620
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
who had a cinema.

621
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,039
He never stopped talking.

622
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,079
He wouldn't shut up

623
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,589
throughout the entire meal.

624
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,885
Didn't that give you a headache?

625
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,480
A man shouldn't talk that much.

626
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,200
Okay.

627
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,279
Fine.

628
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,559
Months ago, I met a guy

629
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,559
who was an artist.

630
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,440
He drew paintings.

631
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:39,839
Never get an artist!

632
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:41,480
Don't bring another Zhuang Yan home.

633
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,519
It's misery.

634
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,359
Wang Xixia,

635
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,599
admit it.

636
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,319
You have a bad taste.

637
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:48,839
But I think

638
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,319
life can still go on otherwise.

639
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,240
With love,

640
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,559
we can make it work.

641
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:53,599
Don't be so sure.

642
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,680
Fate plays a big part in a relationship.

643
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,640
Yeah.

644
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,440
But we can't be too picky.

645
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,039
Life is tough.

646
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Life is so tough.

647
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,839
There is a female celebrity I like.

648
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,720
During an interview,

649
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,680
she was asked,

650
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,359
"How do you see me?"

651
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,039
Her answer?

652
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,880
"I don't."

653
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,559
She earned my respect instantly.

654
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,400
I don't think I've met

655
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,319
a lot of good men.

656
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,160
I have no idea how to pick.

657
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,000
True enough.

658
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,319
I had two marriages

659
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,799
and a son.

660
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,519
I still think

661
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,160
I know nothing about men.

662
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,279
Hello?

663
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,279
We are closed.

664
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,319
No more deliveries.

665
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,400
And you are...

666
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,960
Grandma Lin?

667
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,359
Grandma Chen?

668
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,680
Welcome, Jie.

669
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,079
Sorry,

670
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,680
the food went cold on the way.

671
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,920
You should heat it up.

672
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:17,799
Never mind.

673
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,319
We're having it tomorrow.

674
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,200
Sorry, you have to make the trip.

675
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,519
How much is this?

676
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:23,440
It's on the house.

677
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,240
Grandma Chen talks about you a lot.

678
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,079
You made us

679
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,279
little cakes the other day.

680
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:27,839
We're even.

681
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:29,920
Jie.

682
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,279
I ordered the food

683
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,359
so you could be here

684
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,799
to pick Grandma Chen up

685
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,319
and send her home.

686
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,599
It's her birthday.

687
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,839
She had a little alcohol.

688
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,759
I can't let her

689
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,079
walk home on her own.

690
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Dong is busy.

691
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,759
I had no choice but to

692
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,000
ask you for a favor.

693
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,000
Grandma,

694
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,000
if you ever need help,

695
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,079
don't place an order.

696
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:48,960
I am only

697
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
one call away.

698
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,079
See?

699
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,720
Jie

700
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,039
is the finest girl around.

701
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:56,480
All right.

702
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,039
I'll send her home.

703
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,400
Are you drunk?

704
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,839
No, not me.

705
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:03,680
Not me.

706
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,160
Call me if you need anything.

707
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,119
Grandma.

708
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Happy birthday.

709
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,559
You should've told me.

710
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,640
I would've prepared

711
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,880
a present.

712
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,559
I have no need for that.

713
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,880
All I need is to see you.

714
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,519
How much did you two drink?

715
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,519
Why do you care?

716
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,440
Yeah.

717
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,759
Grandma,

718
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,240
is this a new bracelet?

719
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,480
It's pretty.

720
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,000
Grandma Lin

721
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,799
gave me this as a birthday present.

722
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,960
This is my lucky color.

723
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,799
Looks nice.

724
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,759
Why isn't Chen Maidong

725
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,640
with you?

726
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,200
The better way to put it

727
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,920
is that his grandma

728
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,720
never celebrated his birthday.

729
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,480
Same birthday?

730
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:01,839
What are the odds?

731
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,880
In the past,

732
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,079
we celebrated it together.

733
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,640
But somehow, I didn't even receive

734
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,119
a call from him.

735
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,759
He's probably too busy.

736
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:15,799
So,

737
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,119
I brought him a cake.

738
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,400
We'll finish it tomorrow.

739
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm making it up to him.

740
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,480
Grandma.

741
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,742
I'll deliver the cake.

742
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,880
It's his 30th birthday.

743
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,799
He has to at least

744
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,839
have a piece of cake.

745
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,359
You mean it?

746
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,519
I entrusted her

747
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,799
to you!

748
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,720
How did this happen?

749
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,920
I want my daughter back!

750
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,039
Mom!

751
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,359
She never stopped crying.

752
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,519
She was sick

753
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,039
for a very long time!

754
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,920
Hu Liyan!

755
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,759
You're a heartless wretch!

756
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,119
What did you do?

757
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,590
Why would my sister abandon her kid

758
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,240
and take her life?

759
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,799
I didn't force her to commit suicide!

760
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,440
Right?

761
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,119
I have nothing to gain from her death!

762
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,200
My daughter was only 36!

763
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,480
Had she not met

764
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,920
a good-for-nothing like you,

765
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,720
she would still be...

766
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,200
Mom!

767
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,920
Stop fighting!

768
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:40,030
We're calling the police!

769
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,039
Calm down! Stop fighting!

770
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,200
Hit him!

771
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:43,839
Stop it!

772
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,359
Beat him!

773
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,319
Beat him up!

774
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,119
Stop fighting!

775
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,942
Stop fighting!

776
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,559
Back off!

777
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Stop it! Stop!

778
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,230
- What?
- Leave!

779
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,400
Wait! Are you out of your mind?

780
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,519
You'll get beaten up!

781
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,880
You were tough in school!

782
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,799
Stay out of this. Go!

783
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,799
Stop it!

784
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,319
Calm down!

785
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,200
Only I get to hit women,

786
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,759
not the other way around.

787
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,279
Don't make me hurt you.

788
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,079
Brother.

789
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,480
Why are you here?

790
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,119
You got some helpers.

791
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,119
I didn't know

792
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,720
you had a reputation in Nanping.

793
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,079
Watch your mouth.

794
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,000
Your wife just passed away.

795
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,839
Is this how you should behave?

796
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,759
Do you even have a heart?

797
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,480
Brother.

798
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,279
Brother...

799
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:18,200
I apologize on behalf of my cousin.

800
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,270
I can take it from here.

801
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,519
Stop his bleeding.

802
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,480
Don't stuff the nose.

803
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,480
Lower his head.

804
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,839
Get an ice pack.

805
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:41,680
Feng Xilun.

806
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,519
Handle it.

807
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:46,720
Everyone, calm down.

808
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,359
We can talk in peace.

809
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,880
Has it been ten minutes?

810
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
You're suffocating me.

811
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,628
The bleeding stopped.

812
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,839
Get up. Your legs went numb.

813
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,079
My legs are doing better

814
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,119
than your brain.

815
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,119
I work here.

816
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,119
What else could I do?

817
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,079
But I heard you threaten

818
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,039
to hit the hooligan.

819
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,720
Because he wanted to hurt you.

820
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,839
Forget it.

821
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,440
If your grandma is right,

822
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,519
a little bleeding

823
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,079
might be your lucky color.

824
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,359
Nonsense.

825
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:30,920
Chen Maidong,

826
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,960
happy birthday.

827
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,079
I think I smashed it just now.

828
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,000
You want this?

829
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,359
Thank you.

830
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,359
What for?

831
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:44,759
For the cake

832
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,640
or

833
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,559
for saving your neck?

834
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,480
Both.

835
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,880
Don't be smug.

836
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,160
Your grandma asked me
to send this cake.

837
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,720
I came on her behalf.

838
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,759
I should thank her.

839
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,839
I wish her a happy birthday.

840
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,480
She is happy.

841
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,680
She had a drink

842
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,799
and got a present.

843
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,640
Really?

844
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:07,310
Did you not drink as well?

845
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,759
Can you smell it?

846
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,000
Go away.

847
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:14,510
You're taking my breath away.

848
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,039
That won't be

849
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,240
because of the alcohol,

850
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,285
it's because of my beautiful face.

851
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,799
I think you are drunk.

852
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,519
People might think

853
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,759
you're here to stir up trouble.

854
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,559
You can put it that way.

855
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,559
How else can I

856
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,759
punch that guy in my condition?

857
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,319
No one has ever done that.

858
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,799
Have some cake.

859
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,171
Make this trip worthwhile.

860
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,599
I can still taste the blood.

861
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,319
I'll take a pass.

862
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,720
Take a bite.

863
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:45,519
No.

864
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,079
Yes.

865
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,240
Who is this?

866
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,839
The woman who died
was his mother.

867
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,279
She's in there.

868
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,960
The driver fell asleep.

869
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,400
Text me when you reach home.

870
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,039
Chen Maidong.

871
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,239
What present would you want?

872
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,719
It is your 30th birthday.

873
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,320
Well...

874
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,719
Buy me some clothes.

875
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,360
I'm needed here.

876
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,239
I can't leave.

877
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Can't you shop online?

878
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,360
Nope.

879
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,199
So be it.

880
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:28,070
You asked for a lot.

881
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,760
You made quite a greedy wish.

882
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,559
I'll pay.

883
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,159
Sure.

884
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,457
I'll keep the change.

885
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,199
What do you want?

886
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:39,030
I'll send you the pictures.

887
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,159
Sir?

888
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,760
Sir?

889
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,639
Time to go.

890
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,519
Go inside.

891
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,514

this kind of trouble at work?

897
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,360
It's the first in our town.

898
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:39,880
It's usually the elderly

who die of natural causes.

900
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,480

Wouldn't hurt to know.

904
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,079
I had to sew
a dismembered body back together.

905
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,159
I went to horrible crime scenes.

906
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,559
The worst of them all

907
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,679
was a person who died in the basement.

908
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:03,920
It was summer.

It's late.

938
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,039
I was talking to Chen Maidong.

The first three episodes were thrilling.

944
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,519
Highly decomposed body.

These morticians

947
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,199
have to work days on end.

948
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,199
The hazmat suit was drenched.

00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:24,800
This job requires great
mental and physical strength.

950
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,840
Not a job for the faint-hearted.

951
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,960
It's sensible to think.

952
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,320
Don't give me that look.

953
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,360
My mom just interrogated me.

954
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,119
She wanted to know

955
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,079
if I was the girl

956
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,000
who was smooching
Chen Maidong at the station.

957
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,485
What did you tell her?

958
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,840
I denied it, of course.

959
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,320
First of all,

960
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,880
I wasn't that fashionable.

961
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,199
Secondly,

962
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,719
I wasn't that open-minded.

963
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:52,920
Thirdly,

964
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,800
I would never go near him.

965
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,559
Someone could eat me alive
for such a sin.

966
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,760
Get lost.

967
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,559
Let's get to the point, Zhuang Jie.

968
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,280
Are you in love with Chen Maidong?

969
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,470
(Great Person: By clothes for me.
Note: Height 185cm, weight 65KG)

970
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,360
What's the matter? Are you two planning

971
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,920
to open a fashion store?

972
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,480
Don't be so nosy.

973
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,400
Ten pieces of underwear?

974
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,119
Is he serious?

975
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,719
Are we close enough
that I can buy him underwear?

976
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,039
Underwear?

977
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Listen to this.

978
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,360
I'm busy. Be serious.

979
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,840
Judging by the voice,
he is wearing a mask.

980
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,119
I guess it's another busy night.

981
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,480
Zhuang Jie,

982
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,519
you're hopeless.

983
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,599
It's not about me.

984
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,559
Chen Maidong

985
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,840
is doing perfectly fine.

986
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,559
What do you mean?

987
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,679
Is he not into you?

988
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,239
I think so.

989
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:07,559
At least he's not that into me.

990
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,199
He would've said so otherwise.

991
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,159
How else do you want him to put it?

992
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,600
He asked you to get him underwear.

993
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,679
So, do you think

994
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,440
he sees me as a woman?

995
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,360
Fair enough.

996
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,440
What's the problem

997
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,440
with these men?

998
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:23,840
Never mind,

999
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,599
I'm going back to Shanghai.

1000
00:40:26,514 --> 00:40:28,110
It'd be troublesome if we were in love.

1001
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,960
I treat him like a friend I can talk to.

1002
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:37,840
Zhuang Jie.

1003
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,199
I think

1004
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,039
Ji Tong hasn't moved on from you.

1005
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,639
Forget it.

1006
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,280
The best thing about me

1007
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,360
is I know my own worth.

1008
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:47,960
I mean it.

1009
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:48,719
I...

1010
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:50,030
On the day I came back,

1011
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,199
I barely talked to him.

1012
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,679
I told him you had a boyfriend.

1013
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,519
And?

1014
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,840
And I sent him

1015
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,840
the picture of you kissing

1016
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,440
Chen Maidong.

1017
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,599
Are you serious?

1018
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,840
I wanted to get back at him.

1019
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,719
I think he still

1020
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,599
cares about you.

1021
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,760
Not my concern.

1022
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,199
You moved on?

1023
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,400
Why would I lie about it?

1024
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,559
Good to hear that.

1025
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,440
We are still unsure of

1026
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,920
what we are looking for,

1027
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,440
At least we have to know

1028
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,719
what we should avoid.

1029
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,039
And you know the answer?

1030
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,119
You're sloppy.

1031
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,000
Listen up.

1032
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,320
I can tell the differences.

1033
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,960
The guy from the last blind date

1034
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,280
was totally someone I should avoid.

1035
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,679
That's rare.

1036
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,559
That man was in his 30s.

1037
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:32,039
He claimed to be from
a family of TCM practitioners.

1038
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,639
But he was so over the top.

1039
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,280
He had a whole entourage

1040
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,960
as if he were a big shot.

1041
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,239
He reminded me of my dad.

1042
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,920
And you know what his name was?

1043
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,280
Brother Cui.

1044
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,119
Who would have that name?

1045
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,280
I came across a post online.

1046
00:41:49,771 --> 00:41:51,150
Someone was called "Lightning Ball".

1047
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,085
It's a real name.

1048
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,000
Don't interrupt.

1049
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,000
You know what was the worst part?

1050
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,239
Halfway through the date,

1051
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,800
he said he was into me.

1052
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,039
He said my look and elegance

1053
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,320
reminded him of his ex-wife a lot.

1054
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,760
Who would say that?

1055
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,519
Unbelievable.

1056
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,519
Is there an underlying rule
to blind dates?

1057
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,519
He shouldn't go on blind dates
unless he knows the rule.

1058
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
He said I looked like his ex-wife.

1059
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,280
He looked like my deadbeat dad.

1060
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,519
I felt like punching him.

1061
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,519
Had I been tougher,

1062
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,800
I would've smashed
the glass in his face.

1063
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,039
How did you get

1064
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,679
such an annoying blind date?

1065
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,119
I'm curious.

1066
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,719
What's wrong with you now?

1067
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,719
I speaking from

1068
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,000
my personal experience.

1069
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,400
Some men are
literally a different species.

1070
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:42,480
True.

1071
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,280
I wonder what went wrong

1072
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,679
with their minds.

1073
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,679
Lightning?

1074
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,559
Ball!

1075
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,320
Lightning Ball!

1076
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,400
Cui...

1077
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:57,559
Brother Cui!

1078
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:41,159
Hello?

1079
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,719
Ride safe.

1080
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,400
Don't overtake the hearse.

1081
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:47,920
That's your vehicle?

1082
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,840
I didn't see it.

1083
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:49,800
It's okay.

1084
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:51,639
I'll let it slide.

1085
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,199
Don't insult me.

1086
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,000
I didn't see it.

1087
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,159
But I'm not insensible.

1088
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,519
All right.

1089
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,440
I'm hanging up.

1090
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Focus on driving.

1091
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,199
Wait.

1092
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,320
Is there a reason

1093
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,840
I can't overtake a hearse?

1094
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,039
Is it bad luck?

1095
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,360
Now you're being insensible.

1096
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
Well, enlighten me.

1097
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,559
The vehicle is now empty.

1098
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,639
If we are at work,

1099
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:16,199
the deceased comes first.

1100
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,639
Make way.

1101
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,679
Sorry.

1102
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,000
I'll keep this in mind.

1103
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,371
You learn from mistakes.

1104
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:27,360
That's a good habit.

1105
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:29,880
So...

1106
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,171
Aren't you going somewhere?

1107
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,599
I'll go.

1108
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,280
But I have to settle the things at home.

1109
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,079
Okay, bye.

1110
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,400
That's rude.

1111
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,199
Should I pull over?

1112
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,480
Pull over?

1113
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,519
What for?

1114
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:56,000
So you two can talk.

1115
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,920
I can't believe what you just said.

1116
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:02,599
I almost mistook you for Feng Xilun.

1117
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:05,760
I can't stand it

1118
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:07,428
when you don't speak your mind.

1119
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:08,657
Get rid of this habit.

1120
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:14,239
Chen Maidong.

1121
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:16,280
Can't you finish the talk in one go?

1122
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,519
Ji Tong?
