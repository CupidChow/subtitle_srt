(Prosperity)

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,480
(Jin Village)
(The first time I learned about death)

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,820
(Jin Village)
(was at my dad's funeral.)

4
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,350
(My dad has nine siblings,)

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,260
(giving birth to over forty children.)

6
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,950
(So, on that day,
I met countless relatives.)

7
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,500
(After paying respect to my dad,)

8
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,990
(I turned around and saw
the faces with a similar look.)

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,540
(I almost burst out laughing.
But, I managed to hold it in.)

10
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,070
(Even I was at a young age,)

11
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,110
(I knew that it was inappropriate
to laugh when others were crying.)

12
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,620
(Since then,
every time I walk down the street,)

13
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,870
(I always size up those strangers,)

14
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,510
(guessing where the people
who look like them have gone.)

15
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,620
(People desperately reproduce offspring,
then they are separated,)

16
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:37,150
(and eventually they reunite at funerals
because of their blood ties.)

17
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,900
(That's so miraculous.)

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,790
(Even if they marry outsiders
and mix different blood,)

19
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,060
(they can't get rid of
the original appearance of a family.)

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,390
Are you the emergency
contact person for the patient?

21
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,630
Yes, I am.

22
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,670
How is her condition?

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,742
She just got transferred out
of the Intensive Care Unit.

24
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,028
Her condition is relatively stable.

25
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,510
There'll be a few more checks later.

26
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,942
We'll observe her for twenty-four hours
before we further discuss.

27
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,670
Thank you.

28
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,630
It's nothing. Go in and take a look.

=Episode 18=

32
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:30,057
Mom.

33
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,420
Mom, please wake up. Mom!

34
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,940
Mom. Mom! Mom.

35
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,940
Family members are not allowed in.

36
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,730
Please stay outside.

37
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,710
Please save my mom.

38
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,910
Mom, stay strong!
I'll be waiting outside for you.

39
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,340
(In Operation)

40
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,500
Dr, please tell me why my mom
suddenly became like this today?

41
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,680
She just has a common
heart disease, isn't she?

42
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,780
The patient has already entered there.
Please be at ease.

43
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,030
The doctors in the operation are

44
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,940
the most professional
in our hospital. Don't worry.

45
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,910
Professional?

46
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,590
My dad couldn't make it through
the surgery half a year ago

47
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,610
in your operation theatre!

48
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,990
Can you please calm down yourself?

49
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:24,180
Are you looking down at me?

50
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,300
Please stay calm.

51
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,470
Don't bluff.

52
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,180
I tell you, none of you
should think of bullying me.

53
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,230
Hedgehog.

54
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,790
Let go of me.

55
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,600
Please cool down.

56
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,500
I tell you, if anything happens
to my mom today,

57
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,030
I will never let you off the hook.

58
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,830
Got it? Did you hear me?

59
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,230
I'm talking to you.

60
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,980
Dr. Fang, are you alright?

61
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,200
Let me get you up.

62
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,380
Hedgehog.

63
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,030
Please stay awake.

64
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,540
Chen Maidong.

65
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:10,860
My...

66
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,685
My dad has passed away.

67
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,790
I can't afford to lose my mom.

68
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,110
I beg you to help me beg them
to save my mom.

69
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,150
I'm begging you.

70
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,110
I'm begging you.

71
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,860
I'm begging you.

72
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,420
Mom. We've been eating dumplings
too often at home.

73
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,480
You do once,
and keep a ton of it in the fridge.

74
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,742
And, we eat it for a whole year.

75
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,030
Eating whatever is provided
is the basic courtesy for children.

76
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,860
How kind my brother is!

77
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,830
Just having it without any effort made.

78
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,270
Don't sow discord again.

79
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
Me and your brother take turns
taking care of Grandma Chen.

80
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,860
Finally, he has some time
doing his own thing.

81
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,230
Now he can only
relieve stress through arts.

82
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,860
How's Maidong?

83
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:10,620
He told me that
Grandma Lin is stable now.

84
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,590
But, Chen Maidong must be
having a tough time.

85
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,860
He's anxious all day long.

86
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,740
He is just too kind.
This isn't easy for him.

87
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,620
Dong is someone
who faces death every day.

88
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,150
Shouldn't he be stronger than us?

89
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,180
That's all nonsense.

90
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,590
He used to handle it for other people.

91
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,980
But, this time it's sending off
someone close like his own grandma.

92
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,790
It's not comparable.

93
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,670
But he doesn't let me
help with anything.

94
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,230
All I can do now is try my best
to make Grandma Chen happy.

95
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,350
Luckily, she doesn't know anything.

96
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,300
You guys are really...

97
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,380
I don't know if you're smart or foolish.

98
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:48,330
They've been sisters
for half a lifetime.

99
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,150
And, now they don't even
receive a video call.

100
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,350
How could it be possible
that Grandma Chen wouldn't feel it?

101
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,350
But, I think Grandma is doing alright.
She seems quite happy.

102
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,500
That's when you're around.

103
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,150
Perhaps you guys think
you're protecting her.

104
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,285
But, she is actually the one
who is protecting you.

105
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,740
You know, ever since my dad passed away,

106
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,400
my mom hasn't been able
to heal from that.

107
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,670
And, I finally decided
to be a filial son,

108
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,150
arranging for my mom to go on a trip.

109
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,430
She was so happy.
She couldn't wait for it.

110
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,950
She prepared eagerly,
telling everyone about it.

111
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,660
Saying it's all because of me,
so that she can spend luxuriously.

112
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,020
But just before boarding the flight,
her heart disease suddenly relapsed.

113
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,710
But as her son,

114
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,780
I never knew she had this illness.

115
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:00,350
My mom has been in the hospital
for so long.

116
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,190
She never let anyone worry about her.

117
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,900
She's always been so tough.

118
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,020
The attending doctor told

119
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,070
her health indicators
were getting better.

120
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,710
But today...

121
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,660
Today, all of a sudden...

122
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,380
She's not doing well.

123
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,860
They haven't given up treatment yet.

124
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,550
How could you give up first?

125
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,830
Dong,

126
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,310
I'm scared.

127
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,550
Do you know how much I wish I could
replace my mom there?

128
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,900
Since childhood,

129
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,430
I've never let them
not worry about me even a day.

130
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,485
They gave birth to me with such
a strong body, but I'm so useless.

131
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:53,971
I should be the one who faces death,
shouldn't it be me?

132
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,470
Shouldn't it be me?

133
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,620
Hedgehog,

134
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,590
since they gave you
such a resilient body,

135
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,685
you shouldn't make them disappointed.

136
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,057
Once you get through this,

137
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,590
no matter what you do,

138
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:24,228
or if you want to fight,

139
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:27,600
I'll be right there with you.

140
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,470
Grandma Shen,

141
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:53,542
my mom asked me to carry
this box of water for you.

142
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,900
I put it here.

143
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,590
Um, if you need any help in the future,

144
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,830
just call me anytime.

145
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,780
Thank you.

146
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,350
Grandma!

147
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,828
Why are you here? It's so far from home.

148
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:10,700
You've put the water here,
you can leave now.

149
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,740
Wait, Zhuang Jie has just
called me looking for you.

150
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,730
Why are you hiding here?

151
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,590
Go back.

152
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,660
Weren't you looking down on
the gang of old ladies in Jin Village?

153
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,590
Nonsense. Go away.

154
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,620
(Great Man)

155
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,020
Chen Maidong,
you haven't talked to me for days.

156
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,780
Are you especially busy?

157
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,230
We've all been worried about you.

158
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,070
Are you alright? Are you eating well?

159
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,190
Do you have time to sleep?

160
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,085
You don't let me
have the chance to speak.

161
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,660
I'm fine. Are you all okay?

162
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,657
We're all good.

163
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:58,190
Zhuan Yan and I take turns visiting
your grandma every day.

164
00:11:58,628 --> 00:11:59,942
That must be tiring for you both.

165
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:03,142
Don't talk about useless things.
Let's change to some sweet topic.

166
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,660
I miss you.

167
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,590
I miss you too.

168
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,380
Take care of yourself.

169
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,020
Any progress with Grandma Lin?

170
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,780
Should we prepare ourselves?

171
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:40,314
What should we prepare?

172
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,140
What kind of preparation is right?

173
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,350
Chen Maidong, it's already a miracle

174
00:12:49,657 --> 00:12:51,260
that Grandma Lin has lasted until today.

175
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,380
For elderly surgical patients,
when it comes to resuscitation,

176
00:12:57,085 --> 00:12:58,830
they have to have
their trachea cut open,

177
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,740
punctures made, administered pressors,

178
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,660
placed on an invasive ventilator,

179
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,470
and undergo external chest compressions.

180
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,110
Each step is very painful.

181
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,780
I understand.

182
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,830
Do you really not need me
to accompany you?

183
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,190
No need. You take care of my grandma.

184
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,000
They're looking for me.
I need to get back there now.

185
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:36,655
(Pan)

186
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,620
Hello.

187
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,980
Are you sure?

188
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,660
Did she go again?

189
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,620
Okay. I'm heading there now.
Send me your location.

190
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,900
Ten minutes.

191
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,830
Grandma.

192
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,980
How's it?

193
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,740
If you think you're lacking,
who else is competent?

194
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,950
This is different from my usual job.
I have little confidence.

195
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,110
I'm just grateful to be alive
to enjoy your service.

196
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,620
It's my honor!

197
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,830
Please don't say that.

198
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,830
As long as you get better soon,
I'll do anything for you.

199
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,470
Dong,

200
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,230
sorry to trouble you.

201
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,020
Grandma, don't say that
in the future again.

202
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:54,350
I never expected to have a family
member by my side at this point.

203
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,260
Didn't you ask me to
keep it from everyone?

204
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,171
As long as you are willing to request,

205
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,230
the whole village are your family.

206
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,500
You're right.

207
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,140
I'm very fortunate.

208
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,230
Dong,

209
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,380
I have no regrets in my life.

210
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,310
But it doesn't stop me
from envying you and Jie.

211
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,900
You two must get along well.

212
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,950
Then, your grandma will have no regrets

213
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,710
for the rest of her days.

214
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,950
Grandma,

215
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,740
I get it.

216
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,070
I'm going to tidy up the things.

217
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,190
I'll come back later to listen to you.

218
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,590
Here you go.

219
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,110
You live a cozy life.

220
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,660
You're so mysterious
that I can't find you anywhere.

221
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:38,800
How did you find your way here?

222
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,550
I had to come and see
what you were up to,

223
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,860
to report to your grandson.

224
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,860
Don't tell Dong.

225
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,140
Then you tell me.

226
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,740
Jie.

227
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,900
Look, does this look like
Grandma Lin's house?

228
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,740
It does, but it's not.

229
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,310
Everything about Grandma Lin
is irreplaceable.

230
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,590
You're right.

231
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,350
But, the only Lin I have

232
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,350
will eventually
leave me behind and go first.

233
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,110
Grandma, don't think of that.

234
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,220
Jie,

235
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,750
as people age, they naturally become
somewhat prophetic.

236
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,550
I've been observing here
with people of my age lately.

237
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,030
Like the elderlies in Jin Village,

238
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,180
once they pass seventy,

239
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,070
their most important task each day

240
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,310
isn't about living life anymore,

241
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,228
but about waiting to depart from life.

242
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,460
They keep God in mind,

243
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,380
believing that
under the gaze of the Gods,

244
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,700
only then can their souls ascend.

245
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:01,700
They're afraid of dying
either outside their own homes,

246
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,110
or inside their own rooms.

247
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,660
Therefore, they decided

248
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,070
to move their beds to the living room,

249
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,830
waiting for their final moment.

250
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,940
It's like completing an ultimate test.

251
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,310
I don't like this tradition.

252
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,180
Once we still live in this world,

253
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,660
we should live it well.

254
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,350
At our age,

255
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,140
we have no energy to
fight against the Maker anymore.

256
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,140
Once someone dies,
they won't come back.

257
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,660
No one knows what it's like over there.

258
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,620
The closer we get to the point,

259
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,460
the more scared we become.

260
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,510
Heart rate. Blood pressure.

261
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,790
Heart rate monitor.

262
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,860
Here I come.

263
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,350
Dr. Fang,
this is the latest data record.

264
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,590
Alright, let me check.

265
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,790
The patient's coma index is three.
Pulse is 40.

266
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,510
Pupils are dilated.

267
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,110
When these indicators appear,

268
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,700
we will announce to the family.

269
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,420
Announce what?

270
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,510
Hello. Yes, I am.

271
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,220
Announce what?

272
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,220
Brain death.

273
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,990
But the machine still shows
breathing and heartbeat.

274
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,660
The life support system
doesn't represent life itself.

275
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,460
Once the machine stops...

276
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,350
The vital signs cease.

277
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,660
Understood.

278
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,270
Thank you.

279
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,750
Grandma.

280
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,420
Jie,

281
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,270
what does brain death mean?

282
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,510
Grandma Lin said that I could only

283
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,750
open this letter when the hospital
gave the final notice.

284
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,750
(Just for Gu Beibei)

285
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,860
Do you think brain death
means it's all over?

286
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,085
Even if the brain is not functioning,
isn't the person still here?

287
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,180
Let's try to save Lin again.

288
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,830
Let's save her again, okay?

289
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,460
Grandma Lin entrusted
that if there's no chance to live,

290
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:16,171
then we choose to not resuscitate.

291
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,380
But I still can't make the decision.

292
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:25,400
Can you give me
some professional advice for this?

293
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,460
When treatment no longer
works for someone,

294
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,550
professional advice becomes meaningless.

295
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,420
Grandma,

296
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,270
every brain surgeon struggles daily

297
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,270
to save the patient's life while
also enduring personal distress.

298
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,700
For example,

299
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,180
should they risk losing vision

300
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,620
to remove the brain hemorrhage?

301
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,590
Should they sacrifice
the patient's right hand

302
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,180
to stop the patient's
continuous seizures?

303
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,350
Or, even they know

304
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,940
that the patient lying in the bed

305
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,270
can never go back to
how they were before,

306
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,460
and may even lose their basic dignity,

307
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,900
should they try to save them?

308
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,420
You should know

309
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,510
there's never a best choice.

310
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,700
What Grandma Lin

311
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,350
most desired is dignity.

312
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,510
So, Grandma,

313
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:02,140
Grandma Lin has been living
a decent life her whole life.

314
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,460
Let's leave her
to have her last dignity.

315
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,700
Lin.

316
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,830
Lin.

317
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,140
Lin.

318
00:24:15,857 --> 00:24:17,180
You never listen to my advice.

319
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,750
You're old now.

320
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,110
Taking good care of yourself
is well enough.

321
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,990
You shouldn't take all those cats,
dogs, and rabbits in anymore.

322
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,220
This old cat has only a few days left.

323
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,420
Qi has kept it for over ten years,

324
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,070
treating it like his family.

325
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,990
How can he bear to watch

326
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,660
it take its last breath?

327
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,070
Seeing its fur shedding

328
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,830
and its tail becoming thin,

329
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,510
that's sad.

330
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,660
There must be someone
accompanying it for a peaceful death.

331
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,220
That's why I don't like
keeping these living creatures.

332
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,310
When they're healthy, they ignore you.

333
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,700
But, when they soon die,
they need to suffer for days.

334
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,270
Humans are like animals.

335
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,270
The day to leave will eventually arrive.

336
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,940
When the time comes,

337
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,900
think about the lovely days

338
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,110
we've spent together,

339
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,620
and we won't immerse in the sadness.

340
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,590
(I have acknowledged for a long time)

341
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,030
(that the day I leave
won't be filled with joy)

342
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,900
(or crowded with family members.)

343
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,270
(But because I chose this path myself,)

344
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,220
(I've never regretted it.)

345
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,110
(I have no attachments in this world,)

346
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,830
(except worrying about you.)

347
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,270
(That's why I wrote this letter
to you in advance.)

348
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,660
(You have to promise me to only open it)

349
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,110
(when the hospital
gives you the final notice.)

350
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,900
(The deceased is the greatest.)

351
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,350
(You have to listen to me.)

352
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,140
You are not fooling me, right?

353
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,900
This is my lucky color.

354
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,350
From now on, wear it every day.

355
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,140
I guarantee you
have good luck this year.

356
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,350
(Every individual has their own story)

357
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,220
(of different possible endings.)

358
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,270
(No matter which one, that's all fine.)

359
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,140
(If you were to ask those)

360
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,790
(who have already passed away)

361
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,660
(if they're satisfied with their death,)

362
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,750
(I guess most would want
to change it.)

363
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,860
(But for me, I think)

364
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,070
(no matter how I die,)

365
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,550
(dead is dead.)

366
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,270
(There's nothing to struggle with.)

367
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,990
(For most of my life,)

368
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,270
(I've been able)

369
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,350
(to make my own decisions,)

370
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,070
(even in death.)

371
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,510
(So, I'm quite satisfied
with my own ending.)

372
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,771
(And, please don't feel sorry for me.)

373
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,590
(In the first week after I leave,)

374
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,070
(you might receive a few greeting calls)

375
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,220
(and visits of condolences.)

376
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,380
(Don't be impatient.)

377
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,380
(Please allow others to care for you,)

378
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:47,550
(and talk about me.)

379
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,030
When it rains, hold an umbrella.

380
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,030
When the sun shines, dry the blanket.

381
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,420
Accept whatever comes
to you with happiness.

382
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,990
Time flies so fast.

383
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,510
Both of us started with tiny hands
holding each other's.

384
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,550
And now, it's wrinkly hands
holding each other's.

385
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,660
What's wrong with you?
Does anything happen?

386
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,180
Grandma Lin

387
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,220
has passed away.

388
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,460
You wait for your brother at home.

389
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,590
Don't cry. Follow me.

390
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,420
(The pain of losing a loved one
always makes people)

391
00:29:00,514 --> 00:29:02,314
(feel extremely hopeless at some point,)

392
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,940
(thinking that
the future is only filled)

393
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,700
(with endless loneliness and sadness
that accompany you.)

394
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,940
(But that's not true.)

395
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,350
(Time heals all wounds.)

396
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,270
Lin. I'm here.

397
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,140
You're finally here.

398
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,380
It's just in time for you to taste

399
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,100
the coffee jelly
that I just learned to make.

400
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,571
Why are you hanging this photo here?

401
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,790
I don't get it.

402
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,590
Why will a man dress like this?

403
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,940
Don't look at where you shouldn't.

404
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,700
It won't make you feel embarrassed then.

405
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,380
How can you bear to give this to me now?

406
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:47,200
It's all because you
always nagged about it.

407
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,420
Whatever you like is yours now.

408
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,750
I like it best
when you tidy up your house.

409
00:29:51,942 --> 00:29:53,940
I'm sure I'll have many
good things to collect here.

410
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,460
(In the second week when I leave,)

411
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,790
(you should go out of the house)

412
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,900
(and talk to the people
around you more.)

413
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,070
(Have a chat over topics
other than death.)

414
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,550
(Don't suffer alone.)

415
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,030
Grandma.

416
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,400
(Tunnel closed, please make a detour)
Uncle, I walked through here every day.

417
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,700
No entry here.

418
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,830
Going around will take me
an extra two hours.

419
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,220
What's...

420
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,940
No entry here.

421
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,860
No. You...

422
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,920
- Can't help.
- You...

423
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:45,657
How can you...

424
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,350
Jisan Goose!

425
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,380
Jisan Goose, come back.

426
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,450
You don't belong to the farm.

427
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,110
No entry!

428
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,270
Uncle.

429
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,280
My goose. My goose was scared
to the other side by you.

430
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,350
Which goose is yours?
Aren't they all the same?

431
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,990
The unique one there.

432
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,750
I don't see the difference.

433
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,790
That's just a goose.

434
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,070
Buy another one
at the goose farm.

435
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,270
You know nothing.

436
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,510
Jisan Goose is not an ordinary poultry.

437
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,700
It's the most extraordinary
goose in the world.

438
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,110
What's so special about it?

439
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,830
Roosters, wild dogs,

440
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,790
and white geese

441
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,380
are just bullies in the village.

442
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,830
Even if you don't eat them,
they'll bite you anyway.

443
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,990
They're useless.

444
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,070
Give me back my goose.

445
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,750
Jisan Goose.

446
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,940
Come back quickly.

447
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,270
Come back quickly.

448
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,860
(You have to accept that
life and death are destined.)

449
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:31,590
(Nothing in this world is permanent.)

450
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,070
(If you can't catch up, just let it go.)

451
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,110
(Don't cry.)

452
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:56,220
(If you're upset,
try taking deep breaths.)

453
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,310
Qin Xuezhi's family,

454
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,030
just letting you know,

455
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,420
the surgery is halfway through
and going quite smoothly.

456
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,180
Doctor.

457
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,900
Thank you for your hard work.

458
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,700
It's nothing.

459
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,420
Our current surgical plan is

460
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,660
challenging in terms of technique,

461
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,940
but if successful,
it will reduce postoperative bleeding

462
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,450
and improve the closure rate of
the false lumen in the distal end.

463
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,590
Your mom is only 64.

464
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,070
She's still young. We'll do our best.

465
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,140
Thank you.

466
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,420
(I have always felt that we women)

467
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,380
(are the strongest creatures
in this world.)

468
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,860
(Every family in this world)

469
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:43,110
(relies on the resilience
of women to be stable.)

470
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,990
(Women are the foundation)

471
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,110
(of a family rapport.)

472
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,380
(So, my dear sister,)

473
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,940
(I believe you can
definitely get through)

474
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,550
(the days when I'm not there.)

475
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,310
(I hope you can sincerely tell me that,)

476
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:07,550
("Lin, you've done a great job
in your life.")

477
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,030
(Both you and I are mature elderlies)

478
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,470
(who have gone through a lot in life.)

479
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,180
(We should understand)

480
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,030
(that being hurt
and going through hardships)

481
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,990
(are parts of life.)

482
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:30,550
(You're not the only one
feeling sad and in pain,)

483
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,110
(nor the most unfortunate person
in the world.)

484
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,870
(When comes to the topic of suffering,)

485
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,700
(many people can easily surpass you.)

486
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,990
(So, in other words,)

487
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:51,180
(no one is enduring the pain alone.)

488
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,990
(You should treat yourself nicer.)

489
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,780
(Wear clean clothes)

490
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,260
(and have a meal when it's served hot.)

491
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,950
(Other than these,)

492
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,030
(there's nothing else
I need to remind you of.)

493
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,340
(We've come a long way,)

494
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,300
(and it's time for us to bid farewell.)

495
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,550
(So, that's all for now.)

496
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,550
(My dear Chen,)

497
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,140
(let's meet again in heaven.)

498
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,590
Mom,

499
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,030
are we not going to
look for Jisan Goose?

500
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,740
No, we're not.

501
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,885
A forced tie won't make us close.

502
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,390
Mom,

503
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,910
can we really leave Grandma Chen

504
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,510
alone without our accompany?

505
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,390
Chen Maidong is not at home.

506
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,990
I don't feel at ease.

507
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,514
Even if you want to accompany her,
it shouldn't be right now.

508
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:07,620
Just let her stay quietly
at Grandma Lin's house.

509
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,820
Mom, I know you're most annoyed
with me being so sentimental.

510
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,260
But, why do people

511
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,870
always have to endure all these?

512
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,620
You guys can always talk big only.

513
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,742
When it comes to the real happenings,
you have no personal idea at all.

514
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,620
Zhuang Jie, don't underestimate
Grandma Chen.

515
00:36:34,285 --> 00:36:36,457
She's from the same generation
as your grandfather.

516
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,730
What they did back then,
is ten times more than us.

517
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,971
They've come through
from all the thick and thin.

518
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:43,420
Although looking at it
from today's perspective,

519
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,510
your grandpa might not be a good dad.

520
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,140
Your uncle and I were brought up by him,

521
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:52,228
being educated to
just be literate and sensible,

522
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,780
not to delve deeper into academics.

523
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,780
No matter how the world changes,

524
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:57,942
we believe that survival
is the important thing.

525
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,910
The way he raised children

526
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,028
was by beating them
whenever they disobeyed,

527
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,990
with the belief that it would knock down

528
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,800
their rebelliousness, making them
be able to survive in society.

529
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,771
If it happens in today's context,
no one would be able to stand with it.

530
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,140
But, at that time,
it was so-called wisdom.

531
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,660
When it came to my generation,

532
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,990
we didn't care about
anything unrealistic.

533
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:21,914
And then, I got married
and had children.

534
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,260
I witnessed the country

535
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,685
getting better and stronger day by day,

536
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:27,500
no more worrying
about food and clothing.

537
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,780
And, the most difficult thing
that came to me

538
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,910
was teaching you guys

539
00:37:31,971 --> 00:37:34,657
because I couldn't apply the way that
your grandpa used on you all.

540
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,870
You guys always talk
about freedom and equality.

541
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,330
What you pay attention to
are big matters from all over the world.

542
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,371
What you discussed are the new things
that I don't understand at all.

543
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,070
That was a good thing,

544
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,780
as it means that your lives

545
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,030
are better than mine.

546
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,990
Am I right? You have wider
perspectives than ours.

547
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,470
But we shouldn't just think
about the distant future

548
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,030
and ignore the present.

549
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:56,685
Let's not talk about anything else.

550
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,950
Let's just say that

551
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,700
when I'm gone someday,

552
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,550
the three of you won't get to eat
this braised chicken anymore,

553
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,510
and not even these dried radishes

554
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,660
and pickled vegetables.

555
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,340
Human undergoes birth, aging,
illness, and death.

556
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,780
We need to accept whatever comes to us.

557
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,070
No matter how much we know,

558
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,610
it's all meaningless
unless we experience it ourselves.

559
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,070
No one can escape it.

560
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,740
This weather is perfect
for flying kites.

561
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,870
If Mr. He were still here,

562
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,990
he would definitely be the first
in the kite competition.

563
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,000
But unfortunately,
there are no 'ifs" in this world.

564
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,990
Mr. He and Grandma Lin

565
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,470
can only live in our hearts.

566
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,260
Jie, Dong is coming back soon, right?

567
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,340
In these two days.

568
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,740
I heard you

569
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,110
talking to Xixia
on the phone last night.

570
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,885
You're going back to Shanghai, are you?

571
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,700
I've never said I'm not
going back to Shanghai.

572
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,390
What about Dong then?

573
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,990
Why don't you ask about my job?

574
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,950
For me, career is far
less important than love.

575
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,590
Yan, if you post these comments online,

576
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,180
you will be called lovesick

577
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,140
or a marriage mule.

578
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,510
I don't care about

579
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,870
what those keyboard warriors say.

580
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,110
I only care about you and Dong.

581
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,180
No one cares about
Maidong more than I do.

582
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,780
But your sister
is not just a salesperson.

583
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,660
Just because I'm disabled,

584
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,340
I understand better than others

585
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,340
how medical technology can change fate.

586
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,910
Didn't you come across a foreign article
online a few days ago?

587
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,070
How do they describe ventilators?

588
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,950
Ventilators redefine the end of life.

589
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,590
You're right.

590
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,470
Behind all business,
there can be warmth.

591
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,870
What I pursue is not only money,

592
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,590
but hoping that
there are "ifs" in this world.

593
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,340
If medical technology is more advanced,

594
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,070
and if domestic instruments
are more common,

595
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,140
other people like Mr. He or Grandma Lin

596
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,870
may have a chance to survive.

597
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,220
Do you understand?

598
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,430
Let's fly kites.

599
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,870
He Niaoniao, let's fly kites.

600
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,950
I'm coming.

601
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,470
Jie, let's fly the kites high

602
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,740
so that my dad and Grandma Lin
can see them.

603
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,470
Am I right?

604
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:06,780
Sure.

605
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,740
I heard that your mom's
surgery went well.

606
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,700
Yes.

607
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,140
I didn't know how to thank the doctors.

608
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,990
They don't expect your gratitude.

609
00:41:20,342 --> 00:41:22,514
Just stop throwing your punches
at them will do.

610
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,990
Please don't tease me anymore.

611
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,590
I'll quit fighting from now on.

612
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,870
Then, the happiest one
would be your mom.

613
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,870
The good time is waiting ahead for her.

614
00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:37,971
You can go back.

615
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:40,870
Dong,

616
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,260
are you okay?

617
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,110
You haven't slept much these days.

618
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,390
How should I put it?

619
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,070
It feels a bit surreal this morning.

620
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,820
I only understand now

621
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:56,314
the feeling of handling
all the funeral affairs

622
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,550
as a family member.

623
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,700
We're not young anymore.

624
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,180
Some things are inevitable.

625
00:42:04,457 --> 00:42:06,714
I've been handling others' affairs
all these years,

626
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,740
thinking that I was tough.

627
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,740
But when it actually happened to me,

628
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:15,285
I realized that I couldn't take it.

629
00:42:16,342 --> 00:42:17,542
How about your grandma?

630
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,300
Can she accept it?

631
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,220
I didn't expect her

632
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,070
to be stronger than me.

633
00:42:23,428 --> 00:42:24,942
She even comforted me in return.

634
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,910
That's good then.

635
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,620
Please take care.

636
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,590
You too.

637
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,870
I heard that you work
at a funeral parlor.

638
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,870
Yes, I am.

639
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,685
May I know what can I help you with?

640
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,430
Can we talk somewhere else?

641
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,660
I'm willing to pay.

642
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,140
Sure.
