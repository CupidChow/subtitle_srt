1
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,600
Look at how terrified you are.

2
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,320
Hello,

3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,760
I'm Chen Maidong's mother.

4
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,530
Hello.

5
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,600
My name is Zhuang Jie.

6
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,050
I'm Chen Maidong's

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,530
high school friend.

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,850
I will leave you be.

9
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,960
Something came up. I need to go.

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,400
It's fine.

11
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,570
You can talk.

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,490
I'm not here for something important.

13
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:00,810
It's fine.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,250
I'm leaving, anyway.

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,320
Take care.

16
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:10,600
Are you not seeing her off?

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,600
Come on in.

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,730
It's nippy.

19
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,520
=Will Love in Spring=

20
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,990
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

21
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,720
=Episode 12=

22
00:02:58,714 --> 00:02:59,840
It's cold in the living room.

23
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,160
Do you want to come to my room?

24
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,160
Being with you alone in your room

25
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,120
isn't appropriate.

26
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,000
Seriously?

27
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,610
Fine, forget it.

28
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,210
Your mom

29
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:17,610
came all the way here for you?

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,930
How can that be possible?

31
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,490
Just dropping by.

32
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,050
Not that it matters.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,160
Just some family stuff.

34
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,400
She could've said it

35
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,090
over a quick phone call.

36
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,610
Count your blessings.

37
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,720
Do cherish your parents.

38
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,560
Look at me.

39
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,120
When I miss my two dads,

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,960
I can only make a wish,

41
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:40,514
hoping they will come to my dream.

42
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:44,330
I have complicated feelings

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,880
about them.

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,400
You are traumatized.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,370
Because of their break-up,

46
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,400
you have no trust in relationships

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
and feel insecure.

48
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,400
Like you know a lot.

49
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:08,490
In the early years
after the car accident,

50
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,650
I couldn't get over

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,880
my rage and frustration.

52
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,050
So, I read psychology books every day,

53
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,330
and I found Adler's theory
to be the most practical.

54
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,050
Never find excuses

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,440
for your failure,

56
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,530
like your original family
and traumatic childhood.

57
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,880
They're only about
blaming all those awful people out there

58
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,610
and self-pitying, or the like.

59
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,720
But in fact,

60
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,990
people come up with these claims

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,200
to make themselves feel special.

62
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,730
If you say this outside,

63
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,171
you will get beaten up.

64
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,290
Except for you,

65
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,410
no one would beat a disabled person.

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,560
Look at you.

67
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,050
You are so mean.

68
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,760
Hasn't anyone punched you before?

69
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,930
Because I'm only mean to you.

70
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,170
When I decided

71
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,250
to follow Adler,

72
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,080
I watched the Paralympics repeatedly

73
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,290
and read Helen Keller.

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,250
Finally,

75
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,930
I overcame those bitter days

76
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,610
and returned to school.

77
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,680
Then, I met you.

78
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,370
The first person who showed
no empathy for disabled people.

79
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,250
You said the crutch could be a weapon.

80
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,730
I wouldn't compare myself

81
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,680
with these great people.

82
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,520
Why not?

83
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,050
At least you have been through a lot.

84
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:30,640
That's why I always thought

85
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,970
you were one with a clear mind.

86
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:33,560
I didn't know your parents' situation

87
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,080
still causes you frustration.

88
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:39,600
I haven't brought myself round
to that yet.

89
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,440
Chen Maidong,

90
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,080
only babies use vulnerability
as a weapon

91
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,250
to manipulate grown-ups.

92
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,000
Those who surround themselves

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
with misfortune and trauma

94
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,760
and subconsciously demand empathy

95
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,410
are big babies.

96
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,680
Growing up means maturity in spirits,

97
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,170
not in age.

98
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,610
I never wanted to
burden anyone with my life.

99
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:07,370
I just want to live a life like this
until the end.

100
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,370
But you give out the signals

101
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:13,880
that you need someone to love you.

102
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,370
Nonsense.

103
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:19,880
I mean it.

104
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,170
Being aloof

105
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,520
can also be charming.

106
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:29,930
Is this how you get attracted to me?

107
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,810
There are more

108
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,970
why I'm attracted to you.

109
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,170
You really like me?

110
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,640
Very much so.

111
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,610
Chen Maidong,

112
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,170
we have to stop being a kid.

113
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,640
When we were kids,

114
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,850
we needed our parents' love to carry on.

115
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,200
That's how we survived.

116
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,320
But being loved

117
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,170
isn't a natural thing
in the first place.

118
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,850
We are not the center of the world.

119
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,880
How should we live then?

120
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,170
Go ahead and love.

121
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,440
Love others

122
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,170
instead of waiting to be loved.

123
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,200
This is the only way

124
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,571
for a child to become an adult.

125
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,000
The first time I felt happiness was

126
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,520
when I knew I had the ability
to love my family.

127
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,760
Even though I'm disabled,

128
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,520
it can't stop me
from doing anything for them.

129
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,050
So,

130
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,170
only you can decide

131
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,250
how you live.

132
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,200
Go after what you want.

133
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,520
Don't regret even if you fall short.

134
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,520
Being in this profession,
have you not realized

135
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,850
that life is too short?

136
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,490
If it bothers you

137
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,370
that I always flirt with you,

138
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,160
I can change.

139
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,250
But sooner or later,
you have to learn to love someone.

140
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,760
As long as you are happy,

141
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,090
I will be glad for you.

142
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,880
Bye.

143
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,970
I have to run an errand for Madam Wu.

144
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:37,210
Think deeply about my gospel.

145
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,120
Nonsense.

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,040
That doesn't make sense.

147
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:19,690
The receptionist says I have a parcel.

148
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,490
Is it you?

149
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:25,040
I brought you the medicinal patch.

150
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:28,657
All right.

151
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:29,710
The amount is correct.

152
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:31,800
I thought it would be a deliveryman.

153
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm that deliveryman.

154
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:34,880
How much?

155
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,760
There is no need.

156
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,160
You can treat me to a meal.

157
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,730
Is this compulsory?

158
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,370
No, it's not.

159
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,520
I think I better pay you. Here.

160
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,760
320 yuan.

161
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,610
I will round it down

162
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,370
to 300.

163
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,610
No. I will give you 350 yuan,

164
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,640
including your errand fee.

165
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,090
Do you have a QR code for payment?

166
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,280
Exchanging contact

167
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,970
is a normal social etiquette, right?

168
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,000
Cece.

169
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,400
Cece?

170
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,800
Cece.

171
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,920
Xixia.

172
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,000
It's on me.

173
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,150
Let's eat for the last time

174
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,330
before I go back to France.

175
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,000
No.

176
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,210
I have plans.

177
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,370
Hello, I'm Ji Tong.

178
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,970
Wang Xixia's superior.

179
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,800
Hello, I'm Cui Ge.

180
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,730
Wang Xixia's blind date.

181
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,880
The lunchtime is short.

182
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,880
Let's eat together. It's more fun.

183
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,800
No, it's not convenient.

184
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,970
Let's go our separate ways.

185
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:03,730
Are we really going?

186
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,570
I left my glasses there.

187
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,160
Grandma Lin, I'm Zhuang Jie.

188
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,330
Is it Jie?

189
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,520
Coming in.

190
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,570
Grandma Lin.

191
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,280
Grandma Lin.

192
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,120
You are here.

193
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,690
You have a beautiful house.

194
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,570
Grandma Lin, what are you doing?

195
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,120
Come.

196
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,370
I can do this for you.

197
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,370
Put it here?

198
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,880
It's fine. I can manage.

199
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,920
It's beautiful.

200
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,250
Finally, someone gets it.

201
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,640
Grandma Chen

202
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,850
always says

203
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,210
my clothes aren't decent.

204
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,880
She always wants me to remove this.

205
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,730
What a sweet couple.

206
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,800
It was me when I was young.

207
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
You looked pretty.

208
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,370
Is the man beside you your husband?

209
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,490
My boyfriend.

210
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm not married.

211
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,610
He died at the age of 32.

212
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,570
I'm sorry, Grandma Lin.

213
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,250
It has been years.

214
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,920
We were in love,
so there are no regrets.

215
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,970
He died in his prime.

216
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,450
He has been in my heart

217
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,000
for my whole life already.

218
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,920
That's fair for us both.

219
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,610
That's nice.

220
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,450
Oh, right. Grandma Lin.

221
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Madam Wu asked me
to pass this on to you.

222
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,850
I never take the money.

223
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,520
Besides,

224
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,120
I didn't help her much.

225
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,640
Just chatting.

226
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:34,730
Grandma Lin...

227
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,490
Jie, have a seat.

228
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,570
I will make you some tea.

229
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,120
Sure. Thank you.

230
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,280
Oh, here is a cat.

231
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,350
(Lin Jingru, female, 72-year-old,
Department: Oncology)

232
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:32,090
Just make do with this.

233
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:34,920
It's pretty good.

234
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,040
It's great that I can help you

235
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,640
avoid someone you loathe more.

236
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,090
What are you proud of

237
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,600
when you are only the lesser evil?

238
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm satisfied with it
as long as I'm not the worst.

239
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,570
Have you physicians never been
on the downtrodden side?

240
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,257
That's why
you have a quirky turn of mind.

241
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,000
It has nothing
to do with the profession.

242
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,160
Well,

243
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm blunt, and I don't know
how to speak nicely.

244
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,570
I haven't touched them.

245
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,280
They are clean.

246
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,040
I don't like vegetables.

247
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,800
Then why did you...

248
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,760
I'm hungry.

249
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,730
So I ate them first.

250
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,690
Well, that's awkward.

251
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Gosh, you.

252
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,090
Meat.

253
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,690
Meat.

254
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,800
It's meat.

255
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,090
Oh, my.

256
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,800
You are in your thirties,

257
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,370
how can you be so clumsy?

258
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,610
Like I said,

259
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,610
I don't have much experience

260
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,640
with women,

261
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,160
just my ex-wife.

262
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,400
So, for your convenience,

263
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,160
you want to replicate the old style.

264
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,760
Regarding this,

265
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,800
I have reflected on it.

266
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:12,610
Previously,

267
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,970
I didn't make myself clear.

268
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,730
I didn't mean to find

269
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,210
an exact person like her.

270
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,160
I just assumed

271
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,600
I could replicate the happy life
I had before.

272
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,490
My ex-wife and I
got along quite well

273
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:25,930
and we respected each other.

274
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,080
Until now, I'm very grateful to her

275
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,450
for bringing me those
precious relationship experiences.

276
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,514
Maybe my marriage was too smooth,

277
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,840
so I don't have much dating skills now.

278
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,410
It has been four years since she passed.

279
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,970
You are the first woman

280
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,560
who made my heart flutter.

281
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,800
Because I look like her.

282
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,730
I thought so

283
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,800
when I first met you.

284
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,360
Can you say something new?

285
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,520
But now I think

286
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,890
you two are nothing alike.

287
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,080
It shouldn't have made you feel

288
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,040
that I was comparing you to her.

289
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,450
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:14,490
It's more difficult for a widower
like you to find a new partner

291
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,720
than those with a failed marriage.

292
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,450
Exactly.

293
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,840
That's why I was thrilled
when I met you.

294
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,560
The way you attack me mentally

295
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,650
or verbally insult me

296
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,930
makes me think it's interesting and new.

297
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
You are quite optimistic.

298
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,730
Well,

299
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,800
I will be honest with you.

300
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,360
Sure.

301
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,040
We are worlds apart.

302
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:38,320
I always think we can't really talk.

303
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,130
But I think

304
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,760
we are deeply fated.

305
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,600
Are you finished? Let's go.

306
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,130
Wait, I haven't started yet.

307
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,210
I was giving you my food.

308
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,130
I haven't eaten yet.

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Fine, go on.

310
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,760
Excuse me.

311
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,840
No.

312
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,250
Xixia.

313
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,080
I will pay.

314
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,170
I can accept a lady paying.

315
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,970
I have something else to tell you.

316
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,520
From my observation,

317
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,210
I think you

318
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,210
tend to have a mood swing.

319
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,600
So I suggest...

320
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,000
Come closer.

321
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,760
I'm serious.

322
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,560
Come closer.

323
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:24,450
There are people here.

324
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,730
I can't do anything to you.

325
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,690
I suggest

326
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,000
when you have a mood swing next time,

327
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,210
you can massage the Baihui acupoint.

328
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,450
Massage here.

329
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,650
Feeling better, right?

330
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,520
Ridiculous.

331
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,690
If... If you suffer from agitation,

332
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,000
Laogong acupoint is in your palm,

333
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,130
you can massage it there.

334
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,170
Right here, in the palm.

335
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,410
If you can't find it,

336
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,450
text me.

337
00:19:57,514 --> 00:19:58,760
You all can massage this point

338
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,690
if you stay up late.

339
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,040
So,

340
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,360
only you can decide

341
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
how you live.

342
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,250
Go after what you want.

343
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:19,890
Don't regret even if you fall short.

344
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Being in this profession,

345
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
haven't you realized
that life is too short?

346
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,130
Madam Wu.

347
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,520
Maidong,

348
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,800
what are you doing here?

349
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:37,890
I'm waiting for you.

350
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:43,280
I have a favor to ask of you.

351
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,970
Me?

352
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,650
Liao Tao.

353
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,600
You are at home.

354
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,840
I bought you a basket
of organic vegetables.

355
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,930
Come on in.

356
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:17,080
It's fine. You can continue.

357
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,080
Madam Wu, you are here.

358
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,600
Jie, you are home.

359
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,280
I'm here to chat with your mom.

360
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,690
What a refined girl.

361
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,410
She is reading.

362
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,650
Unlike my daughter,

363
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,890
she never gets off her phone

364
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,970
and lazes around.

365
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,170
What are you busy about?

366
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,250
I'm chatting with a buyer.

367
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,057
Give me a moment.

368
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,560
Isn't there
the professional customer service?

369
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,490
You are typing so slowly.

370
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,890
Do you expect the customer to wait?

371
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,000
I prefer to do things

372
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,210
if I can.

373
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,857
Otherwise,
it's easy to get shortchanged.

374
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,840
I know both you and your daughter

375
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,130
will achieve great things.

376
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:47,600
Right?

377
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,210
I can't.

378
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,650
Typing a few words

379
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,560
tires me out.

380
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,840
Zhuang Jie is better than me.

381
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:53,890
Rightfully so.

382
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,360
Jie is capable.

383
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,730
She can do just well wherever she goes.

384
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,490
You see, is she really

385
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,520
planning to settle down in Shanghai?

386
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,600
Who knows?

387
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,360
She aims high and
is determined to stay there.

388
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,500
I can't do anything about it.

389
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,170
She doesn't consider coming back?

390
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,080
Nowadays,

391
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,080
many young people start up business

392
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,170
back in their hometown

393
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,880
as they are familiar
with the people there.

394
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,520
Besides,

395
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,040
they can get support, right?

396
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,080
We have been in this town
for our entire life

397
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,800
and haven't seen much of the world,

398
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,130
which we think is fine.

399
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,840
But they have been

400
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,360
to the big world out there.

401
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,200
Do you think
they are willing to come back?

402
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,280
To be honest,

403
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,410
I would like to introduce a man to her.

404
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,730
If Jie would come back,

405
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:46,560
I'm thinking of setting her up
with the man.

406
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,600
Her, seriously?

407
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,280
I doubt if she would settle down

408
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,450
with a townsman here.

409
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,360
Can you avoid me

410
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,560
when you are talking about me?

411
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,760
Even if we talk in heaven,

412
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,490
would you want to marry
back into our town?

413
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,250
Look,

414
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,490
no one can decide for her.

415
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,080
She either ignores you

416
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:06,840
or uses words

417
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,040
against you.

418
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,000
Frankly,

419
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,840
I also think this is a long shot.

420
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,040
But since I have promised him,

421
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,490
I have to give it a go,

422
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,040
right?

423
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:20,950
As mothers,
our worries always seem unnecessary.

424
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,490
Let's just mind our own business.

425
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,280
You have grown the vegetables so well.

426
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,040
You know what? This cucumber

427
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,300
is very sweet if you eat it raw.

428
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,760
The vegetables

429
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
are so fresh.

430
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,130
Master.

431
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,970
I will go through the steps again.

432
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,410
Master.

433
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,760
I... I...

434
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,250
I'm going to cleanse your face.

435
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:12,685
Do you expect the deceased to teach you?

436
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,890
No.

437
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,730
I'm sorry, Master.

438
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,410
Please don't suddenly

439
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,320
open your eyes again.

440
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,410
If we had repeat customers,

441
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,450
your face-washing skills

442
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,600
would surely get a bad review.

443
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:08,890
Madam Wu.

444
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,490
I'm free.

445
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,000
I will be in the reception room
in 30 seconds.

446
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,000
All right.

447
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:18,450
Revise the rest of the steps again.

448
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
We will continue later.

449
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,490
All right.

450
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,450
Maidong.

451
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,490
Well...

452
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,320
That's the result.

453
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,000
Jie and her mom

454
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,760
have thought it through.

455
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,170
They don't look for men from the town.

456
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,360
All right.

457
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,490
It's all right.

458
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,690
You will definitely find a better woman.

459
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,130
Believe me.

460
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,930
When I go back later,

461
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,840
I won't do anything

462
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,450
but filter the names thoroughly.

463
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,350
If there's a good one,

464
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,690
I will ask your grandma to check.

465
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,560
You can meet them when you have time.

466
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,360
Thank you, Madam Wu.

467
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,942
Sorry for the trouble.

468
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,520
I'm off.

469
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,650
Maidong.

470
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,080
Let it go.

471
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,000
Don't let it bother you.

472
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,170
Go up.

473
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,170
I will show you once.

474
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,070
I don't think it's a good idea, Master.

475
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,210
I need more practice.

476
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,840
Lie down.

477
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,730
Master.

478
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,130
Is something wrong?

479
00:26:55,228 --> 00:26:55,930
Close your eyes.

480
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,130
Master.

481
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,360
I don't feel safe.

482
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,800
Remember

483
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,930
that I'm alive, I...

484
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,690
Cut your crap.

485
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:09,890
Quiet.

486
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,210
I'm almost thirty,

487
00:27:37,885 --> 00:27:40,080
I'm not some love-struck
young girl anymore.

488
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,080
Everyone has to face reality.

489
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,690
All those romantic

490
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,360
and emotional desires

491
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,450
won't fill your stomach.

492
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,520
Chen Maidong,

493
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,840
I like you.

494
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,800
I'm serious.

495
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,890
But I like Shanghai more.

496
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,040
This is the reality

497
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,250
that comes between you and me.

498
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,080
I was awful to you just now.

499
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,800
Call the other colleagues.

500
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,040
I will buy you dinner tonight.

501
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,490
Chen Maidong,

502
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,730
I know a secret.

503
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,360
I don't know who I should tell.

504
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm confused.

505
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,130
Because this concerns
someone's privacy...

506
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:12,970
Jie, are you not up?

507
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,760
Close the door.

508
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,170
You will understand

509
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,570
after hearing what I'm going to say.

510
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,650
It may affect some people,

511
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,320
especially your grandma.

512
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,360
I'm worried.

513
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,560
I'm struggling over

514
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,890
whether I should tell you.

515
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,040
Not up yet?

516
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,560
Right away.

517
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,760
Chen Maidong...

518
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,210
Where was I?

519
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,490
Jie, hurry and get up.

520
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,250
You are lazy.

521
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,190
(Lin Baobao's Veterinary Clinic)

522
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,080
Chen Maidong,

523
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,490
are you busy today?

524
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,520
I'm so distracted.

525
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,280
There is something
I must talk to you about.

526
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,390
What time are you off work?

527
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,000
Grandma,

528
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,450
I brought you some fruit.

529
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,410
Try it.

530
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,410
If you like them,

531
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,600
I will bring some next time.

532
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,210
I came here to talk about
me and Chen Maidong.

533
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,650
I believe Madam Wu
has told you about it.

534
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,320
Grandma.

535
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,760
Jie.

536
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,000
Grandma, you have a guest.

537
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,280
I won't disturb you.

538
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,690
No.

539
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Well, Jie.

540
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,450
Anything?

541
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,000
Nothing. Don't let me keep you.

542
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,320
Jie.

543
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,170
Jie.

544
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:26,690
Wait up.

545
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,080
Grandma,

546
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,000
go inside.

547
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,280
Don't ignore your guest.

548
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,360
Madam Wu introduces her.

549
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,410
She showed up all of a sudden.

550
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,650
I was dumbfounded.

551
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,040
Madam Wu said

552
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,970
she wanted to compensate Chen Maidong.

553
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,730
I don't have the faintest idea

554
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,690
what that's all about.

555
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,650
To be honest,

556
00:31:44,857 --> 00:31:46,760
I would like to introduce a man to her.

557
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,130
If Jie would come back here,

558
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm thinking of setting her up with him.

559
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,890
Her, seriously?

560
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,800
I doubt she would want

561
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,930
to settle down with a townsman here.

562
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,760
But the girl is here,

563
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,730
I have to talk to her.

564
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,000
Grandma.

565
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,760
It's all right. Just go ahead.

566
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,080
I'm fine with it.

567
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,250
Hurry and go inside.

568
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,600
Don't give her the wrong idea.

569
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,760
You...

570
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:11,730
Oh, right.

571
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,250
Dong called and said he went
to a movie with colleagues.

572
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:16,250
Go and find him there.

573
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,560
All right.

574
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,080
(Nanping Cinema)
I don't think this sequel is bad.

575
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,890
Rey is awesome.

576
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,390
Although she was born on the dark side,

577
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,040
she refused to be Palpatine's queen.

578
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,800
She deserves to be a Jedi.

579
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,730
When she held
Luke and Reia's lightsabers,

580
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,080
I almost burst into tears.

581
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,040
Dong.

582
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,890
Do you like films like this?

583
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:50,600
It's quite good. It's an exciting film.

584
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,490
Next time, I will buy the tickets.

585
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,490
Let's watch.

586
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,690
You should invite Feng Xilun.

587
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,970
He knows more about movies.

588
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:03,930
Master, go on.

589
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:04,760
We are leaving.

590
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,450
Hurry and go.

591
00:33:19,114 --> 00:33:20,000
Are you here for me?

592
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,520
You are busy, Chen Maidong.

593
00:33:26,514 --> 00:33:28,000
Why didn't you reply to my message?

594
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:30,130
I switched to Do-No-Disturb mode.

595
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:30,930
Why?

596
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,130
Why do you think?

597
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,730
I don't know.

598
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,000
Stop playing games.

599
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,800
It's not fun.

600
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:40,840
Zhuang Jie,

601
00:33:41,914 --> 00:33:44,080
I'm just a simple townsman

602
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:45,650
on the straight and narrow.

603
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,600
I don't belong to your kind.

604
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:51,210
Let's go our separate ways from now on.

605
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,650
Fine.

606
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,520
If I ever care about you again,

607
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,490
I'm a dog.

608
00:33:59,657 --> 00:34:01,130
Have you ever cared about anyone?

609
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,450
Sometimes, I doubt if you have a heart.

610
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,250
Chen Maidong,

611
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,142
you are unreasonable.

612
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:10,930
I'm unreasonable?

613
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:13,280
You say one thing and do another.

614
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,257
Are you reasonable then?

615
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:16,210
For crying out loud.

616
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,830
Have I been playing
some love game with you?

617
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,650
Is it fun?

618
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,890
Chen Maidong, listen up.

619
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,920
I might have a lot of problems,

620
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,280
but I only say what I mean.

621
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:27,730
I know you had Madam Wu come
to my house for matchmaking.

622
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,228
Did you even tell me in advance?

623
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:31,714
Madam Wu didn't make it clear

624
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,690
and my mom dissuaded her.

625
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,480
So you blame me?

626
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,400
You started the matchmaking thing,

627
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,350
but I have to guess it.

628
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,650
You are the one fooling me.

629
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:38,600
Now things got messed up,

630
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,840
and you take it on me.

631
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,210
I'm so embarrassed for you.

632
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,170
In terms of our personality,

633
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:47,480
I'm much more frank than you are.

634
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,210
You are a difficult man.
Frigging difficult.

635
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,600
Sod off.

636
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,130
It's my fault.

637
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,371
I wasn't considerate enough
and I snapped at you.

638
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,440
I won't do it again, all right?

639
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,610
Don't touch me.

640
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:18,480
Didn't you tell me to make a move,

641
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,690
rather than sit tight and wait.

642
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,210
I took your words too seriously

643
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,570
and I did something stupid.

644
00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:25,028
Are you pointing a finger at me?

645
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:27,760
Let's not argue anymore.

646
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,690
Anyway, I only want you.

647
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:31,610
You must be responsible for me.

648
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:36,840
Enough.

649
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,760
What are you doing?

650
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,570
Don't be angry.

651
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,880
It's my fault.

652
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:51,650
Trying to take me away forcibly?

653
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,730
Yeah, you can call the police.

654
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:57,010
Should I call the police
or hold you tight?

655
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,570
Put me down.

00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,050
The art exhibition

671
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,400
is quite popular in our town.

672
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:20,685
These young people
have done a great job.

673
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:23,320
Turning this decrepit area
into a decent one.

674
00:38:27,857 --> 00:38:29,250
Don't you think lanterns over there

675
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,880
look like a spittoon?

676
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,530
Keep your voice down.

677
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,010
We might get kicked out

678
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,570
if the artist hears us.

679
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,690
All right, I will stop.

680
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,440
Now I'm already fine with it.

681
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,690
My daughter doesn't want children
so just let her be.

682
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,250
As long as the young couple

683
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,190
doesn't mess up their life
and lead a happy one.

684
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,250
I couldn't ask for more.

685
00:38:47,371 --> 00:38:48,210
Put the cigarette out.

686
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,730
How could you smoke here?

687
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,530
Didn't you see the no-smoking sign?

688
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:52,920
Do it outside.

689
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,800
Such an addict.

690
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,050
All I wish is

691
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
that my child has a partner beside her

692
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,840
when she is old.

693
00:39:04,114 --> 00:39:05,010
I won't ask for more.

694
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,090
There you go.

695
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,250
You see, we are getting up in years.

696
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,320
We can't worry ourselves
about things so far ahead.

697
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:16,690
What do they think they are doing?

698
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,840
This is a public area.

699
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,730
Don't intervene
in other people's children.

700
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,170
Enough.

701
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,090
This is unbelievable.

702
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:24,170
Look at the romantic ambiance here.

703
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,400
Just let them be.

704
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:33,730
I didn't expect Nanping

705
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,100
to have an art exhibition like this.

706
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,960
So beautiful.

707
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:37,480
Not as beautiful as you.

708
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,920
This is a public area.

709
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,050
Watch your language.

710
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:41,650
My innocence has long gone

711
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,570
because of you.

712
00:39:44,571 --> 00:39:46,250
Then, you should look
for a better choice.

713
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,950
People in Nanping
have an interest in you.

714
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,250
Why don't you consider them?

715
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,250
Are you jealous?

716
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
You wish!

717
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,650
I won't be mean to other women
just over a man.

718
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,250
Then tell me

719
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,440

I still won't allow that.

If we see anyone kissing later,

731
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,210
don't stop me.
