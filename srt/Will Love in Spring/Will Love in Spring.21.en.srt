00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,828
(When I'm a judge at a funeral
services competition every year,)

with the same opening line:)

(Technique Competition)
(Everyone)

6
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,200
(lives with death.)

7
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,520
(Some believe)

8
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,080
(that death isn't the end of life,)

9
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,239
(but its completion.)

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,040
(However, most of them)

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,160
(refuse to talk about death,)

12
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:02,578
(make a will or sign)

13
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,320
(a Do-Not-Resuscitate order in advance.)

14
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:09,240
(All this stems from the fear of death.)

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,359
(But an unprepared death)

16
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,639
(can disrupt all plans.)

17
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:21,090
(There is no chance left)

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,120
(to express true feelings to loved ones)

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,320
(or to leave any words for families.)

20
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:32,279
(So,)

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,138
(the sooner)

22
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:37,159
(we realize that death is inevitable,)

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,320
(the more calmly)

24
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,999
(we can prepare.)

28
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,498
(A month earlier)

29
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:21,399
Liao.

30
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,280
Grandma Chen.

31
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,338
I didn't see you at your store just now,

32
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:28,679
and I guessed you must be at home.

33
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,658
I brought you some vegetables.

34
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,419
You can cook for your children.

35
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,700
It helps ward off feverish heat.

36
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:36,299
I feel so bad to trouble you
to bring them over.

37
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,040
I was thinking of sending you
some bamboo shoots lately.

38
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,699
Liao, I know you are busy.

39
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,000
So I will cut right to the chase.

40
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,899
Well, I came here with a purpose.

41
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,600
I have something to ask of you.

42
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,658
We are family.

43
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,359
Please don't say that.

44
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,139
If you don't mind

45
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,859
and are willing to see me
as your family,

46
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,058
I couldn't be happier.

47
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:09,019
Our children have engaged.

48
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,338
Of course, we are a family.

49
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:14,119
Zhuang Jie isn't considerate enough.

50
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,499
I'm worried she might get to you.

51
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,499
I have been meaning to apologize to you,

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,959
but I feel ashamed.

53
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:22,320
It's all right
that Jie pursues her career.

54
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:25,579
Dong just can't bear to leave her

55
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,139
and he gets a bit upset.

56
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,639
Please bear with him.

57
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,819
Oh, no. Please don't blame Maidong.

58
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,978
I didn't expect Zhuang Jie

59
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,320
to make that decision.

60
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:36,819
My child is concerned
about her severed leg,

61
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,760
and she has been driven
since she was little.

62
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,279
No one can stop her

63
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:42,240
from doing anything she wants.

64
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,519
That being said, this is also

65
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,959
why I don't have to worry
about her studies or job.

66
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:49,120
It's the same for Dong.

67
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,479
He may seem to keep to himself.

68
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,800
But when it comes to serious matters,

69
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,360
he knows what he is doing.

70
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,920
He especially told me

71
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,760
not to meddle in this.

72
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,880
So, I just came here once

73
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,279
without telling him.

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,079
Dong surely cares about Jie deep inside.

75
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,000
Could you please ask Jie

76
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:17,019
to approach Dong more?

77
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,599
If they stop meeting each other,

78
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,000
they might grow apart.

79
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,858
Please don't worry.

80
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:23,680
My daughter is stubborn.

81
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,120
Besides Maidong, she hasn't treated
anyone else like this.

82
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,000
That's good, then.

83
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:30,178
Let's not bother ourselves
with them anymore.

84
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:33,000
Right. It's simply unnecessary
to worry about them both.

85
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,338
Let me help you.

86
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,079
Sure.

87
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm going to cook this
for them this noon.

88
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,599
(Jie, everyone has got your back.)

89
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,200
(Don't worry and go ahead to get Dong.)

90
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,379
(Jie, I'm at your command.)

91
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,714
(I go where you point me to.)

92
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,680
Zhuang Jie,

93
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:05,699
talk us through the details.

94
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,479
All right.

95
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,250
Ms. Zhuang is here.

96
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,959
Thank you for coming.

97
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,059
I believe you all
have read the proposal.

98
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,639
So, I won't go into the details.

99
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,059
All of you are the top-notch players
in the medical industry.

100
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,920
I believe we all have a consensus.

101
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,098
That is, building advanced
Chinese medical devices

102
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,059
is the essential fundamental
for promoting a healthcare system

103
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,699
with multiple layers
of medical services.

104
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,139
The biggest problem we are facing is

105
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,899
desynchronization
between industry chains.

106
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,800
Many institutes are devoted
to developing new products,

107
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,778
but they work independently.

108
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:36,978
So, we created this platform

109
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,178
to build a cross-disciplinary

110
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,658
and complementary team
that covers biomedical materials,

111
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,699
mechanical engineering, and more fields.

112
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,259
And we will also delve deeply
into this area over the long term

113
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,178
in an attempt for the domestic
top-tier brand to take off.

114
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:48,899
That's wonderful.

115
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,139
The biggest specialty of us

116
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,680
as salespeople before
was our persistence.

117
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,479
Now that we are starting
our own business, we will stick to it.

118
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,839
We welcome you all to join us.

119
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,098
The more talents we gather,
the closer we are to the goal.

120
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:02,019
Thank you, everyone.

121
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,079
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

122
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,950
I would like to collaborate with you.

123
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,680
That's great.

124
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,379
This is our business card.

125
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,039
Just call me Zhuang.

126
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,059
Wang Xixia,

127
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,579
the company just got on track,

128
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,338
and you are leaving now.

129
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:23,360
You can't go.

130
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,019
Zhuang Jie, are we still on this?

131
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,338
Moving is tiring.

132
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,320
Why are you bugging me non-stop?

133
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,920
Don't move, then.

134
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,579
A woman in her prime

135
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,819
should stay with another woman.

136
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,059
Why bother getting married?

137
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,719
Who was the one
that tried so hard to shove us together?

138
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,079
Well. All right. Easy.

139
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:48,200
Wang Xixia,

140
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,085
why don't the three of us live together?

141
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,178
I will pay for the food.

142
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,000
No way.

143
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,619
I'm planning to have children soon.

144
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,880
Don't get in my way.

145
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:56,920
I had the same plan before.

146
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,178
But it's no use.

147
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,320
Forget about the children,

148
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,519
I don't even have a man.

149
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,059
You just left him.

150
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,059
You lost your spirit?

151
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,360
My spirit is burning.

152
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,320
The point is,
I can't do this all on my own.

153
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,819
Chen Maidong is hard to please.

154
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,760
He has been leaving me hanging.

155
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,019
Zhuang Jie...

156
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,658
I hate you.

157
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:15,519
Don't try to talk.

158
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,200
Don't be mean to my husband.

159
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,259
Can you believe this?

160
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,819
I slave away at work every day.

161
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,130
When I get off work,
I have to watch you lovey-dovey couple.

162
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,599
Well, let's not annoy her.

163
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,579
Zhuang Jie,

164
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,619
I would like to trade some news

165
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,320
for your forgiveness in return.

166
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,640
Go on.

167
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:37,899
I heard that Nanping has officially
submitted the proposal for the

168
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,099
medical tourism pilot zone
to the provincial government.

169
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,139
I don't get it.

170
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,899
What does it have to do
with my forgiveness?

171
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,019
Is that true?

172
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,938
Nanping is a small town.

173
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:47,658
Can it really become a pilot zone?

174
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,538
That's a big deal.

175
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,400
I know my wife is sharp.

176
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:51,640
Nanping

177
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:52,859
has been known for its tourism

178
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,339
in the province in recent years.

179
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,619
It's also modest in scale

180
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,079
and feasible as a pilot zone.

181
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,499
Starting next week,

182
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,099
the town government
will start gathering people for ideas.

183
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,239
Do you have any ideas?

184
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,239
Cui Ge, I forgive you
for everything you have done.

185
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,938
I'm heading back to Nanping
to make this happen.

186
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:11,339
Wait, hold your horses.

187
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,178
Don't be so extreme, will you?

188
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,219
You see, this is a big thing
at the government level.

189
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,619
How can you make this happen?

190
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,578
It's the taking part
that counts, you know?

191
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,658
When I helped Yanggou
Village sell Chinese yams,

192
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,359
I knew nothing at all
before doing all that.

193
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:23,418
As long as we can get into

194
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:25,259
the first batch
of the professional team,

195
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,079
the town government will take us.

196
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,619
I have been racking my brain these days

197
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,658
thinking about how to move

198
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,160
this Chen-Maidong earth,

199
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,239
now Cui Ge has given me
the lever I need.

200
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,239
If there is a bridge
linking me and Nanping,

201
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:44,079
the problem between us
can be solved.

202
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:45,979
Look, Zhuang Jie

203
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,119
has it in her, doesn't she?

204
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:50,040
Flies don't attack a crackless egg.

205
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,298
However, the first fly

206
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,979
to notice a crack in the egg

207
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,239
must be none other than her.

208
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,219
Wang Xixia, can you speak nicer?

209
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,759
You are worse than your husband.

210
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,538
You should call me a bellwether,

211
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,119
not a fly.

212
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,259
I don't mean to depress you.

213
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,899
But Zhuang Jie,

214
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,479
between you and Chen Maidong,
you have to take it slowly.

215
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,219
He isn't as easy as a crackable egg.

216
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,920
Do you think I haven't done anything
for the past few months?

217
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,200
It's time for my aides to take action.

218
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,239
I have many watchful eyes

219
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,320
over this egg for me.

220
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,479
Dong, I'm not bothering you, am I?

221
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:25,440
No. I need a model too.

222
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,178
It's almost the summer break.

223
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:28,139
Why are you back earlier?

224
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,759
I miss home, so I come back at weekends.

225
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,400
Listen, if you ever
mention Jie, I will leave.

226
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,298
I don't have time for you both.

227
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:38,079
I haven't talked to my mom so far yet.

228
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:39,680
Close your eyes.

229
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,520
So tell me.

230
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,079
Why did you quarrel with her again?

231
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:12,440
Dong,

232
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,520
do you also think

233
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,040
I'm a weirdo?

234
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:18,999
No. You are pretty good.

235
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,657
Only you think that way, my mom doesn't.

236
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,490
I've realized that I'm weird
since I was little.

237
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,219
My mom always says

238
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,379
that Jie and I were

239
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,160
born in the wrong genders.

240
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,160
My bad.

241
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,339
I didn't mean to mention Jie.

242
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,239
Again?

243
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,200
Dong, you are oversensitive.

244
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,280
No, your family is cunning.

245
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:42,330
He Niaoniao used all kinds
of reasons to see me

246
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,879
and tried to brainwash me.

247
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,298
Dong, I told you.

248
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,239
I came here for my own problem.

249
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,219
I don't have time to worry
about you and Zhuang Jie.

250
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,680
Get over yourself.

251
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,680
Fine.

252
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,320
It's my fault. Go on.

253
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,239
To be honest,

254
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,538
I...

255
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,859
I was seeing someone last semester.

256
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,959
We met online.

257
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,239
Her surname is Ji.

258
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,599
I didn't tell anyone about this.

259
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,800
No wonder Jisan Goose
also has that surname.

260
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,400
What happened?

261
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,160
However, once I dated this girl,

262
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:22,079
I realized I don't like her.

263
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,879
Have you told your sister about this?

264
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,440
I thought you didn't want me
to mention her.

265
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,058
So, this is the argument

266
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:44,979
between you and your mom?

267
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,219
This is serious, you know?

268
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,139
I told her about this
over the phone the other day.

269
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,578
She just exploded.

270
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:50,739
She never let me finish.

271
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,479
Actually, I wanted to tell her

272
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,859
that I can't date a girl,

273
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,079
but I'm still trying.

274
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,979
I'm just confused

275
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,959
why I'm so different from others.

276
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,040
I think you mishandled this.

277
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:11,160
You shouldn't have told your mom
when you haven't figured it out.

278
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:12,040
Dong,

279
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,658
how long does it take

280
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,959
for one to truly know themselves?

281
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,914
You came to the wrong person.

282
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,479
I'm in a mess myself.

283
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:23,759
But I know there is a gulf between
the perceptions of the two generations.

284
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,142
Don't confront each other
because of your differing thoughts.

285
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,599
You have to trust your family.

286
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,599
Dong, is my sister
considered your family too?

287
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,599
Shouldn't you have more trust in her?

288
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,280
Gosh, you and your family.

289
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:42,160
Ridiculous.

290
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,538
Dong, you said I shouldn't
have told Mom about that.

291
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:47,818
You see, had you
and my sister been fine,

292
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:49,339
I'd bring this up to her first.

293
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,578
It's your fault for ignoring Jie.

294
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,818
She is too miserable to care about

295
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:52,979
He Niaoniao and me.

296
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,979
At the end of the day,

297
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,999
you are to blame.

298
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,938
If you and her were fine,

299
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:58,200
I wouldn't annoy my mom
when I wasn't in my right mind.

300
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,339
So, can you please visit my house

301
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,359
and comfort my mom?

302
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,640
Dong, you are no better than me, though.

303
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,171
I'm going back to campus tomorrow.

304
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,171
You have to drive me
to the train station.

305
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,879
Don't forget, Dong.

306
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:29,759
Thank you, Dong.

307
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,320
There is no need.

308
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:33,400
Focus on your studies

309
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:34,560
and stop upsetting your mom.

310
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,800
Dong, when will you stop icing out Jie?

311
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,280
This is our business.

312
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,160
Don't worry about that.

313
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,219
This isn't a business between you two.

314
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,759
I'm suffering too.

315
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:50,320
Zhuang Yan,

316
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,079
you are a simple boy.

317
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,719
I know what I'm doing.

318
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,979
Jie, what a coincidence.

319
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,800
Zhuang...

320
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:02,759
What a coincidence.

321
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:21,219
Yan, safe trip.

322
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,359
We will come to fetch you next time.

323
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,999
Chen Maidong.

324
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,400
Chen Maidong.

325
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,400
Do you miss me?

326
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:24,920
I do miss you very much.

327
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:28,200
Master.

328
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:30,620
Check for me on how to file a case
for sexual harassment.

329
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,640
Get back to me later.

330
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:37,879
Jeez.

331
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,800
Chen Maidong, jokes aside,

332
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:51,999
you told me to think it through
when I got back to Shanghai.

333
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,200
I have been trying very hard every day.

334
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,370
I came back this time because I heard
that the town government is planning

335
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,999
a medical tourism pilot zone.

336
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,058
This is perfectly aligned

337
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,440
with my startup plan.

338
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:08,080
I wonder which insightful townsman
had such a foresight.

339
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,680
Supposedly, I should lead this case.

340
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,999
Chen Maidong.

341
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,120
Chen Maidong.

342
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:29,559
Mayor.

343
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:30,759
Mr. Su.

344
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,938
Honestly, I'm not familiar

345
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:36,440
with the pilot zone.

346
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,978
I met Mr. Su

347
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:38,999
through Hedgehog.

348
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:41,290
But you have come to a consensus
in such a short period,

349
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,579
I believe Mayor and Madam Wu

350
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,999
must have done a lot of work.

351
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,479
The credit should go to you.

352
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,859
Master, I checked it.

353
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,920
You can call 110 for sexual harassment.

354
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:16,719
Xilun, long time no see.

355
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,400
Jie? It was you in the car?

356
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:23,680
Let me do it.

357
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,759
Order a cab to send her home.

358
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:28,738
Jie, I...

359
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:30,200
No, Xilun. Go on with your work.

360
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:31,519
I'm free today.

361
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,920
I will wait until Chen Maidong
gets off work.

362
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,200
He's still mad at me.

363
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,039
How petty.

364
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,959
He can at least pick a fight with me.

365
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,559
What's this all about?

366
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,018
I apologized to him.

367
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:56,719
Does he have to drag this on and on?

368
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,400
Am I right?

369
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,920
Say something.

370
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,519
I think there must be a reason

371
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,458
why he ignores you.

372
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,859
You should reflect on yourself.

373
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,080
Mom, which side do you take?

374
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,799
Niaoniao, why the silence?

375
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,458
Me? I have nothing to say.

376
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,458
Anyway, Dong is nice to me

377
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,519
whenever I see him.

378
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:22,319
He bought me stationery the other day.

379
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,479
But he never mentioned you.

380
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,120
Traitor.

381
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,840
You guys only sit here
and do nothing.

382
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,539
Give me some ideas.

383
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,279
Or you can give me
some useful information.

384
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,680
Well,

385
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,899
I do realize that Dong has changed.

386
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,799
How so?

387
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,759
The way he dresses has changed.

388
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,120
Ask Mom.

389
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:51,039
I also notice that.

390
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,319
I don't think so.

391
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:57,819
Today, he is wearing the jacket

392
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,178
I bought him.

393
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:00,319
It's the shirt inside.

394
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,600
You didn't notice that, right?

395
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,400
Anyway, all the outfits Dong wears
are especially bright.

396
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,200
His shoes are striking as well.

397
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,360
The peacock is spreading its feathers?

398
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,440
That's rude.

399
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,018
Maidong has always been handsome.

400
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,239
It's just that he dresses better now.

401
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,514
I used to be the one
who decided his outfit.

402
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,210
Why are you nosy
when you have left?

403
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,759
He Niaoniao, do your homework.

404
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,680
Mom, aren't we being too harsh?

405
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,640
No.

406
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,759
She is overconfident

407
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,819
that Maidong won't leave her.

408
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,759
It's good to break her spirit.

409
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,980
(You decide which path you take.)

410
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,559
What's this?

411
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:15,600
Wang Xixia,

412
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,178
you gave me a stupid idea

413
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:18,959
to get Chen Maidong's attention before.

414
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:20,178
I have tons of them.

415
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,139
Which one?

416
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,099
We went to dinner
with a former colleague before

417
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,299
and took a picture.

418
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,539
You said my eyes look seductive.

419
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,299
Oh, the photo that
you look quite sexy, right?

420
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,640
Yes, that one.

421
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,279
Post it on your Moments

422
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:33,470
and make it visible only
to Chen Maidong.

423
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,379
Also,

424
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,859
tag him in that post

425
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,920
and see if he replies.

426
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,799
Didn't you say my idea
was stupid and cheap?

427
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,379
I don't care about all that now.

428
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,200
Chen Maidong is leaving me.

429
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,285
(Today: Meeting at the
town council at 8 AM)

430
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:37,860
(An unread message)

431
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,120
Chen Maidong didn't reply.

432
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,142
(Great Man: How precious spring is.
Don't miss out sunshine and exercise~)

433
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:58,559
A tilde?

434
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:01,039
You seem quite happy, huh? Chen Maidong.

435
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,440
Chen Maidong.

436
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:30,698
How did you get in here?

437
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:32,099
Am I not allowed in your room anymore?

438
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,779
I'm taking a shower. You go out first.

439
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,160
No. We must talk today.

440
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,218
I'm cold.

441
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,719
Let me get dressed first before we talk.

442
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,039
I was cold yesterday.

443
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,258
You know my leg has a problem,

444
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:43,099
yet you left me
till the middle of the night.

445
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,239
Are you sure?

446
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:45,539
I had Feng Xilun inform you

447
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,519
just when I left.

448
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,379
Wait. Let me get dressed first.

449
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,285
No one can cover my shift
if I catch a cold.

450
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,360
Chen Maidong,

451
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,840
do you plan to leave me

452
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,600
and find another woman?

453
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:22,319
That's so typical of you.

454
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:24,330
You speak without
thinking it through.

455
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,440
You are never sincere.

456
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:27,360
I'm never sincere?

457
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,018
I have been explaining and apologizing
to you over the past months.

458
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,680
You are hard to please.

459
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:33,360
That's the problem.

460
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,539
You always try all sorts of tricks

461
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,759
to please me as if I'm a kid.

462
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,400
But I can't feel your sincerity at all.

463
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:44,559
Chen Maidong, I don't know
what to do now.

464
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:47,570
You are never satisfied
with anything I do.

465
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,799
Could you please show me the right way?

466
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,039
I'm not your client.

467
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,978
You don't have to please me

468
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:03,279
as if it were a task.

469
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,139
I hope you can think carefully

470
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,400
and properly about

471
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:08,539
what kind of life

472
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,840
makes you happier.

473
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:11,840
That's the point.

474
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,799
Wang Xixia,

475
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,999
I have never felt so anxious before.

476
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:40,999
I think Chen Maidong

477
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:43,080
has already gotten over me.

478
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:05,139
What if he means to

479
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,239
break up with me?

480
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:09,779
I'm going to give a presentation
at the town council.

481
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,400
But I want to cry now.

482
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:20,120
Hello?

483
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,039
Zhuang Jie, get a grip.

484
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,218
Chen Maidong is stubborn.

485
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,258
It's not easy for him
to fall for someone.

486
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,640
How could he just turn off
his feelings like turning off a tap?

487
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:32,200
If he's stubborn,
you can be even more stubborn.

488
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,099
Think about this.

489
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,139
When you were a rookie,

490
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,738
you got so much of the
cold shoulder from clients. Remember?

491
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:39,680
When you waited for the client's door,

492
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,619
the pet dog peed on you.

493
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,619
Don't you remember that?

494
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,539
You even slept on the Healthcare Street
with your luggage for over a week.

495
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,920
Did you forget all this?

496
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:49,360
You were full of spirit
when you were in Shanghai.

497
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,559
Why have you ended up like a crier
when you are back in Nanping?

498
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,039
Stop scolding me.

499
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,319
Zhuang Jie, soldier on. All right?

500
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,999
I know you are right.

501
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,039
I have to get myself together
no matter how hard it is.

502
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,440
At least, he didn't take away my ring.

503
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,539
I hope you can think carefully

504
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,779
and properly about what kind of life

505
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,160
makes you happier.

506
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,200
That's the point.

507
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,479
Now I get it.

508
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:46,779
Our ways of expressing ourselves

509
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,999
have been very different.

510
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:51,400
You always think I'm facetious.

511
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:54,880
And I don't know how to change it.

512
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,890
After all,
I have gotten used to laughing

513
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,279
when I talk about
sad things over the years.

514
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,559
But now, I'm going to
say this very seriously.

515
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,120
I genuinely like you

516
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,178
and I sincerely want to

517
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:17,759
get engaged with you.

518
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,178
I have never seen you

519
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,200
as a trophy to show off.

520
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:23,759
I really need you.

521
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,559
I want to spend my life
with no one else but you,

522
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,160
no matter what.

523
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,400
But I understand I can't force things.

524
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:37,258
If you are fed up with me

525
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,200
or you have gotten over me,

526
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,600
you can tell me.

527
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,360
Well.

528
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,400
Since you have asked so,

529
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:52,840
I will be frank with you...

530
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:55,790
Something is wrong with your tone.

531
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:57,230
I don't want to listen to it now.

532
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:24,899
Do you have any requests

533
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,418
for your future husband?

534
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:27,360
Ask away.

535
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,978
I want a study upstairs.

536
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:31,319
Only this?

537
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,619
Because you are good enough.

538
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,559
I don't want to be greedy.

539
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,440
What about you?

540
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,099
What's yours?

541
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,999
None.

542
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,160
As long as it's you,

543
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:42,759
everything is the best.

544
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:15,742
Your things have been moved out.

545
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:17,218
Only you are left.

546
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:17,959
Let's go.

547
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:19,559
You are sweating.

548
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,840
Did you take everything?

549
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:23,440
So fast.

550
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,400
Cui.

551
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,799
What's wrong, Ms. Wang?

552
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,519
I don't know

553
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,440
why I suddenly

554
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,360
feel a bit conflicted.

555
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:47,600
What do you mean?

556
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,859
Actually,

557
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,920
this place is closer to my office.

558
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:52,400
Besides,

559
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:54,479
I'm worried about Zhuang Jie.

560
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:57,978
Wait, hear me out.

561
00:30:57,979 --> 00:30:59,120
No.

562
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:01,880
Let me tell you this.

563
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,458
Chen Maidong

564
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:04,959
won't ice her out for long.

565
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,418
You will only be in their way

566
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:08,619
once they make up.

567
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,519
So, just come with me.

568
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:37,859
As you can see from this slide,

569
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,418
healthcare industry

570
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,239
has a great prospect in China.

571
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:42,458
We created this platform,

572
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:45,539
attempting to build a cross-disciplinary
and complementary team

573
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,458
that covers medical,
mechanical engineering, etc.

574
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:49,299
Our ultimate goal is to provide

575
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,258
multiple layers of medical services,

576
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:54,799
which resonates with the medical
tourism pilot zone in the town.

577
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:04,360
Mayor,

578
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:06,080
everyone,

579
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,440
am I too presumptuous

580
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,999
to put myself forward
to propose this plan without informing?

581
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:14,258
No, not at all.

582
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:17,160
We have so much to learn from you.

583
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:20,039
Please don't see me as some kind
of professional expert.

584
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,840
Just consider me a part of Nanping.

585
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,080
Previously, someone

586
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:27,039
said this to my face.

587
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,779
He said I didn't feel attached
to Nanping

588
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,714
because I only came here
when I was a teenager

589
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:34,200
and I gave empty promises.

590
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,640
The one who said this

591
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,160
was Chen Maidong.

592
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:46,039
But I have to admit that he is right.

593
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:49,819
Before this, I helped Yanggou Village
sell Chinese yams

594
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,319
because I wanted to prove myself.

595
00:32:53,459 --> 00:33:00,479
But now, I just want to do my bit
for the hometown from my heart.

596
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,999
Of course, it's also
because of Chen Maidong.

597
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,640
As his name implies,

598
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,658
it may seem like weeds,

599
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,400
but it's also a useful herb.

600
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,120
It grows in the wild,

601
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,914
yet is refreshing
and nourishes the lungs.

602
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,120
I have lucked out
to meet Chen Maidong at this age.

603
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:26,738
Because I have come across some paths

604
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,920
and people and made mistakes.

605
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:30,959
That's why I truly understand

606
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:32,099
that a vast world

607
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,120
isn't merely geographical,

608
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:36,160
but also about a fulfilled heart.

609
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:41,959
I want to contribute to the medical
tourism pilot zone in my hometown.

610
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:44,039
As this will make me feel

611
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,920
that I'm closer to my loved ones,

612
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,479
not just in physical distance,

613
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,680
but also in shared values.

614
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:54,360
Jie, well said.

615
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,880
Let me continue to elaborate
on my proposal.

616
00:33:57,939 --> 00:33:58,719
Go on.

Yeah.

629
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,779
You wouldn't let me
finish speaking that day,

630
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,040
so I can only continue here.

631
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:48,759
I'm sorry, Chen Maidong.

632
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,498
During this period,

633
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:53,439
I have made many proposal plans.

634
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,839
Still, I couldn't plan out our future.

635
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,160
Because it's never your own business.

636
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:21,600
But you were so mad at me last time.

637
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,960
Zhuang Jie, haven't you
worked it out yet?

638
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:29,719
What I mind is never that you are
going back to Shanghai.

639
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:32,879
It's that you don't see me
as your partner

640
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,120
even though you have chosen
to get engaged to me.

641
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:38,578
I thought...

642
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:42,239
You thought you did it
for my sake and ours.

643
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:45,458
But have you realized

644
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,279
that you always
made the decision yourself?

645
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,640
You don't trust me completely.

646
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:54,919
Right, I didn't consider you.

647
00:36:57,459 --> 00:37:00,000
I like that you are smart, independent,

648
00:37:00,057 --> 00:37:01,514
and have a mind of your own.

649
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,239
And because of that,

650
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:08,160
you flinch when there is a change
in our relationship.

651
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,520
You fear that the future

652
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,879
might eat away your independence.

653
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,239
That's probably it.

654
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,120
Zhuang Jie,

655
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:28,299
I have never doubted

656
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,640
your feelings for me.

657
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,719
But marriage can't be sustained
by impulsiveness or jolly jokes,

658
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,680
nor can strategy maintain it
without tactics.

659
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,609
So, I wasn't giving you

660
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,314
the cold shoulder during this time.

661
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,520
I just hope you can
see yourself more clearly

662
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,439
and not make any decisions you regret

663
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,839
because of pressure.

664
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:54,279
Go back to Shanghai.

665
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,000
For our future,

666
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,480
we will figure something out.

667
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,359
I didn't think I did anything wrong.

668
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:09,000
But why do I feel guilty?

669
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,799
It's never easy for girls

670
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,080
to juggle love life and career.

671
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,120
You did your best.

672
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,600
Chen Maidong,

673
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,319
do you remember that I told you

674
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:37,640
to learn to love someone

675
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,719
instead of waiting to be loved?

676
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:45,759
You have done so much better than I do.

677
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,359
You taught me about love.

678
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:57,520
Next, let's both learn to love.

how many times
do I have to tell you this?

Stop buying me food.

692
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:53,040
I gained two kilograms.

693
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,160
But you said

694
00:39:58,419 --> 00:39:59,578
you didn't know what to eat

695
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:00,919

00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,000
Why don't we eat together
from a distance?

to receive everyone's blessing

698
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:09,339

00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,759
So cheesy.

703
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,319
How did it get delivered here?

704
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,200
Give me the card.

705
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,040
Chen Maidong,

706
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,759
I just finished a lengthy meeting.

707
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,239
I guess I spoke more today
than you do in a year.

708
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,020
(Pick up Zhuang Jie)

709
00:40:56,828 --> 00:40:58,390
Whenever it gets closer to the evening,

710
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,520
I miss Nanping even more.

711
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,680
The scooter bike
takes me wherever I want to go.

712
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,000
To eat a bowl of noodles
for less than ten yuan.

713
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,160
Most importantly,

714
00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:09,879
you are there.

715
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:13,138
If I weren't in this industry,

716
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,680
I might not have stayed in Nanping.

717
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,458
People always say

718
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:18,399
we have plenty of days ahead.

719
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,569
But lives are unpredictable,

720
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,600
and there might not
be a future to look forward to.

721
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:24,930
So, you should cherish wherever you are.

722
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:25,759
Did you hear me?

723
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,319
Chen Maidong,

724
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:31,600
I love you.

00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,879
I love only you.

I love you.

00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,279
I love you too.

732
00:41:56,438 --> 00:41:57,654
I love you too.

733
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,480
When will we meet next?

734
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:25,200
Niaoniao,

735
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,759
I can't help with your homework today.

736
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:31,279
I came to Shanghai to judge
a funeral services competition.

737
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,120
Right.

738
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,040
I want to give Jie a surprise.

739
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,000
Don't tell her.

740
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,879
Miss, you must be a local here, right?

741
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:52,799
I have sharp eyes, you know?

742
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:54,759
Can you tell by my accent?

743
00:42:55,979 --> 00:42:57,000
No, right?

744
00:42:58,419 --> 00:42:59,680
I'm from Dongbei.

745
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,978
I left home when I was young.

746
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,000
I have been to many places
over the years.

747
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,719
But of all places, I prefer Shanghai.

748
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,160
It's as good as any other country.

749
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,498
Whenever I'm not driving,

750
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:12,379
I wander around Yu Graden, Lujiazui,

751
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,742
and the City God Temple of Shanghai.

752
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,538
You have more opportunities

753
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:16,498
to observe and practice

754
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:18,000
before your graduation.

755
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,759
If you are still determined

756
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:22,359
to stay in the funeral industry,

757
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:24,200
I hope you remember this.

758
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,080
The more honest we are,

759
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,680
the more at ease the families are.

760
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:35,040
You see, no one can plan
their lives meticulously.

761
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,370
We can make decisions accordingly.

762
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,138
Sir. Sir.

763
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:39,319
Sir!

764
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:52,879
Wait.

765
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,200
To me,

766
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,759
there are only two kinds of partings:

767
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,200
Parting in life

768
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:08,640
or parting by death.

769
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,520
I used to think

770
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,759
that the latter was
the most painful thing.

771
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:16,960
However, just a few minutes ago,

772
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,759
when a parting in life
turned into a parting by death,

773
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,480
I suddenly realized that the former

774
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,839
was the scariest thing ever.

775
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:29,319
Zhuang Jie,

776
00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:31,520
I don't want to endure this anymore.

777
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:38,359
Right now, I don't want you
to leave my world in any way.

778
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,919
Are you all right?

779
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,620
(Deceased's information,

780
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,659
Your vehicle is bigger than mine.

781
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,018
Who can avoid this better?

782
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:38,219
You ought to be careful.

783
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,299
I'm all right, sir.

784
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,018
I'm good.

785
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:40,659
I'm so sorry.

786
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,138
(Great Man)

787
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,259
I have a family to feed.

788
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,399

All right.

796
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,239
Maybe you should answer
your phone first.

797
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:17,560

I'm heading back to Nanping to find you.

802
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,239
Wait for me.

803
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:36,480

Not really.

807
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,719
I came here for you.

808
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:47,719

Wasn't the gate locked?

I left the gate unlocked.

Mom, look.

862
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,420

864
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,819
Should we return it to the goose farm?

865
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,469
The goose farm is rich.

866
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:54,771
They won't care if one runs away.

867
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:56,860
It's terrible to force a couple
to break up.

868
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:58,219
Nonsense.

869
00:54:58,399 --> 00:55:00,219
Either we give them a call

870
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,179
or we buy the goose.

871
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,070
It's their business
whether to take the goose back.

872
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,038

873
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,540

876
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:17,719

you can skip the essay

885
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,219
No, I won't.

886
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:38,759

has come back to us.

Everything will look up soon, all right?
