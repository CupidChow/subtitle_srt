00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,100
(Seven Days Ago)

2
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,958
If you're that capable,

3
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:34,838
you should keep talking

4
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:36,189
when you're on the surgical table.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,719
(Doctor,)

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,039
(laparoscopic cholecystectomy)

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,518
(isn't that dangerous, right?)

8
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:48,399
(Our surgical technology)

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,079
(is very mature now.)

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,719
(However, everyone
has a different constitution.)

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,710
(I still suggest Zhuang Jie
to rest and recuperate after surgery.)

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,440
(But with this profession of ours,)

13
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,509
(how can I keep her in Shanghai?)

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,679
(You see...)

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,598
(In Operation)

16
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:01,439
(But please don't worry.)

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,079
(I'll do everything I can)

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,439
(to persuade her
to return to our hometown)

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,079
(and rest and recuperate there.)

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,038
(That's right.)

21
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:08,389
(She can treat it as a holiday.)

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,949
(A holiday, huh?)

23
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,318
(This is my first holiday)

24
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,790
(ever since I joined the workforce.)

25
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,279
(But as my hometown friend,)

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,878
(colleague,)

27
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,109
(and bosom friend,)

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,719
(since Wang Xixia has already made
the necessary arrangement,)

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,990
(I'll have no choice but to oblige.)

30
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,999
(I've lived in Shanghai for many years.)

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,318
(My hometown, Nanping,)

32
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,070
(isn't as familiar to me.)

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,669
(I only remember that it was a town
that was beside mountains and the ocean.)

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,079
(There are 18 administrative villages)

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,949
(and 26 natural villages.)

36
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,080
(The total population is 390,000.)

37
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,120
(There are pharmaceutical factories
that are listed on the market)

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,840
(and electrical appliance factories
and porcelain factories)

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,670
( that have achieved
consecutive years of revenue growth.)

40
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,678
(I heard)

41
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,749
(that the tourism sector was growing too.)

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,238
(On the business streets)

43
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,479
(that influencers often checked in,)

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,919
(there's)

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,789
(a stunning view.)

46
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,438
(That is Madam Liao Tao's)

47
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,550
(braised chicken shop.)

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,958
(Liao Tao?)

49
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,280
(You guys have seen her before.)

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,110
(She's my mother.)

51
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,638
(Nanping Famous Restaurant)
(This woman who changes her expressions rapidly)

52
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,479
(and doesn't mean what she said)

53
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,998
(got married to Mr. He)

54
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:38,199
(with me and Zhuang Yan)

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,670
(when she was 35 years old.)

56
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,118
(Mr. He is my father's old comrade.)

57
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,469
(He doesn't speak much and is very kind.)

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,039
(To us,)

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,469
(he's the best stepfather in the world.)

60
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,159
(Especially when the sensitive Zhuang Yan)

61
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,319
(gradually became a thorn)

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,869
(in my mother's eyes.)

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,029
(As the lubricant of the family, Mr. He)

64
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,830
(has an important position in the family.)

65
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,599
(When Madam Liao Tao was 40,)

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,909
(she gave birth to my sister,
He Niaoniao.)

67
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,838
(She's just like
a stream of spring breeze.)

68
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:17,958
(She brought me and Zhuang Yan)

69
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,718
(endless laughter.)

70
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,118
(However, she also
brought endless trouble)

71
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,150
(to my mother and Mr. He.)

72
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,118
(However,)

73
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,150
(even my family members don't know)

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,789
(that there's one individual in Nanping
who left a deep impression on me.)

75
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,718
(Although we haven't met for many years,)

76
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,430
(and his personality
is still as eccentric as ever,)

77
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,558
(I'm still happy)

78
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,998
(to be able to reunite with him.)

79
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,240
(Women' Singles Champion)
(That individual is)

80
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,040
(Chen Maidong.)

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,950
Grandma.

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,230
As for this...

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,238
Isn't this Granny Lin's expertise?

84
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,589
You!

85
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,799
Stop interrupting me.

86
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,990
I'm already frustrated enough.

87
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,039
You're asking me if
they have an affinity with each other?

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,960
I guess they have more
than just affinity with each other.

89
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,589
Maybe there is a deeper bond between them.

90
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,749
A deeper bond?

91
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,839
=Will Love In Spring=

92
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,859

"Lover" by She Mu Si)

=Episode 3=

94
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,469
My son!

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,589
My son!

96
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,198
You were only 17!

97
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,678
The cops and
the medical examiner just left.

98
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,080
They confirmed that he drowned
by accident when he was swimming.

99
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,310
It's been more than 36 hours.

100
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,669
That child was only 17.

101
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,229
He argued with his parents
a few days ago.

102
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,638
They thought

103
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,238
that he was living
at his classmate's house.

104
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,630
That's why they didn't look for him.

105
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,118
My son!

106
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,270
Please accept our condolences.
We're from Nanping Funeral Parlor.

107
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,789
Leave your child to us.

108
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,989
We'll make the necessary arrangements.
Please don't worry.

109
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:40,678
Let's go.

110
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,710
My son!

111
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,310
My son!

112
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,719
My son!

113
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,549
Let's go.

114
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,109
My son!

115
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,399
Have you prepared

116
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,589
the gurney and the hearse?

117
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,909
The road was hard to traverse.
We only arrived not long ago.

118
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,870
Did that child discover the victim?

119
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,678
Yes.

120
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,669
I think it's the child we saw
in the restaurant yesterday.

121
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,029
He's dumbfounded.

122
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,280
Even ordinary folks
can't stand the sight when the corpse

123
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,560
has been immersed in water for so long.

124
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,070
Reconfirm it.

125
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:31,190
Is your name

126
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,270
Zhuang Yan?

127
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,999
We're going to take his body back.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,029
Are you okay?

129
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,360
Do you want us to
tell your family members to pick you up?

130
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,470
Where are you guys taking him?

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,350
To my workplace.

132
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,240
We'll see him off on his last journey.

133
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,150
I'll go as well.

134
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,350
May I?

135
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,230
Only family members

136
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,029
are allowed to observe the rites.

137
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,990
Just let me stay there for a while.

138
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,870
Please.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,990
Xilun,

140
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:07,829
take him to my car.

141
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,270
Please follow me.

142
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,549
Jie!

143
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,870
Sorry. Please stop here.

144
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,870
Let me take a breather.

145
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,999
Xilun, you should head back first.

146
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,390
Okay, Master.

147
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,309
You can sit here
and take a break for now.

148
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,510
I might be very busy later.

149
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,110
I might have no time to tend to you.

150
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,189
I'm very sorry

151
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:09,630
that you received such a shock.

152
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:13,750
That boy is almost my age,

153
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,829
right?

154
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,560
He was supposed
to take the NCEE next year.

155
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,150
What's his name?

156
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,470
Trust me.

157
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,110
No matter how much you know about him,

158
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,558
it won't help you

159
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,829
in alleviating your negative emotions.

160
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,590
I always thought

161
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,270
that things with names

162
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,029
contain a soul.

163
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:47,350
I'm sure he has a great name too.

164
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,799
The kind where his parents

165
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,270
expect great things
from him since young.

166
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,519
Maybe they'll hope

167
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,870
that he'll become someone extraordinary.

168
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,478
Or maybe they'll hope

169
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:56,759
that he would live a long life

170
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,110
in peace.

171
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,110
Jie,

172
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,119
that boy's life

173
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,029
hasn't even started yet.

174
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,150
He didn't even
get to realize his dreams.

175
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,870
He vanished just like that.

176
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,598
He didn't live a glorious life

177
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,350
or have a memorial tablet
erected after him.

178
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,669
Soon,

179
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,879
no one in this world

180
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,958
will remember him

181
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,949
except for his parents.

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,390
What's the point

183
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,029
of a life like that?

184
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,709
To humans, death is the most helpless

185
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,549
yet fairest event in our lives.

186
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,189
The weight of one's ash

187
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,838
weighs between 1,800g

188
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,230
to 3,100g.

189
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,350
Whether one was successful or not
doesn't matter.

190
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,270
It's already meaningful

191
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,470
as long as they've existed before.

192
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,510
Yan,

193
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,470
have you not heard
of this saying before?

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,639
Sometimes, misfortunes

195
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,309
do haunt good people too.

196
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,829
I think you'll be able to understand

197
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,949
if you just look at me.

198
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,870
Some people once told me...

199
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,584
Even a crutch could be used as a weapon.

200
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,119
Even a crutch could be used as a weapon.

201
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,429
I believed him.

202
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,150
That's why I'm doing pretty well.

203
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,390
Humans are very resilient.

204
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,110
No matter if it's you

205
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,350
or the parents of that child,

206
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:54,990
everyone will get over it soon.

207
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,189
I have to resume my work.

208
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,510
You guys should head back earlier.

209
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,870
Let's go home.

210
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,949
Thank you.

211
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,350
Is Zhuang Yan asleep?

212
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,838
He took half of a sleeping pill.

213
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,549
He finally fell asleep.

214
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,949
Who told him to go to that remote area

215
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,390
instead of staying at home?

216
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,590
That's enough.

217
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,358
Zhuang Yan

218
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,759
didn't want to encounter it either.

219
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,390
Stop pulling a long face.

220
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,198
I just think that he's too fragile

221
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,279
as a man.

222
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,358
Look at him.

223
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:35,558
He's scared witless.

224
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,799
He Niaoniao was the one

225
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,150
who found his pet for him.

226
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:39,999
The coroner already said

227
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,039
that the bloated corpse

228
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,110
was a disturbing sight.

229
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,838
Everyone has to
take some time off after seeing that.

230
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:45,519
Besides,

231
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,318
you shouldn't just keep
talking about gender.

232
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:49,438
Who said that boys shouldn't cry

233
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,318
or be afraid?

234
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,270
You're being a sexist here.

235
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,838
You always side with your brother.

236
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,390
Everything's my fault, huh?

237
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,870
You said he was reliable.

238
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,829
The only thing he's good at
is taking exams.

239
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,230
He hasn't contributed
a single cent for the family yet,

240
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,270
and now, he wants to quit school.

241
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,750
It's just his thought.

242
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,390
You shouldn't jump to conclusions first.

243
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,750
Let's take a step back.

244
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,358
All roads lead to Rome, you know?

245
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,709
Rome?

246
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,039
If he can still rule over Nanping

247
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,438
after quitting school,

248
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:17,159
I'll kneel

249
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,750
and kowtow to him.

250
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:22,718
How long does it take

251
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,159
to cook this?

252
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,429
You should sleep earlier.

253
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,838
I think you're easily irritated

254
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,189
due to lack of sleep.

255
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,630
Stop trying to analyze me.

256
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:31,478
You think I'm willing to stand here

257
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,838
and cook this for the entire night?

258
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,590
I had enough of this long ago.

259
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,598
I would've rented a factory building

260
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,829
in the developmental zone last year
if it weren't for you guys.

261
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,360
Everything would've been automatized.

262
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,800
I wouldn't need
to go through all of this.

263
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,630
That's great.

264
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,078
I agree with
that notion of yours completely.

265
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,110
Rent it?

266
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,630
You expect me to sell my kidneys?

267
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,750
My savings and Mr. He's savings

268
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,838
were all used up

269
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,150
to buy houses for you three.

270
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,350
You bought houses?

271
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,470
You bought one for me too?

272
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,189
Aren't you my daughter?

273
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,829
Of course you have to be included.

274
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:04,749
Mom,

275
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,638
I already told you long ago.

276
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:07,679
I won't return to this town.

277
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,469
Even if you did buy it,
you should rent it out.

278
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,999
Didn't you say

279
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,719
that all roads lead to Rome?

280
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,398
The main focus

281
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,158
is the road and Rome,

282
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,150
not the countryside and Nanping.

283
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,110
What?

284
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,909
Do you want to talk about
the inner world with me as well?

285
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,918
Shanghai is your Rome, huh?

286
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,870
You think this town
is too small for you.

287
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,078
That's not what I mean.

288
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,959
What do you mean, then?

289
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,790
Tell me.

290
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,590
Tell me.

291
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,239
My son is useless

292
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,949
while my daughters make me worried.

293
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,318
I...

294
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,229
I wonder why I'm working so hard.

295
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,358
Didn't I tell you

296
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,719
to be frugal at home?

297
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,590
So what if you're trendy?
No one is looking at you.

298
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,800
You should wear the pair with
the anti-slipping sole that He made for you.

299
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,229
What?

300
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,030
You should tell me
if you're out of money.

301
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,000
Your son may not be earning money,
but your daughter is earning quite a lot.

302
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,350
I don't want your money.

303
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:22,709
What?

304
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,110
Are you favoring
sons over daughters now?

305
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,358
You can only depend on your son

306
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,679
to continue your bloodline, huh?

307
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,759
Are you afraid

308
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,759
of owing your daughter a favor

309
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,310
now that she's trying to give you money?

310
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,398
No one in this town

311
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:39,989
can win an argument against you three.

312
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:55,749
Mom,

313
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,679
I love to stay

314
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,350
beside you and Mr. He.

315
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,830
It's very comfortable.

316
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,150
But it's too comfortable.

317
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,189
It'll polish my determination away.

318
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,350
I can stay here for a short while.

319
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,590
But I cannot stay here
for the rest of my life.

320
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,509
I have to strive to improve myself

321
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,229
because I'm physically disabled.

322
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,358
Ever since I got into Shanghai,

323
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,870
I decided

324
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,550
that I must be more determined
than ordinary people.

325
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,630
I'm going to be Nanping's pride and joy.

326
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,870
I'll spread my roots in Shanghai.

327
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,909
I'm going

328
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,189
to climb higher and higher

329
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,709
so that I can see

330
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,070
the beautiful view up there.

331
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,558
(Madam Zhang's Tailor Shop)

332
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,679
Here. Thank you.

333
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,630
Okay.

334
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,709
One chicken, right?

335
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,358
Liao Tao!

336
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,318
Hurry up!

337
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,790
Fill out this form for me.

338
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,638
Where did you come from?

339
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,070
You're sweating so much.

340
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,070
Because I'm tied up in official duties.

341
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,479
The mayor intends

342
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,519
to gather all the undergraduates
who are studying or working

343
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,719
in other states

344
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,719
for a tea party

345
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,790
during the Labor Day holiday.

346
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,878
I've been finding them
one household after another

347
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,070
to complete the census.

348
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,358
When I reached your household,

349
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,078
I couldn't find

350
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,398
the household information of Zhuang Yan.

351
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,390
Look.

352
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,669
This is so frustrating.

353
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,318
It's been so many years.

354
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,030
You can just tell him to fill it again.

355
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,358
Look at what you're saying.

356
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,310
I need to check and update
all these profiles every year.

357
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,118
Do you think this is about
the missing information?

358
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:06,759
It's a humiliation

359
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,679
toward my professionalism!

360
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,350
This is so infuriating.

361
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,118
Menopause

362
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,630
is terrible!

363
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,240
I can't do anything right,
yet I can't stop myself from eating.

364
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,830
Sometimes, I even hate myself.

365
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,239
Me too.

366
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,269
This has nothing to do with menopause.

367
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,638
If I have to blame someone,

368
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:28,838
I'll blame it on Zhuang Yan.

369
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,838
Nothing goes well

370
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,390
when he's involved.

371
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,519
Why are you blaming him for it?

372
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,358
What has this got to do with that child?

373
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,398
You're lucky that
you don't have a son like him.

374
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,520
You'll lose ten years of life
if you just take a glance at him.

375
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,269
No one is perfect, you know?

376
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,239
You should be grateful

377
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,838
that you have a great daughter.

378
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,838
Just now,

379
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,838
I saw Zhuang Jie

380
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,799
bringing He Niaoniao

381
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,598
to buy clothing for you and He.

382
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,719
How could they be the same?

383
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,070
Zhuang Jie suffered together
with us since young.

384
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,558
I don't want her

385
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,398
to suffer anymore.

386
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,550
Didn't you buy a house
for her here in secret?

387
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,039
Even so, she has to appreciate it.

388
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,318
She even talked back to me last night.

389
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,630
If I must say,

390
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,630
with her legs

391
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,759
and her vigor,

392
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,880
I don't think it's easy for her
to find a husband in Shanghai.

393
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,110
Don't worry.

394
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,719
You can leave this to me

395
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,630
as long as she's willing to come back.

396
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,239
Stop bragging.

397
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,439
You should deal with

398
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,178
that pesky Madam Chen
before you say anything else.

399
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:21,078
My goodness.

400
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,469
That Madam Chen is truly something else.

401
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,638
Now, the entire town committee

402
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:26,429
avoid her when they see her.

403
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,469
In my opinion,

404
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,398
I think

405
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:31,878
the girl who's marrying into her family

406
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:33,909
must be the unluckiest girl
in the world.

407
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,799
Sometimes,

408
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,999
I sympathize

409
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,150
with Chen Maidong, her grandson.

410
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,279
Jie,

411
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,358
I'll improve my grades by myself, okay?

412
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,909
Just stay out of this.

413
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:48,999
Hurry up.

414
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,439
Jie, are you taking me
to register for tuition classes again?

415
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,878
I won't waste my money on that.

416
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:53,479
But I found

417
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,039
a better way for you to attend tuition.

418
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,838
But Jie...

419
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,429
Shut up. No negotiations allowed.

420
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,429
Jie?

421
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:02,630
Madam.

422
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,909
Where are you going?

423
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,638
I was planning
to buy some food from your family

424
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,679
since I wasn't going to cook tonight.

425
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,078
Please go ahead. My mother is around.

426
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,279
I'll tell her to give you a discount.

427
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,759
You can treat it as
us thanking Chen Maidong

428
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,350
for taking care of Zhuang Yan.

429
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,709
No need for that.

430
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,118
Indeed.

431
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,078
From now on,

432
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,269
we should help each other
since we're a family.

433
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,989
What do you mean by "we're a family"?

434
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,838
That means

435
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,479
your sister, Zhuang Jie,

436
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,078
and my grandson, Chen Maidong,

437
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,949
are destined to get married.

438
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,110
You see,

439
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,870
no one can avoid their fate.

440
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,279
You must've lost your mind.

441
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,318
Wait!

442
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,669
Come here!

443
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,959
Jie,

444
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,479
don't blame me for being frank.

445
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,039
Both of you are adults now.

446
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,709
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

447
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,799
I've done divination for you guys.

448
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,279
Madam,

449
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,239
we don't believe in superstition.

450
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,118
Alright, then.

451
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:59,310
Let's talk about it objectively.

452
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,189
Are you single?

453
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,039
You are about the same age as Dong.

454
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,110
And, you two
know each other pretty well, right?

455
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,550
That makes it, then.

456
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,078
Look at him. He's handsome.

457
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,719
You're very beautiful.

458
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,759
There's no reason

459
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,669
for you two not to be with each other.

460
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,790
Madam,

461
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:25,110
thank you for taking a liking to me.

462
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,550
To be honest,

463
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,918
I did have feelings

464
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,550
for your grandson.

465
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,719
I thought Chen Maidong

466
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,669
was pretty nice
when I was in high school.

467
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,318
But it was

468
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,799
so long ago.

469
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,398
Scientists said

470
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,279
that human cells

471
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,118
are renewed once every seven years.

472
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,519
Now, we're totally different.
I lost all of my feelings for him.

473
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,078
He's just like a stranger to me now.

474
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,799
That's even better.

475
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,918
You guys can get
to know each other again. It'll be fun!

476
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:53,959
I came back to Nanping

477
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,358
for a holiday.

478
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,030
I'll be returning to Shanghai soon.

479
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,199
Chen Maidong and I

480
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,630
can only be friends.

481
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,390
I mustn't ruin his future.

482
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,630
Thanks.

483
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,590
Hey!

484
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,199
Jie!

485
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,918
Listen to me!

486
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:09,759
I'm not lying!

487
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,439
You two are truly

488
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,070
destined to be together!

489
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:14,790
Thanks, huh?

490
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:17,429
Thanks my foot.

491
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,189
Let's go!

492
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,638
Grandma,

493
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:27,110
that's the second time.

494
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,669
Can you please stop embarrassing me
in front of other people?

495
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,358
I'm not familiar with Zhuang Jie at all.

496
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,519
Stay out of this.

497
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,630
Grandma.

498
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,118
Be honest with me.

499
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,398
Have I ever tried this hard

500
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:37,878
to help you court a girl before this?

501
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:40,429
Why did you have to pick Zhuang Jie
out of all the girls out there?

502
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,870
Did Madam Lin
put a curse on you?

503
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,870
Don't slander her.

504
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,158
Lin has been

505
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,118
teaching me how to recite poems lately.

506
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,199
Recite poems?

507
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,679
That sounds scary.

508
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,040
What kinds of poems do you recite?

509
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,989
Chen Maidong,

510
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,590
you're overstepping your boundaries.

511
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,398
You think you can test me now?

512
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,630
I dare not do so.

513
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,709
I just wish to translate it for you.

514
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,918
Maybe I can make up a version

515
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:04,790
that's unrelated to Zhuang Jie.

516
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:07,479
Heaven's secrets are not to be divulged.

517
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,558
I've already

518
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,719
made up my mind.

519
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,229
Since you're not doing it yourself,

520
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,679
I'm casting away my pride

521
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,229
to court Jie on your behalf.

522
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,350
Grandma.

523
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,350
Grandma!

524
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,909
Can you stop messing around?

525
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,039
Fine.

526
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,630
I'll give you a second choice.

527
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,358
Call your parents back.

528
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,118
Tell them to bring their
remarriage partners

529
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,078
and family members here.

530
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,078
We'll hold

531
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,918
an official family meeting

532
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,070
and talk about your personal issues.

533
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:38,469
There's no need to resort to that.

534
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,479
Now, you know

535
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,509
the definition of messing around.

536
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,310
Fine.

537
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,039
I...

538
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,390
I'll consider it seriously.

539
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,110
Kid,

540
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:58,350
I assume your skills in picking up girls

541
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,070
haven't grown rusty yet, right?

542
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,070
I never had that skill
in the first place.

543
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,949
All the girls court me.

544
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,150
I dare you to be cocky again!

545
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,030
I dare you to be cocky again!

546
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,749
You brat!

547
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,638
This time,

548
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:33,830
He Niaoniao is learning for real.

549
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,799
Her drawing board

550
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,429
looked full.

551
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,229
Really?

552
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,709
Really.

553
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,239
Is that class monitor of hers a wizard?

554
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,909
Did he actually change the nature of
this underachiever in one afternoon?

555
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:49,360
This is what you call teaching
students according to their aptitude.

556
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,680
He Niaoniao likes handsome guys.

557
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,679
Her class monitor is upright and handsome.

558
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,999
Of course she'll study hard

559
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,199
if they study together.

560
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,838
Great job.

561
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,598
The thing is,

562
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,189
why did he agree to it?

563
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,749
Zhuang Jie,

564
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,189
seems like
you did something drastic again.

565
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,669
You're the best
at belittling your children.

566
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:06,638
If He Niaoniao

567
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:07,999
wants to please someone,

568
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,669
no one in the world can stop her.

569
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,078
Do you think being witty alone
can make this work?

570
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,989
I'm sure your sister
spent a lot of money this time.

571
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,838
Of course I can't go there empty-handed.

572
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,318
I bought him some tonics.

573
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,870
But that's not what they're after.

574
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:22,360
Mainly, they're grateful to me
that I contacted the provincial hospital

575
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,550
for a checkup
and got them an insider's price.

576
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,999
Look at her.

577
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,959
Nowadays,

578
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,830
you have to go so far
just to please someone.

579
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:30,949
You know nothing.

580
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,799
You think that you
can just carry drawing board around

581
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,909
and that you can survive.

582
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:37,749
You won't be able to sell any drawings
if you don't know how to deal with people.

583
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,638
Jie is here.

584
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:40,558
She can promote

585
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,439
even He Niaoniao.

586
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,949
I'm sure she can help to sell drawings.

587
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,598
Madam Wu wants you
to go to the mayor's tea party tomorrow.

588
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,150
Tell me whether you're going or not.

589
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:50,039
I don't know how to deal with people.

590
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,469
Tell Jie to go on my behalf.

591
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,720
Fine. I'll go.

592
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,340
Zhuang Yan, you must strike
while the iron is hot.

593
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,840
Keep an eye on He Niaoniao
while she studies.

594
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,469
Okay.

595
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,439
What?

596
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,709
You're being so sneaky.

597
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,669
Yan,

598
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:26,590
you have two choices.

599
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,719
It's either you sit here as an audience

600
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,429
or join me in solving this issue.

601
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,199
I choose none of it.

602
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,630
I'm sure you've messed up again.

603
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,279
Mom!

604
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,830
Yan!

605
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:46,949
Yan!

606
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,310
I assume you don't know him.

607
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,999
What makes you think so?

608
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,909
This is Dong.

609
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,398
He's an outstanding person.

610
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:54,719
He even won your heart

611
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,229
in just a few days?

612
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,790
What do you mean by that?

613
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,078
Where did you hear about

614
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,358
all of these?

615
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,390
Jie mustn't be together

616
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,590
with Chen Maidong.

617
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,479
Why?

618
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,439
It's because Jie

619
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,350
let her tongue slip today.

620
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,638
I did have feelings

621
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,679
for your grandson.

622
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,590
But it was so long ago.

623
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,070
What?

624
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,509
Isn't it peculiar?

625
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,709
Both of us were kept in the dark.

626
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,158
You almost duped me.

627
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,158
I was only four

628
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:24,390
when Jie was transferred

629
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,398
to the high school here.

630
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:27,519
You weren't even born yet.
As if you know anything about them.

631
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,918
That's not the point here.

632
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,719
The thing is,
our sister was always a frank person.

633
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Why has she never mentioned
her first love to us before?

634
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,669
First love?

635
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,630
Why are you jumping to conclusions here?

636
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,959
Yan,

637
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,989
both of them had a peculiar relationship
since high school.

638
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:42,590
Both the high school and middle school
students knew about their relationship.

639
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,880
Why did you think it was that famous?

640
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,310
It's because they don't suit each other.

641
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,669
Anyway, I have plenty of reasons to suspect

642
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,989
that Chen Maidong

643
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,550
has been inside my sister's heart
all these years.

644
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,039
He's using psychic powers

645
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,350
to gaslight our sister,

646
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,630
causing her to remain single until now.

647
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,730
(Hongxu Cargo Terminal)

648
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,479
Pass.

649
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,519
Pass. I don't have any.

650
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,240
- You have none, right?
- Who dealt these hands?

651
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,909
He's here.

652
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,070
Six!

653
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:22,350
Why don't you join us?

654
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,199
You're finally free today.

655
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,189
Go.

656
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,469
Six.

657
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,318
Nine.

658
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,269
Ten.

659
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,390
Circle.

660
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,590
Joker of Diamond.

661
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,709
Joker of Spade.

662
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,830
My turn.

663
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:34,878
Pass.

664
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:36,150
Pass.

665
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,590
A pair of 8.

666
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,479
So, did your grandma whoop your butt

667
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,949
and you're here to hide from her?

668
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,350
Shut up.

669
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,429
Dong,

670
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,709
why did I hear

671
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,229
that your grandma
stopped a girl in public?

672
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,949
There's no use staring at me.

673
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,799
Our town is tiny.

674
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,790
The latest gossip will spread
in the town within two hours.

675
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,989
Just don't spread it to me.

676
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,630
Did you guys know who Dong's grandma
stopped in public?

677
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:07,469
Who was it?

678
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,749
Zhuang Jie.

679
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,480
It's the girl who can't walk properly
who was transferred

680
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,880
to our high school
during our first year.

681
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,830
It's her?

682
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:14,790
Enough.

683
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,799
I saw her on the streets
two days ago.

684
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,110
She looked like a normal person to me.

685
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,269
The medical technology of modern cities
is amazing indeed.

686
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,558
You don't say?

687
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,838
I didn't dare to speak with her

688
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,310
when I saw her in the past.

689
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,719
It felt as if

690
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,598
she was

691
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,398
very depressed.

692
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,509
Change the topic.

693
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,189
Let's change the topic.

694
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,279
Four.

695
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,229
Six.

696
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,870
Now, Zhuang Jie

697
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,350
is totally different.

698
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,469
When she stands in
the middle of the crowd,

699
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:41,598
she's eye-catching.

700
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,669
She's beautiful.

701
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,838
It's no wonder his grandma

702
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,110
lost her mind.

703
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,709
I told you to change the topic!

704
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,239
Chen Maidong,

705
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,630
you better don't push your luck.

706
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,509
Right now, we feel the same

707
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,070
as your grandmother.

708
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,630
When you were in high school,

709
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,429
you were renowned

710
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,899
for your terrible temper

711
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:13,000
and your tendency to rule with
an iron fist as a rich man's son.

712
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,909
But now?

713
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,279
He's left on the shelf!

714
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,709
What's going on?

715
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,429
If I must say, you should rekindle
your past relationship

716
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,039
with Zhuang Jie.

717
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,550
Rekindle my foot.

718
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,709
You guys were the ones
who spread the rumor.

719
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,679
Who said so?

720
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,269
We dare not do so.

721
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,598
You see,

722
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,790
there's no smoke without fire, you know?

723
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,550
No smoke without fire, huh?

724
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,118
What? We can talk this over.
There's no need to get violent.

725
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,189
Chen Maidong,

726
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,150
you were decent
when you were in your workplace.

727
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,239
Why are you acting like a thug
in our place?

728
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,790
You're forcing me
to state the obvious, huh?

729
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,070
Go ahead.

730
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,638
If you fail to subdue me today,

731
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:51,110
I'll make sure you learn your lesson!

732
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,269
Stop! What are you doing?

733
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,199
Chen Maidong!

734
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,150
You know the best how you were involved
in the scandal with Zhuang Jie!

735
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,878
Back then,

736
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:00,719
you were a tyrant!

737
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,838
How could you fall under the control
of an unremarkable girl

738
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,150
who can't even walk properly?

739
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:29,550
Lower your volume.

740
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,229
Quiet down.

741
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,599
You guys are participating in a play,

742
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,990
not the circus.

743
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,990
You'll run out of voice
if you keep this up.

744
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,229
Let's take a picture.

745
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:41,159
By the way, Miss,

746
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,950
we lack two more trees.

747
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,878
I thought Song Wei and Li Yang
were supposed to be the trees.

748
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:46,799
They don't want to do it.

749
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,550
They said they have no lines
and wanted to be the guards.

750
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,309
If so...

751
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,590
Zhuang Jie,

752
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,229
are you willing to participate in it

753
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,918
and make some

754
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,590
pleasant high school memories?

755
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,910
But you don't need to force yourself

756
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,590
if you're afraid
it might take a toll on your body.

757
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,910
I'm in.

758
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,470
But

759
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,269
we need two trees, right?

760
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:18,869
One tree will do.

761
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:20,430
The main point is your participation.

762
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,910
What about Chen Maidong?

763
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,229
He doesn't have a role too.

764
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,759
He and I

765
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,030
will be the two trees.

766
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:35,470
Chen Maidong.

767
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,958
It's rare for Zhuang Jie

768
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,430
to participate in an event.

769
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,749
You should stop pretending to be sick.

770
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,189
You two can play the trees together,

771
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,430
okay?

772
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:52,950
Fine.

773
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,309
