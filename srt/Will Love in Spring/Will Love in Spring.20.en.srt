(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

=Episode 20=

4
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:54,840
Grandma?

5
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,400
How come you're here?

6
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Who is she?

7
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,799
Who are you hiding? Who? Speak up!

8
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,319
Who else could it be?
She's still asleep.

9
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,879
You dishonorable child.

10
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,639
You touched her.
I'll smack some sense into you.

11
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,599
You will apologize
in front of your grandpa.

12
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,479
Wait, Grandma.

13
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,199
Hush.

14
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,120
Please, please.

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,800
You can hit me when we're back.

16
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,560
Wait. You can hit me.

17
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,110
Don't get worked up.
It's not worth it.

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
Also, the neighbors might see us.

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,680
Now you know shame.

20
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,879
As your grandmother,
I need to discipline you.

21
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,439
Come here.

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,599
Grandma! Grandma!

23
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,080
Grandma.

24
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,360
Grandma.

25
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,280
Don't hit him.

26
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,680
It was consensual.

27
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,960
Jie, stop protecting him.

28
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,639
I know what's happening

29
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:47,310
and I will make sure you're not wronged.

30
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,199
He took advantage of you,

31
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,240
so I will do the same to him.

32
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,960
Grandma!

33
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,520
Grandma!

34
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,800
It was consensual.
He didn't do me wrong.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,280
Hit me if you want.

36
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,599
Jie, I will call your mom.

37
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,879
I'm willing to accept any punishment
from your family.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,240
No need, Grandma.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,639
My mom knows.

40
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,319
Your...

41
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:09,571
Your mom knows you're sleeping together?

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,240
I...

43
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,439
My mom knows
I can't move on from him.

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,159
No.

45
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,879
I am a traditional person.

46
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,342
This doesn't sit right with me.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,039
Or we can call the police.

48
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,680
Grandma.

49
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,039
Please.

50
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,280
Kneel.

51
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,520
Me? Why?

52
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,080
Because this is against my principles.

53
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,759
You have no bottom line but she does.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,879
At this point, you two must get married.

55
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:49,840
Hey, you can't make
this decision for us.

56
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,280
It's our affair. We will handle it.

57
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,520
Speak no further.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,639
Why? You want to abandon her now?

59
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,800
Or are you, Jie, abandoning Maidong now?

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,457
Grandma. I will never do that.

61
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,759
But this is so sudden.

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,485
No marriage then.

63
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,039
But get engaged.

64
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,319
Otherwise, I'll smack you.

65
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,039
Smack me.

66
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,199
Don't force her to do anything.

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,085
You can't coerce people
into getting engaged.

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,120
You...

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,879
I...

70
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,639
I...

71
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,000
- I...
- Grandma!

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,360
Jie. Don't worry.

73
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,680
I will always come to your defense.

74
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,000
Girls help girls.

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,720
Grow...

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,480
Grow what?

77
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,720
It's G-I-R-L-S.

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,680
Girls.

79
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,000
Great.

80
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,439
Girls are great.

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,914
Grandma, I know you are my friend.

82
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,399
I can tell you here that I want to
spend my life with him.

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,079
Even though I haven't figured out

84
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,399
a win-win solution,

85
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,560
I'm sure it will
come to me in the future.

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,428
Grandma, I made a mistake.

87
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:10,600
Please don't be mad.

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:10,879
You...

89
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,759
Why are you kneeling?

90
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,680
Grandma is unreasonable.

91
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,114
We will get engaged,

92
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,079
as you wish.

93
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,714
Zhuang Jie. You don't have to do this.

94
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:23,690
An ordinary wedding band will do.
No need for diamonds.

95
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,057
They are not worth it.

96
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,600
(Your attention, please.)

97
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,639
(This is the replay of felicitous news.)

98
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,160
(Today, come to Liaogen Chicken)

99
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,120
(and claim wedding candies.)

100
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
You put on something dapper!

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,519
Enough. Stop showing off.

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,199
Everyone in this town
knows you're engaged.

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,319
Exactly. We all have seen
engagement before.

104
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,120
How come it's particularly
festive when it's yours?

105
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,542
Your grandmother and Zhuang Jie's mother

106
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,090
are making rounds in the town every day.

107
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,880
The only thing they lack
is a loudspeaker.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,279
Can you believe it?

109
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,400
What's wrong with that?

110
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,360
We must make sure
all Chen Maidong's admirers give up.

111
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,120
He's the one who takes you

112
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,199
off the dating pool.

113
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,380
Don't think the other way around.

114
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,000
What?

115
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,879
It's just a joke.

116
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,199
Mind your words.

117
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,040
I am no longer single.

118
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,580
I will not take this teasing from you.

119
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,199
He's getting petty now.

120
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:45,350
Anyway, did you invite everyone here
to distribute wedding candies?

121
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,800
Where is my feast?

122
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,519
- Right.
- Yeah.

123
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,950
Once we're done with our work,
we will hold something grand.

124
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,879
When that happens,

125
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:52,600
you're not leaving
with an empty stomach.

126
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,079
Okay.

127
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,199
Deal.

128
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,560
Wait. What are you doing?

129
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,519
You listen to her now?

130
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,839
We have to go now.

131
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,839
We have an engagement dinner to attend.

132
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,399
All right, go.

133
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,439
Go.

134
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:04,720
Go.

135
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,479
Dong.

136
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
Your parents came?

137
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:07,680
Yeah.

138
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,540
What a rare occasion.
Enjoy your time with them.

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,319
Go now.

140
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,079
See you.

141
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,759
Bye.

142
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

143
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:15,150
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

144
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,199
Sure.

145
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,300
(Wedding)

146
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,319
Who decorated this? How fancy.

147
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Your siblings, I bet.

148
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,630
My family will never
do something like this.

149
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,560
It is almost exorbitant
to have these decorations in this town.

150
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,759
You think so?

151
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
I find them incongruous.

152
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,519
You have no taste.

153
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,519
Sorry.

154
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Pardon my ignorance.

155
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,639
Congratulations.

156
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,680
Congratulations.

157
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,040
Jie.

158
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,120
Jie.

159
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,199
Grandma.

160
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,480
I know we held this party in a rush

161
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,399
so it's not as grand
as it could've been.

162
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,800
I hope it doesn't bother you.

163
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,360
Hey, don't say that.

164
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,199
When they get married,
we can hold a grand party.

165
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,319
Sure.

166
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,959
Hi Mr. and Mrs. Chen, I'm Zhuang Jie.

167
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,560
Maybe once we get married,

168
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,279
I can call you Mom and Dad.

169
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,959
Sure.

170
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,360
Thanks to you, everything is reunited.

171
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Yes.

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Come. Let's eat and talk.

173
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:28,839
Sure.

174
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's eat and talk.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,959
We'll be in-laws.

176
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,840
Come. Take a seat.

177
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,799
Take a seat.

178
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,799
Fill the glass.

179
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,714
Come.

180
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,360
All right.

181
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,440
Take a break.

182
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,440
I'm not tired.

183
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,720
I didn't know
that your grandma left too.

184
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:18,485
Your family went to send my parents off.

185
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,519
My grandma will then
send your family off.

186
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,679
It's a cycle.

187
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,080
You don't usually drink

188
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,360
but you drank a lot today.

189
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,759
Are you feeling okay?

190
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,771
I'm very happy.
So I can take those drinks.

191
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,440
Besides, I have drunk alcohol before.

192
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:39,857
When?

193
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,759
When we broke up.

194
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,399
No way. We never broke up.

195
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:47,030
That's right.

196
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:49,828
We will never break up.

197
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,759
Chen Maidong,

198
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,000
does this all feel like a dream to you?

199
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,085
I have never seen anyone
get engaged in a rush.

200
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,114
Will you regret it and not show up

201
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,485
on the wedding day?

202
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,240
Why would I do that?

203
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,960
I finally get to call you mine.

204
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:14,542
I'm worried that you might run away.

205
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,759
Chen Maidong,

206
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,200
thank you for loving me.

207
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,159
You and this small town

208
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:29,114
are like a bowl of heartwarming soup.

209
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,919
Soothing and reassuring.

210
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:37,428
I know Shanghai is more beautiful.

211
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,679
It's like an iridescent
and mesmerizing land.

212
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,320
I take back what I said.

213
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,279
I like Shanghai.

214
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,600
But I like you more.

215
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,600
Thank you too.

216
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,342
My relationship with my parents
has never been this peaceful before.

217
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,000
It's as if we become at peace

218
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,720
with our past grievances.

219
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,480
That's because you have a home now.

220
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,840
You are now an adult.

221
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,440
Hopefully, I won't be abandoned

222
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,960
by my family another time.

223
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,639
Chen Maidong.

224
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,840
I will always be your family.

225
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
I believe you.

226
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,740
♪Grabbing a piece of moonlight♪

227
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,060
♪Spilling it toward
the place you turned around♪

228
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,900
♪Even if you miss out on the sunset♪

229
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,380
♪Your gaze set my surroundings ablaze♪

230
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,260
♪People come and go. The scent of roses♪

231
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,980
♪Already became a part of history♪

232
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,140
♪The ray of sunlight in the drizzle.
The bell tolls from afar♪

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,780
♪It is my yearning for you♪

234
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,159
Cucumber...

235
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,840
Is this an after-party?

236
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:48,400
You didn't drink enough just now?

237
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,039
We can't get drunk before

238
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,000
your future in-laws
and embarrass you, can we?

239
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,919
What a hasty wedding.

240
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,639
I was caught completely off-guard.

241
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,320
I dropped whatever I was doing
in Shanghai and rushed here.

242
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,120
I can only hope it won't go wrong.

243
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,080
I appreciate that.

244
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,279
I'll rejoin you very shortly.

245
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,120
None of you can mention
Shanghai tonight, okay?

246
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,320
You're right.
Zhuang Jie, congratulations.

247
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:13,799
Cheers.

248
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,399
Thank you.

249
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,159
Don't chug it.

250
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,519
I'm quite happy
that I decided to get engaged.

251
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,000
The scarier it is,
the more decisive you have to be.

252
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,559
Overthinking it leads you nowhere.

253
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,559
You have my support.

254
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,080
But Zhuang Jie,

255
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,919
marriage is grounded in real life.

256
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,510
You need food.
You need to build a family.

257
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,960
Other than love, you also need money.

258
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,840
I can earn money.

259
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,000
Besides, it's not Maidong's sole duty.

260
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,039
Once you decide who to marry,

261
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,879
you marry to a certain lifestyle.

262
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I know that.

263
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:53,030
All these impulsive decisions
were carefully planned.

264
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,279
Mom, you're awfully quiet today.

265
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,279
You were quiet too at the party.

266
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm listening.

267
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,519
I'm learning the new ways

268
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,720
young women treat marriage.

269
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,879
What new ways?

270
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,519
Finding someone you love

271
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,971
and marrying him is like
finding a needle in a haystack.

272
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,360
Exactly.

273
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,679
In the current dating scene,

274
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,759
people think that the more
independent a girl is,

275
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,879
the pickier she'll be.

276
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,399
Either she marries someone rich

277
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,559
or she marries someone

278
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,720
more successful than her.

279
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,679
But that's not true.

280
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,360
In fact, the more mature women are,

281
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,080
the more they crave emotional support.

282
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,110
It has nothing to do
with your educational background

283
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,000
or profession or money.

284
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,559
What matters is open-mindedness.

285
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,629
It's no longer the era of wives

286
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,142
being the homemakers.

287
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,840
We want men with similar values,

288
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,840
men who are emotionally available

289
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,600
and comfortable to hang out with.

290
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:57,919
That's right.

291
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,919
To maintain a cliché
but romantic thing like marriage,

292
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,039
you need mutual effort.

293
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,519
They need to commit

294
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,440
to fighting against the injustice,

295
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,440
the unfairness, and the restraint
from social norms

296
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,480
so deeply ingrained in us.

297
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,360
Many people won't understand

298
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,879
what you said,

299
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,440
including a lot of women.

300
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,399
See?

301
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,559
Ms. Liao,

302
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,840
the poverty aid
we desperately need in this town

303
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,240
is the dispelling of ignorance.

304
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:27,510
I don't understand everything

305
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,480
but I do think both of you are right.

306
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,919
You remind me of the time

307
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,679
I got married and gave birth.

308
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,360
For us, getting married

309
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,279
is like heading to a tourist site.

310
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,919
Everyone takes the bus,

311
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,120
heads in the same direction,

312
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,559
disembarks, and takes photos.

313
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,000
Everyone is doing the same

314
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,759
and no one wants to feel left out.

315
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,639
And so, we get married.

316
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,559
Some marriages

317
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,360
end with a happy ending.

318
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,000
Some end with a tragedy.

319
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:04,840
I'm serious.

320
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,080
We should play
the conversation tonight on a loop

321
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,200
on the public speakers.

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,639
I know, right?

323
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,639
At the same time,

324
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,960
I'm also quite upset.

325
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,559
I toiled and raised

326
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,039
three children.

327
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,679
And now, I'm losing one.

328
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,000
It doesn't sit right with me.

329
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,440
The Chens got lucky.

330
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,240
Ms. Liao,

331
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,519
I must correct you there.

332
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,399
Think of it as you'll get

333
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,559
a new son instead. Right?

334
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,279
That's right.

335
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,500
Your daughter is getting married.

336
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,519
You're not selling her.

337
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,799
I'm not changing my surname.

338
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:37,600
Right.

339
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,039
Think positively.

340
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,790
Chen Maidong
is better than all three of you.

341
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,799
I'm so happy.

342
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,600
Come.

343
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,240
Come.

344
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,120
To Ms. Liao.

345
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,559
To Mr. He.

346
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,480
And to your father.

347
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,240
That's all?

348
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,720
Oh, the young women nowadays.

349
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,350
Don't eat so much.

350
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,319
Look at your belly.

351
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,279
It's none of your business.

352
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,114
Where are the others?

353
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:18,000
They went back. Their wives called.

354
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,640
Then you two should leave too.

355
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:21,340
You are disturbing my grandma's sleep.

356
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't kick us out. Let us stay.

357
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,680
My mom allows me
to stay out late tonight.

358
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,759
I don't want to go home either.
My wife got pregnant recently.

359
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,920
She has wild mood swings
and her hormones are all over the place.

360
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,680
Stop. You're scaring
the future groom here.

361
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:35,742
In the past, you were
the one scaring him.

362
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,680
Hedgehog.

363
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,359
Thanks.

364
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,519
Grandma told me
that you had found a decent job.

365
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
What does it entail? Tell me.

366
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,319
I'm telling you. If I get the deal,

367
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,742
half of the town will know.

368
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,759
What a bluff.

369
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,720
Why would I bluff?

370
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,000
Hear me out.

371
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,680
Didn't I travel to Hainan?

372
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,440
I was driving a big wig around.

373
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,257
Dr. Fang from the provincial hospital
introduced him to me.

374
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
The man is very kind

375
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,279
and doesn't mind my past records.

376
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,519
He works in tourism

377
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,640
and he went to Hainan to check out

378
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,200
the medical tourism pilot zone.

379
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,839
I learned a lot from him.

380
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,119
Medical... Medical tourism?

381
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,799
What is that? I don't understand.

382
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,960
Tourism is huge in Hainan.

383
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,319
It's leagues above Nanping's.

384
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,279
The medical tourism pilot zone

385
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,920
has comprehensive medical resources.

386
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,150
It will help develop health services
and other industries.

387
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,780
That's right.

388
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,440
I heard in Thailand,

389
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,640
Singapore, and Indonesia,

390
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,200
their medical tourism industry

391
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,519
can produce up to billions of yuan.

392
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,799
And this pilot zone has something

393
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,319
called Green Path.
Approval is simplified.

394
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,119
New drugs or medical devices

395
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,799
can be put into clinical trials quickly.

396
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,799
Well done, Hedgehog.

397
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,039
You know your thing.

398
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,780
I was listening carefully
when I was with him.

399
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,880
So serious.

400
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,480
Hedgehog,

401
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,279
can you introduce that guy to me?

402
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,559
Sure.

403
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,319
Wait. You're interested in this?

404
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,240
Are you dumb?

405
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,119
What does Zhuang Jie do?

406
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,599
Oh, I get it now.

407
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,359
You are getting provident
for your future.

408
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,079
Dong is more about action than words.

409
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,430
This cup of tea shall be your wine.

410
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,359
Congratulations on your engagement.

411
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,319
Cheers.

412
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,160
Jie, you just got engaged.

413
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,319
Why are you sighing?

414
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,057
Are you too happy that you can't sleep

415
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,160
so you meditate here?

416
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,440
Yan.

417
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,319
I can't lose Chen Maidong.

418
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,559
Are you sick, Zhuang Jie?

419
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,519
Or are you drunk?

420
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm sober.

421
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,759
That's why I'm even more upset.

422
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,160
What are you on about?

423
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,960
Everything is so perfect today.

424
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,720
Yeah, today.

425
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,640
In a few days,

426
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,279
I have to return to Shanghai.

427
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,079
Chen Maidong will be sad.

428
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,119
Then talk to him.

429
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,160
He is not unreasonable.

430
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,079
What's the point of reasoning with him?

431
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,400
I can't give him a definitive answer

432
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,920
because I don't know

433
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,920
if I'll succeed in
establishing my business.

434
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,680
I used to think
that I could shrug everything off.

435
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,319
And I'm engaged now...

436
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,279
I was such an idiot.

437
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,720
Jie,

438
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,480
where is your courage?

439
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,960
I have never seen you

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,359
admitting defeat before anything else.

441
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,240
That's because
I have never cared so much

442
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,240
about something before.

443
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,200
You said you were afraid of losing Dong.

444
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:49,920
So am I.

445
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,240
When I imagine how he could

446
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,720
be someone else's brother-in-law,

447
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,079
I feel horrible too.

448
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,119
Are we all clear now?

449
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,390
The agenda will move on
as Zhuang Jie told us just now.

450
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,400
Don't panic.

451
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:15,750
I knew those kids wouldn't last
for a day when we were away.

452
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,319
The investors are supposed
to visit next month.

453
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,519
Why are they coming tomorrow?

454
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,400
You won't come with me today?

455
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,480
I can't.

456
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,720
I need to explain everything
to Chen Maidong before I leave.

457
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,799
Right.

458
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,880
You're no different from a scammer

459
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,780
if you run away
one day after getting engaged.

460
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,519
It's my fault.

461
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,270
I don't know what happened to me.

462
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,480
Whenever I want to bring it up,

463
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,200
no words come out of my mouth.

464
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,240
I know why.

465
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,000
You care about him.

466
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,400
All right.

467
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,839
I have to go now.

468
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,559
Listen.

469
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,240
You have to be there

470
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,359
before 2:30 PM tomorrow.

471
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,200
We invested all our starting capital.

472
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,519
Miss Huang also did her best.

473
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,600
She called and introduced
everyone to us.

474
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,470
Everything is ready.

475
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,680
We just need you to be there.

476
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:04,720
If you don't show up,

477
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,100
you'll never hear the end of it.

478
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,000
Okay.

479
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,079
Go now.

480
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,000
See you.

481
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,519
Wang Xixia.

482
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,079
I don't know why

483
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,160
but I'm getting cold feet.

484
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,079
It's not you to be this indecisive.

485
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,400
Tell Chen Maidong now.

486
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,440
Tell him everything.

487
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,759
Don't beat around the bush.

488
00:22:25,371 --> 00:22:26,830
Not only are you heading to Shanghai,

489
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,119
you'll stay there for a while.

490
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,039
Don't let the whole team down.

491
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:31,839
Understood?

492
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,857
Don't worry. I know what to do.

493
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,440
See you.

494
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,342
What are you doing here?

495
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,319
I just arrived.

496
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,519
You're leaving?

497
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:11,400
There's an emergency. I have to go.

498
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,119
Go ahead.

499
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,119
I'm fine.

500
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,519
Perhaps...

501
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,799
Forget about me. Just go.

502
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,039
Go!

503
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,359
See you then.

504
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,260
I'll call you later.

505
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:19,720
Sure.

506
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,680
See you.

507
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:31,920
Bye.

508
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,319
Jie. You're leaving for real?

509
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,119
Stop clinging to your sister.

510
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,759
You'll make her emotional.

511
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,640
She's upset not because of me.

512
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,279
What? You haven't told Maidong?

513
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,680
He's busy. He hasn't
replied to my message.

514
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:11,640
You...

515
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,828
You're doing this on purpose
then to tell him at the last minute.

516
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,720
That's right.

517
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,039
Jie, I have an idea.

518
00:24:19,428 --> 00:24:21,580
Tell Dong that it's not
a long-distance relationship.

519
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,742
You're just on a business trip.

520
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,559
What lame idea is that?

521
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,759
Yes, don't listen to her.

522
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,480
Don't pull any tricks.

523
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,000
You have to be honest with him.

524
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,799
Do you hear me?

525
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,720
Hello?

526
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,720
I'm done.

527
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,971
I was about to call you.

528
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,359
Where are you?

529
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,720
Sure. I'll come over.

530
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,300
(Nanping North Station)

531
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,314
Who are we picking up? Which platform?

532
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,599
Zhuang Jie,

533
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,200
why aren't you replying
to my messages?

534
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,200
Who are we picking up?

535
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,799
Answer me.

536
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:50,628
We're not picking anyone up.

537
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,279
I'm leaving.

538
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,519
For how long?

539
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,759
I don't know yet.

540
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,839
How long?

541
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,440
I'm starting my business so

542
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,000
I'll be very busy
for the first two years.

543
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,400
Chen Maidong,

544
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,079
I'm not hiding this from you on purpose.

545
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,559
I just couldn't find

546
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,039
the right opportunity to tell you.

547
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,559
You are my responsibility.

548
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,960
Why am I your responsibility?

549
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,880
You told me you didn't
want to wait. I understand that.

550
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,240
And I don't want to be

551
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,279
your confidant or your girlfriend.

552
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,720
That's why we got engaged.

553
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,400
So you remember that we are engaged.

554
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,079
Of course, what are you on about?

555
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,839
Is impulsiveness

556
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,400
your ideal of marriage now?

557
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,240
Chen Maidong,

558
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,039
life is mundane.

559
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,319
Do you want me to make
PowerPoint slides of my future to you?

560
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:52,960
Sure.

561
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,039
Tell me.

562
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,571
How do you plan
to spend your every day now?

563
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,039
(Your attention, please.)

564
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:07,440
(Train G5185 to Shanghai)

565
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,359
(is arriving soon.)

566
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,240
(Please carry your personal effects)

567
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,799
(and board on time.)

568
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,599
Go then.

569
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,510
Don't miss your train.

570
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,160
I won't see you off.

571
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,039
Chen Maidong.

572
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,680
I'm not leaving you.

573
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,200
Think of it as a business trip.

574
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,720
Can you do that, please?

575
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,542
Zhuang Jie,

576
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:37,079
I'll respect your decision
even if you want to leave me.

577
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,680
I have never gotten
in the way of your dream.

578
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,100
But you don't take marriage seriously!

579
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,200
You can't tell me
at the last minute. Understand?

580
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,519
You're mistaken.

581
00:27:50,657 --> 00:27:53,160
I might not be as thoughtful as you
in my handling of matters,

582
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,920
but you truly misunderstood me here.

583
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:58,279
Go.

584
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:02,000
Think about it when you're in Shanghai.

585
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,599
I know what I want already.

586
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,657
Give me the wedding ring.

587
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,200
Forget about this engagement.

588
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,839
No.

589
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,160
Why?

590
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,519
It's engaged with my name.

591
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,440
Give it back.

592
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,240
No!

593
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,680
I...

594
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,359
I'm sorry.

595
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,600
It's not my intention.

596
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,680
I...

597
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,079
You get nosebleed so easily.

598
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,359
Let me wipe it.

599
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,440
Chen Maidong.

600
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,759
Chen Maidong.

601
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,000
Chen Maidong.

602
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,640
Chen Maidong.

603
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,079
Chen Maidong.
I will not break up with you.

604
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,559

606
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:48,440
Hello?

(is arriving soon.)

608
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,440
I'll be there this afternoon.

609
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,880
Yes, Wang Xixia.

610
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,200
Stop rushing me.

this afternoon, the biggest investor
representatives will be there.

628
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:16,500
I've sent all the relevant
documents to your mailbox.

629
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,379
You know very well we only
have one chance to pitch our idea.

630
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:25,540
We all count on you.

631
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,960

by my family another time.

635
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:54,500
Chen Maidong.

636
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:58,780
I will always be your family.

637
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,580
Looking at your face,

638
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,142
I don't even know if I should
celebrate the occasion with you.

639
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,419
Congratulations to us.

640
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,740
Do you know how dazzling
your proposal this afternoon was?

641
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,060
It was brilliant.

642
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,979
I find myself charmed by you.

643
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,379
So Zhuang Jie, you made
the right decision to return here.

644
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,459
You belong to this stage.

645
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,620
Don't give it up.

646
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,379
I know.

647
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:13,220
I never plan to give it up.

648
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,059
Then cheer up.

649
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,140
Chen Maidong didn't have time
to prepare for the news.

650
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,499
After some time, he'll come around.

651
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,539
I'm the one who needs
to figure everything out.

652
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,342
On my way back,

653
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,379
I kept asking myself why.

654
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,200
Why

655
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,180
am I so obsessed with the tower?

656
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,400
It's not the tower's fault.

657
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,660
We all draw a circle around ourselves.

Chen Maidong,

662

if I leave Nanping,

663
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:46,820
will you resent me?

664
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:59,379
Life never goes our way.

665
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:03,371
We won't sacrifice ourselves
for one another.

666

we have together.

00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,979
My job isn't as meaningful as yours

669
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:17,539
and Shanghai isn't my home.

670
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,019
But those people

671
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,419
are quite important to me.

672
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,714

I don't want to settle for less.

676
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,860
I don't want

677
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:38,539
to resent myself or you
after we get married

for five or ten years.

679
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,459

what my life could have been.

this will be my last chicken soup.

No more chicken,

690
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:48,539
in any form, for the next six months.

691
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,660
Sure.

692
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,419
As you wish.

693
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:54,569
Maidong.

694
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,285
Grandma.

695
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,539
Don't say anything.

696
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:00,899
Okay.

697
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,379
It's your matter.

698
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,300
You handle it.

699
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,257
But you bear the main responsibility

700
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,860
for the rushed engagement.

701
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:15,379
But Jie agreed to it too.

702
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,099
We reached a consensus

703
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,140
so I did what I did.

704
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:20,499
But an engagement doesn't

705
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:21,660
solve our current problems.

706
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,539
You can keep this promise in mind

707
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:25,379
and think about the rest much later.

708
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,057
Zhuang Jie and I have different visions
of what our future should be.

709
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:34,379
I'm fine with monotony
but she may not be.

710
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:37,340
What if she runs into

711
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:38,899
a better man, a better temptation?

712
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,971
What should she do?

713
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,499
You underestimate her.

714
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,539
I trust her as much as you do.

715
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,340
But what does she want?

716
00:38:48,942 --> 00:38:51,142
The answer will only appear
in time and with distance.

717
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,099
Dong,

718
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,300
what about you?

719
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,740
What do you want for yourself?

720
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:08,800
You asked me the same question
when Dad and Mom got divorced.

721
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,340
I told you back then

722
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:14,820
I hated Mom.

723
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:18,660
So I decided to
live with you and Grandpa.

724
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,979
But that wasn't true.

725
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,180
I do not hate her.

726
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:30,499
I let her go

727
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:35,371
because I know a single mom with a son
cannot date someone else easily.

728
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,019
To my dismay,

729
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:42,780
letting go

730
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:47,620
gave me more than a decade of pain.

731
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,820
Dong,

732
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,660
sometimes, it's okay to be selfish.

733
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,899
I know.

734
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,828
So I won't make the
same mistake with Zhuang Jie.

735
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,499
I have my way of living and pace.

736
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,771
Don't meddle in this anymore.

737
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,200
(Six months later)

738
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:09,099
Miss,

739
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,979
you must be a local.

740
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:13,579
I knew it.

741
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,180
Did you notice my accent?

742
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,700
No?

743
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,800
I'm from the northeastern region.

744
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,979
I left home when I was young.

745
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,180
I've been to many places

746
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:28,499
but I love Shanghai the most.

747
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,400
It's as good as the Western countries.

748
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,979
When I'm not driving, I travel a bit.

749
00:41:33,379 --> 00:41:35,660
Yu Garden, Lujiazui,
and City God Temple of Shanghai.

750
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:36,971
I can never have enough of them.

751
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
But you know,

752
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:41,620
as time goes by, you miss home.

753
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,899
We always think

754
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,780
we have a free soul.

755
00:41:47,459 --> 00:41:48,820
We think we can go

756
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:51,140
wherever life takes us.

757
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,419
But when something serious happens,

758
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,099
you'll realize that you have nothing.

759
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:02,099
We all crave companionship.

760
00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:04,539
Our life is too short

761
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:06,220
to fuss over the details.

762
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,620
Mister!

763
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,160
(Shanghai Wenhua Funeral Parlor)

764
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,899
Before you graduate,

765
00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:15,019
you'll have more field trips
and workshops.

766
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,449
In the end, if you decide

767
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,771
to stay in funeral services,

768
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:23,419
remember that the more honest we are,

769
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:25,428
the more reassured our clients will be.

770
00:42:25,939 --> 00:42:26,820
The stigma on us

771
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:28,340
will disappear one day.

772
00:42:29,499 --> 00:42:30,220
We won't

773
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,660
fear death as much as we do

774
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,660
because in our lives,

775
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,780
death isn't unknown or uncommon.

776
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,499
Wait.
