=Will Love in Spring=

00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,520
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

3
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,400
=Episode 7=

4
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,100
Jie, you are back.

5
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,741
Jie?

6
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,701
You are back.

7
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,125
We met in Yanggou Village before.

8
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:51,959
My surname is Yang.

9
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,581
I'm Mr. He's comrade.

10
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,040
I took the liberty

11
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,320
to set up the funeral hall

12
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,060
with the funeral parlor staff.

13
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,980
Please forgive me
if I overlook something.

14
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,060
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

15
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:04,540
Where is my mom?

16
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,199
She has been with He.

17
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,100
She is probably in the embalming room.

18
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:11,540
I'll take a look at the funeral hall.

19
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,541
Let me know
if you need me to do anything.

20
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,421
All right.

21
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,060
Ms. Liao.

22
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,980
Do you want some water?

23
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,280
I... I'm not thirsty.

24
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,420
No, thanks.

25
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,319
Mr. He's 3-dimension
facial reconstruction

26
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,540
takes some time.

27
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,341
You can look at the details

28
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:46,100
to feel more assured.

29
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:49,261
I'm sorry

30
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,021
to butt in everything.

31
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,341
Not at all.

32
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,169
This is just what we should do.

33
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:55,901
Take your time.

34
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,540
No rush.

35
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:00,261
All right.

36
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,860
Are these made

37
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,860
for those who died in accidents?

38
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,021
Yes.

39
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,540
3D printing helps

40
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:52,291
conceal all disfigured parts

41
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,420
as possible in the shortest time,

42
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,660
especially in cases like Mr. He.

43
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,740
Manual restoration

44
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,341
is rather difficult.

45
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,741
Can you understand this?

46
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,660
After the mold is done

47
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,300
and placed on the deceased,

48
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:14,169
we will proceed with facial makeup
and detail restoration.

49
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,141
This allows the family

50
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,620
to see a familiar face

51
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,261
when they say goodbye.

52
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,420
This technology

53
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,701
is more advanced
than over ten years ago.

54
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,581
My first husband

55
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,501
died in a car accident.

56
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,512
I'm sorry for your loss.

57
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,941
My husband

58
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,501
was pretty meticulous.

59
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,581
Please...

60
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:02,581
Please take care of him.

61
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:07,341
Don't worry.

62
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,261
I will.

63
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,350
(Great Virtue Endures)

64
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:39,840
(Return to the earth fulfilled,
bless the descendants abundantly.)

65
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:43,901
Jie,

66
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,410
there is a condolence money desk

67
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:47,941
and registration desk.

68
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:49,730
He was a people person.

69
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,211
There must be a lot of guests.

70
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:52,080
If you don't have

71
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:53,300
any special requests,

72
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,420
I will handle it.

73
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,180
I'm fine with it.

74
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,741
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

75
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,261
Don't be so courteous with me.

76
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,200
Besides, you'll...

77
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,021
Jie.

78
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:23,341
Niaoniao.

79
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,740
Jie,

80
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,461
I lost my dad too?

81
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:37,660
Jie.

82
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,900
Mr. Yang,

83
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,181
if you have any instructions
for us three,

84
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:01,100
please tell us.

85
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,980
Tomorrow,

86
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,941
we will send He off properly.

87
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,599
Someone has to go home

88
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,740
to issue an obituary.

89
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,141
Zhuang Yan will do this.

90
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,541
According to our local tradition,

91
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:16,461
it has to be done by the son.

92
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,341
Zhuang Yan will do it.

93
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,740
But I'm not Mr. He's biological son.

94
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:24,821
Maybe Niaoniao could do this.

95
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,781
Niaoniao is too young.

96
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,821
Some of the procedures

97
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,781
are too difficult for her to manage.

98
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,640
But I...

99
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:41,719
I'm afraid

100
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,061
my identity isn't suitable.

101
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:44,980
If Mr. He is upset...

102
00:09:51,126 --> 00:09:53,169
Have you forgotten
how Mr. He treated you?

103
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:55,799
He won't be upset

104
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,301
if you send him off.

105
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,701
He will issue the obituary
as the eldest son.

106
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,541
All right.

107
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,500
Let's split

108
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,661
and proceed.

109
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,941
Mr. Yang,

110
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,798
don't worry about the money.

111
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:15,880
I will give Mr. He

112
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,380
the most dignified funeral.

113
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:21,140
Okay.

114
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,341
Let's go.

115
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,919
Zhuang Yan,

116
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,421
take Niaoniao home

117
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:29,910
and do what Mr. Yang said.

118
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:31,398
Come back here afterward.

119
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,900
We are going to keep vigil for Mr. He.

120
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,500
Mr. He,

121
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,181
I'm now going

122
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:19,421
to trim your fingernails.

123
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:58,620
It trims off

124
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,100
your worries and doubts

125
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:06,541
as well as

126
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,541
your mundane troubles.

127
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,620
Mr. He,

128
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,020
please move on peacefully.

129
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,439
My condolences.

130
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,301
Thank you.

131
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:04,959
Jie, please stay.

132
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,430
Thank you.

133
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:06,959
Just tell me if you need anything.

134
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,860
Thank you.

135
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:09,500
Take care.

136
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,079
Thank you.

137
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,520
Thank you.

138
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:12,380
I'm leaving.

139
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,581
Please take care, girl.

140
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:51,661
Having you all and your mom

141
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,380
is my luck.

142
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:14,880
(Registration)

143
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,581
Please put the shoes on
for the deceased.

144
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,260
He, I'm putting shoes on you.

145
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:21,525
Mr. He,

146
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,520
if I really get recognized
by the town this time,

147
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,399
I'll give you
an appreciation pennant.

148
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,000
Sure.

149
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:26,860
That's right.

150
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,221
Mr. He,

151
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,940
I promised I would give you
an appreciation pennant

152
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:44,420
if the town government honors me.

153
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,821
I had Niaoniao order this.

154
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,660
I planned...

155
00:19:57,201 --> 00:19:59,660
I planned to hold a grand celebration

156
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:02,799
during the New Year

157
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,221
and give it to you.

158
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:20,100
It seems I can only give it to you now.

159
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:38,920
(Honor Mr. He Zhangyue the title
of "The Great Man of the House")

160
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,741
Mr. He,

161
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:57,639
without you,

162
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,180
how will the family carry on?

163
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,140
You are not made of iron.

164
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,940
Get some rest.

165
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:29,180
Chen Maidong,

166
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,680
I have never once

167
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:34,460
called him "dad".

168
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:37,021
He won't blame you.

169
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,341
You don't understand.

170
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:42,940
You don't.

171
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,460
Mr. He is gone.

172
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,420
He is gone.

173
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:58,620
Don't cry here.

174
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:01,061
You will your siblings up.

175
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,821
Dad.

176
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,660
Chen Maidong,

177
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,301
do I really bring bad luck?

178
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:14,981
Don't say silly things.

179
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,660
I had already lost my dad,

180
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,460
so I cherished Mr. He very much.

181
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,620
I wouldn't dare to call him dad.

182
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,140
Still,

183
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,700
he has left.

184
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:34,960
My mom and I think

185
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:36,501
it's our fault.

186
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,821
Sometimes, the good die young

187
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,720
because Heaven thinks

188
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:45,940
they are too tired

189
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,420
and gives them an early rest.

190
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,221
I can't understand.

191
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,180
I really can't.

192
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,180
No one is born already knowing it.

193
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:06,626
I have been in this industry
for a long time.

194
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,100
(It was only a few months ago)

195
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,159
(that I realized something)

196
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,301
(through a boy.)

197
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:13,420
(That the people closest to us)

198
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,940
(will one day leave us.)

199
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,781
For example, my grandma.

200
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,860
Zhuang Jie,

201
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:43,140
parting with our closest ones

202
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,460
may be a signal from Heaven

203
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,221
to remind us

204
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:53,100
that after the most reliable barrier disappears,

205
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,981
it will be our turn sooner or later.

206
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,221
Life has its limits.

207
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:03,660
That's why we should strive hard to live,

208
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:07,301
create, and love.

209
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,900
If life carries on forever,

210
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:13,851
it would be quite boring, actually.

211
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:19,221
But why me again?

212
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,460
Why does it always have to be me?

213
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,061
I'm sorry.

214
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:32,341
I can't answer that.

215
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:51,981
Chen Maidong,

216
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,940
have you ever

217
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,501
lost someone in your life?

218
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,021
When I was 17,

219
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,460
my best friend

220
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,021
died right before me.

221
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:21,660
His name was Song Ran.

222
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,380
When he died,

223
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:27,100
he was also 17.

224
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,700
(Before Song Ran died,)

225
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,140
(he called me.)

226
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:37,380
(But I missed it.)

227
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:41,221
(To be honest, I was just lazing around.)

228
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,541
(I was playing video games
at the cyber cafe.)

229
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,541
(Song Ran)

230
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:50,569
(had never been in a fight before.)

231
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,100
(That was the first time.)

232
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,301
(So,)

233
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,821
even now,

234
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:04,061
I still blame myself

235
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,140
for his death.

236
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:10,541
You are saying silly things too.

237
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:12,900
No, I'm serious.

238
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:15,159
Every day since Song Ran's passing,

239
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,301
I have wondered

240
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,061
why it had to be my friend

241
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,821
and why I had to witness that scene.

242
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,940
If people die at last,

243
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,660
what is the purpose of living?

244
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,460
Do you have an answer now?

245
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:39,460
Someone

246
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,420
gave me the answer.

247
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,821
All right.

248
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:53,140
Your feet are clean.

249
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:57,700
You are clean too.

250
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,821
Stop messing around.

251
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:19,341
Those who are meant to leave
will eventually leave.

252
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,581
You can't keep them.

253
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,569
Those who are meant to leave
will eventually leave.

254
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:31,140
We can't keep them.

255
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,900
So,

256
00:32:36,098 --> 00:32:38,021
you decided
to enter the funeral industry

257
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,380
because of this man?

258
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,981
Yes.

259
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,741
He told me

260
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,021
death always happens suddenly.

261
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:53,581
Being upset is useless.

262
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:55,981
Someone

263
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,781
has to do something.

264
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:00,380
If so,

265
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,700
is he your master?

266
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:08,040
I have learned various professional skills

267
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,221
from many experts.

268
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,061
But only he

269
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,981
is my master.

270
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:34,681
(Vocational Skills Level Certificate)

271
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:38,001
(Vocational Skill Level Certificate)

272
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:40,920
(Name: Chen Maidong
Profession: Embalmer)

273
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:21,021
What is your master doing now?

274
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:23,100
He must be retired.

275
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,181
Well.

276
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:29,661
He is gone.

277
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:38,341
He had bad habits

278
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,626
and no one was around
to take care of him.

279
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,181
He called me at the weekend

280
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,940
and proudly promised

281
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,070
to take me to go hiking

282
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:52,141
when I return to Nanping
during the New Year.

283
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,821
The next day,

284
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,500
he passed away.

285
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:00,480
(Beijing)

286
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,701
(At the age of 17,)

287
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,341
(Master sent Song Ran off.)

288
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:23,940
(At the age of 27,)

289
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,341
(I left Beijing for Nanping)

290
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,900
(and sent him off myself.)

291
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,060
(Because of Song Ran,)

292
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:38,580
(I refuse to forget about death.)

293
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,980
(Because of Master,)

294
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:47,020
(I learned to help more people)

295
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:50,181
(to leave this world with dignity.)

296
00:35:57,881 --> 00:35:59,060
Zhuang Jie,

297
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:02,341
losing

298
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,079
is a way of teaching us

299
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,580
to slowly accept.

300
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,860
I know you are suffering.

301
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,701
But you will get through the pain.

302
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:22,341
Like you?

303
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:27,221
Yes, with me.

304
00:36:41,021 --> 00:36:57,120
(Being mortal,
we can only lessen our grief.)

305
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:24,026
Those who are meant to leave
will eventually leave.

306
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:26,060
We can't keep them.

307
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:29,980
Being mortal,

308
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:34,101
we can only lessen our grief.

309
00:39:09,741 --> 00:39:21,280
(Pardon us if we fail to inform you.
The He family is in mourning.)
