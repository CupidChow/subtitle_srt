=Will Love In Spring=

2
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,160
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

3
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,960
=Episode 11=

4
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,682
Hurry up and memorize it.

5
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:52,331
I have other things to do later.

6
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:54,842
The bright moon separates the branches
and scares the magpies.

7
00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:56,691
Cicadas chirp in the midnight breeze.

8
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,852
The fragrance of rice flowers
speaks of a good harvest.

9
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,732
Listen to the cacophony of frogs.

10
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:02,491
Stars flicker in the night sky.

11
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,292
A drizzle falls upon the mountain.

12
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:06,491
The old straw shack still stands
beside the temple.

13
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,652
Appearing at the end of the bridge.

14
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:10,891
Awesome, Niaoniao.

15
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:12,143
You're improving rapidly.

16
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:13,572
You can flatter me.

17
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:15,531
But you still have to pay

18
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:16,411
for your massage.

19
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:17,172
Sure.

20
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:18,062
I'll definitely pay.

21
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:19,882
Big news. Big news.

22
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:22,251
Just now…

23
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:23,572
Wow.

24
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:25,331
It was frightening.

25
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:26,771
What's wrong?

26
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:28,172
That Grandma Chen.

27
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:30,642
You know Chen Maidong
from the funeral parlor?

28
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:31,651
His grandmother.

29
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:32,491
What's wrong?

30
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:35,412
Mother, hurry up and say it!

31
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:36,692
Grandma Chen

32
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:39,012
was carrying a sickle

33
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:40,312
and breaking into someone's yard.

34
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:42,457
Then she started a fight
with the family by herself.

35
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:43,692
Is she okay?

36
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,331
She is an old lady.

37
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,362
Who dares to touch her?

38
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:47,372
What could happen to her?

39
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:49,012
Mother.

40
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:51,211
Why?

41
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:52,314
Which family?

42
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,842
I heard Chen Maidong got into a fight

43
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:55,000
with somebody last night.

44
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,371
The opponent is

45
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:57,852
a guy released from prison.

46
00:02:58,091 --> 00:02:59,452
I think he is called Hedgehog.

47
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:00,452
There was a big commotion.

48
00:03:00,572 --> 00:03:01,611
Even the police were there.

49
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:02,532
The old lady said she

50
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:03,842
gave her grandson a beating first.

51
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:04,752
Then, she took a sickle

52
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:05,972
and went to that brat's house.

53
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:07,172
She said she wanted to personally

54
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,051
fight him to death.

55
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:09,771
Where are you going?

56
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,771
It has ended. They went home long ago.

57
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,252
Mother.

58
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:14,132
Madam Wu persuaded her

59
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:14,972
to drop it and go home.

60
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:16,352
Mother, continue to test me

61
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,172
on the second unit?

62
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:18,252
The Long March.

63
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:19,642
Your sister...

64
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:20,331
What a busybody.

65
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:21,532
Red Army embraces difficulties.

66
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,611
Thousands of rivers and mountains
are no tribulation.

67
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:33,412
Grandma.

68
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:34,811
You came, Jie.

69
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:36,132
Grandma.

70
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,372
You are spending money again.

71
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:44,211
Eat more fruits.

72
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,412
You are so well-informed.

73
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:47,491
Thank you, Grandma.

74
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:52,051
Grandma.

75
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:53,692
Are you okay?

76
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:55,292
I'm fine.

77
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,611
You think that little hedgehog

78
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,732
could prick me?

79
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:03,211
It smells good.

80
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,543
Are you making chicken soup?

81
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:07,532
The free-range chickens
your family sells

82
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:09,051
have a really good meat texture.

83
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:10,632
You don't have to buy it the next time.

84
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,611
I'll deliver them to you.

85
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:12,651
No way.

86
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:14,132
That's a different matter.

87
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:16,314
Why don't you drink a bowl later?

88
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:17,362
I don't eat chicken.

89
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:18,811
Our whole family doesn't eat chicken.

90
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:20,771
I've been smelling it since I was young.

91
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:27,452
The thing about the fight.

92
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:28,482
Please don't think of

93
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:29,611
this old lady as a bully.

94
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:31,172
I can't let bad people

95
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:32,172
stay around Dong.

96
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,972
His accomplishments today

97
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:36,652
did not come by easy.

98
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:37,571
Jie.

99
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,412
Go up and tell Dong
to come down and eat.

100
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:41,543
He hasn't eaten for a day.

101
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:42,772
He's upstairs?

102
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:44,292
Okay.

103
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,172
I'm coming in.

104
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,652
You knew you made a mistake, right?

105
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,000
That's why you are hiding here.

106
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:11,451
I thought someone

107
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:13,332
had gotten worse at fighting.

108
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:15,743
It turns out that he just
doesn't fight at work.

109
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,972
How old are you?

110
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:22,451
I see you still get hurt in fights.

111
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:33,811
Rabbit grandson.

112
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:35,602
Do you want to starve to death?

113
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:36,491
Leave me alone.

114
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:38,200
I didn't want to care about you.

115
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:39,931
Grandma asked me to call you to eat.

116
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:41,852
What are you here for?

117
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:44,572
To look at the laughingstock.

118
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:45,962
It's not every day you see one.

119
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:46,912
Let me ask you something.

120
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:47,571
Go ahead.

121
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:49,412
Have you ever

122
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,482
thought about me romantically?

123
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,092
Certainly.

124
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:56,251
So, am I not as attractive as Shanghai?

125
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:58,532
Or am I worse than

126
00:05:58,532 --> 00:05:59,943
the guy at the barbecue restaurant?

127
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,242
Did you really start a fight
because of this?

128
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:12,972
So not worth it.

129
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:15,657
Do you still have feelings for him,

130
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:18,762
but regret not being able
to be with him?

131
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:21,562
Does the look on my face that day
seem like I'm still holding on to him?

132
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:24,892
So what are your plans now?

133
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:25,931
What plans?

134
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:27,371
You.

135
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:28,532
And me.

136
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:37,811
No plans.

137
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,143
Man proposes, god disposes.

138
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:42,931
Nothing ever

139
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:44,332
goes according to my plan anyway.

140
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:47,972
I'd rather wish for more inspiration.

141
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,491
Stop getting off-topic.

142
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Have you not thought about it
or are you pretending you didn't?

143
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,143
I didn't think about it.

144
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:11,114
Then what is our relationship right now?

145
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:18,691
I'm asking you.

146
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:22,162
This is the first time
you asked me this.

147
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:23,922
You have to let me think about it.

148
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,292
Still thinking?

149
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:28,451
If you haven't figured it out.

150
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:30,412
Why are you flirting with me?

151
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:32,772
Do you have too much free time?

152
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:37,772
You did it too.

153
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:39,892
I asked you to send medicinal patch,

154
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:41,372
and to go to the
barbecue restaurant?

155
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,811
It seems like I judged you incorrectly.

156
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,092
Chen Maidong.

157
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:51,571
Chen Maidong.

158
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:56,931
Leave.

159
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:08,732
Wretched rascal.

160
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,442
If I ever respond to you again,

161
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:11,251
I'm a fool.

162
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:20,486
Do you still dare to fight?

163
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:21,331
Yes.

164
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:22,372
You.

165
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:23,532
How dare you?

166
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:25,286
Give me back the chicken soup.

167
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:27,731
If we keep on tolerating
this kind of person,

168
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:28,914
he will just be more daring.

169
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:31,372
Oh, so it's your job to teach him
a lesson now?

170
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,292
Show-off.

171
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:39,822
What's wrong with the corner
of your lips?

172
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,532
It wasn't injured yesterday.

173
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:45,772
Did Jie hit you?

174
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,132
I told you!

175
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,532
Sooner or later, someone will
deal with you!

176
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:06,851
Thanks.

177
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,691
This is spirulina.

178
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,292
It's good for your health.

179
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:25,252
Tastes good.

180
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:29,331
Grandma Lin.

181
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:30,451
Look.

182
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:32,492
We live in the same town.

183
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:34,091
I admired you for a long time.

184
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:36,211
However, I failed to visit you

185
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:37,811
as the Women's Director.

186
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:38,892
I've neglected my duty.

187
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:40,492
Madam Wu is always busy.

188
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:41,811
Why the sudden visit?

189
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:45,451
Well,

190
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,571
I just hope that

191
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:47,931
you can give me some pointers.

192
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:49,811
Madam Wu, you are too kind.

193
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:51,372
What can I give you advice on?

194
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:53,051
The rumors in the town

195
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,132
are all without truth.

196
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:56,051
How can that be possible?

197
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:57,612
The year before last, the Xu family

198
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:59,051
listened to your advice

199
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:00,252
and stopped quarreling.

200
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:02,811
Look at them, they are living
their best.

201
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:04,731
There was also Feng's family.

202
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:05,822
They listened to your words.

203
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,282
They went to get some medicine.

204
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,252
This year,

205
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:09,892
they gave birth to a big chubby boy.

206
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,652
We were just chatting.

207
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,412
Maybe it's because I'm getting old.

208
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,012
I have experienced more things.

209
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,652
I could see the other aspects
of a problem. That's all.

210
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:18,731
Grandma Lin.

211
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:20,731
Just stop being modest, okay?

212
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:23,331
If I wasn't almost going crazy,

213
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,571
I wouldn't have come here
to trouble you.

214
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:27,172
My daughter, you know her, right?

215
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:28,412
She was in this relationship.

216
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:30,372
They were super into it.

217
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:31,292
But I don't know why

218
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:32,091
she as an aunt had to

219
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,292
date her distant nephew.

220
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:36,132
I, being her mother

221
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:36,851
was so ashamed

222
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:38,132
that I couldn't even lift my head.

223
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:39,412
Go straight to the point.

224
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:40,492
Yes. Sure.

225
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,012
The two of them

226
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:43,731
finally overcame all the difficulties

227
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:44,652
and got married, right?

228
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,731
Life was pretty good too.

229
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:49,892
They are so lovey-dovey
but with no results to show for it.

230
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:51,451
Oh, come on.

231
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:52,922
Her daughter and son-in-law

232
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,331
are really tough to deal with.

233
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,612
In public or not,

234
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:56,657
they would hug and kiss

235
00:11:56,731 --> 00:11:57,612
whenever they wanted.

236
00:11:57,811 --> 00:11:59,892
They've been married for three
or four years, right?

237
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,412
But they haven't got a child yet.

238
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:02,571
In your words.

239
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:03,532
What was it?

240
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,132
Determined but incapacitated.

241
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,892
She wanted to come to you
for a long time.

242
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:08,811
To get your advice.

243
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:10,532
See if there are any ways to solve it.

244
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:12,492
Maybe the both of them

245
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,492
want a few more years

246
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:14,971
to just the two of themselves?

247
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:16,571
I understand this.

248
00:12:16,731 --> 00:12:17,412
Aren't we all

249
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:18,931
like this when we were young?

250
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:19,971
Oh, goodness.

251
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:21,772
I wasn't like that when I was young.

252
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:23,652
Then I was married in a proper manner.

253
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:25,252
I had a baby the next year.

254
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,292
People of our generation, am I right?

255
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:28,762
Especially people of your generation.

256
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:30,652
Chasity was important.

257
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:32,331
Who would be like them?

258
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,412
They don't care anything.

259
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:34,372
Me.

260
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,412
This is you?

261
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:39,532
So, if you are asking me

262
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:40,772
about this matter,

263
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:41,971
you got the wrong person.

264
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:43,292
Some people think

265
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:45,132
the love of a man and a woman

266
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,252
can only burn for so many years
in a lifetime.

267
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,292
But I

268
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:49,571
do not think so.

269
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:51,172
One's life is one's own.

270
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:52,492
Let them be.

271
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,451
Otherwise, when you are old.

272
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,172
And when you look back.

273
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:57,772
You will regret it.

274
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:04,091
I have a good idea

275
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:05,612
of how to promote the Vacuum Chicken.

276
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:06,731
In two days,

277
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,343
you can go to
the pharmaceutical factory.

278
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:09,451
I heard that

279
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:10,892
their year-end employee gifts

280
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:11,612
are really good.

281
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:13,832
Last year, everyone was given
a box of organic oil,

282
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,012
a few bags of vacuum beef,

283
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:16,012
and organic rice.

284
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:17,914
You can try to sell
Vacuum Chicken of yours.

285
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:19,931
You helped to sell yams in the town.

286
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,172
That was done beautifully.

287
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:22,331
Everyone is grateful to you

288
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:23,252
from their hearts.

289
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,143
No matter what, they would
return the favor.

290
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:28,851
Why are you always

291
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:30,492
touching your lips?

292
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,714
Is the weather so dry that
your skin is peeling?

293
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:35,292
Tomorrow, I'll send you a lip mask.

294
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:37,211
No need. I still have some.

295
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:39,532
Then what's wrong with you?

296
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:40,331
Alright.

297
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:41,331
I'm hanging up.

298
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:42,800
I have a morning meeting tomorrow.

299
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:43,931
Wang Xixia.

300
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:44,731
What?

301
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:46,451
You're hesitating a lot today.

302
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:50,532
Then what is our relationship right now?

303
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:57,652
Say,

304
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,691
deep down, am I

305
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:01,931
a cowardly person?

306
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:04,082
If we're talking about this,

307
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:05,612
I'm suddenly not sleepy anymore.

308
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,652
I vaguely smelled it.

309
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:09,051
The smell of gossip.

310
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:10,372
Screw off.

311
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,331
I'm just a little disappointed
in myself.

312
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,152
(Clock: Chen Maidong reminds you
to change the medicinal patch!)

313
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,514
Wait a minute, I'm changing
my medicinal patch.

314
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:25,372
Okay.

315
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:25,971
Change it.

316
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:34,772
Ji Tong and I have been at odds
for more than three years.

317
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:36,372
I've always thought

318
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,972
that there's something wrong with him.

319
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:40,811
But today I suddenly realized

320
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:42,731
maybe deep inside me

321
00:14:42,772 --> 00:14:44,211
I lack the courage to catch feelings.

322
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:45,731
I can't blame it on others.

323
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,412
Zhuang Jie, let me remind you.

324
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:48,931
If you dare to

325
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:50,331
give Ji Tong another chance…

326
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:52,851
What are you saying?

327
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:54,731
I'm reflecting on myself.

328
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:56,372
Looking at my nature
through observation.

329
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:58,412
What's the use of reflection?

330
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,612
You have to take a practical
step forward.

331
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:02,562
Otherwise, you would just be running
in circles.

332
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:04,132
Makes sense.

333
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,112
(Ancestral secret recipe
Address: Huangpu District, Shanghai)

334
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:11,652
Wang Xixia.

335
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:15,132
In fact, the both of us are similar.

336
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:16,691
We're both sick deep down.

337
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:18,252
We have to grow together.

338
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,051
Take care of yourself first.

339
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:21,451
So, no more gossip?

340
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:22,372
I'm going to sleep.

341
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:23,532
Wait a minute.

342
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,800
Before you go to bed,
I want to ask a favor from you.

343
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:26,492
Say it.

344
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:29,842
I recently discovered a medicinal patch.

345
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,331
It works wonders for my nerve pain.

346
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,451
But it's limited in stock.

347
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:36,532
I looked at the

348
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,922
founder's traditional Chinese medicine
clinic in Shanghai.

349
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:40,322
Send me the address. I'll buy it.

350
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,731
Don't agree too quickly.

351
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:42,851
What if you fail to buy it?

352
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:44,772
Stop talking nonsense.

353
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:45,922
As long as you need it,

354
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,892
I will go through trials
to get it for you.

355
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:49,091
But now

356
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,172
let me go to bed first.

357
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:50,892
Okay?

358
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:53,652
Bye.

359
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:05,772
Big Brother Cui.

360
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,372
That's all the help I can give you.

361
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:32,312
(Medicinal patch instructions)

362
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:55,811
What are you doing?

363
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:58,012
Did you see a ghost?

364
00:16:58,492 --> 00:16:59,532
I got the wrong person.

365
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:02,172
What's wrong?

366
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,451
Is your boss still stalking you?

367
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:06,343
It seems that your company
is quite relaxed.

368
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:08,492
He can afford to leisurely
hang out in our town.

369
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:10,571
He's leaving today.

370
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:11,731
Stop complaining.

371
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,172
You still have to send him off.

372
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:14,892
Why's that?

373
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:16,811
Just to be polite.

374
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:18,029
I better just go see him off.

375
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:19,372
I don't understand.

376
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:20,612
He goes his way.

377
00:17:20,612 --> 00:17:21,412
You live your life.

378
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:22,482
Do you have to be so sneaky

379
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:23,612
and absent-minded?

380
00:17:23,672 --> 00:17:24,762
I'm telling you, Zhuang Jie.

381
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:25,731
I can't stand

382
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,600
a woman who loses her composure
for a man.

383
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,052
Hello.

384
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,172
What do you want?

385
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:33,291
I want four chicken wings.

386
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,282
A whole braised chicken.

387
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:34,931
Okay.

388
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,400
You haven't got time for breakfast,
have you?

389
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,652
Your job at the funeral parlor

390
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:40,451
must be tough.

391
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:41,812
Leaving so early.

392
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:43,211
Four chicken wings.

393
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:44,691
A whole braised chicken.

394
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,042
I put them together here for you.

395
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:46,572
Okay.

396
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:47,812
Scan here, right?

397
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:48,451
Yes.

398
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:52,852
Okay, here you go.

399
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:53,572
Thanks.

400
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,251
Goodbye.

401
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:55,011
Okay.

402
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:55,652
Thanks.

403
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:22,852
Master, it's all yours.

404
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:24,372
You obviously had breakfast.

405
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:39,011
Hai,

406
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,211
if I may be frank…

407
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:41,172
I know.

408
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:43,011
If we don't leave, we'll be late.

409
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:45,211
But I'm not driving today.

410
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:46,731
What's the use of hinting to me?

411
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:13,572
Ji Tong.

412
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:15,057
Have a safe journey.

413
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:18,011
I waited for you for several days.

414
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:20,491
But I couldn't even
see you a second time.

415
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,172
We are both prideful people.

416
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,092
I understand you.

417
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:29,132
You are stubborn for your own sake.

418
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:31,251
I refuse for my own sake, too.

419
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:31,892
So,

420
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,172
let's end it here.

421
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:34,822
That's the best for both of us.

422
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:36,652
Sure.

423
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:39,332
I understand.

424
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:52,192
(Nanping North Station)

425
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:52,771
Master.

426
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,812
Hai has already picked up the body.

427
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:56,771
Leave the rest of the process to me.

428
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:57,852
You can go home and rest.

429
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,200
You have the night shift tonight.

430
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:01,612
Deaths from unexpected illnesses

431
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,372
will have many cumbersome procedures.

432
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:11,372
That's it, I'm leaving first.

433
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:18,892
We're in Nanping.

434
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:20,132
We don't do French farewell.

435
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:22,291
Zhuang Jie.

436
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:24,731
You've changed a lot.

437
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:26,612
Maybe

438
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:28,011
you misunderstood me in the past?

439
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:29,132
That's not important.

440
00:20:29,372 --> 00:20:31,202
You could at least send me to my seat,
right?

441
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:47,962
Everyone who is sending off passengers

442
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:48,992
alights the train quickly.

443
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:50,332
The train is leaving soon.

444
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:57,892
Master.

445
00:20:58,412 --> 00:20:59,092
Master.

446
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:00,052
Master.

447
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:06,771
Goodbye.

448
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:08,011
Jamie.

449
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:08,971
Jamie.

450
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:11,652
Is there really no hope for us?

451
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:15,132
Ji Tong, let go of me.

452
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:16,731
Let go of me.

453
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,291
Chen Maidong.

454
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,652
Who do you think you are?

455
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:30,892
Did no one teach you in Shanghai

456
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,132
to not force a woman?

457
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:50,612
Chen Maidong.

458
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,812
You like this, right?

459
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:01,652
Like what?

460
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:04,922
You enjoy being tugged by a man

461
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:05,943
in the public, right?

462
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,229
Waiting for others to take
photos of you, right?

463
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:09,132
Chen Maidong.

464
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:10,291
Are you being stupid again?

465
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:11,400
Not as stupid as you.

I want to go to the pharmaceutical
factory to try my luck.

495
00:24:47,914 --> 00:24:49,257
You want to make a business deal?

496
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:51,812
I want to promote our Vacuum Chicken.

497
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:54,229
I want to try to be a part of

Have you made an appointment in advance?

499
00:24:57,852 --> 00:24:58,572
No.

500
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:00,211
That's why I said I'm trying my luck.

501
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:04,011
Okay.

502
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,222
I'll send you there first.

503
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:09,052
Aren't you going back to work?

504
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:12,852
It's okay, it's lunch break now.

505
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:17,412
Taxi.

506
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:49,812
Hello, Miss Wang Xixia.

507
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,429
It's your turn. Please follow me.

508
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:52,251
Okay.

509
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:52,931
Let's go.

510
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:53,451
Let's go.

511
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:55,812
This way, please.

512
00:25:59,251 --> 00:25:59,771
Thanks.

513
00:25:59,812 --> 00:26:00,657
You're welcome.

514
00:26:01,652 --> 00:26:02,251
Hello.

515
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:07,092
I recently discovered a medicinal patch

516
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:09,052
that works wonders for my nerve pain.

517
00:26:09,052 --> 00:26:10,612
But it's limited in stock.

518
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,852
When I saw this founder's

519
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:13,762
traditional Chinese medicine clinic

520
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:14,731
in Shanghai.

521
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:19,731
I thought it was a duplicate name.

522
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:21,429
I didn't expect it to really be you.

523
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:22,491
Have a seat.

524
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:23,429
Give me your arm.

525
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:27,792
You don't need to be so
embarrassed about your illness, do you?

526
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:29,743
If you are sick,
you should get it cured.

527
00:26:29,852 --> 00:26:31,011
I'm unlucky,

528
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,372
not embarrassed.

529
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:34,892
It seems you really

530
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:36,172
hate me a lot.

531
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:37,812
Did you think

532
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:39,332
I was just pretending before this?

533
00:26:39,412 --> 00:26:40,731
Indeed, I noticed.

534
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:44,011
Well, in the past,

535
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:46,572
I really don't know how I

536
00:26:46,612 --> 00:26:47,812
managed to offend you.

537
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:49,011
I'm sorry.

538
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:50,251
Okay.

539
00:26:50,412 --> 00:26:51,412
Once you leave my clinic,

540
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:52,612
go 700 meters south.

541
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:53,762
It's another medicine clinic.

542
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:54,771
They're not bad.

543
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,057
Why don't you go there and have a look?

544
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,251
I'm not sick.

545
00:27:00,914 --> 00:27:02,842
My friend asked me to come over
to buy some patches.

546
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:04,172
She told me it's developed here.

547
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,543
It's not sold anywhere else.

548
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:07,971
The friend with a leg problem?

549
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,972
How did you know she has
problems with her leg?

550
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:14,092
Because I'm really a doctor.

551
00:27:14,572 --> 00:27:15,771
I didn't say you weren't.

552
00:27:15,892 --> 00:27:17,572
I'm asking how you can tell.

553
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:19,922
Well, when you were both talking loudly

554
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:20,931
about buying underwear…

555
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,451
Don't mention the underwear thing.

556
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:27,052
Okay.

557
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:38,052
Do you sell the medicinal patches?

558
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,714
You have to order them.

559
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:40,892
I want to order 50 then.

560
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:43,211
There is no need to stock up on this.

561
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:45,132
First, you have to see if it works.

562
00:27:45,892 --> 00:27:46,612
20 should suffice.

563
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:48,771
I'll pay you then.

564
00:27:49,332 --> 00:27:50,211
Pay on delivery.

565
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:53,092
Please leave your phone number
and address.

566
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:58,202
If you don't want to come again
by yourself,

567
00:27:58,286 --> 00:27:59,762
I'll get someone to deliver it to you.

568
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:02,914
I'll write it down at the front desk.

569
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:07,612
Thanks.

570
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:12,372
You're welcome.

571
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:18,572
Zhuang Jie, are you trying to trick me
on purpose?

572
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:20,002
Do you think I can't beat you to death

573
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:20,971
because we're far apart?

574
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:23,372
Buy the medicinal patches?

575
00:28:23,812 --> 00:28:24,612
You're so efficient.

576
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:26,652
As expected from my true besties.

577
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:28,200
Don't blame me for this.

578
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,892
I really need this patch.

579
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:31,291
Also, I did warn you.

580
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:32,931
I told you not to agree too early.

581
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:41,971
But this is the last time I'll
do something like this.

582
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:43,011
If you and Cui Ge

583
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:44,211
are really incompatible,

584
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,251
don't force it.

585
00:28:45,822 --> 00:28:47,562
I went to the pharmaceutical
factory today.

586
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:48,771
It didn't work out.

587
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:50,486
I didn't see the person in charge.

588
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:52,211
They told me that this year's gifts

589
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:53,052
were all distributed.

590
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:58,092
Are you waiting for me?

591
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:02,372
Of course.

592
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:10,531
You didn't tell me in advance.

593
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:11,491
What if I'm in there

594
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:12,451
for a very long time?

595
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:14,657
I expected you to be out of luck.

596
00:29:15,143 --> 00:29:16,743
It's not easy to hail a taxi out here.

597
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:18,372
Can you predict the future?

598
00:29:18,482 --> 00:29:20,000
Why did you think I'd be out of luck?

599
00:29:23,172 --> 00:29:23,892
Let's go.

600
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:24,971
Let's eat first.

601
00:29:25,971 --> 00:29:27,412
Depending on my mood,

602
00:29:27,422 --> 00:29:29,343
I will decide if I want to give you
some pointers.

603
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:14,132
Here.

604
00:30:20,092 --> 00:30:21,531
Take it easy.

605
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:24,491
Tao.

606
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,451
I understand now.

607
00:30:26,971 --> 00:30:27,931
All children

608
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:28,971
are debt collectors.

609
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,491
I told you already.

610
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:34,086
Children have their own lives.

611
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:35,272
Don't bother to get involved.

612
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,652
It will only trouble you.

613
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:37,731
Why bother?

614
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:39,491
Okay.

615
00:30:39,612 --> 00:30:40,562
We're at this age already.

616
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:42,251
It's better to take care of yourself.

617
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:42,852
Come.

618
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:49,011
Let me tell you.

619
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,400
You can say this easily because
you don't have my problems.

620
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:53,132
Zhuang Jie takes care of herself well.

621
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,172
You don't understand

622
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:55,172
my mood at all.

623
00:30:55,491 --> 00:30:56,491
Oh, come on.

624
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:57,914
She? Taking care of herself?

625
00:30:58,829 --> 00:30:59,522
A few years ago,

626
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:02,531
I couldn't sleep because I was worried
about finding her a partner.

627
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:03,432
In the blink of an eye,

628
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:04,612
she is almost thirty.

629
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:05,892
I have moved on.

630
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:07,457
It's fine if she doesn't get a partner.

631
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:09,029
At worst, when she's old and I'm dead,

632
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:10,172
she and Wang Xixia

633
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:11,652
can go to a nursing home together.

634
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:12,886
I think that's pretty good.

635
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:13,931
That's true.

636
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:15,491
Zhuang Jie

637
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:16,892
is capable.

638
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:17,731
She knows

639
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:18,812
what she is doing.

640
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:20,132
Not like my daughter.

641
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:20,852
She likes to

642
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:22,332
do some conspicuous feats in town.

643
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:23,812
What a disgrace.

644
00:31:25,172 --> 00:31:25,812
That's because

645
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:27,200
you've spoiled them since young.

646
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,029
It's too late to worry about this now.

647
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:30,572
If Zhuang Jie

648
00:31:30,652 --> 00:31:31,931
dared to act crudely

649
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:33,812
getting tangled with some guy,

650
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:35,114
kissing and touching in town.

651
00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:36,914
I don't even have to tell her fortune.

652
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:38,491
I'll just take her life.

653
00:31:48,052 --> 00:31:49,372
Chen Maidong.

654
00:31:50,132 --> 00:31:52,052
This dish looks good.

655
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,612
Because I made it.

656
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,332
Not my grandma.

657
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:59,192
How do you know I had no chance
at the pharmaceutical factory?

658
00:31:59,514 --> 00:32:01,052
Do you have to go straight to the point?

659
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:02,971
It's not the first day you've known me.

660
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:07,432
The pharmaceutical factory
is the leading enterprise in town.

661
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:09,629
They have a lot to consider when
it comes to gifts.

662
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:10,771
They will either first

663
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:12,092
support new industries in town

664
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:14,962
or take care of college students who are
returnee entrepreneurs.

665
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:17,057
A private self-employed body like you?
No chance.

666
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:23,612
I'm a returnee entrepreneur too.

667
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:25,372
Do you count as one?

668
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:27,332
Why not?

669
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:29,272
I'm an old college
student who found her way back.

670
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:30,062
Is that not allowed?

671
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:31,211
Sure it is.

672
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:32,612
But these college students

673
00:32:32,691 --> 00:32:33,731
have to settle in town.

674
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:34,731
Can you do that?

675
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:38,132
Then I really can't do it.

676
00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:41,291
Eat first.

677
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:55,052
Do the patches work?

678
00:32:55,612 --> 00:32:56,211
Of course.

679
00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:57,962
It's colder the past couple of days.

680
00:32:58,011 --> 00:32:59,211
I'm still alive and kicking.

681
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:00,572
That's good.

682
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,281
I'll get more later.

683
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:02,882
It's alright.

684
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:03,771
I found the source.

685
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:05,257
I asked Wang Xixia to buy it for me.

686
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:08,472
You're going to throw me away after
using me?

687
00:33:08,491 --> 00:33:09,332
Great.

688
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:12,011
What do you know?

689
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,092
I just might cause a love to blossom.

690
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:16,892
You haven't even figured out
your own affairs yet.

691
00:33:18,652 --> 00:33:19,291
Who said that?

692
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:21,491
I have never been a sloppy person.

693
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:23,172
Come on.

694
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:25,531
If I hadn't saved you from Ji Tong,

695
00:33:25,857 --> 00:33:27,402
you would have been dragged to Shanghai.

696
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:28,172
Nonsense.

697
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:29,332
I made it clear to him

698
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:30,771
at the barbecue restaurant that day.

699
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:43,771
I'm almost 30.

700
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:45,731
I'm not some

701
00:33:45,812 --> 00:33:47,132
young girl, obsessed with love.

702
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:50,229
I know how to protect myself
better than anyone.

703
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,572
My views on marriage and love
are very realistic.

704
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:54,332
The men who mind my disability

705
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:55,812
from the core of their being.

706
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,886
I can understand. But I won't like them.

707
00:33:58,691 --> 00:33:59,691
Because they are the ones

708
00:33:59,731 --> 00:34:01,172
who let this disability be a problem.

709
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:02,531
Not me.

710
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:06,531
You have a sober mind.

711
00:34:11,372 --> 00:34:13,531
I'm sober because I'm calculative.

712
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:16,200
One is calculative when there's
a lack of love.

713
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:18,057
It's the same for both persons.

714
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:21,743
For grown-ups to approach love
like a moth attracted to fire.

715
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:23,092
It's not easy.

716
00:34:23,851 --> 00:34:24,811
That's why,

717
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:28,452
Everyone has to face reality.

718
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:31,012
The romantic scenes.

719
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:32,691
The urge to kiss and hug.

720
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:34,691
They can't feed a person.

721
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:40,851
Are you trying to brainwash me again?

722
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,291
Are you going to say
since we're grown-ups

723
00:34:43,492 --> 00:34:45,092
we shouldn't take things too seriously?

724
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,452
Chen Maidong.

725
00:34:49,932 --> 00:34:50,891
I like you.

726
00:34:52,052 --> 00:34:52,891
That's for real.

727
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:56,891
But I love Shanghai more.

728
00:34:58,092 --> 00:34:59,012
This is the reality

729
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:00,172
between you and me.

730
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:30,891
Chen Maidong.

731
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:33,371
The most admirable thing about you

732
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,052
is that you are willing
to listen to women.

733
00:35:37,532 --> 00:35:38,657
And you understand it too.

734
00:35:39,731 --> 00:35:40,972
Unlike some men

735
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:42,652
who are disabled like me.

736
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:45,012
They have ears

737
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:46,012
but never listen to

738
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:47,291
what the woman is saying.

739
00:35:49,211 --> 00:35:50,411
Stop flattering me.

740
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:53,331
Okay.

741
00:35:53,972 --> 00:35:55,029
Let's get to the point.

742
00:35:57,172 --> 00:35:58,652
Dong, please give me some pointers.

743
00:35:58,662 --> 00:36:00,712
What other policies does the town
have for returnees

744
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:02,012
to promote the Vacuum Chicken?

745
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,800
Don't always think of
taking advantage of the town.

746
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:05,972
Leave the good policies

747
00:36:05,972 --> 00:36:07,092
to those who need them more.

748
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,371
We don't have it easy either.

749
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:12,211
Then use your brain.

750
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,629
Don't always look at
the pharmaceutical factories.

751
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:16,532
The stone quarries in town

752
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:18,002
have nearly a thousand employees.

753
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,486
They also need to give gifts.

754
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,486
I am even less familiar with
stone quarries.

755
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:24,251
I'm familiar with them.

756
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:25,972
Wait for the news.

757
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:33,411
Thank you, Dong.

758
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:36,932
Look at your snobbery.

759
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:39,771
Give it back.

760
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,251
I'm not full yet.

761
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:11,251
What's the situation?

762
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:14,411
Madam Wu just left.

763
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:15,652
She was crying.

764
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:17,411
She was all tears.

765
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,772
Our mother was also shrouded
in a fog of melancholy.

766
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:21,251
Fog of melancholy.

767
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:22,492
It's okay.

768
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,771
Madam Wu's menopause

769
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:26,211
is longer than your puberty.

770
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,652
Stop making fun of us middle-aged women.

771
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,086
Sooner or later, you two will
face the same fate.

772
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:32,891
I was wrong.

773
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:34,811
I had a bad attitude.

774
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:36,914
I will go downstairs and reflect.

775
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:43,811
Send it to Grandma Lin

776
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:45,492
at the veterinary clinic in town

777
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:46,600
on behalf of Madam Wu.

778
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,572
Why is Madam Wu giving
Grandma Lin money?

779
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:50,851
Is her old dog sick?

780
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:53,211
Why are you cursing her dog?

781
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:54,682
Madam Wu was asking for a solution

782
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,492
from Grandma Lin

783
00:37:55,492 --> 00:37:56,572
for her clumsy daughter.

784
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,331
Although it didn't help much,

785
00:37:58,429 --> 00:38:00,012
Madam Wu is a very
particular person.

786
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:01,486
She wants to express her gratitude.

787
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:03,331
Sure, I'll deliver it when I'm free.

788
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:06,052
Mother.

789
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,052
Don't be like Madam Wu.

790
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:09,691
Don't simply get my fortune told.

791
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:11,411
You wish.

792
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,172
I won't ask for anyone's help.

793
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:15,691
I can take care of the children
I birthed myself.

794
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:17,372
I don't need to ask about your fortunes.

795
00:38:36,532 --> 00:38:37,691
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

796
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:39,172
I will not let you down.

797
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:40,652
The stone quarry's annual gifts

798
00:38:40,682 --> 00:38:42,057
will be presentable and beautiful.

799
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:43,172
You're welcome.

800
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:44,331
Let's help each other.

801
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:45,652
Before, you helped

802
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:46,972
Yanggou Village sell their yams.

803
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:48,691
Everyone in the town remembers it.

804
00:38:48,932 --> 00:38:50,612
It's a small matter.

805
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:52,612
But the stone quarry
selecting Liaogen Chicken

806
00:38:52,652 --> 00:38:54,771
is a really timely help for my family.

807
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:56,452
Don't say that.

808
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:58,200
I did not make this decision myself.

809
00:38:58,291 --> 00:38:59,012
Maidong

810
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:00,691
played a greater role.

811
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:01,612
Wait a moment.

812
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:03,811
I thought Chen Maidong

813
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:04,811
sent my WeChat to you

814
00:39:04,851 --> 00:39:05,612
as a recommendation.

815
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:06,492
How can that be?

816
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:07,972
He is such a thoughtful person.

817
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:09,492
Not only did he tell
our factory director

818
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:10,572
about your family's situation,

819
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:12,251
he even guaranteed the product himself.

820
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:14,232
When the factory director's
father passed away,

821
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,452
he received Maidong's favor.

822
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,372
He has been waiting
to return this favor.

823
00:39:17,652 --> 00:39:18,251
Maidong

824
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:20,012
hasn't requested anything
in so many years.

825
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,200
Then our factory director

826
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:22,452
was certainly eager to help.

827
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,132
Okay.

828
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:25,172
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

829
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:26,122
I should go.

830
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:26,452
Sure.

831
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:27,211
Take care.

832
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:28,092
Thank you.

833
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:39,291
Chen Maidong.

834
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,492
Chen Maidong.

835
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:44,052
Chen Maidong.

836
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,052
Why did you come?

837
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:46,092
What happened?

838
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:47,891
You did such a big thing.

839
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:49,532
Why didn't you take any credit?

840
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,012
I'm asking you a question.

841
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:55,452
You really like me, don't you?

842
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:56,743
Stop joking around.

843
00:39:57,532 --> 00:39:58,612
Grandma is not at home.

844
00:39:58,731 --> 00:39:59,612
I just met her.

845
00:40:00,012 --> 00:40:00,731
All the same.

846
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,612
It's not convenient.

847
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:02,612
Acting like a fool, huh?

848
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:07,829
Why are you acting like a fool?

849
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:11,411
Don't regret it later.

850
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:23,811
Who cares about you?

851
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,771
I pity you.

852
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:27,572
Look at your mouth.

853
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:29,211
Your lips are cracked.

854
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:32,572
I came here to thank you

855
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:33,886
for the deal with the quarry.

856
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:35,172
Don't worry.

857
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:36,612
I will work hard.

858
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:37,891
I won't embarrass you.

859
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,291
Why are you so scared?

860
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:45,492
Gender equality.

861
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:48,012
I won't use force on you either.

862
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:55,652
Hello.

863
00:40:55,972 --> 00:40:57,172
I am Chen Maidong's mother.

864
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:00,932
