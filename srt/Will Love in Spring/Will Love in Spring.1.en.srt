and bring comfort to the living.

17

bids farewell to this world

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,430
in the cries of others,

20
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,469
they should be given

Your earrings are very pretty.

OK, it's yours.

28
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,678
How about the e-mail to Lisa?

29
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,678
Don't worry, I've sent it.

30
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,629

What are you eating?

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,869

35
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,919
are you back from training?

Thank you for your hard work.

37

Qin, next week,
I will introduce Colin to you.

42

Take him to the equipment department.

43
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,479
Don't ignore my calls again.

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,118
After today,

45
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,278
I will lose my gallbladder.

46
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,230
Please do it for me.

47
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,230
Why are you still acting like
a tough gangster?

48
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,838
Do you think it's easy
to be hospitalized?

00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:53,799
Which medical salesperson

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,238
doesn't want to enter Yakang?

51
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,558
My illness is a blessing in disguise.

52
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,599
You are almost the top player

53
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,919
in the wellness industry.

54
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,039
Aren't you satisfied yet?

55
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,020
Stop flattering me.

56
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,580
Why is the bad woman who's competing
for the spot of top sales with me every year

57
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,958
- telling me to be content with the status quo?
- Okay.

58
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:06,998
You are good.

59
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,270
When you're in the operating theater,
just keep blabbering.

60
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,118
You're right.

61
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,238
I heard that my surgeon
is the vice president of this hospital.

62
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:13,958
Let me think about it.

63
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:14,718
How can I

64
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,069
leave a good impression later?

65
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,229
Great.

66
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,270
Just lie down.

67
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,070
Overall, there is no problem

68
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,830
with the operational process just now.

69
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,719
Just be aware

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,349
of your body position and gait.

71
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,109
When standing,

72
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,589
your two feet should be in a T-shape or
a figure-eight shape.

73
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,680
In this way, we can move forward
and backward freely,

74
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,630
and turn to our side swiftly.

75
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,270
Before bathing,

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,878
check every area of ​​the skin carefully.

77
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,909
Some tiny wounds

78
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,070
need to be cleared, disinfected,

79
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,390
and closed in advance.

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,070
In addition,

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,589
don't be in a hurry
when washing their hair.

82
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,870
From the sideburns
to the Baihui acupoint.

83
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,150
From Shenting acupoint
to Baihui acupoint.

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,630
From Wangu acupoint
to the Baihui acupoint.

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,469
Repeat several times.

86
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,190
Hold your breasts and pull your back,

87
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,909
and do not stick out
your chest and belly.

88
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,638
This will help you to control
your strength

89
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,989
and allow you to work longer.

90
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,349
After death,

91
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,349
one's pores will become loose,

92
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,150
and hair will fall out more easily.

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,589
So, be careful
of how much force you exert.

94
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,758
Some family members will choose

95
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,190
to watch the ceremony on-site.

96
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,870
So, every move you make

97
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,070
will affect their feelings.

98
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,229
Everyone,

99
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,719
facing death is never

100
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,270
a simple thing.

101
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,429
A long time ago,

102
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,238
our work

103
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,519
was considered dirty,

104
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,469
vile, and despicable.

105
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,109
Even today,

106
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,078
no one would be willing

107
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,950
to stay too long at where we work.

108
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,630
After saying "Thank you",

109
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,229
no one would say "See you again".

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,469
However, I hope you understand

111
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,750
that they do not hate us

112
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,229
but death.

113
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,864
(Next station: Nanping North)

114
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,349
Excuse me, thank you.

115
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:03,870
Thanks.

116
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,669
Thanks.

117
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,310
Are you from Nanping?

118
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,669
Is there a matter?

119
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,069
Don't you remember me?

120
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,590
We know each other.

121
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,270
Excuse me.

122
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,029
Was that necessary?

123
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,949
We really know each other.

124

Chen Maidong.

125
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,069
You really are a piece of work.

126
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:08,718
I am Zhuang Jie.

127
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,150
We were at the high school.

128
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,150
Have I changed that much?

129
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,270
Yes.

130
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,879
Okay.

131
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,159
I'll take it as a compliment.

132
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,519
You've changed a lot too.

133
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,198
I was only sure that it was you
after recognizing

134
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,390
the scar on your forehead.

135
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,669
Sorry,

136
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,078
I don't remember

137
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,270
your special features.

138
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,078
Me?

139
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:28,230
I don't have any?

140
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,150
Sorry.

141
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:31,870
I really didn't recognize you.

142
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,358
I have something to do.

143
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,309
I'm leaving.

144
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,919
Did you think

145
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,189
I was hitting you up?

146
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,709
Yes.

147
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,879
So if a girl really tried

148
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,558
to hit you up,

149
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,639
this is how you would respond?

150
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,470
Yes.

151
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,630
Are you driving? Give me a ride.

152
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,549
Yes,

153
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,069
but I'm busy. Take a taxi.

154
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,270
Bah.

155
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,470
Come.

156
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,110
Mr. He.

157
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,829
You're back, Jie.

158
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,759
Why didn't you tell us

159
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,919
that you were coming back?

160
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,640
I could have picked you up.
Here, give it to me.

161
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,198
It's okay. Taking a taxi is easy.

162
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,360
I'll make you something delicious.

163
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,020
It's all right. Let's have dinner
together tonight.

164
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,840
I'm going to see my mother later
to give her a surprise.

165
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,558
Okay.

166
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,350
Come.

167
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,069
Why has the house become like this?

168
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,759
I'm burning the midnight oil every night

169
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,759
with He Niaoniao.

170
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,358
Her grades are terrible.

171
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,909
I can't bear to look at it.

172
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:01,718
My mother

173
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,590
improved her braised chicken recipe,
didn't she?

174
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,429
What's this?

175
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:08,958
There is a kite competition
in the town this autumn.

176
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:09,759
I'm trying to improve

177
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,189
my kite-making skills.

178
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,598
How does it look?

179
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,239
You just want to keep yourself busy.

180
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,470
It's going to be hard for you
to go to bed early and get up early.

181
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,718
It's not hard on me.

182
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,270
Your mother has it worse.

183
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,470
Let me tell you.

184
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,799
Last night,

185
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,919
your mother was almost about to

186
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,478
crack open He Niaoniao's skull.

187
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,999
She said she wanted to see her brains

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,069
and how they are different
from yours and Zhuang Yan's.

189
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,069
Well,

190
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,358
isn't the only difference

191
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,759
between both of you and your brother
and He Niaoniao is me and your father?

192
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Is there really a difference?

193
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,558
- From young, my grades have been...
- Mr. He,

194
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,958
stop making excuses for He Niaoniao.

195
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,399
Her mind is sharp.
She's just not using it in the right places.

196
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,669
Let me take care of her.

197
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,829
Master.

198
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,958
Master.

199
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,150
You are finally back.

200
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,320
Whenever you're not here,
something bad happens.

201
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,759
What's wrong?

202
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,309
Come inside and take a look.

203
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:39,669
This way.

204
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,330
(Good beginning and good ending,
with the utmost truth and sincerity)

205
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,999
Who hid my buddy?

206
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,718
The deceased man

207
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,039
passed away while they were drinking.

208
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,598
All your brothers are here,
yet you ran away by yourself.

209
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:53,039
- Quiet down.
- That's how the drunkards came here.

210
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,159
Huang, come out quickly!

211
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,390
Let's call the police.

212
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,838
Come out, Huang.

213
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,759
Brother!

214
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,350
Are you friends with Huang too?

215
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,718
We're ironclad brothers!

216
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:03,598
Who are you?

217
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:04,159
Who?

218
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,870
We just had a drink together.
Did you forget?

219
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,999
Then, I'll have a drink with you.

220
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,558
Sure.

221
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,279
Let's go, let's drink together.

222
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,999
Brothers.

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,358
There's more liquor, brothers.

224
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,549
Let's go.

225
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,069
There is liquor.

226
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,870
Come here, come here to drink.

227
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,718
I'm going to buy you drinks.

228
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:22,390
- I'll buy you drinks. Wait for a moment.
- Okay, go and buy a drink.

229
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,639
- Is everyone inside?
- Yes.

230
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,760
- Five of them are as strong as fifty men.
- Stop yapping.

231
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,159
Stay here.

232
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,358
Cremate the body as usual.
Only let them out when they are sober.

233
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,759
Seriously, these guys.

234
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,279
There's a time and place to be drinking.
Just causing trouble to others.

235
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,239
Feng Xilun.

236
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,870
I said stop yapping.

237
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:35,870
Come over.

238
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,390
Where's the liquor?

239
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,350
Ever heard of the Battle of Antietam?

240
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,630
No.

241
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,159
It had the highest daily casualties

242
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,510
among the American civil wars.

243
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,560
Before clearing the battlefield,

244
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,710
the regiment commander specifically
requested his superiors

245
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,438
to allow the soldiers to drink
some liquor before

246
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:54,029
burying the bodies of their companions.

247
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,870
For some people,

248
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,590
they need alcohol to numb them

249
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,478
in order to complete

250
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,709
some special tasks.

251
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,350
Even drunkards

252
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,789
have the right to be sad.

253
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,039
If we called the police,

254
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,318
they would sober up

255
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:09,909
in the detention center.

256
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,999
In the future,
whenever they miss their friend,

257
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,709
they will be reminded
of how awkward they were.

258
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,309
That's double the pain.

259
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:18,598
I understand, Master.

260
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,590
I was wrong.

261
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,598
Pour them some tea.

262
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:23,478
Look after them.

263
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,039
Yes.

264
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,318
When they sober up,

265
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,230
I will take them
to send off their friend.

266
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,639
Something funny is happening

267
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,239
at the town committee today.

268
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,838
Indeed.

269
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,639
How did Wu Xuehua

270
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,478
meet such an opponent?

271
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,879
Yes, they were hard to deal with.

272
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,829
Madam Wu?

273
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,478
Madam Wu,

274
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,999
you have been beaten so many times.

275
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,358
Excuse me.

276
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,879
Why couldn't you
even return a single ball?

277
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,829
That's right.

278
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,669
They really got her beat.

279
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,598
The opponent

280
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,198
obviously came prepared.

281
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:03,750
Even if you were to go,
you would be beaten.

282
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,399
I really don't believe it.

283
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,429
Hurry up.

284
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:07,909
I'm coming.

285
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,598
Come.

286
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:12,680
(Scientific fitness for the sake
of our nation's wonderful life)

287
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,789
Come here.

288
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,999
Come again.

289
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,150
Come on.

290
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,029
Mr. Wang, your turn.

291
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,919
Come on.

292
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,399
Come on.

293
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,519
Play well, Mr. Wang.

294
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,909
Wipe your sweat.

295
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,558
Good luck.

296
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,598
That's enough.

297
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,558
We're just playing ping pong.

298
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,549
Why are you guys making it
sound like we're boxing?

299
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,039
Come.

300
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,239
You two, come at me together. Come.

301
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,519
- Bring it on.
- Go, all the best.

302
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,350
- Come on, good luck.
- Go!

303
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,918
Fight well, come on.

304
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,669
You must win. Come on.

305
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,030
Another miss.

306
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,429
Why didn't you receive it?

307
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,909
Awesome.

308
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,669
Madam Wu,

309
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:57,830
let's keep going.

310
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,429
Grandma Chen,

311
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,679
I know you are a professional.

312
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,030
You shouldn't bully us like this.

313
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,558
Are you not advocating for

314
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,679
national fitness?

315
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,239
Well...

316
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,279
I am the Women's Director.

317
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,918
Well, I can't be
playing ping pong here all day.

318
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,918
From my observation,

319
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,279
you are just horsing around every day.

320
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,279
That's why

321
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,598
I am training you.

322
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,799
Madam Wu,

323
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,429
what is this activity you are holding?

324
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,118
Jie?

325
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,398
When did you come back?

326
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:25,598
I didn't hear it from your mother.

327
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,350
I suddenly thought
of coming back for a vacation.

328
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,550
It's good to see you back.

329
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:29,318
This time

330
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,558
stay here longer.

331
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,479
You know what?

332
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,598
Our town is now

333
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,679
changing every day.

334
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,318
You won't get bored anytime soon,

335
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,429
you know?

336
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,830
Where are you going?
We haven't finished the match yet.

337
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,550
Come.

338
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,479
Help me.

339
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,358
I beg you.

340
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,158
I can't.

341
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,239
You can.

342
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,679
Come on.

343
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,469
Ready, go.

344
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,638
Great.

345
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:54,239
This...

346
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,269
This is...

347
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,759
Is there no one else
on the town committee?

348
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,229
Trying to fool me with some amateurs.

349
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,390
Mark my words.

350
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,719
If you don't solve my grandson's issues

351
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,838
with his marriage,

352
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,469
no one can leave today.

353
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,638
My grandson

354
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,598
is a great person

355
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,918
and a pillar of the country.

356
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,719
He is the most indispensable talent
in our town.

357
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,398
If even he can't find a partner,

358
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,358
what's the use

359
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,509
of your department?

360
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,669
Madam Wu,

361
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:24,118
is this grandma trying to find a wife

362
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,189
for her grandson?

363
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,479
Yes, she comes often.

364
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,550
I'm almost driven crazy by her.

365
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,509
Madam Wu,

366
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,199
let me try.

367
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,479
See if I can rescue you.

368
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,669
Good girl.

369
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,630
Grandma,

370
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,158
I am a layman
when it comes to ping pong,

371
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:45,070
but I am good at finding a partner.

372
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,110
Girl,

373
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,759
if you are a spy

374
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,199
sent by Wu Xuehua,

375
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,398
I won't spare you.

376
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,870
Grandma,

377
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,519
is there no more trust between people?

378
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,189
Do you think I look like a traitor?

379
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,150
Sure,

380
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,709
then tell me,

381
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,790
what's the trick?

382
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,118
These days,

383
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,279
arranged marriages by parents

384
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,709
or matchmakers are no longer popular.

385
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,358
The best places to find a partner
are a gathering with friends,

386
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,509
eating, and drinking.

387
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,279
I don't need you to tell me that.

388
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,719
My grandson is not into parties.

389
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,918
What about dating websites?

390
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:27,719
Social media?

391
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,390
That's even more unreliable.

392
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,318
We don't even know
who is on the other side yet,

393
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,909
and they want to collect my money.

394
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,150
You don't want to spend money, huh?

395
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,790
Grandma,

396
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,110
have you ever heard of WeChat Shake?

397
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,199
Low cost, high opportunities.

398
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,279
Exactly tailored

399
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,669
for your grandson.

400
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,630
Look.

401
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:58,759
How do you shake this?

402
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,749
Let me teach you.

403
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,150
Will a girl appear after shaking it?

404
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,558
There will definitely be girls.

405
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,039
You have to tirelessly

406
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,870
shake, find, and chat.

407
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,949
Not bad, girl.

408
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,078
Although your limbs are not coordinated,

409
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,669
your brain is bright.

410
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,630
Grandma,

411
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:28,439
as long as you continue
shaking diligently,

412
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,630
I guarantee you will have
a granddaughter-in-law this year.

413
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,390
Teach me more.

414
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,709
Look.

415
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,150
Look for this page.

416
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,918
Slide open and click into it.

417
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:40,989
Hear the noise.

418
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,390
Let me tell you again.

419
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,279
Look for this page.

420
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,830
Click this.

421
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,870
After that, listen.

422
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,590
Thank you.

423
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,039
What do you want?

424
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,679
A chicken.

425
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,199
A chicken.

426
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,799
Two drumsticks.

427
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,550
Okay.

428
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,239
Two drumsticks.

429
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,110
Yes.

430
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,398
Here you go.

431
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:37,160
Thanks.

432
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,999
- What do you want?
- A drumstick and a wing.

433
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,158
A drumstick and a wing.

434
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:41,638
Okay.

435
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:42,790
Thank you.

436
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,078
Okay.

437
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,118
Hi, what do you want?

438
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,719
I don't eat chicken at all.

439
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,269
Don't you sell anything else?

440
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,110
You!

441
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:50,999
What are you doing here?

442
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,790
Where did you come from?

443
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,199
Madam.

444
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,949
You...

445
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,358
I want a chicken and a drumstick.

446
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,150
Okay.

447
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,398
It's not a festive season.

448
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:59,030
What made you come home suddenly?

449
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,830
Are you fired?

450
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,550
Can you wish something good for me?

451
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,959
I had a dream.

452
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,199
I dreamed that you missed me.

453
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,199
I took annual leave on purpose

454
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,550
to stay with you for a few days.

455
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,439
As always,

456
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,838
you have a sweet mouth.

457
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,398
Do you think I believe you?

458
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,759
Mommy.

459
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,999
Don't you miss me?

460
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,949
Shoo!

461
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,550
Don't disgust me here.

462
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,469
When would I have time to miss you?

463
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:24,030
We're closing the stall early today.

464
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,679
I'll give you two chicken drumsticks.

465
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,558
New flavor.

466
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,909
Tell the folks about it.

467
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:39,469
Grandma.

468
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,030
Grandma.

469
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,189
Grandma.

470
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:07,519
Thank you.

471
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,469
Okay.

472
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:12,118
I just passed by the town committee.

473
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,039
I helped Madam Wu settle a grandma

474
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,590
who was looking
for a date for her grandson.

475
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,150
My mouth was dry after talking with her.
It was really exhausting.

476
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,799
Madam Wu really has a hard time
being the Women's Director.

477
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,150
Where do I put this?

478
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:25,239
Let me do it.

479
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,909
Go home quickly. I'm hungry.

480
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,078
He, that's enough.

481
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,679
There are so many dishes already.

482
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,709
This is the last one.

483
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,158
Here I come.

484
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,519
Your favorite shredded sweet potato.

485
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,479
Mr. He,

486
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,269
your cooking has improved.

487
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:23,598
This is nothing.

488
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,560
If we were to prepare a feast,
we would need your mother.

489
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,229
What time does Niaoniao
get out of school?

490
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,158
The time she gets out of school

491
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,469
depends on how long the detention
given by the teacher is.

492
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,118
It seems like you just can't stop

493
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,358
throwing shade at your daughters.

494
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,719
I diss her every day,

495
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,229
but she still doesn't care at all.

496
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,358
If I followed your method
of motivational education,

497
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,909
she would drive me mad.

498
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,239
She's back.

499
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,830
You brat.

500
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:46,878
You can't be more steady?

501
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,759
Do you want to break the door?

502
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,439
That's enough.

503
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,830
I'm starving.

504
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:52,949
Unbelievable.

505
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,989
Jie.

506
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,030
Let me take a look at you.

507
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:03,878
You do look much fairer.

508
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:05,720
The whitening mask I gave you
did a good job, right?

509
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,759
Yes.

510
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,800
Why does she care about whitening?
She is still so young.

511
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,799
I think you are both sick.

512
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,509
Niaoniao, quick, come over and eat.

513
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,669
You scold me
as soon as I enter the door.

514
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,078
Do you see this?

515
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,909
I'm not allowed to speak in this house.

516
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:17,999
He Niaoniao,

517
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,439
don't you accuse me here.

518
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,838
Jie,

519
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,429
take me to Shanghai quickly.

520
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,669
Even if you go to Shanghai,

521
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,039
you won't even recognize

522
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,229
all the words on the hotel signs.

523
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,519
Jie, look at her.

524
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,398
Always humiliating me.

525
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:30,429
True, the way our mother talks
is quite problematic.

526
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,749
Stop talking about me.

527
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,310
I haven't asked you yet.

528
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,310
Why did you suddenly take leave?

529
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,398
Is the company doing badly?

530
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,199
Remember this.

531
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,799
Our company is among the top ten
medical device companies in the world.

532
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,679
Your daughter
is a senior technical salesperson.

533
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,429
I can enjoy paid time off.

534
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,918
So what if it's in the top ten
or top five?

535
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,239
You don't own the company.

536
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,239
You should pay more attention

537
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,479
to our family business.

538
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,799
Didn't I applaud you every time

539
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,398
you broke your sales record?

540
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:56,030
Stop doing that nonsense.

541
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,949
Listen.

542
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,239
Mr. He and I

543
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,030
plan to expand our business.

544
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,918
No more slaughtering chickens at home.

545
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:04,840
The blood smells bad,
and it's not environmentally friendly.

546
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,189
Coincidentally,

547
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,590
you're back now.

548
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:08,558
Starting tomorrow,

549
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,719
you will do the deliveries.

550
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,070
This way, Mr. He will have time
to look for a factory with me.

551
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,390
I'm here on vacation.

552
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,949
Spoiled brat.

553
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,790
Zhuang Jie, let me tell you,

554
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,030
I don't care if you are
called Ashley or Jessica in Shanghai.

555
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,509
When you come back to this home,

556
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,110
you are my worker.

557
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,429
She's right.

558
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,039
This shredded sweet potato
is stuck in my teeth.

559
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,390
Mother, just talk less.

560
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,170
(Possession Organizer)

561
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,989
It's breakfast time.

562
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,878
Dad,

563
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,918
I told you I don't like
the breakfast from this place.

564
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,909
Can you show some respect?

565
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,790
I'll buy it from another store
next time.

566
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,949
I didn't buy this for you today.

567
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,749
For my sister's sake.

568
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,558
By the way, Dad,

569
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,439
don't leave in a hurry yet.

570
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,790
About the sneakers...

571
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,078
If you need money,
discuss it with your mother.

572
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,269
Zhuang Jie.

573
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:29,878
Zhuang Jie,

574
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:31,590
don't laze around after you wake up.

575
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,719
Tutor He Niaoniao

576
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,870
on her homework later.

577
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,150
Did you hear that?

578
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,759
I haven't dared to reply

579
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,469
to her class's
WeChat group since long ago.

580
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,280
Also, don't forget to take care
of the deliveries this afternoon.

581
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,879
Look at your messy hair and dirty face.
Tidy up yourself before going out.

582
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:46,150
Don't affect Liaogen Chicken's brand image.

583
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,398
You're the same every day,

584
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,030
always sleeping in.

585
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,279
Mom...

586
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,458
I'm busy now. If you have anything
to discuss, talk about it tonight.

587
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,310
Mom...

588
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:21,630
He Niaoniao, do you have thorns
on your body?

589
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,558
Jie,

590
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,158
I'm determined

591
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,398
to be on your side.

592
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:29,189
Don't make me an enemy so quickly.

593
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,229
Niaoniao,

594
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,949
do you want to make some extra money?

595
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,039
Lighter.

596
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,120
You don't have much hair,
yet you are hiring someone to wash it.

597
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,830
We city people are like this.

598
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,269
By the way, Jie,

599
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,989
I forgot to mention

600
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:51,199
that 30 is the price for washing your hair.

601
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,669
Scalp massage is 50.

602
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,638
Shampoo and massage,

603
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:54,558
50 in total.

604
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,118
60.

605
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:55,838
Deal,

606
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,078
but it has to be at least 15 minutes.

607
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,989
Deal.

608
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,110
Niaoniao,

609
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,799
during my vacation here,

610
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,039
I'll let you wash my hair.

611
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,039
Take the money you saved
and sign up for a cram school.

612
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,838
How does that sound?

613
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,638
I'll think about it.

614
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:08,959
My schedule is quite full too.

615
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,439
I was planning

616
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,830
to watch a concert with the money.

617
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,479
He Niaoniao, be serious.

618
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,830
I've been there.

619
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,959
I can see that you changed the score
on your math paper.

620
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,759
Mom might miss it,

621
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,189
but you can't hide it from me.

622
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,030
I won't tell her this,

623
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,679
but you have to attend a cram school

624
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,909
whether you want to or not.

625
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,749
Jie,

626
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,118
I forgot to mention it just now.

627
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:36,429
The second basin of water is half-price.
It's 30 yuan.

628
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,429
What?

629
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,669
Do you want it?

630
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:39,909
It's okay if you don't want it.

631
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,949
Come back.

632
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,310
You profiteer.

633
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,918
That's who I am.

634
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:47,110
I accept WeChat Pay, but late payment
will not be entertained.

635
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:48,870
Transfer it yourself.

636
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,509
Don't transfer more than the amount.

637
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,480
(Old Cedar)

638
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,350
Jie,

639
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,719
just enjoy your vacation.

640
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,239
Why are you Shaking?

641
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,199
Who did I Shake?

642
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,799
Here,

643
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,799
someone is Shaking you here.

644
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,078
They're called Old Cedar.

645
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,749
She looks like a grandma.

646
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,410
(Old Cedar)

647
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,909
Sure,

648
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,310
add her.

649
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,350
Jie,

650
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,558
you have to give me another 100 yuan.

651
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,590
Hush money.

652
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,909
He Niaoniao, are you not ashamed
of yourself?

653
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,959
If you don't pay up,
I'll tell our mother

654
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,920
that you have been using Shake
like an indecent girl.

655
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,799
He Niaoniao,

656
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,390
give me my phone.

657
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,358
No.

658
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,039
He Niaoniao,

659
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,358
you aren't done washing my hair yet.

660
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,398
Be self-reliant, Jie.

661
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:39,899
He Niaoniao!

Gratitude for what?

It's quite lively here.

My father

684

just had his funeral a few days ago.

685
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,150
There were a lot of people
who were there to help.

686
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,119
Excuse me,

687
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,719
I had no idea.

688
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,070
Let me give you a discount.

689
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,038
No.

690
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,349
He was 97. It was a joyful mourning.

691
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,470
Congratulations, then.

692
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,430
I mean, you're blessed.

693
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,349
I'll stop bothering you. I'm leaving first.

694
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,000
Since you're here,
why don't you eat something?

695
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,438
No.

696
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,709
Watch some opera, then.

697
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,749
Think of it as cheering me up.

698
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,159
Today is my gratitude dinner.
Come on, sit here.

699
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,119
I specially invited this troupe

700
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,218
from the provincial capital.

701
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:24,709
They are performing
"Farewell My Concubine".

702
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:25,478
You keep watching.

703
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,669
I need to get busy.

704
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,789
Just an ordinary man,

705
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:34,679
yet you are someone

706
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,030
who makes a woman fall in love.

707
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,389
In this world full of desire and chaos,

708
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:53,159
how could there be
such a sincere, straightforward,

709
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,430
and deeply sentimental man like you?

710
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,679
From that time on,

711
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:08,838
you are engraved in my heart.

712
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:10,709
Great.

713
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,269
Full of nonsense!

714
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,878
Tell me.

715
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,559
Is it Liu Bang?

716
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,950
Did he send you to convince me?

717
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,918
I was merely listening

718
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,599
to the call of the heart.

719
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,799
That Liu Bang

720
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,150
is a scoundrel. A gangster.

721
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:36,518
He dimmed the romantic night

722
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:43,950

It's all right.

730
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,510
I'm just here to have a meal.

731
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,789
You aren't eating anything, though.

732

you're sitting on my grandma's seat.
