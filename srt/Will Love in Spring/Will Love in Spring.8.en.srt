(Prosperity)

2
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:04,900
Zhuang Yan.

3
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:06,819
He Niaoniao.

4
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:09,574
Tomorrow,
both of you will return to school.

5
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,300
Resume your studies.

6
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,620
Mom.

7
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:14,980
I...

8
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:17,374
You guys don't need
to worry about the family.

9
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,419
It's already been more than a week.

10
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,660
The living have to resume their lives.

11
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:24,219
I'm quitting school.

12
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,379
How dare you?

13
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,139
I've quit the group chat
for our study group.

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,060
But why?

15
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:34,540
They say that

16
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:37,740
women in our family
jinx their husbands.

17
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,019
I didn't say that.

18
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:44,340
They were saying that.

19
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,579
People have their own opinions.

20
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:55,700
We can't control them.

21
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:58,460
However, we can choose
how to live our lives.

22
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,180
Let's just ignore them.

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,419
He Niaoniao,

24
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,540
if you're still my daughter,

25
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,779
all the more you need to go to school.

26
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,379
Show everyone

27
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:15,219
how our family of jinx

28
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:16,900
can survive without men.

29
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,100
Mom.

30
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:19,379
I'm still here.

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,659
I can quit school

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,740
and help the family out.

33
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:22,620
- No.
- No.

34
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,979
If you dare to mention

35
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:30,745
that you're quitting school again,

36
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,659
I'll break your legs.

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,379
Besides,

38
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:36,810
braising chickens is not

39
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:37,900
what your hands are for.

40
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,219
You and He Niaoniao need
to focus on your studies.

41
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,060
It'll be the biggest favor
you can do for me.

42
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:46,620
Did you hear me?

43
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:13,090
In the past, I didn't think

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,688
He Zhangyue was a talkative person.

45
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,117
But why is the house so quiet

46
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,340
without him around?

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,560
=Will Love In Spring=

48
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

49
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,880
=Episode 8=

50
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,180
(Therefore, Zhuang Jie,)

51
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,620
(the nature of loss)

52
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,620
(is teaching us)

53
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,917
how to accept things gradually.

54
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,220
I know you have a rough time now.

55
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,180
(But you'll get over it.)

56
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:52,620
Those who will leave will leave.

57
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,231
We can't make them stay.

58
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,939
As living humans,

59
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,231
we can only give our condolences.

60
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,019
Mom.

61
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,300
Let me do it.

62
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:53,699
Go to sleep.

63
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,660
I'm not sleepy.

64
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,220
Even so, you need to sleep.

65
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:01,420
We're reopening

66
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,802
the braised chicken shop tomorrow.

67
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,545
You'll return
to Shanghai tomorrow, right?

68
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:08,802
Remember to work hard when you're there.

69
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:09,899
You don't need to miss me.

70
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,740
I'll go back and do my job handover.

71
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,540
I'll pack my usual belongings,

72
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:18,980
and I'll come back soon.

73
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:21,939
Why are you coming back?

74
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,980
Didn't I say I don't need you?

75
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:25,980
Mom.

76
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,420
I'm no longer 12, you know?

77
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:30,780
Even so, you're still a child to me.

78
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,259
I said I don't need your help.

79
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,420
You think you're

80
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,088
the only stubborn person in the family?

81
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,180
I'll come back no matter what you say.

82
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,459
Mom.

83
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,100
Since it has already come to this,

84
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,699
we can only

85
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,139
depend on ourselves now.

86
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,620
We'll definitely get over it.

87
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:29,339
I know that.

88
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:58,380
Here you go.

89
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,550
I've organized them for you.

90
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,060
See if there's anything else you need.

91
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,570
But it's fine even if
you leave them behind.

92
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,317
I'll send them to you
via courier service.

93
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:12,339
You can cry

94
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,619
if you wish to.

95
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,699
There's no need to hold it in.

96
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:20,288
I'm not going to cry.

97
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:22,060
It's pointless.

98
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:31,500
If so, you should head back

99
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,945
and keep Godmother company for now.

100
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:35,540
You can come back once the factory

101
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:37,300
and the shop have settled down.

102
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:40,345
I'll keep an eye on
the company's side for you.

103
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,859
I'll update you with

104
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,917
the latest client info

105
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:44,339
and industry news.

106
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:46,540
I'll make sure you won't lag behind

107
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,939
when you come back.

108
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:54,780
I'll head to the company tomorrow

109
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:55,859
and do my job handover.

110
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:02,219
Zhuang Jie,

111
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,699
one's emotions

112
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,317
might not communicate well with others.

113
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,610
You can show your friends

114
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:10,339
and families your weak side.

115
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:12,020
But in the company,

116
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,745
you have to show them who's the boss.

117
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:15,219
Don't let those who are

118
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,170
eyeing your position

119
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,140
think that you're weak

120
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,410
and that you won't be returning.

121
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:19,579
Don't worry.

122
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,819
I know what to do.

123
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:28,770
I'll be leaving my position temporarily.

124
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,180
You have to depend on yourselves.

125
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:32,490
Both offense and defense
are vital in our sector.

126
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,320
Not only do we have to
compete with our peers,

127
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,870
but we also have to retain our clients.

128
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,602
But remember this.

129
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:38,099
No matter what you do,

130
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,545
you mustn't cross the bottom line.

131
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:41,774
Do not ruin the sector's
ecological environment.

132
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,370
You will receive
a bigger piece of the pie

133
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,799
if you make sure it's large enough.

134
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,979
Zhuang, don't worry.

135
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,020
We won't let you down.

136
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,350
We'll do a good job with the rest.

137
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,540
Sales experts

138
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,219
are people who go to extremes

139
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,488
to accomplish something simple.

140
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,050
For example, when you promote a product,

141
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:58,545
not only do you have to know
your theories and data,

142
00:10:58,602 --> 00:10:59,300
but you also have

143
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,490
to know how to bundle them

144
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,345
into a set and similar products
on the market.

145
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,570
You guys need to know
your clients' transactions,

146
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,320
even their medical
insurance information.

147
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,209
To organize them,

148
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,402
and learn how to analyze them.

149
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:09,600
Any other questions?

150
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:11,180
Okay.

151
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,780
Zhuang, are you leaving already?

152
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,945
Is there anything else?

153
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,060
I requested to our superior yesterday.

154
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,500
I want to take your seat

155
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,859
during your absence.

156
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:24,459
You know this too.

157
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,500
Newcomers like us

158
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,859
don't even have our own desks.

159
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,780
But I don't mean anything else.

160
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,831
I want to get some luck
from the top salesperson.

161
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,450
If our superior is fine with it,

162
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:37,420
I'm fine with it.

163
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,631
But first, I need to correct you.

164
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,260
You can't just become
a top salesperson with luck alone.

165
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,300
If not, all of my experiences
would've been in vain.

166
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,090
You may take my seat for now

167
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,860
but don't put too many
personal belongings.

168
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,810
If not, you'll keep them

169
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:50,739
when I come back. It'll be troublesome.

170
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,219
Of course.

171
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,380
Zhuang, you mustn't overthink it.

172
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:57,500
Jia,

173
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,900
I was never the one to overthink it.

174
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,060
I understand you.

175
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,780
You're young and ambitious.

176
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,609
From a certain POV,

177
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,831
this is actually a strength.

178
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,699
But remember what I said.

179
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:11,420
You can only travel far

180
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,020
if you don't cross the bottom line.

181
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,459
I've been working for many years.

182
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:16,540
I hate the term

183
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,459
"involution" the most.

184
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:19,330
One's ability shows

185
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,380
whether they stay
at the top or remain at the bottom.

186
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:23,939
You're very intelligent.

187
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,060
But there might be some lessons

188
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,380
you'll only get to learn in the future.

189
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,540
Mom.

190
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,579
Mom, calm down.

191
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:34,619
Slow down.

192
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:35,699
Who's missing?

193
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,420
He Niaoniao ran away from home?

194
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,550
I would've run away from home long ago

195
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:42,979
if my father wasn't around.

196
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:49,260
Mom.

197
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,420
Niaoniao is a witty girl.

198
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,459
You know that too.

199
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:55,619
I'll look at her in a different light
if sh can travel to Shanghai alone.

200
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:56,180
Calm down.

201
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,850
I'll inquire about her
at the train station.

202
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,619
Staff nowadays

203
00:12:58,619 --> 00:12:59,430
are very responsible.

204
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,640
I'm sure they'll question her

205
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:01,420
if they see a girl

206
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,688
like her traveling alone.

207
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:03,300
You...

208
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:04,619
You should calm down.

209
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,380
I'll update you later.

210
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:17,699
Who is this?

211
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:19,739
Chen Maidong?

212
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:52,900
He Niaoniao.

213
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,099
What are you up to, huh?

214
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,619
You left the house

215
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,710
after leaving behind a note?

216
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:58,660
Did you know that Mom

217
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,560
was worried about you?

218
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:00,339
How could you...

219
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,219
How could you

220
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,260
be so bold?

221
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,459
Isn't she safe now?

222
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:05,579
We can only call this a close call.

223
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,450
It'll be too late when
something happens to her.

224
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:09,650
You should tell Madam Liao
that she's safe first.

225
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,380
How did you find her?

226
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,140
I came to Shanghai for a meeting.

227
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,602
I encountered her on the train.

228
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,420
Thank you so much.

229
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,031
I was so worried about her.

230
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,774
Don't mention it.

231
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:27,300
Talk it over with her.

232
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,660
If so,

233
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,174
I'll make a move first.

234
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:34,688
Do you have
something urgent?

235
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:37,339
I...

236
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:39,579
It's not that urgent.

237
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:44,380
If so, do you want

238
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,459
to have a beverage?

239
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:48,420
I'm too busy

240
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,739
to buy you a meal now.

241
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,730
Since you're around,

242
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,060
at least I won't beat her up

243
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,174
out of frustration.

244
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,380
Do you always

245
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,859
beat up your sister?

246
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:02,730
I can learn how to beat her up

247
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:03,619
starting from now.

248
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,020
Niaoniao.

249
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,380
What's wrong with you?

250
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,780
Why did you do that?

251
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,300
The house felt cold.

252
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,339
What do you mean?

253
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:55,739
I have the feeling

254
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:57,939
that Dad is still home.

255
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,140
He wants to take me with him.

256
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,780
He Niaoniao,

257
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,631
don't let your imagination run wild.

258
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,619
Mr. He doted on you so much.

259
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,849
Why would he take you away?

260
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,317
It's precisely because he doted on me

261
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,117
that he wanted me to keep him company.

262
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,819
Didn't you guys say

263
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,979
that he went to a better place?

264
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,260
To be honest,

265
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,540
I wanted to leave with Dad.

266
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,840
But I was afraid that
I couldn't explain to Mom.

267
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:42,699
He Niaoniao,

268
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:44,859
you're getting ridiculous here.

269
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,500
Why do you disrespect

270
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,660
the sense of a child?

271
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,339
I know that Dad is still around.

272
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,900
He keeps talking to me.

273
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,619
Niaoniao,

274
00:16:58,339 --> 00:16:59,900
why would I disrespect you?

275
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:05,089
I was the same as you

276
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,917
when I was your age.

277
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,060
But we mustn't think of it that way.

278
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,180
Even if we were both 12

279
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,780
when we lost our fathers,

280
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,740
you're not me.

281
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,339
And, you'll never feel what I feel.

282
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:07,060
Niaoniao,

283
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,740
your feeling

284
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,345
might not be a hallucination.

285
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,099
Everything in the world

286
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,740
is made up of atoms,

287
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,460
including humans.

288
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:23,659
From a certain perspective,

289
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,060
it's a type of energy.

290
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,545
It's just that we can't see it

291
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,500
or touch it.

292
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:33,917
Your father,
whom you spent most of your time with,

293
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
is just existing in another form.

294
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,660
That's why it's normal for you

295
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,060
to sense his presence.

296
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,419
So, my father is still
in the house, right?

297
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,300
He'll always be in your heart.

298
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,619
That's way more important.

299
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,960
But I wish to adjust my frequency
to my father's frequency.

300
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:57,980
I want to tell him that I miss him

301
00:18:58,174 --> 00:18:59,774
and that I can't forget about him.

302
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,339
For some words,

303
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,117
your father will be able

304
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,202
to sense it
even if you don't say it out loud.

305
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,619
He should be very worried about you.

306
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,339
It's because his sudden departure

307
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
is a huge blow

308
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,300
to your entire family.

309
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,145
We have many subjects we have to study

310
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,780
when we go to school.

311
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,020
However, no one

312
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,339
ever taught us about death.

313
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,579
Death sucks.

314
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,020
Why must I study

315
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,940
such a subject?

316
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,819
Niaoniao,

317
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,819
death

318
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,500
is actually a long game
of hide-and-seek.

319
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:49,460
Although you can't find your father now,

320
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,220
that doesn't mean

321
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,419
there's no point in living.

322
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:55,500
Since your father is hiding right now,

323
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,099
you should cherish

324
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,020
your other family members more,

325
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:03,579
don't you think?

326
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:08,980
If so,

327
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,460
is my father doing okay now?

328
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:14,980
Is he still suffering?

329
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,020
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:27,379
I have no idea either.

331
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,899
But from a professional perspective,

332
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,602
for those who just departed
from the world,

333
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,379
their bodies aren't remains

334
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
or remnants.

335
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:41,890
It's more like
they're experiencing some sort

336
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,680
of changes, nurturing,

337
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,899
and the hatching

338
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:46,940
of a new form of life.

339
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,700
When people

340
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,859
depart from this world,

341
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,379
scientists once made an educated guess.

342
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,540
The billions of atoms within you

343
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,379
start to drift apart.

344
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:35,500
They're no longer confined
to the human form.

345
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,410
The parts that make up the human body

346
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:40,300
are taken down one by one

347
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,819
as the human

348
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,740
breathes one last time.

349
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:46,419
These atoms start to disintegrate

350
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,850
and merge into the surrounding land.

351
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:52,659
The atoms form something new.

352
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,819
They became

353
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:56,220
the leaves of sunflowers,

354
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
the spotted snails,

355
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,020
the husk of corn,

356
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:01,917
the upper jaw of an insect,

357
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:04,419
and even the feather

358
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:05,220
on a bird's tail.

359
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:07,574
However, each of these atoms

360
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:10,579
carries a mark of their previous lives.

361
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:12,940
Therefore,

362
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,379
life doesn't vanish.

363
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,020
They only exist in another form.

364
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:19,579
In the past you

365
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:21,540
might embrace people,

366
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,379
might smile,

367
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,980
or frown.

368
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:27,339
But now,

369
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
you might have become

370
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,619
the seaweed that dances with the waves,

371
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:33,970
the swirling Mammatus clouds

372
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,339
beneath the cumulonimbus,

373
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:37,980
the fluttering silverfish

374
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,419
as it lays eggs

375
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:41,460
or a cobblestone

376
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,099
that's gliding in a vortex.

377
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,859
Your body

378
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,859
can travel across the world,

379
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,540
make the grassland crease,

380
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,780
bend the pine branches,

381
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:56,020
and make the egrets flap their wings.

382
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,740
All in all,

383
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,659
the peak you wished to conquer,

384
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,088
the underwater world you wished to see,

385
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,945
and the sky you wished to conquer,

386
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,260
you can achieve

387
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,339
all of them easily.

388
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,980
You didn't finish the story, right?

389
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,631
What about the rest?

390
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,339
I suggest you read the book yourself.

391
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,920
"Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives"

392
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,520
by

393
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:07,780
David Eagleman.

394
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,402
Do you wish to take a look around?

395
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,540
The balcony has the best view.

396
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,379
You can see the Oriental Pearl Tower.

397
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,260
It's just a radio tower.

398
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,774
What's so nice about it?

399
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:50,859
Chen Maidong.

400
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:55,859
Luckily, I know you well.

401
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,089
If not,

402
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,488
I would've been terrified by now.

403
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:00,500
Do you have a grudge

404
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:01,540
against my lights?

405
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:03,339
Warming one's body

406
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:04,640
and acquiring light

407
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,260
affect our emotions.

408
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,500
Warm lighting softens the edges.

409
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
It soothes one's nerves.

410
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,619
You can try it

411
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,139
when you're alone.

412
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,850
I'll remember that.

413
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,780
By the way,

414
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:31,650
weren't you living together

415
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:32,339
with Wang Xixia?

416
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,859
You know about that?

417
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:38,819
I forgot which old classmate
told me about it.

418
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,300
She hasn't returned yet.

419
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,460
She went on a blind date.

420
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,339
What?

421
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,880
You think city-dwellers like us
don't go on blind dates?

422
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,460
You think we get our partners in bars?

423
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,174
I'll be leaving now.

424
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,139
Chen Maidong.

425
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:34,579
Thank you.

426
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,819
Be more patient toward your sister.

427
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,500
Honesty is the cure for everything.

428
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:45,099
Luckily, you were around today.

429
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,145
If not, I'll definitely
get irritated by her questions.

430
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,802
I'll definitely tell He Niaoniao

431
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,859
that Mr. He
will definitely go to Heaven.

432
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,619
If she wishes to get there,

433
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,179
she has to pass the exam there.

434
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,660
Those who don't study well
won't get to see their family.

435
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,500
You should shut up.

436
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,740
What about you?

437
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:07,540
Are you okay?

438
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:09,540
Yeah.

439
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:13,099
Didn't you tell me this before?

440
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:15,740
As humans,

441
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,888
we can only give our condolences.

442
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,945
You should take Niaoniao out for a walk.

443
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:28,700
Both of you.

444
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:39,500
Chen Maidong,

445
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:40,740
you deleted my account.

446
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,579
What?

447
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,619
WeChat.

448
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,574
You unfriended me on WeChat.

449
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:55,419
Fine.

450
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,517
I'll add you again, then.

451
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,980
It's over.

452
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:04,619
What do you mean?

453
00:28:07,574 --> 00:28:08,660
You mean the train station?

454
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,780
The kiss?

455
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:12,700
Your phone.

456
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,899
Hurry up.

457
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,099
You're good

458
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,339
in all aspects,

459
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,317
except for the fact that you're petty.

460
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,717
I'll be leaving now.

461
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:44,940
Take care.

462
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:46,659

Did you have fun today?

488
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,100
Of course.

489
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:01,699
Dad promised us several times

490
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,745
that he would
bring all of us to Disneyland.

491
00:32:03,979 --> 00:32:05,619
We'll enjoy his share

492
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:06,699
on his behalf today.

493
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:08,060
Not just today.

494
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,060
From today onward,

495
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,500
we need to lead by example.

496
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:12,260
We need to motivate Mom and Zhuang Yan

497
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,360
and live our lives to the fullest
on Mr. He's behalf.

498
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:15,100
Okay?

499
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:22,580
Oh yeah, for that ride, my goodness.

500
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,717
Straighten your back.

501
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:37,610
Jie, you're back.

502
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:38,179
Hello, mister.

503
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,270
When did you come back?

504
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,300
Just now.

505
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,210
You guys are back.

506
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:42,939
We are back.

507
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,820
- You guys are back.
- Hello, mister, madam.

508
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:54,580
Mr. Zhang.

509
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:55,970
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

510
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,500
Girl, you're back.

511
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,619
Are you okay?

512
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,219
I'm fine.

513
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:00,899
Niaoniao.

514
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:01,899
Girl, where did you go?

515
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:02,820
Shanghai.

516
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,580
Shanghai?

517
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,020
Shanghai Disneyland.

518
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:05,580
Really?

519
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:06,300
Yeah.

520
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,350
Look at how happy you are.

521
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,117
Seems like she's okay now.

522
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,300
She's okay now.

523
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,820
Why aren't you asleep?

524
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:18,419
Can you still move your legs?

525
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:20,820
You guys toured the town

526
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,419
like people who have lost their minds.

527
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,345
I wonder who you were trying to show.

528
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:26,260
I'm telling the folks

529
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:27,740
that I, Zhuang Jie, am back.

530
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,860
The He family is doing fine.

531
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,002
We're not widows and orphans
that can be bullied.

532
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:34,340
You're just giving yourself away.

533
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:35,740
Enough.

534
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,179
Go and take a bath.

535
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:38,740
You can rest after that.

536
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:40,100
Why the rush?

537
00:33:40,174 --> 00:33:41,460
Let's spend some time together.

538
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,179
Is He Niaoniao asleep?

539
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:47,060
Yeah.

540
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:48,540
Mom,

541
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:49,979
you should stop being angry at her.

542
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:51,300
She promised me

543
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,780
that she wouldn't do this again.

544
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:54,979
She's

545
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,431
way less sensible
compared to the younger you.

546
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:00,500
Niaoniao is pretty sensible too.

547
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,820
It's just that
she's sensible in a different way.

548
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,340
I'm a terrible mother.

549
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,580
All of you have to suffer

550
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,860
together with me.

551
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:19,020
Mom.

552
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,060
Have you ever heard
of the term "maerchen"?

553
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,059
What do you think?

554
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,340
When it comes to foreign terms,

555
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,288
I only know "Goodbye".

556
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:31,180
I know nothing else.

557
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,419
I only said "Goodbye".

558
00:34:34,745 --> 00:34:36,140
I'm sure you've heard of the famous

559
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,340
Grimm Fairy Tales before.

560
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,260
The term "maerchen"

561
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,419
means fairy tales.

562
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:41,340
It's a German word.

563
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,660
The narrators at the start
are all women.

564
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,260
As mothers,

565
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:46,740
they hope that their children

566
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,459
can grow up in a pure and gentle world.

567
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:52,260
Fairy tales always give people a notion

568
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,419
of happiness

569
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,820
that's unrealistic.

570
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:58,379
I failed at that.

571
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:00,499
I never believed it.

572
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,380
I wasn't patient enough
to tell you guys about fairy tales.

573
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,059
Do you know who else in the world

574
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,419
doesn't believe fairy tales
or even want to talk about them?

575
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,379
Who?

576
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:10,180
Men.

577
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,780
That's why, Mom,

578
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:15,939
thank you

579
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,340
for leading by example

580
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:18,740
and making us live in reality.

581
00:35:19,774 --> 00:35:21,140
Did you think I wanted to do it?

582
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,700
It's all because I'm unlucky.

583
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,530
If only I could raise all
of you as princesses

584
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,340
and let you guys
live in rainbow bubbles.

585
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,700
Forget it.

586
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,539
Those bubbles will
pop with just a touch.

587
00:35:32,145 --> 00:35:34,260
You'll try to escape from reality
if you're too naive.

588
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:35,530
Both He Niaoniao and I

589
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:36,579
are daughters of Liao Tao.

590
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:39,140
Both of us can grow up overnight
at the age of 12.

591
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:40,539
Just wait and see.

592
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,740
Enough already.

593
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:49,620
Stop that.

594
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,459
Go to sleep.

595
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,340
Fine.

596
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,002
I have one more quote for you
before I go to sleep.

597
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,059
It's by Goethe.

598
00:35:55,402 --> 00:35:56,745
Is it another famous person again?

599
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,660
He's a world-class literary giant.

600
00:35:59,059 --> 00:35:59,700
He once said:

601
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,180
"The Eternal-Feminine

602
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,499
draws us upward."

603
00:36:03,431 --> 00:36:04,660
We'll frame that and hang it

604
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,780
in the living room tomorrow.

605
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:08,700
You're right.

606
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:11,660
Goethe is truly intelligent.

607
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:14,740
Go to sleep now.

608
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:17,860
You should go to sleep too.

609
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,317
You have to wake up early tomorrow.

610
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:54,419
He,

611
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:58,174
today's the seventh day of your passing.

612
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:01,740
Our family is here

613
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,660
to send you off on your last journey.

614
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:10,010
This place was the place
you were supposed to come

615
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,340
for the kite-flying contest.

616
00:37:13,379 --> 00:37:14,340
But it's fine.

617
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,620
I know your temper all too well.

618
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:18,860
The kite-flying contest

619
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,288
doesn't matter to you.

620
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:21,930
I'm sure you'll be content

621
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:23,260
if our family stays harmonious

622
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:25,579
and peaceful, right?

623
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:30,300
Don't worry.

624
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,340
In the days ahead,

625
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:35,780
we'll live a good life.

626
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:57,220
Dad,

627
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,300
I've been studying hard lately.

628
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:06,340
I even read about Newton.

629
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:08,459
That's why I know

630
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,979
that energy

631
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,780
cannot be created

632
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,220
or destroyed.

633
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:17,220
It can only change from

634
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,820
one form to another.

635
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,459
All lives that vanish

636
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,140
use their energies

637
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:26,820
to sustain other living beings.

638
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,140
That's the circle of life.

639
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,539
Edward Munch once said:

640
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,019
"From my rotting body,

641
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,180
flowers shall grow

642
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,300
and I am in them

643
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,180
and that is

644
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,740
eternity."

645
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:11,979
Therefore,

646
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:13,939
Dad,

647
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:16,860
no matter if you're in Heaven,

648
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:19,499
under the sea,

649
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,620
or

650
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,019
everywhere around us,

651
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,459
I'm happy as long

652
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,831
as we're on the same planet.

653
00:39:58,579 --> 00:39:59,379
Mr. He,

654
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,459
we'll miss you forever.
