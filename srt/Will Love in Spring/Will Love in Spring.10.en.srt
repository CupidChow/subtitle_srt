1
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,240
(Waiting area)

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,120
(Shanghai, seven months ago)

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,160
(In operation)

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,759
She went in?

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,600
Right on time, Mr. Ji.

6
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:56,990
Only dare to appear when it's

7
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,274
about time to apply anesthesia.

8
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,359
How is she?

9
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,439
Who?

10
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,639
Jamie.

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,679
You're not in France yet.

12
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:06,560
Speak Chinese.

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,119
Tell Zhuang Jie for me.

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,990
When I'm settled in France

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,045
there will be ample time

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,600
to contact her.

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,319
Zhuang Jie also asked me to tell you.

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,640
Life is too short.

19
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:25,759
I wish you happiness.

20
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,600
Even after I am transferred to France

21
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,479
I am still your direct superior, Wang Xixia.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,309
So what?

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,160
So whatever it is between
Zhuang Jie and me,

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,000
please keep out of it.

25
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,960
You and Zhuang Jie?

26
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,180
What's between you two?

27
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,600
Wasn't it just a
three-year situation

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
without any acknowledgment?

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,950
You ran away as soon as
she wanted to make it official.

30
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,199
What's wrong?

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,880
Is this flower to commemorate

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,919
your premature love that ended too soon?

33
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,760
=Will Love In Spring=

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,020
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

35
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,580
=Episode 10=

36
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,620
(Ji Tong)

37
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:51,999
Jie.

38
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,119
Are you going to record?

39
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,399
You have to work with me.

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,750
It has to look like the real thing.

41
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,640
Okay.

42
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,719
Let me check the equipment for you.

43
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,159
Not bad.

44
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,159
Lighting, check.

45
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,480
Internet connection, check.

46
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,719
Battery, check.

47
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:10,800
Let me go through the script
for you again.

48
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,439
You have to memorize it later.

49
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,719
Be like me.

50
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,719
Vivid expressions and...

51
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,200
Zhuang Jie.

52
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:16,670
Ji Tong might have not

53
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:17,679
given up on you yet.

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,279
Forget it.

55
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,599
My greatest advantage

56
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,999
is my self-awareness.

57
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,439
It's true.

58
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,279
I...

59
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:25,670
The day when I just came back.

60
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:26,950
He wanted to talk to me.

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
I told him you have a boyfriend.

62
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,700
(Shanghai, last week)

63
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:34,200
Mr. Ji.

64
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:36,874
Don't pretend to be busy.

65
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:37,788
Let's have a chat.

66
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,080
Wang Xixia.

67
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,200
I told you.

68
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:46,200
Even if I went to France,

69
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,839
I am still your direct superior.

70
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,200
So?

71
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,788
HQ wants you to work with me
to train some newbies.

72
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,839
I haven't seen you in two days.

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,960
Didn't the administration tell you?

74
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,760
My annual leave starts today.

75
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,320
Are you avoiding me?

76
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,680
Mr. Ji, it's quite weird

77
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,200
to use this phrase here.

78
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:07,120
There's no need for us
to beat around the bush.

79
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:08,239
I know.

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,760
Zhuang Jie is on vacation

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,680
because I hurt her badly.

82
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,479
Aren't you a bit narcissistic?

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,320
Don't say that.

84
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,719
I really care about her.

85
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,799
If I knew something would happen to

86
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,919
Zhuang Jie's stepfather,

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,880
I should have...

88
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,080
You should keep hanging her.

89
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,799
Quit it.

90
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,830
Zhuang Jie is on vacation

91
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,120
to rest after her surgery.

92
00:05:28,474 --> 00:05:29,560
Your relationship with her

93
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,931
has been thrown away along with
the medical trash long ago.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,640
Moreover,

95
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,880
she has a boyfriend now.

96
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,399
What an attractive couple.

97
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,320
A match made in heaven.

98
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,902
Is he from your hometown?

99
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,880
Handsome.

100
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Attentive to details.

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,599
Treats her well.

102
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,599
From now on, Zhuang Jie's matters

103
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,719
are none of your concern.

104
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,120
Wang Xixia.

105
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:10,950
We are both sensible people.

106
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Why so hateful?

107
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,640
If Zhuang Jie could

108
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,799
abandon Shanghai and me

109
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,279
for a man in the town,

110
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,039
I'd write my last name backward.

111
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Are you mad?

112
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,239
I was just trying to piss him off.

113
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,080
But I think

114
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,120
he still cares a lot.

115
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,239
None of my business.

116
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,302
Have you really let it go?

117
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,440
Why should I lie to you?

118
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:39,599
That's good.

119
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:45,599
Done.

120
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:47,680
Jie.

121
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:48,560
Get the chicken.

122
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:51,320
Anchor.

123
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,440
Get the chicken.

124
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,320
Why are you so

125
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,560
absent-minded tonight?

126
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,080
If you aren't feeling it,

127
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,320
we can get another anchor.

128
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,470
But you must reflect on it properly.

129
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:03,960
We need to have a meeting later.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,839
A serious one.

131
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:09,880
Are you really not feeling well?

132
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,560
Then let Ms. Liao Tao do it.

133
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:15,799
She's busy.

134
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,680
Let Jisan Goose

135
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,560
deal with it first.

136
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:23,479
Come back.

137
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,719
Jie!

138
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,000
Jie!

139
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,320
I am very dissatisfied

140
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,531
with your performance today.

141
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:39,820
I worked so hard, but you
didn't cooperate with me.

142
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm sorry, Niaoniao.

143
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,320
I really can't do it.

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,919
Next time.

145
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,440
I will definitely do better next time.

146
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,039
Next time.

147
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,731
There will be no next time.

148
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,120
Sorry.

149
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:57,200
It's my fault today.

150
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,000
I held my sister back.

151
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,359
It's not entirely your fault.

152
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Everyone has their strengths
and weaknesses.

153
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,520
I might as well study hard.

154
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:08,880
I support you.

155
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,960
Let's first be a good student.

156
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,270
If you want to start a business,

157
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,180
you can take your time.

158
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,302
Don't rush into things.

159
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,520
Jie.

160
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,902
There's something wrong with you today.

161
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,640
There's always something wrong.

162
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,674
Don't interrupt.

163
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,359
I mean.

164
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:28,702
You have something on your mind.

165
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,799
Tell me.

166
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:33,919
I won't tell mother.

167
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,200
Do you remember

168
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,280
a colleague I mentioned before?

169
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,160
He's called Ji Tong. Your boss.

170
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,400
Your ability to remember gossip
is exceptional.

171
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,674
What's up with him?

172
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,950
He came back to China.

173
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,080
He stayed for half a month
to training new employees.

174
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:01,960
He heard something happened
to our family.

175
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,560
So he called to say hello.

176
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,200
Just to say hello?

177
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,519
He wants to see me.

178
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,639
No way.

179
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,080
Why?

180
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:13,080
How can he leave whenever he wants

181
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,502
and see you whenever he wishes?

182
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:17,130
He did nothing to help
when something happened to us.

183
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
You're right, Niaoniao.

184
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,800
Jie.

185
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,119
I've always wanted to ask you.

186
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,119
In the few days after my dad died.

187
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,359
You didn't shed a single tear.

188
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,417
But I don't believe you weren't upset.

189
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,040
How did you get through it?

190
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Did somebody help you?

191
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,759
Certainly.

192
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,839
During those times,

193
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,119
no one could bear it

194
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,617
without help from others.

195
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,879
So,

196
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,359
you should be with

197
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,960
those who help in times of need.

198
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Icing on the cake?

199
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,359
You don't need those.

200
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,940
(Yongda Plaza)

201
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,160
You can't make up your mind
when it comes to underpants, huh?

202
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,800
Hey.

203
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,040
Do you want everyone to know?

204
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Am I wrong?

205
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,479
You look like a pervert.
You've been here for half an hour.

206
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,200
Well, I'm just inexperienced.

207
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,519
I didn't know men's underwear

208
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,599
came in so many styles.

209
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,080
Just randomly pick some.

210
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,040
Get some boxers.

211
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,879
Get some briefs.

212
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,239
Get him a few of each, okay?

213
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:49,839
You do it.

214
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,200
This looks good, no?

215
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,519
This one too...

216
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,160
No wonder you can't get enough of it.

217
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,280
Just choose one for him.

218
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:09,110
Do you guys know each other too?

219
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,680
Too?

220
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:13,210
I didn't have time to introduce myself
the last time.

221
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,040
Cui Ge.

222
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,479
That man.

223
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
He's in his thirties.

224
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,150
He told me he came from a family
of traditional Chinese physicians.

225
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,759
There were a few people with him.

226
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:22,590
Oh, and do you know

227
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,519
what he calls himself?

228
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,879
Cui Ge.
[*Means Big Brother Cui in Chinese]

229
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,759
Acting like a big shot.

230
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,680
Who named him?

231
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,080
Ge as in 'big brother'?

232
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,320
Ge as in 'song'.

233
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,440
Do you like this?

234
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:41,400
No, you do.

235
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,519
I haven't worn it though.

236
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,400
Let me help you.

237
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,999
It's okay.

238
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,479
What a coincidence!

239
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,388
Shall we have a meal?

240
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,680
No way.

241
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:12,874
Was this sent by Zhuang Jie?

242
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,200
What do you want to eat tonight?

243
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:41,630
Anything is alright.

244
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:42,839
Do as you like.

245
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,119
Is there anything you want to say to me?

246
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,920
Like what?

247
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,960
What's going on?

248
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,680
I asked Zhuang Jie
to buy some clothes for me.

249
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,960
I've been busy recently.

250
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:09,719
What is this?

251
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,519
Underwear.

252
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,759
You asked Jie to buy underwear for you?

253
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,359
She didn't refuse me.

254
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,719
That's because Jie

255
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,320
has a big heart.

256
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,119
You little rascal.

257
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,440
Who do you think you are?

258
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,239
You made an unmarried girl

259
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,599
buy you underwear!

260
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,119
What's wrong with that?

261
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,759
You!

262
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:29,960
You!

263
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,400
You should be sentenced!

264
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,280
Are you even treating her like a woman?

265
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,217
That's really not the case.

266
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:39,560
Never mind.

267
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,800
You heartless thing.

268
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,759
You aren't worthy of Jie.

269
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,680
Do you like her that much?

270
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,920
Is there a point in me liking her?

271
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,239
Sure.

272
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,519
Didn't I tell you?

273
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,359
The matter of my partner

274
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,519
is all up to you.

275
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,320
Whoever you like,

276
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,800
I will marry them.

277
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,519
I told you.

278
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,080
You need to move more.

279
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,680
You're walking too slowly.

280
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,040
Just like an old lady.

281
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,160
Hold on.

282
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,731
Let me take a break.

283
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,080
Take it easy.

284
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,119
The way I see it.

285
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,359
The weather is changing.

286
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:34,999
On this body.

287
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,560
Nothing feels right.

288
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:38,230
I can't sleep well either.

289
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,080
Your problem
has nothing to do with the weather.

290
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:42,931
It has everything to do with
your grandson.

291
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,119
True.

292
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,320
When Dong

293
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,731
wasn't even remotely interested in Jie,

294
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,474
I scolded him every day.

295
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Now, he is showing a little interest.

296
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,839
I'm afraid instead.

297
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,160
Speaking with my conscience,

298
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,719
with his condition,

299
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,719
Dong can't bluff anyone.

300
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,680
If he and Jie don't get along,

301
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,920
and he gets hurt again.

302
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:09,560
He might be devastated.

303
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,080
At that time,

304
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,580
Even I wouldn't have the drive to go on.

305
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,599
Stop saying such depressing words.

306
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,960
With your physique,

307
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,040
you will definitely live
to be over 100 years old.

308
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,120
Won't I become an old monster then?

309
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,960
Stop talking nonsense.

310
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,800
Believe in it.

311
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,599
Good things

312
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,160
are coming soon for sure.

313
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,639
I hope so too.

314
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,788
Well,

315
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,080
how good would it be

316
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,820
if we could predict matters
of our children?

317
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,200
Just like the weather forecast.

318
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,759
Come on.

319
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,920
How arrogant are we

320
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,879
to dare predict the weather?

321
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,599
God acts

322
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,479
according to his own will.

323
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,599
We're old.

324
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,879
We need to learn to adapt.

325
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:50,359
If it rains, hold an umbrella.

326
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,400
Put out the quilt to dry
when the sun comes out.

327
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,200
Accept come what may.

328
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,119
And be happy doing it.

329
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,040
Are you serious?

330
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,160
Should I be thankful

331
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,445
for typhoons and earthquakes?

332
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,280
At least, we should learn to be humble.

333
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,719
Know that humans are small.

334
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,639
Many things

335
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,320
are out of our control.

336
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:10,639
What now?

337
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,359
Switching your career

338
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,239
from a fortune teller to a philosopher?

339
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,879
Alright, let's go.

340
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,440
Go back and catch some sleep.

341
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,479
Slow down.

342
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,359
Time passes really quickly, doesn't it?

343
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:29,280
When we were young,
we held each other's tiny hands.

344
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,359
And now,

345
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,879
we're holding each others'
wrinkly hands.

346
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,519
Are you building an emergency room?

347
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,280
You spray too much disinfectant.

348
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,599
The bachelor is here.

349
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,474
The mop is at the door.
Help clean the floor.

350
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,639
Why is your wife like this?

351
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,759
Better than having no wife.

352
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:07,160
My mother-in-law is coming
to check our homework later.

353
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,960
Hurry up.

354
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,331
If we can't get it clean,

355
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:10,788
I will become a bachelor too.

356
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,999
Hurry up.

357
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:19,188
What should you thank me for?

358
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:20,200
Thank me for this cake?

359
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,045
Or should you thank me
for my life-saving grace?

360
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,310
What's wrong with your legs?

361
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,920
Didn't I tell you to stop squatting?

362
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,120
It's too cold in here.

363
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,239
It triggers after a while. Phantom pain.

364
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,960
Wasn't that from back in high school?

365
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,920
Aren't you healed yet?

366
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,960
You really are ignorant.

367
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,400
This condition can't be cured.

368
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,450
It can only be alleviated.

369
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,319
Hold this.

370
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,559
I'm leaving.

371
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:43,440
Let me send you.

372
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,079
Well.

373
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,999
That.

374
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,245
Sister-in-law.

375
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,519
Spit it.

376
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,430
Don't call me that.

377
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,331
It gives me goosebumps.

378
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,079
I'm being serious.

379
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,310
Last year my grandma's
legs were hurting.

380
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,440
She couldn't get out of bed.

381
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
You gave her some medicine patches then.

382
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,999
Could you get me a few more?

383
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,559
I got them from my mother.

384
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,400
Without her knowing.

385
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,319
Back in my hometown,

386
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,102
there is a famous
Chinese medicine clinic.

387
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,319
Just a while ago,

388
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,850
the wife died from drinking pesticides.

389
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,640
That's the couple

390
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,645
who opened that store.

391
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:19,680
Really, that man.

392
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:20,799
I couldn't tell.

393
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,039
On the surface, he looks
like a proper person.

394
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,120
Didn't expect this.

395
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,388
Please stop talking
about other's family affairs.

396
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:27,920
Could you trouble your mother

397
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,719
to get me some more medicinal patches?

398
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,440
That stuff is in short supply.

399
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,531
It'll be hard to get it.

400
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:33,920
Get as many as you can.

401
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,302
I can even pay double the price.

402
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
What happened to Grandma?

403
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,559
It's not her.

404
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:40,640
Then who?

405
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,719
Yes, who needs it?

406
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,680
Spill it.

407
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,989
I need to know if she is worth

408
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,902
my mother's labor.

409
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,239
Zhuang Jie.

410
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,120
Chen Maidong.

411
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,799
You're all grown up!

412
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,400
Alright.

413
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,319
I'll call my mother right now.

414
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,474
I'll ask her to go the clinic
before coming here.

415
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,840
I'll do it for you.

416
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,200
Come here.

417
00:19:06,302 --> 00:19:07,160
What are you doing?

418
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,360
Sit down.

419
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,239
Do that later.

420
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,674
Let me ask you.

421
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:11,880
What happened?

422
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,039
What?

423
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,319
Are you playing dumb?

424
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,960
Zhuang Jie? Are you serious?

425
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,902
Do you have an opinion?

426
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:19,640
No.

427
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,360
What can I say?

428
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,079
I think

429
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,479
Zhuang Jie is too smart.

430
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,988
You might not be able to trick her.

431
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,200
I don't want to trick her.

432
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:34,880
So, you're really in love with her?

433
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm even more worried, then.

434
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:38,988
It's not easy for an iron tree like you
to blossom.

435
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,388
I'm afraid you might wither away.

436
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,999
Can't you just wish me luck?

437
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:43,702
That's not what I mean.

438
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,640
Chen Maidong.

439
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,999
Open your eyes.

440
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:48,445
Do you think Zhuang Jie

441
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,120
will stay in this town?

442
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,120
Is she someone you can live with?

443
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:54,045
I'm just worried that you might be sold

444
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,160
without realizing it.

445
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,440
Look at me.

446
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,160
Do I look like I'm valuable?

447
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,799
Come on.

448
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,400
What's with that mentality?

449
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,239
No matter what, you were

450
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,540
a dashing guy at school.

451
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,960
Don't trample on your own worth.

452
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:08,230
A woman like Zhuang Jie.

453
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:09,999
She has eaten and seen everything.

454
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,702
Dealing with a woman like her,

455
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,200
you must not rush things.

456
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,960
That's like making yourself her slave.

457
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,680
You're a slave.

458
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,999
You are the cheapest slave.

459
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,519
I'm not a slave.

460
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,988
What I'm doing is 'simping'.

461
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,502
What are you doing?

462
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,020
(Ticketing)

463
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,045
When you go back,
try to persuade your mother.

464
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,245
Not to be rushed to put
her goods on the supermarket.

465
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,920
Other than passenger flow,

466
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,640
the place shouldn't be too remote.

467
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,039
I'll ask my cousin-in-law later
to investigate for you.

468
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:49,120
If a shop lot opens up,

469
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,200
- I will tell you as soon as possible.
- Okay.

470
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:52,840
My mother has been collecting chickens.

471
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,220
I heard they are all free-range
chickens with good quality.

472
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,840
I was wondering
if we should hire someone

473
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,245
to rear chickens on Xingshan Mountain.

474
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,217
But that depends on whether
the town agrees or not.

475
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,799
Don't be too aggressive, alright?

476
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:03,030
It's just the two of you.

477
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,840
Take it easy.

478
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
It's a lot of pressure.

479
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,630
More than 200,000 yuan
was invested in the new factory.

480
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,300
Our relative who was seriously injured
was discharged from hospital.

481
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,960
He asked us for 100,000 yuan in one go

482
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,319
as a settlement.

483
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:15,030
After all, he is only over 50 years old.

484
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:16,320
His waist was seriously injured.

485
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,880
He can never do heavy lifting again.

486
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,759
Zhuang Jie.

487
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:21,230
Even if he's a relative,

488
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,560
you need to draft an agreement.

489
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,319
Any more complications in the future,

490
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,350
your family shouldn't bear

491
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,799
any more responsibilities and fees.

492
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,840
That's true.

493
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,440
I wanted to hire a lawyer
to notarize the agreement.

494
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,880
But I feel that's too cold.

495
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,360
Don't test one's humanity.

496
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,680
Sign it in black and white.

497
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:37,910
That's the best for everyone.

498
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,400
Sure.

499
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,588
I'll follow your words.

500
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,120
Okay, you can go back now.

501
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,120
I'm leaving then.

502
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,319
Don't miss me too much.

503
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,640
I picked just the right time to go back.

504
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,239
I heard that Ji Tong
is on a business trip again.

505
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,319
Don't be too hostile to him.

506
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:53,845
Things between us are in the past.

507
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,479
Oh, yeah?

508
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,200
I'm not as tolerant as you.

509
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,319
I rarely dislike anyone.

510
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,759
But if I do,

511
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,400
it's the permanent blacklist for them.

512
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
What are you laughing at?

513
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,759
Including that Cui Ge?

514
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,160
How dare you mention him?

515
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,710
When we met at the mall last time,

516
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,920
I was so sick.
Have you forgotten?

517
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
But I really think

518
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,120
he's quite interesting.

519
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,650
Why don't you try to get to know him?

520
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,519
Shut your mouth.

521
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,880
Go home.

522
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:22,440
Bye-Bye.

523
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,788
Call me if something happens.

524
00:22:27,274 --> 00:22:28,590
You should give it some thought.

525
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,479
That Gui Ge guy.

526
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,799
After all, it's rare to meet

527
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,039
Big Brother Cui.

528
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:32,759
I'll hit you.

529
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,519
Be careful.

530
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,400
Cui Ge.

531
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,479
Cui Ge.

532
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,645
Looking at your phone while walking.

533
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,588
You still have the same old bad habit.

534
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,519
Why are you here?

535
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,519
I came here just to see you.

536
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,360
Are you moved?

537
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,360
I'm a little surprised.

538
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,840
That's great.

539
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,880
Coffee?

540
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
I don't think there's

541
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,902
a cafe that you like in this town.

542
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,960
No.

543
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:40,719
On my way here,

544
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,102
the town seems quite lively.

545
00:23:42,902 --> 00:23:44,590
I need to help my mother
with some chores.

546
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,319
See you later.

547
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,120
Tell me where.

548
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,680
Sure.

549
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,360
I'll call you later.

550
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,440
We'll talk at home tonight.

551
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,319
Okay?

552
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,079
Mother.

553
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,999
Mother.

554
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,960
Stop calling me.

555
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:51,600
Lift your feet.

556
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,200
Whenever you spread out that workbook

557
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:55,710
you will get hungry, thirsty,

558
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,039
or want to go to the toilet.

559
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,740
There's always something wrong.

560
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,479
No, I'm very serious.

561
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:02,960
I'm stuck on this math problem again.

562
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,960
When is Jie

563
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,039
coming back?

564
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,999
How would I know?

565
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,319
She's good.

566
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,840
All grown up now.

567
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,519
The guy even came here to look for her.

568
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,039
I'm still acting like a fool.

569
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,759
I don't even know his last name.

570
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,017
Does she still treat me as her mother?

571
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,640
Really?

572
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,640
That's outrageous!

573
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,799
I was wondering

574
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,880
why you are in a bad mood.

575
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,120
Who came here?

576
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,600
I told you. I don't know.

577
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,319
Anyway, that person

578
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,880
is dressed all prim and proper.

579
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,309
He looks like he wants

580
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,702
to buy the whole of Nanping Town.

581
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,680
He came to the storefront.

582
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,490
When he heard your sister wasn't here,

583
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,960
he quickly walked away.

584
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:42,760
As if he's afraid of the chicken smell
getting on his clothes.

585
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,680
That look on his face.

586
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,680
Oh, him?

587
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,680
You know him?

588
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:49,510
Even you don't know.

589
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,440
How would I know?

590
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:51,799
I'm just guessing.

591
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,279
He should be someone from Shanghai.

592
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,702
I've seen photos of Jie
in their annual meeting.

593
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,960
They all look the same.

594
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,039
All full of vigor.

595
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:00,510
Your sister is also very energetic.

596
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,120
Seriously, what is going on?

597
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,360
She's even dressed like

598
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,559
she's going on a flower parade.

599
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,350
Freeze her to death.

600
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,217
Freeze her to death.

601
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,960
Go do your homework.

602
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,017
What does this have to do with you?

603
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,120
All of you are making me worried.

604
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,519
(Jie,)

605
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,719
(red alert.)

606
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,417
(Be careful with your words and actions.)

607
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,417
Why did you think of
having a barbecue date?

608
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,188
Whenever you have a meal
with Wang Xixia...

609
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,039
Thanks.

610
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,519
Don't you always have

611
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
hotpot, skewers, or spicy hotpot?

612
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,039
You don't have to force yourself.

613
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,017
There are Western restaurants
in our town.

614
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,600
Sure, they aren't high-end.

615
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,017
But their food tastes good too.

616
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,600
It's okay.

617
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,400
I do as the Romans do.

618
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:02,160
If knew you were so easygoing

619
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,960
I wouldn't wear clothes
that absorb smells.

620
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,279
It looks good.

621
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Also, your attire

622
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,799
matches mine very well.

623
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,519
So,

624
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
you still maintain your old habits.

625
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,719
Catering to me.

626
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,200
Accommodating me.

627
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:24,150
After all this time,
I've gotten used to it.

628
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:25,440
After all, you are my boss.

629
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:28,302
You're treating me as your boss now?

630
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:29,960
Didn't you repeatedly

631
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:30,999
tell Wang Xixia?

632
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,440
Even if you went to France

633
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:33,400
you are still our

634
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,360
direct superior.

635
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,960
Jamie.

636
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,880
You should understand.

637
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,880
You are not just a subordinate to me.

638
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,220
(Instructions on the patch)

639
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,220
(Ancestral secret recipe)

640
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,245
There are some things

641
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,790
that I thought were understood
by both of us.

642
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,319
So I never pointed it out.

643
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:59,045
I thought you would
understand it naturally.

644
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,902
My family has high expectations for me.

645
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,120
Since young,

646
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,039
I have never once disobeyed my parents.

647
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:06,188
Guaranteed admission to university,

648
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,330
getting a job, going abroad.

649
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,590
These are all part of the plan.

650
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,120
Of course,

651
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,360
this plan

652
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,759
includes my love life and marriage.

653
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:17,988
I'm more than just the pride
of my parents.

654
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,160
My grandparents...

655
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,440
Hey guys.

656
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,188
Close the door and chat inside.

657
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:22,719
Okay?

658
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,200
Thanks.

659
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,319
Let's go.

660
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,445
Be careful on the way back.

661
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:29,588
Let me repeat it.

662
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,931
I understand what you are saying.

663
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,239
But I don't understand

664
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,519
why you came here specially
to tell me this.

665
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:36,710
You don't understand?

666
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,640
I don't.

667
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,070
I thought since you quietly

668
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
went to France.

669
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,617
There's nothing left to discuss
between you and me.

670
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,474
I went there to pave the way.

671
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,559
For me.

672
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:46,759
For the both of us.

673
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,845
Then I don't understand it even more.

674
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:51,790
I must first satisfy
the expectations of my family.

675
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,230
Only then, can I have a bigger say

676
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,519
in my romance and marriage.

677
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,417
Initially, I planned to
settle down first.

678
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,350
Then I'll send you abroad
for two years of study.

679
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,440
In this case, perhaps

680
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,840
my family will

681
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,160
have an easier time accepting you.

682
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,902
Don't you trust me?

683
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,440
Hello?

684
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,840
Where are you?

685
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:21,750
The barbecue restaurant
on the main street.

686
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,559
Barbecue?

687
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,360
Don't you hate that?

688
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,719
A friend of mine reserved it.

689
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:30,559
Not Wang Xixia. She went back.

690
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,840
What's so urgent?

691
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,920
What's wrong?

692
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,960
Is it not convenient?

693
00:30:37,074 --> 00:30:37,710
Another day...

694
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:38,239
It's alright.

695
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:40,719
Come here.

696
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:42,200
Okay.

697
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,388
Then I'll come over now.

698
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:45,319
See you later.

699
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,360
Okay, bye.

700
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:55,880
Your boyfriend?

701
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,874
This has nothing to do with you, right?

702
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,759
I really didn't expect this.

703
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,600
You move too fast.

704
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,759
Ji Tong.

705
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,600
I know you are a good negotiator.

706
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,519
Good at sophistry and reeling people in.

707
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:16,960
But

708
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,600
let me be honest with you.

709
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,960
You are the one who's too slow.

710
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,719
Too late.

711
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,640
I was being cautious.

712
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,759
You are selfish.

713
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,440
Me too.

714
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:27,559
Zhuang Jie.

715
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,079
Ji Tong.

716
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,719
Just listen to what I have to say first.

717
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,719
Even though it has only been
a few months

718
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,110
since I made things clear with you.

719
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,519
But for me, that is

720
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,880
three years and half a lifetime.

721
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,559
That's right.

722
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,360
My recent experience

723
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:45,990
is enough for me to
become another person.

724
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,759
So, now I don't care at all

725
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,479
what your family thinks of me.

726
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,400
Or can they accept me.

727
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,210
Because I also have to
take care of my family.

728
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:53,920
I'm very busy.

729
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,388
The point is that
you have someone else in your heart.

730
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,680
You'd better stop saying that.

731
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:00,990
You make things seem sour.

732
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,030
This is an objective fact.

733
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,039
The objective fact
is I am a disabled person.

734
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,279
Ever since I was 12 years old.

735
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:10,200
So, no matter how many
two years I spend

736
00:32:10,274 --> 00:32:11,230
to further my studies,

737
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,988
to cater to, or to
accommodate your family,

738
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,039
they may not

739
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,079
accept me.

740
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:15,960
Zhuang Jie.

741
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,239
Relationships require effort.

742
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,017
We can't be too calculative
with the cost.

743
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:21,239
Do I really need to

744
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,600
spell it out for you?

745
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,645
You were the one who was
being calculative first, right?

746
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,640
If you really were sincere,

747
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,279
really paving the way for us,

748
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,217
why did you run away in the first place?

749
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:36,880
You were keeping me
while looking for a better one.

750
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,840
And now, you are not content
with how it ended.

751
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,719
This is not love.

752
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:40,999
You know?

753
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,079
Okay.

754
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,039
Even if you are right.

755
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,600
I'm back now.

756
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:56,990
I want to get back together.

757
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:59,039
I want to accept your confession.

758
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,319
Do you want me to?

759
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,840
I've already rejected you just now.

760
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:09,360
Think about it again.

761
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,120
Think again.

762
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,131
I'm getting some fresh air.

763
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,274
Where is your friend?

764
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,239
Here.

765
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,799
What's wrong?

766
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:37,731
This is a medicine patch.

767
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,617
There is an instruction manual inside.

768
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:40,760
I'll excuse myself.

769
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,479
I'll call you later.

770
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,599
Don't you know about your own condition?

771
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,645
Have you forgotten how it hurts
now that it's healed?

772
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:17,960
That's him, right?

773
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,559
Chen Maidong?

774
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,840
He is Chen Maidong.

775
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,320
This guy?

776
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,559
Ji Tong.

777
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,720
That's enough for tonight.

778
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,479
Neither of us likes barbecue.

779
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,320
What a waste.

780
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:41,331
Thank you for coming to see me.

781
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,720
Good luck in the future.

782
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,119
In the company, you are still my boss.

783
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,760
I respect you very much.

784
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,760
This won't change.

785
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,199
Today, I...

786
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,274
I was a little out of sorts today.

787
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,800
Next time...

788
00:35:58,445 --> 00:35:59,280
I'll send you home.

789
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,074
No, thank you.

790
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,188
You should go home early.

791
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:09,902
I'm not in a hurry
to go back to Shanghai.

792
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,245
Next time, we'll eat what you like.

You, you have to block it.

801
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:01,459
But I did, didn't I?

802
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,700
- You blocked it so well. You're gone.
- I only have three, four, and five left.

803
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Tell me, how could I go?

804
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:06,820
How can I block it?

805
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,614
I'm four, three, four, five.
How can I go?

806
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,780
Come.

807
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,780
It's so cold.

808
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:15,930
You're wearing so little.

809
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:18,939
His face is colder than the weather.

810
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:19,380
Enough.

811
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,042
Talk less.

812
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:20,928
Deal the cards.

813
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:49,939
Mother?

814
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:52,300
I thought you were asleep.

815
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:55,220
Don't tell me

816
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:56,860
you sneaked home silently because you

817
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:58,480
were worried you might wake me up.

818
00:37:58,499 --> 00:37:59,459
Of course.

819
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,499
I haven't done anything wrong.

820
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:09,340
That guy today

821
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,340
is called Ji Tong.

822
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,539
He's my boss.

823
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,820
He heard about our incident.

824
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:15,019
So he came to visit me.

825
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:16,660
That's it?

826
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:17,579
That's it.

827
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,300
Then why did you have to come back

828
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,340
for a change of clothes?

829
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:24,300
Dressing up and all that.

830
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,740
He is a colleague from Shanghai.

831
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:29,619
I must be more formal.

832
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,590
Otherwise, he'll think

833
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,271
I'm too slipshod in my hometown.

834
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:34,890
You think making a fool of yourself
in that dress

835
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,099
will make you confident?

836
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:41,480
I think that person is not good.

837
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,300
Too proud.

838
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,459
When he smiles.

839
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:45,019
There is no warmth in the eyes.

840
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,757
He is not the same kind of person
as you.

841
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:48,019
I know.

842
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:55,939
Jie.

843
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:57,619
We are just

844
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,340
the upright people of this town.

845
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,480
We don't lick anyone's boots

846
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,642
nor are we scared of anyone.

847
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:03,139
Understand?

848
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,139
Mother.

849
00:39:15,499 --> 00:39:16,419
Ji Tong and I

850
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:17,820
are really just colleagues.

851
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:19,139
Don't worry.

852
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:22,539
Okay.

853
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,300
Sleep early.

854
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,419
You too.

855
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:29,539
Did Wang Xixia

856
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,740
send these to you?

857
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,820
No.

858
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,128
A friend of mine gave it to me.

859
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:38,860
Make more friends like this.

860
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:41,300
From now on, forget about those who

861
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,139
only care about your face, not your leg.

862
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,640
(Add alarm, Tag: Chen Maidong
reminds you to change medicinal patch)

863
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:20,180
Money is hard to make.

864
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,220
Crap tastes bad.

865
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,530
My brother-in-law
is getting married next month.

866
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:27,180
I think my income this year

867
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,642
might have to be contributed fully.

868
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,049
At least your money

869
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,357
is going back into your family.

870
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:33,499
Wu Dalang chatted with me two days ago.

871
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,180
He was also cheated a lot.

872
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,340
Who did that?

873
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:39,499
Wu Dalang's in a tough spot.

874
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,059
His father has a GoFundMe.

875
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,300
My wife donated 200 to that.

876
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:44,700
Hedgehog, I think.

877
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,071
He's out of prison?

878
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,220
Yeah.

879
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,600
He brings his company to eat
at Wu Dalang's restaurant every day.

880
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,810
They leave once they're done.

881
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,214
Put it on the tab, he says.

882
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:55,700
Wu Dalang is too cowardly.

883
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,059
Always trying to calm things down.

884
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,979
If it were me,

885
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,480
I wouldn't let Hedgehog have his way.

886
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:01,499
Stop joking around.

887
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,979
Do you think you are Dong?

888
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,871
He has been confrontational
since he was a kid.

889
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:06,820
Stability is important for business.

890
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,700
What is stability?

891
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:10,530
For people like Hedgehog,

892
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,520
once you show your fear,

893
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:12,300
he will bully you.

894
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:13,380
You have to toughen up.

895
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,557
He fears the tough and bullies the weak.

896
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,539
Who's that?

897
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:29,979
Hedgehog.

898
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,660
Just our luck.

899
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,579
Why didn't I hear

900
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,585
about your game here?

901
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:39,059
Let me join in the fun.

902
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,260
Come,

903
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,939
sit here.

904
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:42,459
Win or lose, put it on my account.

905
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,680
Dong and I were just going out
to buy something.

906
00:41:44,728 --> 00:41:46,357
Why should I play with your account?

907
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,139
Why should I

908
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,740
use your money?

909
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:51,300
Moreover,

910
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:52,459
it's not like

911
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:53,220
I have no friends.

912
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:54,300
Aren't I right?

913
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,820
Dong.

914
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,660
Dong, come on.

915
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:02,019
Xu's hardware shop

916
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:02,820
closes early.

917
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,419
Let's go.

918
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:06,600
Don't be in a hurry.

919
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,180
Dong.

920
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:11,260
Lend me some money.

921
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,300
Get lost.

922
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:22,080
What did you say?

923
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,860
I told you to scram.

924
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,300
Still tough as ever, huh?

925
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:35,900
I knew it.

926
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:39,010
As expected of a guy
who deals with dead people.

927
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,814
You're of a different breed, huh?

928
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:44,820
No.

929
00:42:52,414 --> 00:42:53,330
What are you doing?

930
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,099
Don't move.

931
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:54,900
Stop fighting.

932
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:56,340
Stop it.

933
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,979
It's my stuff, don't touch it.

934
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:02,300
Don't do it.

935
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,260
Don't do it.

936
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,220
Don't do it.
