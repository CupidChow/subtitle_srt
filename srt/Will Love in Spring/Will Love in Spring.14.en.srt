1
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,240
This sea area...

2
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,750
Didn't the authorities say

3
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,470
that people weren't allowed
to surf or swim at the unclaimed beach?

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,500
Why would there be people?

5
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,640
They emphasized that surfing
and swimming were forbidden here.

6
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:32,400
Even so,
people didn't heed their advice.

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:33,640
Let's go.

8
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:45,742
Tend to his family members.

9
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,390
My son!

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My son!

11
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,560
Calm down!

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,590
You troublemaker!

13
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,560
Calm down!

14
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,920
We can talk it over!
Please don't act like this.

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,710
Master!

16
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,070
Please calm down!

17
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,230
Return my son to me!

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,680
Calm down!

19
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,120
Return my son to me!

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,230
Return my son to me!

21
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,950
I'm sorry!

22
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:57,280
He didn't like such dangerous sports
before he got to know you!

23
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:00,920
It's all because of you!
He died because of you!

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,070
It's all because
you like such stupid stuff!

25
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,310
Why did you cause him to die?

26
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,400
Why?

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,710
He died because of you!
It's all because of you!

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,360
He died because of you!

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,910
Are you okay?

=Will Love In Spring=

31
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,940
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

32
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,780
=Episode 14=

33
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,240
My brother is Song Ran.

34
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
He's Chen Maidong's best friend.

35
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,920
Therefore,
we have known each other since young.

36
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,270
I fell for him
ever since our first encounter.

37
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
But he always saw me
as the sister of his friend.

38
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,485
I spent a lot of effort
courting him and pestering him.

39
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,228
But he never took me seriously before.

40
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,750
Until the day I was surrounded
by hooligans outside of school.

41
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,830
I thought to myself that it
might be another opportunity.

42
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,190
I kept calling him.

43
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,040
Actually, I didn't fear them at all.

44
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,070
I just wanted Dong to know
that people fancied me as well.

45
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,120
But he ignored me.
He didn't answer any of my calls.

46
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,950
He just notified my brother.

47
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:08,428
He told my brother to tell me
to stop harassing him.

48
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,680
Therefore, my brother was the one
who showed up that day.

49
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,800
(Those people never
took my brother seriously.)

50
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,190
(But in order to stand up
for me, he fought them.)

51
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:36,120
(My brother never
got involved in any fights before.)

52
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,000
(That was the only time.)

53
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,480
(After my brother's passing,
I lost all hope of living.)

54
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,800
(I even thought that I was the one
who was supposed to die.)

55
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,720
(I never expected myself
to interact with Dong again.)

56
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,720
(Even I couldn't forgive myself for it.)

57
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,480
(He has no reason to forgive me.)

58
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,257
(But after that, I realized that I wasn't
the only one who felt guilty about it.)

59
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,428
(It seemed like
Dong felt more guilty about it than me.)

60
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,950
(Only the two of us understood what it
felt like to be in each other's shoes.)

61
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,120
(Therefore, since then,)

62
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,720
(Dong has willingly taken over
my brother's responsibilities.)

63
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,360
(He looked after me and protected me.)

64
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,830
He agreed to every one of my requests.

65
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,240
He satisfied all of
the expectations I had of him.

66
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,120
For the past seven years,

67
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,720
it felt like I was holding
onto the last straw I had

68
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,142
and that I wasn't willing to let go,

69
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,720
even though I knew clearly
that he might have blurred

70
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,360
the lines between sympathy and love
and that he wanted to make it up to me.

71
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,120
But I was selfish.

72
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,030
I thought I could last until the end

73
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,550
by depending on my love for him.

74
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,120
But in the end,
it still ran out of steam.

75
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:56,114
Therefore,
I never blamed Grandma for it.

76
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,171
It was indeed my fault.

77
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,670
Dong is a very kind person.

78
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,790
He's experienced many misfortunes.

79
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,942
And, I took up
seven years of his life too.

80
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,085
I have many regrets, and I don't know
how to make it up to them.

81
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,440
Many people are selfish too.

82
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,870
Don't just blame yourself
for everything.

83
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,200
Zhuang Jie, I suppose you're able
to see Dong smile often, right?

84
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,720
No.

85
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,510
His occupation is unique.
He doesn't like to smile.

86
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,390
You can make him happy.

87
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,360
I can feel that.

88
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,440
I also found out that I loved to smile
after encountering my husband.

89
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,440
You chose the right person
and led a good life.

90
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,960

A little. Did I wake you up?

108
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,030
You didn't come back for two nights.

Got it.

114
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,840
Who's this?

115
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,020
(Lin Lihong, 1998-2023,
Zhang Mingmei, 1972-)

116
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,320
The boy who passed away
on the unclaimed beach.

117
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,028
His mother gave it to me.

118
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,720
Alright. Don't dwell on it.

119
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,542
Go to sleep after taking your medicine.

120
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,200
His mother booked her funeral with me.

121
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,960
How old is she?
Why is she already doing that?

122
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,270
There's no point in reasoning with
people who have their hearts broken.

123
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,480
The parent has
to attend her child's funeral.

124
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,485
It's excruciating indeed.

125
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,480
After all these years,
she's not the only one

126
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,771
who booked her funeral with me.

127
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,800
Some of them knew that I was the one
holding funerals for their loved ones.

128
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,240
They wished that I could
do the same for them as well.

129
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,870
They could only have peace of mind
when I agree to it.

130
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,960
They feel they won't be separated
from the loved ones in the other world.

131
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:18,057
They think they might have a chance
to see each other again.

132
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,390
I guess you know
why I can't leave Nanping now.

133
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,440
It's not just because of Master or you.

134
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,480
I have to keep my promises.

135
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,542
If I just leave this city
and change my career casually,

136
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,171
what should they do by then?

137
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,790
What if they couldn't find each other
in the other world because of me?

138
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,171
What if they can't be reunited?

139
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,440
If so, I'll be a heinous sinner.

140
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,080
Dong, your life is important as well.

141
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,240
Sometimes, as humans,
we have to learn how to be selfish.

142
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:19,870
If you lead your entire life
for the sake of other people,

143
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,600
what will happen
when you grow old and die one day?

144
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,080
Who can you find, then?
Who can you be reunited with?

(Funeral Culture Studies)

146
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,457
Grandma, I'm not eating.
Let me sleep for a little longer.

147
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,720
Who are you trying to scare?

148
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,000
You didn't answer my calls
or reply to my text messages.

149
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,510
How dare you still sleep?

150
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,600
You must've stolen this
from your sister again.

151
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,840
Can you please stop bullying her?

152
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,030
You're worried about her, huh?

153
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,342
It's no wonder
Grandma thinks you're long-winded.

154
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,270
Grandma said you were sick.

155
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,800
Your forehead is quite hot too.

156
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm fine.

157
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:54,750
I'll be fine in a few days.

158
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,750
You must've been worried

159
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,657
since you couldn't reach me yesterday.

160
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,150
Are you trying to threaten me?

161
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,630
Who else can I see behind your back?

162
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,360
Something happened at the
unclaimed beach near the bathhouse.

163
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,240
I know. Yesterday, I was just saying.

164
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,590
Alright. Go to sleep now.

165
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,960
Let's have a chat. I missed you.

166
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,480
You're pretty sweet
when you get sick, huh?

167
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,000
Fine. I'll keep you company for a while.

168
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,590
Here. I have to deliver some chickens
once you're asleep.

169
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,114
The chickens you sell are going
to be our third wheel soon.

170
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,514
Do you know something?

171
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,680
I think this is my first time
being embraced as such.

172
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,920
Nonsense.

173
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm sure your parents did the same

174
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,920
when you were a baby.

175
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,314
You must've forgotten about it.

176
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:13,771
Anyway, I think this is the first time

177
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:16,750
ever since I could remember things.

178
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:21,314
My parents were too busy.

179
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,371
My grandparents
wouldn't do something like this.

180
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,885
It got harder for me
to get closer to people

181
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,350
after I started working.

182
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,720
You were the first person I saw
after waking up.

183
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,480
That felt pretty good.

184
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,880
Chen Maidong,

185
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,750
will you hate me
if I leave Nanping after this?

186
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,070
Life is unpredictable.
Nothing is predictable.

187
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:25,114
We shouldn't sacrifice ourselves
for other people's sake.

188
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,371
We should spend our days to the fullest

189
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,628
when we're still together.

190
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,510
Chen Maidong.

191
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,240
My career isn't as noble as yours.
Shanghai isn't my home either.

192
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,030
But they're quite important to me.

193
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,790
I wish to be successful
and be respected by other people.

194
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,350
I wish to prove my worth.

195
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,742
That's why
I don't want to make any compromises.

196
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,440
I don't want to hate myself or you

197
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:13,228
five years or ten years later
after getting married to you.

198
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,440
I don't want to imagine the kind of life
I could have had.

199
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:23,110
I don't want to become
someone else for your sake.

200
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,600
I support your choice.

201
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,510
He Niaoniao, what have you done again?

202
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:07,771
What time will you be punished?

203
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,314
Do you need me to be your shield?

204
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,200
What do you know?

205
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,830
A battle of the century
between Mom and Jie will erupt soon.

206
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,685
I'm just seeking cover beforehand.

207
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,790
What happened between Mom and Jie?

208
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,200
None of them told me about it.

209
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,070
How could you be that insensitive?

210
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,790
He Niaoniao!

211
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,000
He Niaoniao!

212
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,070
He Niaoniao!

213
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,790
Why are you using that vacuum cleaner?

214
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,640
The noise is crushing my head.

215
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:32,740
It has to be charged too.
Do you think we're rich?

216
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,000
Okay, Mom. I think rags are better too.

217
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,160
Take your sister to breakfast later.

218
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,114
Don't eat casually
because no one is cooking at home.

219
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,680
How old you are?
But you can't even cook.

220
00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:45,714
Mom, don't worry.
We won't starve ourselves.

221
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,171
He Niaoniao. Hurry and tell me.

222
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,400
What's wrong with Jie?

223
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,542
What else do you think?
She got herself a boyfriend.

224
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,400
Who is it?
Isn't that a good thing?

225
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,830
Why is Mom unhappy, then?

226
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,720
Is he from our town? Do I know him?

227
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:03,914
Which question
do you want me to answer first?

228
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,550
Just tell me already.

229
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,771
Jie got together with Chen Maidong.

230
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,680
Really?

231
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,114
Jie didn't reveal it.
She didn't even tell me about it.

232
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,000
But I eavesdropped on the phone call

233
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,114
between Mom and Madam Wu.

234
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,750
I think Mom caught them red-handed

235
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,920
for doing something indecent.

236
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:28,714
Your living expenses
for two days. Take care.

237
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,020
Do not buy any beverages with it.

238
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,000
Mom, we have money.

239
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:33,000
Are you two making money now?

240
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,771
Your sister gave you the money,
didn't she?

241
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:36,457
Don't spend her money casually.

242
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,514
Lin, I have something
to discuss with you.

243
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,350
Don't be angry at me.

244
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,640
I think you'll be alone after I'm gone.

245
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,920
Why don't you follow me to Shanghai?

246
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,310
This won't do.

247
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,800
I have to reorganize my words.

248
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,720
Lin, you're more creative than me.

249
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,342
You're more intelligent than me too.

250
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,960
Say, if you have a silly grandson
like mine,

251
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,057
you'll chase him away and tell him
to go to Shanghai too, right?

252
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,550
I think Jie will be his only girlfriend.

253
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,920
Please make way.

254
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,371
What are you guys doing?
Why are you guys surrounding the place?

255
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:24,085
Madam Wu is inside.
You should go inside and take a look.

256
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,030
Please make way.

257
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,070
Grandma Chen?

258
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:35,800
What are you guys doing here?

259
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:43,742
What are you guys doing?
Are you guys seizing her house?

260
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,960
Where's Grandma Lin?

261
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,720
Why are you only here now?

262
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:48,085
Answer my question.

263
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:49,942
She was just taken away
by the ambulance.

264
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,880
What? The ambulance?

265
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,310
Why is Grandma Lin in an ambulance?

266
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,960
So, you had no idea either?

267
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,310
Grandma Lin has a brain tumor.
It's malignant.

268
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,771
The doctor said she
doesn't have much time left.

269
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,000
Grandma?

270
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,920
Grandma?

271
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,790
Grandma?

272
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,285
She's not answering my calls again.

273
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,820
(Madam Wu)

274
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,680
Yan was busy with cooking.

275
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,440
I could tell. The dishes look healthy.

276
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,440
Here it comes.

277
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,240
Yan, you made fish too?

278
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,057
There's no steam
coming from any of them.

279
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,680
But they're cooked.

280
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
I know how to cook now.

281
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,910
Protein and carbohydrates
have the nutrients we need.

282
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,750
What a waste of food.

283
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,160
Mom, there are only four of us here.

284
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,920
You shouldn't
go against the three of us.

285
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,110
Can't I even express my opinion now?
Who made up that rule?

286
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,160
Precisely.

287
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:02,685
Mom can say whatever she wants to say.
I love every word she says.

288
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,240
Have some mashed potatoes.

289
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,720
Jie, try this.

290
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:15,990
This is the oil vinegar sauce
I made personally.

291
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,500
If you think it's nice,
I'll cook during Chinese New Year.

292
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,714
- Don't.
- Just forget it.

293
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,340
Mom, you should assign
some jobs to me tomorrow.

294
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,828
I don't have a lot of homework lately.

295
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,628
It's time for me to help the family out.

296
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,000
Mom, me too.

297
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,571
Order me around to your heart's content.

298
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,030
Fine. I'll see how it goes.

299
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,270
I can't just assign
empty tasks to you guys.

300
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,750
Liao Tao!

301
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,400
Liao Tao!

302
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,480
Liao Tao!

303
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,550
Liao Tao!

304
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,310
What's wrong?

305
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,550
Hurry and tell me where
Grandma Chen was heading just now!

306
00:27:52,685 --> 00:27:54,310
We searched
the entire Xingshan Mountain!

307
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:57,110
We couldn't find her! The sun has set!

308
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,542
Madam Wu, what happened to Grandma Chen?

309
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,270
It's all my fault! I'm so ineloquent.

310
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,110
I didn't think twice before I spoke.

311
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:08,030
I told her that Grandma Lin was
taken away by an ambulance

312
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,300
and she didn't have much time left.
She can't withstand it.

313
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,110
Just look at you.

314
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,920
Zhuang Jie!

315
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:16,440
You guys should know better!
Hurry and go after your sister!

316
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,110
My good children!
Hurry and search for her!

317
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,680
Alright!

318
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,750
Grandma!

319
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,510
Grandma!

320
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,270
- Grandma Chen!
- Grandma!

321
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:32,830
- Grandma Chen!
- Grandma Chen!

322
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,720
Grandma Chen!

323
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,510
- Grandma Chen!
- Grandma Chen!

324
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,240
Hong Xu!

325
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,680
How is it?

326
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,400
I didn't see her!
She's not on the northern side.

327
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,830
Chen Maidong!

328
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:46,720
What are you doing here?

329
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,110
Why didn't you tell me about it?

330
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,670
You're physically impaired. You
can't do anything even if I tell you.

331
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,830
What were you thinking?

332
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,550
- Grandma Chen!
- Grandma Chen!

333
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,000
Alright. Don't panic.
I'm sure she'll be fine.

334
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,510
All of us are searching for her.

335
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,440
It's my fault.

336
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:08,514
Grandma always said
that she took this path countless times.

337
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,880
She told me not to call her,
that's why I didn't call.

338
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,750
Calm down. She'll definitely be fine.

339
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,310
I think Grandma
just couldn't accept reality.

340
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,270
I think she just wants
to cool down in a quiet spot.

341
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:22,371
I already searched
the places she frequented.

342
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,060
The bus terminal. I went to the hospital
Grandma Lin was in.

343
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,790
No one saw her.

344
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,400
If it doesn't work out,

345
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:29,685
we should call the cops.

346
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:38,171
Let's search for a little longer.
Grandma is a prideful person.

347
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:39,571
If it was just a false alarm

348
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,514
and she found out
that she caused trouble for us,

349
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,685
she'd definitely get angry.

350
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,170
Alright. If so, we should keep in touch.

351
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,400
Alright. Don't go too far.

352
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,000
Take them back
if you guys are exhausted.

353
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,428
Alright. Stop worrying about us.

354
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,240
Go now.

355
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,457
Let's go. Let's search over there.

356
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,240
Grandma Chen!

357
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,440
Dong, don't panic, okay?

358
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,920
Grandma Chen!

359
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,590
Let's go.

360
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,240
Grandma Chen!

361
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,830
Grandma!

362
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,200
Grandma!

363
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,070
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

364
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,400
Grandma Chen!

365
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,510
- Grandma Chen!
- Grandma!

366
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,750
Wait.

367
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,920
Did you guys hear something?

368
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,830
Is it our pet goose?

369
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,942
It does sound like it.

370
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,160
What's with the strange voice?

371
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,920
It has a terrible temper,
just like our mother.

372
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:26,114
That's what it does
when it's thirsty and hungry.

373
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,550
Alright, I'll go and check it out.

374
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,000
You two can check over there.
Call me if you find anything.

375
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,830
- Okay.
- Stay there.

376
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,680
- Alright.
- Got it.

377
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,920
Grandma Chen!

378
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Chen Maidong. I found Grandma.

379
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,000
She's under the bridge, westward.

380
00:31:29,142 --> 00:31:30,030
It's fine. Don't panic.

381
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,114
Take your time.
I'm keeping an eye on her.

382
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,942
Put this on
when you take your bath later.

383
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,550
Now, everyone
in the town will notice you.

384
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,485
Mom, you should stop reprimanding Jie.

385
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,680
She just got a scratch on her way back.

386
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,685
She'll be fine.

387
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,480
Besides, you should show some empathy.

388
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,550
Didn't you join us for the search too?

389
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:15,920
Zhuang Jie.

390
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,350
If you choose Chen Maidong,
you'll lead such a life in the future.

391
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,510
His grandmother will only age.

392
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,480
You'll have more
and more causes of concern.

393
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:27,960
You want to keep your career
and lead a peaceful life?

394
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:28,590
There's no way.

395
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,640
If you do encounter any troubles,

396
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,340
you'll have no other adults
to depend on.

397
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,550
No one will care for your child.

398
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,057
You have to do everything yourself.

399
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:38,240
I'll see how you can enjoy
your love life when it's like this.

400
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,440
Mom, didn't I tell you already?

401
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,171
I'll return to Shanghai after New Year.

402
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:45,020
You shouldn't be so optimistic about it
if you want to leave here.

403
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,060
You'll cause trouble.

404
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,640
This body of yours and his background
are burdensome enough.

405
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:51,430
Draw a line with him.

406
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,200
You guys shouldn't
delay each other's happiness.

407
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,350
Jie...

408
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm fine. You two should sleep early.

409
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:18,750
Here.

410
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,030
I already told you I was fine.

411
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
Why did you have to bring me here?

412
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,760
What's wrong with you?

413
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,360
This kind of building is warm.
A change of environment

414
00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:34,171
will provide you with a better mood too.

415
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,800
A better mood?

416
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,510
I'm annoyed by the elevator.
It's swaying all the time.

417
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:41,771
It's as if I'm descending to Hell
whenever I take it.

418
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,230
You don't like elevators, huh?

419
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:45,510
I guess you were just ragging

420
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,400
that you were heading to
Shanghai with me, huh?

421
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,670
I'm not going. I'm old now.

422
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,800
It's pointless no matter where I go.

423
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,590
I'm too lazy to even visit your unit.

424
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,150
You and Jie
are at the prime of your lives.

425
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,550
You guys may leave. Just come back
and visit me when you're free.

426
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,840
Let's drop the topic.
I'll go wherever you go.

427
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,070
Don't be silly.

428
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:41,590
No one can keep another person company
for the rest of their lives.

429
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,371
Grandma, why don't I apply
for leave tomorrow?

430
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:52,360
I'll take you to the provincial hospital
and visit Grandma Lin.

431
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,440
No need.

432
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:58,480
She won't allow it.

433
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,920
How would you know?

434
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,670
I reached
the train station this afternoon.

435
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,670
I came back because she told me off.

436
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,960
I've never seen her this angry
in this many years.

437
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:20,685
No one knows this better
than Grandma Lin.

438
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,030
When Grandpa was sick,
you almost couldn't take it

439
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:25,714
when you kept him company
in the hospital.

440
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:28,200
I'm sure she doesn't want you
to experience that again.

441
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,630
Although her life was saved
not long ago, she shouted at me.

442
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:36,485
I'm worried that
her ailment might act up again.

443
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,600
That's good too.
You should listen to her.

444
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,630
Who else can I listen to?

445
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,571
In the past,
I always depended on Grandma Lin

446
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,110
to make all of my decisions for me.

447
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,800
But now, she's abandoning me
all of a sudden.

448
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,110
I finally figured it out now.

449
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,190
You see, life is just a passing
of various destinations.

450
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,840
In the end, we have to enter our graves.

451
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,510
No one can avoid it.

452
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,828
We should live our lives to the fullest.

453
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,960
Grandma, you must live well.

454
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,880
Do it for my sake.

455
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,280
I already told you I was fine.
Why are you still so long-winded?

456
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,142
It's not like there's no cure
for Grandma Lin.

457
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,110
She should be hospitalized
and go for chemotherapy.

458
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,110
She's in a good state of mind.

459
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,670
Maybe she'll even live longer than me.

460
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,670
I'm sure you two can live a long life.

461
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,110
I didn't know that you
could say such nice words.

462
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,880
Enough already. Wash up and go to sleep.

463
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,030
Is Grandma asleep?

464
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,320
How's your leg?

465
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,960
It's just a scratch. Don't worry.

466
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,710
Do you truly think
Grandma has gotten over it?

467
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,190
She's brokenhearted. I can feel it.

468
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:44,150
I have to keep her company
more often lately.

469
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,670
You're her only kin now.

470
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,400
Even her buddy is no longer here.

471
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,280
She still has you.

472
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:57,314
Wasn't it troublesome?
You visited me so often.

473
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:02,630
I'll visit you even more in the future.
I'll visit Grandma every day.

474
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,920
Stop bragging.

475
00:39:05,628 --> 00:39:07,509
You'll stay here
at most for a few more months.

476
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,971
Forget about keeping Grandma company.

477
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,230
We didn't even
get to go on a decent date.

478
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:14,000
Let's go on a date, then.

479
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,590
I was waiting for you.

480
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,485
Let's catch a movie, then.

481
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,920
If not, our relationship would seem fake

482
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:28,571
when we think about it in the future.

483
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:49,020
(Sparkling New Year's Eve)

484
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,840
Stop running.
You're already late anyway.

485
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,685
My mother came back late today.

486
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,710
Something happened to factory.
Our dinner was delayed.

487
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,180
I didn't dare to leave early.

488
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,070
Look at us.

489
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,140
As if we're too young
to be dating each other?

490
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,960
Sorry about that. Let's go inside.

491
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,360
The movie aired 40 minutes ago.

492
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:21,685
Even if we go in now,
we won't be able to understand it.

493
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,800
Forget it, then.

494
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:25,630
I'm too tired to catch another one.

495
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,800
Why don't we
sit here for a while?

496
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,070
We can't stay out too late anyway.

497
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,190
You smell great.

498
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,000
Seems like you put on some perfume, huh?

499
00:40:54,428 --> 00:40:55,760
I wouldn't even have taken a bath

500
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,542
had I known
we were going to sit on the floor.

501
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,390
How dare you still laugh?

502
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,571
You don't take it seriously.
You smell like a hotpot.

503
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:03,140
Hotpot is the fastest dinner.

504
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,714
I'll be able to come outside
without whipping up something quick?

505
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,914
Besides, I don't know
how to cook anything else.

506
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,090
I know how to cook.

507
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,110
You should
spend more time with me.

508
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:12,457
I'll make sure you won't starve.

509
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,960
Dong, you're so cool.

510
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,150
Dong, you're cooler now.

511
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,057
You're really annoying, aren't you?

512
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,070
Dong, are you Doraemon?

513
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,440
Come.
Let me search your pockets.

514
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,371
- Let me see.
- Don't touch it!

515
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,840
Dong, are you even using lip balms now?

516
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,550
You're using the same brand as me?

517
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,360
What's with all the crap?

518
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,510
People go on dates
to talk crap, you know?

519
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,771
I wanted you to help me
put on some lip balm.

520
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,514
How could you take advantage of me?

521
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,800
Someone!

522
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,230
Chen Maidong is taking advantage
of a young girl!

523
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,000
Have you lost your mind?

524
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,920
Try and scream now.

525
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,140
I was just teasing you.
What's wrong?

526
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,314
Why do you look like
you have a guilty conscience?

527
00:42:14,457 --> 00:42:16,670
The townsfolk might not know you,
but all of them know me.

528
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,742
I'll be involved
in another strange rumor

529
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,342
once you leave after New Year, you know?

530
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,480
Got it.

531
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,320
Dong, I know you're a public figure.

532
00:42:25,714 --> 00:42:27,371
You're pretty flamboyant, aren't you?

533
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,830
Are you cold? Why don't I send you back?

534
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,230
No.

535
00:42:34,457 --> 00:42:36,800
We have to sit here
at least until the movie is over.

536
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,710
Alright.

537
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,400
Chen Maidong.

538
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,550
I was late today. It's my fault.

539
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:55,510
We should overcome all obstacles
during New Year's Eve

540
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,280
and go on a decent date.

541
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,030
Sure.

542
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,971
I want some popcorn.

543
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,142
Let me show you a trick.

544
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:19,920
Can you do it?

545
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,150
Again! Do it again!
