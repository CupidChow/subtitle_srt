1
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:07,310
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,310
I didn't know
that I arranged a blind date for myself.

3
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,400
I thought I was going
on a boat ride with Grandma.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,749
It's okay.

5
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,630
You know all about

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,110
my personal situation, right?

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,189
You are a nurse.

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,029
Your parents are pretty nice.

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,389
You are three years older than me.

10
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:22,430
Yes.

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,630
I graduated from
a formal nursing school.

12
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,119
I want to work in the city
after graduation.

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,070
The requirements of the hospitals
in the city are too high, so I came back.

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,030
Our town is not too shabby.

15
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:35,958
It depends on how you see it.

16
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,359
My best friend
has some connections through her family

17
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,478
and stayed in the city.

18
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,119
The bonuses and benefits
of city hospitals

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,278
are incomparable in this town.

20
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:43,119
They even have

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,198
an attached school.

22
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:44,679
In the future,

23
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,679
I won't have to worry

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,309
about my children's education.

25
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:49,399
Actually,

26
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,399
my friend

27
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,958
and I have similar academic performance.

28
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:54,030
Compared to her,
I even have more internship experience.

29
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,269
This town will get better and better.

30
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,079
That's the only thought I can count on.

31
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,359
I'm mainly worried

32
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,878
about the education and environment.

33
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,029
My children might be at a disadvantage.

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,790
Do you want a drink?

35
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,830
I don't drink soft drinks.

36
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,790
In fact, you should drink less.

37
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:30,279
The economy in our town

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,839
is really good, actually.

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,238
But I still hope

40
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,199
to return to the city in a few years.

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,469
The spiritual life in the city is rich.

42
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,238
On weekends, you can take the children

43
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,359
to the library, the opera house,

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,430
or the museum.

45
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,678
You can even drive.

46
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,029
Go camping on the grass
and gaze at the stars.

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,639
Only in that environment

48
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,949
can people feel happiness.

49
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,389
Am I right?

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,118
Madam Wu said
you're registered residence is in the city.

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,109
Yes.

52
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,878
What about your current job?

53
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,630
Do you plan to keep doing this?

54
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,589
What do you think of it?

55
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,998
Honestly,

56
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,718
my family and I feel

57
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,270
that it shouldn't be a long-term thing.

58
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,639
Since we are on a blind date,

59
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,599
marriage should be the end goal.

60
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,879
I'm a down-to-earth person.

61
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,359
I know a little bit

62
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,670
about your past.

63
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,789
Which aspect of it?

64
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,319
You loved to fight, divorced parents.

65
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,639
Also,

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,919
I heard that your grandma

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,230
has a bad temper.

68
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,550
You're right. You're worrying
about the right things.

69
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm mostly okay with it though.

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,390
But what do you think about me?

71
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,270
Great.

72
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,990
I think you are great too.

73
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,079
Appearance, height.

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,510
No problems.

75
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,718
Moreover, the prodigal son coming home
is more valuable than gold.

76
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,678
As long as you are

77
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,718
100% committed to me in the future.

78
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,950
I will definitely treat you well.

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,830
Chen Maidong.

80
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,159
Why do you seem

81
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,150
a little distracted?

82
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,830
Sorry.

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,799
Well,

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,079
I think we can disembark ahead.

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,349
Let's go there.

86
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,879
=Will Love In Spring=

87
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,759
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

88
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,750
=Episode 2=

89
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,998
I really like a girl
who likes to smile like you.

90
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,558
It just feels good looking at you.

91
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,318
Oh, right.

92
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,599
You've just mentioned it.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,310
What's your name again?

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,638
Grandma, my name is Zhuang Jie.

95
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,799
My mother is Liao Tao.

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,029
The one from Liaogen Chicken.

97
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,039
Oh, I love your chicken.

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,789
Hurry, add me on WeChat.

99
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,909
My name is Gu Beibei.

100
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,630
Your name is so nice.

101
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,870
Gu Beibei.

102
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,710
How did you know him?

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,750
We are high school classmates.

104
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,830
Why haven't I heard of it?

105
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,479
When I was in my senior year,

106
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,438
I went to stay with
my relatives in Shanghai.

107
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,799
I took the college entrance
examination and went to university there.

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,719
That's why

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,669
Chen Maidong doesn't have
a deep impression on me.

110
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,198
A college student.

111
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,510
Postgraduate.

112
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,989
I furthered my studies
after working for two years.

113
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,719
Amazing.

114
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,750
Grandma.

115
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,429
Didn't you just say you were sleepy?

116
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,799
Sleepy? Who is sleepy?

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,909
Go to sleep if you want to sleep.

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,238
That day,

119
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,279
I was just telling you
about my grandson.

120
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,669
I forgot to ask you.

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,318
Are you still Shaking for a date?

122
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,469
Did you get a match?

123
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,638
Grandma.

124
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,279
I'm not in a hurry to Shake it.

125
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,989
I want to focus on my career.

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,318
Aren't you the same age

127
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,078
as my grandson?

128
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,519
How can you not be anxious?

129
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,599
In my opinion,

130
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,078
you both were delayed by work.

131
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,878
Look.

132
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,989
My grandson.

133
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,039
A young man in his thirties.

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,678
An established civil servant.

135
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,870
Admired in town.

136
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,870
That's why.

137
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,479
On tonight's gratitude dinner,

138
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,390
they have to invite him
to sit on the C (center) position.

139
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,520
If he didn't come,
we wouldn't have started the banquet.

140
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,200
Grandma.

141
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,238
Grandma, you are so hip.

142
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,719
You also know about
the C (center) position?

143
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,799
Don't interrupt, you two.

144
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,510
Listen to what I have to say.

145
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,878
My grandson.

146
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,799
He has a great body.

147
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,789
He works out whenever he is free.

148
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,909
Many years have gone by
without him catching a cold.

149
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,479
Also,

150
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,438
the year before last,

151
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,719
he bought a house

152
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,878
with two rooms and a dining room.

153
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,109
It's at the eastern end of our town.

154
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,959
It's a classy property.

155
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,229
Very well decorated.

156
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,150
Zhuang Jie.

157
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,150
Your phone is ringing.

158
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,630
Is it?

159
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,390
I don't hear anything either.

160
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,270
I turned it silent.

161
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,870
Chen Maidong's eyes are sharp.

162
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,599
Grandma,

163
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,279
I have to do some deliveries.

164
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,480
We had so much fun just chatting
that I'd forgotten about it.

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,349
Let's chat on WeChat later. Okay?

166
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,678
Don't leave in such a hurry.

167
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,589
Have you two added each other on WeChat?

168
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,989
That's alright.

169
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,150
I wouldn't want to
delay your deliveries.

170
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,070
Goodbye grandma.

171
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,549
What a lovely girl.

172
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,390
She looks fair.

173
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:08,750
She has bright eyes and a good figure.

174
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,510
Most importantly, she is still single.

175
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,989
Peanuts?

176
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,750
You only know how to eat.

177
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,750
Sit down.

178
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,949
Chen Maidong's grandma is quite funny.

179
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,519
Forget about it.

180
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,999
The conversation was so awkward.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,279
That's not a common occurrence.

182
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,558
But his grandma

183
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,189
wasn't exactly bragging either.

184
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:44,879
An embalmer like Chen Maidong

185
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,069
is indeed an important figure in our town.

186
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:49,239
Before this,

187
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,318
he used to work
in a large funeral parlor in Beijing.

188
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:52,709
I heard that he is very experienced.

189
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,718
Wang Xixia.

190
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:54,999
Why do you know everything?

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,039
Isn't this nonsense?

192
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,759
Compared to you

193
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,639
I am considered

194
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,870
a native of Nanping.

195
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,598
Still, he couldn't find a partner.

196
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,919
His grandma was so worried

197
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,069
she wished we consummated
our marriage on the spot.

198
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,709
It's difficult for Chen Maidong
to find a partner

199
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:09,909
not just because of his career.

200
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,039
There are also rumors in town
that he was a bully when he was young.

201
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,669
And he was involved in somebody's death.

202
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:18,590
When he was young? When?

203
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,598
Senior year of high school.

204
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,239
The semester you transferred away.

205
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,270
Didn't he always get
into fights back then?

206
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,598
That time when somebody died.

207
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,159
Rumor has it he was fighting

208
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,709
with a group of gangsters.

209
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,270
What is he like now?

210
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,999
Does he still

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,709
smell like a little gangster?

212
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,718
He wasn't a gangster back then.

213
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,119
At most he was

214
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,390
unruly.

215
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,909
That's true.

216
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,039
It was probably just rumors.

217
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,399
If something really happened back then,

218
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,759
how could he still work

219
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,039
without complications in the town?

220
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,230
I think so too.

221
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,759
But let me tell you,

222
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,789
his grandma is also quite the character.

223
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,558
She was the coach
of the provincial ping pong team.

224
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,909
Exceptionally respected.

225
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,718
But after fighting with a colleague,

226
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,990
her career was hindered after
receiving a penalty.

227
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,279
I suspect Chen Maidong's violent tendencies

228
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,870
were inherited from his grandma.

229
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:06,510
With these rumors about his family,

230
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,709
it's not easy for Chen Maidong
to find a partner.

231
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,119
How would any proper townspeople

232
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,510
dare to marry him?

233
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,870
Do you really not remember Jie?

234
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,949
Can you stop snacking in your bed?

235
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,110
I'm asking you a question.
Don't interrupt me.

236
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,510
How did she look like back
in high school?

237
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,669
There should be many boys
chasing after her.

238
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,239
What is she working as now?

239
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,318
I've not met her

240
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:44,590
for more than ten years.

241
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,510
Do you think I would know?

242
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,519
Don't you have class reunions

243
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,990
every year?

244
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,909
Jie is so outstanding.

245
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,470
Won't you boys talk about her?

246
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,270
I won't anyway.

247
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,750
Speak properly.

248
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,189
Look at you.

249
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,789
Lacking in judgment regarding women.

250
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,590
You need me to look for you.

251
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,119
At least,

252
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,239
we know Jie's background.

253
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,999
Her age matches you as well.

254
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,909
Not shy in character.

255
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,838
Much better than that wench...

256
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,990
Grandma.

257
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,829
You should speak nicely too.

258
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,230
What? Can't I criticize her?

259
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,230
Then Song Yi is indeed a wench.

260
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,159
She looks harmless.

261
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,750
You were together for so many years.

262
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,549
Yet she still cheated on you.

263
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:27,429
You have a discerning eye.

264
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,470
Didn't you notice

265
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,189
Zhuang Jie wearing a prosthetic leg?

266
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,350
I knew you would show this expression.

267
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,759
When I was in high school,

268
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,270
Zhuang Jie and her father got into
a car accident.

269
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,990
Her father passed away.

270
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,870
Zhuang Jie's right leg below the knee

271
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,750
was amputated.

272
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,510
Why didn't you prepare all your stuff?

273
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,119
When the floor gets wet later,

274
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,358
you will be jumping out again.

275
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,829
If you fall down,
no one will care about you.

276
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,230
Thank you, mother.

277
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,029
Is it hurting again?

278
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,789
This is normal.

279
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:23,519
I'll massage it for you.

280
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,598
It's alright.

281
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,799
I just need to take a bath.

282
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,390
You just go to bed.

283
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,990
Chen Maidong.

284
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,119
I came back to my senses.

285
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,390
What do you mean?

286
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,709
What expression did I make?

287
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
What are you so anxious about?
Being angry is bad for your body.

288
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,270
Mark my words.

289
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,669
I have taken a liking to Jie.

290
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,390
I'm warning you.

291
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,279
No one has the right to discriminate
against people with disabilities.

292
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,189
I have never discriminated against her.

293
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,110
I just don't like her that way.

294
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,639
Why?

295
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,029
She is too noisy.
She is noisier than you.

296
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,718
You stinky brat!

297
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,750
Chen Maidong!

298
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,590
I'll teach you a lesson!

299
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,678
If Zhuang Jie

300
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,999
didn't have a disability,

301
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,870
she would have married much sooner.

302
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,949
Moreover,

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,318
she walks like the wind.

304
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,558
No one would be able to tell

305
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,519
that her leg has a problem.

306
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,519
If you continue to be this stubborn,
just stay single all your life.

307
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,718
Jie said it herself.

308
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,318
There are people who got their wife

309
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:55,519
just from WeChat Shake.

310
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,558
How about you?

311
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,358
As I see it,

312
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,519
you don't have the right to sleep.

313
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,239
You should hold your phone all the time

314
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,750
and keep shaking it!

315
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,159
What kind of rotten idea is this?

316
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,279
Shake?

317
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,709
How old-fashioned.

318
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,170
(Sincere invitation Li Tao &amp; Song Yi)

319
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,890
(Li Tao &amp; Song Yi)

320
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,669
Mother.

321
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,789
What's for breakfast?

322
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,069
You just know how to eat.

323
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,240
Look at your sister's grades.
It's about to fall through the Earth's core.

324
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,200
Can't you wake up a few minutes earlier
to tutor her?

325
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,958
Don't you personally check out
her homework?

326
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,639
Do you still need me?

327
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,350
Do I look like I understand the paper?

328
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,598
I can only intimidate her

329
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:27,870
for a moment.

330
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,478
Moreover, I can't keep an eye on her all day
and neglect my business.

331
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,678
You've made many arrangements
for me too. I'm very busy these days.

332
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,270
I'm always on the run.

333
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:35,519
Besides, I'm impatient.

334
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,990
I can't be a tutor.

335
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,678
Isn't Zhuang Yan's holiday starting
in a couple of days?

336
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,558
Get him to do it.
He is more reliable than me.

337
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,870
Zhuang Yan?

338
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,239
Reliable?

339
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,750
Nonsense.

340
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,198
Why are you badmouthing your children
whenever they aren't here?

341
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,280
He is the college entrance examination
top scorer in our town.

342
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,958
Why can't he
tutor an elementary school student?

343
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,029
You think just having good grades
is enough?

344
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,358
You need a normal brain to be a tutor.

345
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,350
Seriously, watch your mouth.

346
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,270
Zhuang Yan, you're back.

347
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,229
Yan.

348
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,598
Yan!

349
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,310
No. Hold on a moment.

350
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,390
This is Mr. He, He Zhangyue.

351
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,390
This is my mother, Liao Tao.

352
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,989
My elder sister, Zhuang Jie.

353
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,429
And my younger sister, He Niaoniao.

354
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:40,799
This is the new member of our family.

355
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,030
Jisan Goose.

356
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,509
Hello, Zhuang Yan.

357
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,158
Hello, Jisan Goose.

358
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:48,669
How cute.

359
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,350
Look at him.

360
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,398
Dressing himself

361
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:53,398
like a moth.

362
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:54,999
Jisan Goose my foot.

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,070
I really...

364
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:57,790
Take it easy.

365
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,598
At least within the first 24 hours.

366
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,989
Refrain from using cuss words.

367
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,390
Calm down.

368
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,918
I...

369
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,390
I'll check her homework.

370
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,318
Master.

371
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,118
Today is a national holiday.

372
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,279
Do public officials like us

373
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,870
have to take turns to be on duty too?

374
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,590
Repeat the case report.

375
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,509
An elderly woman whose head was crushed.

376
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:47,669
Multiple open comminuted fractures.

377
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,598
From the right side of the neck.

378
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,838
Through the lips, nose, and left eye

379
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,078
to the left forehead.

380
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,630
There is an irregular laceration.

381
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:01,630
The length...

382
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:06,558
The length should be...

383
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,679
The length is approximately
15 to 18 centimeters.

384
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,799
Accompanied by multiple

385
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,279
bone puncture injuries on the face.

386
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,269
After cleaning,

387
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,479
there are about 30 pieces
of bone fragments of various sizes

388
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,630
from the head.

389
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:17,550
Nearly one-third is concentrated
on the face.

390
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,310
Because of the face of the deceased
has little subcutaneous fat.

391
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,310
So the best solution to fix it is...

392
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,189
The mortise and tenon technique.

393
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:29,870
Reason?

394
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,790
The reason being...

395
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,310
She...

396
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,679
Mortise and tenon technique

397
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,479
is mainly used on the head and face.

398
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,630
To fix flat bones.

399
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,039
Implantating steel rods or wires

400
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,830
in the spongy bone within
the bone plate.

401
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,279
Glue the plates together.

402
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,999
To connect the broken bones.

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,199
This method can conceal the defect well.

404
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,669
It will form a smooth bone surface.

405
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,390
There will be no obvious dents
or protrusions.

406
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,189
When is it not applicable?

407
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,310
Not applicable when...

408
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,909
Not applicable when...

409
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,999
It's not suitable for inclined sections

410
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,110
that are less than 70 degrees
or greater than 120 degrees.

411
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,158
Bone recovery

412
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,878
is crucial for plastic surgery.

413
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:16,638
Yes.

414
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:17,799
It's also the objective basis

415
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,150
for the recovery of other tissues.

416
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,479
So I hope you

417
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,790
can be more focused.

418
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,078
Yes, Master.

419
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,429

421
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,310
I know you are not officially employed.

422
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,160
You are still taking the accounting
certificate exam in your free time.

423
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,999
Yet,

424
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,918
even if being an embalmer

425
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:35,959
is just a temporary job

426
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,269
before you become an accountant,

427
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,598
I hope that you can

428
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,269
put more passion into it.

429
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,679
Do we still need passion here?

430
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,479
Compared to you,

431
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,189
I should be lacking in composure instead.

433
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,279
Why are you still here today?

I'm finishing my last post.

436
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,118
I want to treat everyone to a meal.

437

Let's go together.

438
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:00,749
Sure.

439
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:02,519
You really have to pay respect
to a resignee.

to make.

What are you doing?

I shouted so hard for you,
my throat was smoking.

What took you so long?

457
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,550
I was giving an infusion to the sheep
in the backyard.

to pick it up?

don't I?

I dare you to say it again.

I came back this time

557
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,790
to talk to you.

558
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,949
Please respect my uniqueness.

559
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,709
This person you found

560
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,350
shouldn't be suitable for Dongzi, right?

561
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,558
Did you even look carefully

562
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,679
before telling me no?

563
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,398
There are matters

564
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,398
where everyone

565
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,279
would have an agreed opinion.

566
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,239
Don't you try to
discriminate against her.

567
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,519
I know.

568
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,638
You are well informed.

569
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:26,918
You may know the inside story,

570
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:28,719
but I've met this girl personally.

571
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,398
She is pretty and has a good character.

572
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,269
The rest aren't an issue.

573
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,719
Your mentality

574
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,749
really impressed me.

575
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,469
Actually,

576
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,918
I'm a little hesitant.

577
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,358
At the beginning,

578
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,598
I didn't want to accept it.

579
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,918
After thinking about it.

580
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:44,799
Screw it.

581
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,039
What times are we in now?

582
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,799
I can't block the fate
of these two children

583
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,310
just because of some small disability.

584
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,989
Can you give me back my freedom?

585
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,749
My hands

586
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,398
are made for painting.

587
00:27:57,399 --> 00:27:58,479
It should not learn computers

588
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,959
nor marinate chickens for our shop.

589
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,279
Only pure art

590
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,838
can soothe my mind.

591
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,719
On this point,

592
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,909
Jisan Goose

593
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,590
understands me better than you do.

594
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,999
Zhuang Yan.

595
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,310
His mind?

596
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,959
I think you have a mental illness!

597
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,878
Eat.

598
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:13,679
I'm going to marinate

599
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,838
this one that knows you so well!

600
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,830
I'll let you know that I am still your mother.

601
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,749
Yan!

602
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,310
Come and save the goose, Yan!

603
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,830
What was that for?

604
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:27,918
Old rules.

605
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,189
Look at the card and tell the story.

606
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,638
Tell me something nice.

607
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:31,398
The first one.

608
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:32,949
The sun is shining.

609
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,790
A little happy and sweet.

610
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,189
It's done.

611
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,630
Calm down.

612
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,239
Love is not a bed of roses.

613
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,959
The most important thing to Dong

614
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,358
is the determination

615
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,558
to establish an intimate relationship.

616
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,759
There is hope

617
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,638
but

618
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,709
the decision-making process
is very difficult

619
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,550
and painful.

620
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,638
That's normal.

621
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:56,638
Dong is no longer a child.

622
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:57,870
He can bear it.

623
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,790
Let's look at the second picture.

624
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,318
The man took a lamp.

625
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,279
There is a cane next to it.

626
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,598
Accurate, so accurate.

627
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,638
This shows that the girl

628
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,358
is lonely.

629
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,719
She is groping forward

630
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,749
in the darkness.

631
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,439
Her thoughts are heavy.

632
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,318
Even though she wants to steady her mind

633
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,318
with learning

634
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,918
and thinking.

635
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,799
But she can't do it.

636
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,398
Anyway, I think

637
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:24,479
this girl

638
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,030
is not a particularly happy person.

639
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,390
Yeah?

640
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,239
She didn't seem like that.

641
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,479
The third card.

642
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,638
This woman is very strange.

643
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,479
Her aura is also very domineering.

644
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,558
Between these two,

645
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,598
she might be...

646
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,030
A mistress?

647
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,669
Don't interrupt me.

648
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,719
This image

649
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,078
isn't that terrible.

650
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,158
I'm just saying.

651
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,638
She will cause a certain impact

652
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:51,469
between the two children.

653
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:51,999
Alright.

654
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,519
This woman is not important. Ignore her.

655
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,719
Just tell me.

656
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,759
Is Dong

657
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,799
fated to be

658
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,310
with this girl?

659
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,070
Well.

660
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,959
What should I say?

661
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,870
Just say it bluntly.

662
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,719
If you ask me if they are fated,

663
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,239
I don't think they are merely fated.

664
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,509
Perhaps,

665
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,509
they could even be star-crossed lovers.

666
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,390
Dong.

667
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,590
Hai.

668
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,590
Xilun.

669
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,078
From now on,

670
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,669
I guess there won't be any chance
to work with you guys again.

671
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,030
This will be our parting dinner.

672
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,949
But knowing you guys

673
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,630
has been an honor.

674
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,030
Cheers.

675
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,598
Sadly, even today

676
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,390
I can't even accompany you
to have a good drink.

677
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:46,039
It's okay, we understand.

678
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,310
During these four years working
in our unit,

679
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,110
I never touched a single drop of wine.

680
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,669
So if I drank too much today,

681
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,229
please forgive me.

682
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,790
Xilun.

683
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,439
Soon,

684
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,279
won't it be your turn

685
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,350
to host a parting dinner?

686
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,550
What are you saying?

687
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,759
I have recently been

688
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,358
working hard to hone my skills.

689
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,398
I never thought about

690
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,519
resigning from this job.

691
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,918
Unlike you, so anxious to get married.

692
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:10,999
Come on.

693
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,239
In this profession,

694
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,439
you can tell who hates their job

695
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,959
just by looking.

696
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,189
You

697
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,558
don't smell like us.

698
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,439
Hey, you are the deserter.

699
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,759
You have the nerve to talk about me?

700
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,350
Hai, what do you think?

701
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,429
Why don't I smell like you guys?

702
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,989
What kind of smell is it?

703
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,429
Indeed, you don't have the character
of an undertaker.

704
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,790
You're right.

705
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:33,429
You are bullying the newcomer.

706
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,078
In the morning,

707
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,398
Master also said that I have no passion.

708
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:38,719
But I don't understand.

709
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,550
What are you basing this on?

710
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,390
Then let me tell you about Hai.

711
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,959
Brother Hai has driven
for the funeral house for more than 20 years.

712
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,558
Moving and changing.

713
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,509
He is responsible for all these things.

714
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,039
In China, male remains

715
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,878
weigh 75 kilograms on average.

716
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,709
Females, 65 kilograms.

717
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:56,878
To complete a set of proper procedure,

718
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:59,158
a body has to be moved at least five times.

719
00:31:59,159 --> 00:31:59,878
This excludes

720
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:00,959
other added services.

721
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,269
Just look at the statistics,

722
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,358
Hai's physical output

723
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,078
is no less than

724
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,509
that of a professional athlete.

725
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,479
So, do you think Hai

726
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,679
has a passion

727
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,949
for this profession?

728
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,030
Here.

729
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,709
I'll toast you.

730
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,909
Cheers, Hai.

731
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:24,749
Zhuang Yan.

732
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:31,350
I went around the town twice
looking for you.

733
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,078
Dinner is ready.

734
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:34,918
Go home and eat.

735
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,959
No. I want to listen for a while longer.

736
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,479
No, I mean.

737
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,949
I want to eat some more.

738
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,078
Master, do you know them?

739
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,398
Let's share a table.
It's more fun that way.

740
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,429
I don't know her well.

741
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,909
Whatever.

742
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:54,949
Your alcohol tolerance has increased.

743
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,229
You drank a lot.

744
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,279
Is Jisan drinking with you?

745
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,759
Talking about passion,

746
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,590
Chen Maidong is the best.

747
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,358
Everyone is the same.
Stop talking about me.

748
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,638
Did you know

749
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:06,239
many people found their motivation

750
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,110
to do this job from watching you?

751
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,558
Feng Xilun.

752
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,398
You don't know what a good teacher

753
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,118
you've found.

754
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,679
Last year, there was this special remains
handled by Brother Dong.

755
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,959
At least five times.

756
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,838
Every session

757
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,239
lasted more than 15 hours.

758
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,999
He was also going to other places

759
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,799
to help deal with the tougher ones.

760
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,239
The whole system of bone reconstruction
techniques in our province

761
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,909
was brought in by Dong.

762
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,078
Without him,

763
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,239
those who died in accidents

764
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,669
won't be able to leave this world
in a dignified manner.

765
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,590
If he did not have passion or love,

766
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,350
why is he doing this?

767
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,909
Drink less.

768
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,390
Drink less.

769
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,469
I really don't understand.

770
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,799
Why does a woman after 25

771
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,030
have to hurriedly fall in love
and get married?

772
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,229
And why does she have to give up

773
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:55,790
a job she likes for her marriage?

774
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,709
No one may believe me if I say it.

775
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,429
I really have feelings for
the funeral profession.

776
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,838
Every body

777
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,558
I used to take care of

778
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,959
is like my friends.

779
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,189
I can even imagine

780
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:09,838
their lives.

781
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,398
I could clearly see

782
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,559
how they spent

783
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,229
their last days.

784
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,990
- Here.
- Don't be too sad, Zhang Xin.

785
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,869
It's time to go home.

786
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,709
Keep these experiences in mind.

787
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,119
You don't have to expect

788
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,789
everyone else to understand it.

789
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,550
Physical decay

790
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,630
is only another truth of death.

791
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,998
Through sight and smell,

792
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:40,709
it reminds us of how fragile
our flesh is.

793
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:42,318
There are Buddhist monks

794
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:43,559
who observe bodies

795
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,878
to stay alert to life.

796
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,070
How do they observe it?

797
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,639
In each stage of decomposition,

798
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,030
the body will appear differently.

799
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,318
Distension.

800
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:53,389
Rupture.

801
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,518
Exudation of blood.

802
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,318
Putrefaction.

803
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:56,470
Discoloration.

804
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:08,038
The monks use this method

805
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,239
to achieve permanent suppression

806
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,709
of their own desires.

807
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:18,349
I have to work the night shift.

808
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,749
I'm leaving.

809
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:25,030
Enjoy your meal.
