=Will Love In Spring=

2
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,980
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

3
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,860
=Episode 15=

4
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,120
Look at this, Lin. What a feast.

5
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,710
Although you won't
be able to taste them,

6
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,230
you can see them.

7
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,840
Today, I'll live-stream
the meal for you.

8
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,400
And you will watch me eat.

9
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,640
The shredded squid is my favorite.

10
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,590
Why don't you save me some?

11
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,080
How do I save it for you?

12
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,280
When you're discharged,

13
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,510
I'll tell Dong to buy you
a kilogram of fresh shredded squid.

14
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,120
I knew it. I can never steal your food.

15
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,750
What an old glutton.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,520
Now you know what I'm like.

17
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,870
Here.

18
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,280
It's Grandma Lin.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,470
Grandma Lin!

20
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,750
Happy New Year!

21
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,400
Happy New Year to you too, Dong.

22
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,280
Dong. I passed your grandma
the New Year's money.

23
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,080
Don't forget to get it from her.

24
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,560
Otherwise, she might keep it to herself.

25
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,240
Sure. I'll get it from her.

26
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,430
So... You go on. I'm heading out.

27
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,080
Sure. Go ahead.

28
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,080
Bye!

29
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,280
Lin.

30
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,750
I saw some jokes written
by some old people online.

31
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,000
I was amused by that nonsense.

32
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,470
You finally found yourself
some good friends while I'm gone.

33
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,742
Let me read them out for you.

34
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,910
There was an old lady.

35
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,310
She said that she
wanted to fall in love again,

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,190
but she was attracted to older men.

37
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,150
Eventually, she realized
that she couldn't find anyone like that.

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,710
Also, the doctor
who wouldn't stop telling me

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,280
to take care of my health passed away.

40
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,470
Meanwhile, I'm still alive.

41
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,080
I'm living longer than I should.

42
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,030
Also, this is really funny.

43
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,750
What else? I can't read my own writing.

44
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,470
Mealtime!

45
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,750
Dad and Mr. He don't drink alcohol.

46
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:29,200
He's been alone for a long time
and he must be feeling lonely.

47
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:31,000
We will just prepare some wine for them.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,142
They don't have to drink it,

49
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,314
but if they want to, the wine should
be ready. Otherwise, it'll be our fault.

50
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
Uncle.

51
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Dad.

52
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,800
Don't be shy.

53
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:59,285
Just show up in my dream
if you have any requests.

54
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,190
Fine. Quit fooling around.

55
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,310
Let's eat. Quick.

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,920
Zhuang Yan. It's mealtime.

57
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,870
Here.

58
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,680
Let's dig in.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,510
Let's dig in.

60
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,040
Give it a taste.

61
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,950
We agreed to drink together.

62
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,560
Why are you drinking on your own?

63
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,430
Here.

64
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,720
Let me propose a toast
for the festive season.

65
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,190
Here.

66
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,510
Happy New Year!

67
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,180
Happy New Year!

68
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,040
Cheers!

69
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,430
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,310
Cheers!

71
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,657
Our first New Year's Day
without He Zhangyue.

72
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,270
I feel sorry for the clock.
Stop staring at it.

73
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,685
Do you have plans this evening?

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's nothing important.

75
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,914
My friends and I are going
to a countdown party.

76
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,870
Why?

77
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,057
The new year won't arrive
if you do the countdown at home, huh?

78
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,310
If you don't mind, I can
invite my friends over too.

79
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,828
It's the New Year's Eve.

80
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:41,400
It's normal to spend it with friends.

81
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,870
Some of my classmates
are organizing an online event.

82
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,800
Yes. My classmates too!

83
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:47,390
They invited me to the square with them

84
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,840
for the fireworks and the countdown.

85
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:50,285
Are all your classmates orphans?

86
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,142
Do they not have a family?

87
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,800
It's the New Year. Why don't they
spend it with their families?

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,171
Why are they loitering around?

89
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,950
Our family never had this rule before.

90
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,857
And that was
when Mr. He was still alive.

91
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,000
Nonsense.

92
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,390
Mom. If you're annoyed at me,
just come at me.

93
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,240
Don't ruin their mood.

94
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,750
When Mr. He was still alive,

95
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,180
he didn't like a family quarrel.

96
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,230
Stop talking about Mr. He.

97
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,750
You started it.

98
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,720
Enough, He Niaoniao! Take it away!

99
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,040
No one needs a vacuum
that's worth thousands of dollars!

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,800
Mom.

101
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,190
Can we spend the
festive season in harmony?

102
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,510
That's up to you!

103
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:52,350
It's the first New Year's Day
without Mr. He,

104
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,000
but you want to go out,
neglecting your younger siblings.

105
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,942
You call yourself
their elder sister, huh?

106
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,560
Do you know what time it is now?

107
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,800
Decent women
don't hang out at this hour.

108
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,270
You're not making any sense.

109
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:05,514
Why are you so demeaning
to your own daughter?

110
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,710
Every time you are upset,
you don't think before you speak.

111
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,360
You can ask them.

112
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,380
Which one of us hasn't been hurt
by your words before?

113
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,720
It's been a long time like this.

114
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,070
Are you done yet?

115
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,742
Get out of here
if you find it so tiring!

116
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,800
I know all of you look down on me.

117
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,390
You think I am uneducated and crude.

118
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,830
But in case you forgot,

119
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,390
I am the one who brought you up!

120
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,480
Ask yourself. Isn't that a tough job?

121
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,430
Because of your leg,

122
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,990
I have never said anything harsh
to you since you were little.

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,620
The house.
Zhuang Yan has a 120-ping unit,

124
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,680
so I got you a 140-ping one.

125
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,950
I didn't want you to feel bad

126
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:42,550
and I was worried about you
because your age is catching up on you.

127
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,190
I get it now.
I brought this upon myself.

128
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,550
You can ask any mothers out there.

129
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,910
Which one isn't worried when
their daughters go out late at night?

130
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,150
I know you very well.
The countdown is merely an excuse.

131
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,120
Have a little wine and fun.
Women always end up as the victims.

132
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,440
Mom. I'm approaching my 30s.

133
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,270
I know it if anyone
wants to take advantage of me.

134
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,150
Just because of my severed leg,

135
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:14,910
it's never easy for me
to be in a relationship.

136
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,200
Even if I want to seek pleasure,

137
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,910
do I bother anyone?

138
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,600
If we have to talk about this,

139
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,480
I should be grateful

140
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,510
if anyone wants to take advantage of me.

141
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,790
Jie.

142
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,000
Jie.

143
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:10,960
Jie.

144
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:12,960
Jie.

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,960
Don't get mad at Mom.

146
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,870
You are not exactly the reason
why she's feeling bad.

147
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,771
Something happened
in the factory two days ago.

148
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,270
A new guy almost got his hand
trapped in the machine.

149
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,750
They can't resume their operation
until next week.

150
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

151
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,320
Mom told me not to.

152
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,150
Actually, I think it's not merely
about the workplace accident.

153
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,240
Mom must be missing Mr. He again.

154
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,360
Jie.

155
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,840
This time,

156
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,085
I can tell
that Mom is getting older.

157
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,270
That day, I saw her
enjoying the sun in the yard

158
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,400
and it only took her a while
to doze off.

159
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:51,800
She's acting a little like our grandma.

160
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,440
When Mr. He was still around,
I never let her win any arguments.

161
00:10:58,514 --> 00:11:01,057
Sometimes, I deliberately found faults
in the things she did.

162
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,270
I thought
she was domineering and a bully.

163
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,320
But I've been thinking about this.

164
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,510
Take my artwork for example.

165
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,270
Mom has no idea
what those artworks are about.

166
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,150
So how could she totally
agree with my decision?

167
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,510
Her education level and her experience

168
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,320
can't help her understand
my dream to be an artist.

169
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,390
Mom will never be like us.

170
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,085
I understand what you're trying to say.

171
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,200
I was just throwing a fit.

172
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,600
Go back and comfort her.

173
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,670
Jie. Don't worry.

174
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,790
One day, she'll understand
your relationship with Dong.

175
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,960
I don't even understand
our relationship, let alone her.

176
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,480
Jie.

177
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,870
Being misunderstood is a part of life.

178
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,200
You will get hurt if you
insist on seeking others' approval.

179
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,840
I know. I'm fine.

180
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,480
You're all grown up.

181
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,660
(Bottomless drinks.
Sparkling New Year's Eve. Neon Party)

182
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,030
Let's drink.

183
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,390
I don't drink.

184
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:04,720
Try something else.

185
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,360
This one.

186
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,000
Come on.

187
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,200
15. 20. No!

188
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,240
15. 20!

189
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,840
15!

190
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,720
You make me cringe.

191
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,440
I can't stand this.

192
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,630
I mean it.

193
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,670
Happy New Year!

194
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,320
Happy New Year!

195
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,840
Slow down.
No one's going to snatch it from you.

196
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,080
I got it for you.

197
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,550
Let's go.

198
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,542
Are you wearing perfume?

199
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,360
Yes.

200
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,320
It's the New Year's Day.

201
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,830
I'll leave
a good impression on you

202
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,750
so that you'll never forget me.

203
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,550
Watch your words.
Don't ruin the atmosphere.

204
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,480
You're right!

205
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,910
Festivals are an excuse
for us to celebrate.

206
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,030
You're right. Live in the moment, right?

207
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,790
Chen Maidong. You're not
someone like that, right?

208
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,720
Like what?

209
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,342
Someone who lives in the moment.

210
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:25,342
I live in the moment when I'm with you.

211
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,600
You're just like my mom.

212
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,390
Deep down, you think I'm an easy woman.

213
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,440
You're trying to start a fight, right?

214
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:38,780
There's nothing you can do.

215
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,910
You've chosen me, so let's
put up with each other

216
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,828
and be a couple everyone hates.

217
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,840
Watch your words.

218
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,710
What are you doing?
Do you want the lipgloss?

219
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,857
I don't have it with me today.

220
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,120
Kiss me.

221
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,360
Quit fooling around. We're in public.

222
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,371
We're the couple everyone hates.
There's nothing to fear.

223
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,314
Did you forget that
I'm a public figure again?

224
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,085
Stop fooling around.

225
00:15:05,285 --> 00:15:06,400
What's the matter?

226
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,750
Wait. Is it you?

227
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,200
Did you do it on purpose?

228
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,320
Do you want to fight?

229
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,120
What's the matter?

230
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,120
He touched me.

231
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,670
Apologize to her.

232
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,960
I overheard your conversation,

233
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,720
so I tried to get closer
and accidentally touched you.

234
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Don't take it personally.

235
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,720
It's a countdown party. Let's have fun.

236
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,960
I told you to apologize to her.

237
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,120
No way.

238
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,150
Hey!

239
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,200
Let's talk it out.

240
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,057
Don't get violent.

241
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:45,057
Get out of my way!

242
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:46,120
It's none of your business.

243
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,840
What are you doing?

244
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,080
I don't get it. Why did you stop me?

245
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,750
They got kicked out of the venue.

246
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,030
They deserved it.

247
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:00,480
You were so impulsive just now.

248
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,371
I almost thought
that you were there to fight.

249
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,320
What do you mean?

250
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,200
Should I have allowed him
to take advantage of me?

251
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,480
I'm with you.

252
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,914
If the fight happens, you should
stay away and call the police.

253
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,830
But instead, you went ahead
and joined the fight.

254
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,342
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

255
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,720
You are the lousy one.

256
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,840
Me? You say
that I'm terrible at fighting?

257
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:19,714
I know what you're thinking.

258
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,971
You think I ruined the evening
and you're very upset, right?

259
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,110
No one will ruin a party
like him during a festive season.

260
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,550
That's why I said
we shouldn't let them go.

261
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:30,342
Why are you acting so strange today?
What happened?

262
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,400
Do you think we're
incompatible with each other?

263
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,630
Why is it that none
of our dates went well?

264
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,000
Forget it. Let's go home.

265
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,550
Don't waste your time
being angry at those losers.

266
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,714
Before you go home,
let's do the countdown first.

267
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:53,600
Where should we do the countdown?

268
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,960
My grandma is on a video call.
We can't go to my place.

269
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,120
Let's go to my place, then.
We'll fight it out with my mom.

270
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,480
Does your mom hate me so much?

271
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,600
Do you think you're cute?

272
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,080
Maybe...

273
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
We can sit in front of the cinema.

274
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,390
You deserve something better.

275
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,030
Let's go. We'll go to my new house.

276
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,030
New house?

277
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,110
Forget it?

278
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:25,085
My grandma flaunted it in front of you.

279
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:27,680
I bought a new place. They wrapped up
the renovation. Let's go.

280
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,640
Do I look like the kind of woman

281
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
who goes home with any guy?

282
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,350
You do.

283
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,542
I was kidding, Zhuang Jie.

284
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,600
That was just a joke.
You look nothing like that.

285
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,400
Zhuang Jie!

286
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,342
You look nothing like that. Look at you.

287
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,160
Taxi!

288
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,400
Let's go.

289
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,550
You shouldn't show me your passcode.

290
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,000
I have memorized it.

291
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,510
I want you to remember it.

292
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:28,240
No need to take off your shoes.
Come on in.

293
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Chen Maidong.

294
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,920
You have a pretty good taste.

295
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,590
Perhaps the people who live in this town

296
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,342
have better taste than you think.

297
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
No one has lived here before, right?

298
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,310
My grandma stayed here once.

299
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:49,800
She doesn't like the elevator,
so she refuses to come here again.

300
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,720
She is just being thoughtful.

301
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,400
Obviously, you'll stay here
with your future wife.

302
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,600
No one else wants to be here.

303
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:57,571
How do you know what my plan is?

304
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,240
Isn't that
what everyone in this town does?

305
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,971
Hire a matchmaker, go on a blind date,
get married, and have children.

306
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,960
You're no exception.

307
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,480
Don't bring up
the matchmaker ever again.

308
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,142
I was traumatized by the experience.

309
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,200
Look at you!

310
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,680
Chen Maidong.

311
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,590
What is this?

312
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,720
What?

313
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,680
What is this?

314
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,920
Put it back. You're being rude.

315
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,100
How could you do that?

316
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,790
Why not? That's me.

317
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,720
Give it back.

318
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,790
I'm asking you. Is it me?

319
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,270
Is it?

320
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,640
Is it me? Tell me!

321
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,400
Yes, it is.

322
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,542
What's the matter?

323
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,310
When did you get this?

324
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:21,771
I can't remember.

325
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:27,620
When I was in high school.

326
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,680
Really?

327
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,510
Why are you so surprised?

328
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:34,485
I've always been more loyal than you.

329
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,830
Tell me

330
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,270
what happened.

331
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,510
Is it because of me?

332
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,510
You have to tell me
if something happened.

333
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,160
You won't be able to help.
You're already tired enough.

334
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,960
I can cope.

335
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,790
Chen Maidong.

336
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,110
Have you ever brought
anyone else here before?

337
00:21:29,228 --> 00:21:30,630
Do you want to start another fight?

338
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,510
Have you?

339
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,400
No.

340
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:34,714
What's wrong with you tonight?

341
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,720
So I'm the only one.

342
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,880
Because of your leg,

343
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,971
I've never said anything harsh to you
since you were little.

344
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,400
No reaction?

345
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,657
I'm curious about
what you're going to do.

346
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,200
Nonsense.

347
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,000
We're both adults.
What are you expecting?

348
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,310
Zhuang Jie.

349
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,480
Are you drunk?

350
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,310
Your body is a burden.

351
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,200
No.

352
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm just a frivolous person.

353
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,070
I didn't know you well,
and I have apologized for it.

354
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,750
If you pick Chen Maidong,

355
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
this is what your future
is going to be like.

356
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,160
Lin, isn't it pretty?
You can't see it there.

357
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,640
This year, our town organized
a countdown party.

358
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,750
If you could tolerate the crowd,

359
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,342
I would've brought you there.

360
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,960
Give me a minute.

361
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,657
They'll definitely play more fireworks.

362
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,310
Isn't it pretty?

363
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,110
Zhuang Jie.
Let me take off your prosthesis.

364
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,880
Just because of my severed leg,

365
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,914
it's never easy for me
to be in a relationship.

366
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,160
Even if I want to seek pleasure,

367
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
do I bother anyone?

368
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,830
What's the matter?

369
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,110
What's wrong?

370
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,550
What's wrong?

371
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,070
Zhuang Jie, what's the matter?

372
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,270
Why did you force me?

373
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,160
What did you say?

374
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,960
Repeat it. What did you say?

375
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,680
I'm regretting this.

376
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,440
I don't want to do it anymore.

377
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,440
Get on the bike.

378
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,350
I'll send you home.

379
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,160
Enough. I'll hit the sack.

380
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,030
I won't stay up with you anymore.

381
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,310
We can't sleep
before it turns 12 A.M. Please.

382
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,440
Let's do what those young people do.

383
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,920
We should follow the trend.

384
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,110
Let's finish the countdown first.

385
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,680
Face the reality.

386
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,790
Do you still think of me
as a healthy person?

387
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,510
Many say that it's difficult
to live through the year,

388
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:32,070
but we have survived
many years together, right?

389
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,640
I'm terminally ill now.

390
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,240
Silly.

391
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,550
You're not ill. You can read fortunes.

392
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,030
You'll definitely be able
to live through the year.

393
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,160
Let us just hang in there.

394
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,550
Come on.

395
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,440
No one else believes in fortune-telling

396
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
after they reach their 70s.

397
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,790
I only did that to cheer you up.

398
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,160
You have grandchildren,
so you have to do it every day.

399
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,640
In fact, you're not trying
to read his future,

400
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,270
but your own.

401
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:18,480
We can do a countdown
even if it's not on New Year's Eve.

402
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,510
The countdown started
the moment we were born.

403
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,110
Our age is catching up to us

404
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,830
and we're getting closer to our end.

405
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,057
We have to accept the fact.

406
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,510
Whether we have a big family

407
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,750
or are on our own,

408
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,200
in the end, we're all alone.

409
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,000
Isn't it?

410
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,085
I've been thinking about it,
but to no avail.

411
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:14,160
Are we different because of our genders

412
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,800
or it's simply because we are different?

413
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,720
If I have offended you, sorry.

414
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,880
But you were right.

415
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,790
I can't live in the moment.

416
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:33,830
Perhaps, you have
overestimated yourself too.

417
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,550
Anyway, this is quite ridiculous.

418
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:47,742
As the ancient said,
an illicit relationship is unacceptable.

419
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,310
Indeed. It's really frail.

420
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,920
Zhuang Jie.

421
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,160
I'm new to this
and I'm no match for you.

422
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,920
So...

423
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,657
Let's forget about it.

424
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,790
Ten.

425
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,750
Nine.

426
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,960
Eight.

427
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,070
Seven.

428
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,440
Six.

429
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,640
Five.

430
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,960
Four.

431
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,270
Three.

432
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,440
Two.

433
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,750
One.

434
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,070
(I'll sleep with you tonight.)

435
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,350
(But can you do me a favor?)

436
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,510
(Stop arguing with Mom, all right?)

437
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,510
(I don't want to see you cry.)

438
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:10,142
(I don't want to see Mom cry either.)

439
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,550
(When you both cry,)

440
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,750
(I feel terribly sad.)

441
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,200
(As if I'm being cut by a knife.)

442
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,400
(I had the same feeling when Dad left.)

443
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,750
(In fact, I know everything,)

444
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,790
(but I pretend that I don't.)

445
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,030
(My classmates and my teacher
take pity on me,)

446
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,070
(but I don't want them to pity me.)

447
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,350
(I want to appear cheerful)

448
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,110
(just like how I was
when Dad was still alive.)

449
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,920
(Previously,)

450
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,160
(my teacher made us read an article,)

451
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,114
(called "My Memories of Old Beijing".)

452
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,720
(When it read)

453
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,550
("Papa's flowers have fallen,)

454
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,030
(and I was no longer a child",)

455
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,480
(I was close to tears,)

456
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,714
(but I managed to hold them back.)

457
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,110
(I think my childhood ended)

458
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,510
(when Ying-tzu's ended.)

459
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,590
(Then, I thought about my mom,)

460
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,350
(my sister, and my brother.)

461
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,942
(And that cheered me up a little.)

462
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,640
(Jie.)

463
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,750
(I hope that
neither you nor Mom will cry.)

464
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,880
(We still have each other.)

465
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,240
Is the store open today?

466
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,880
It's New Year's Day.
You should take a day off.

467
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,070
I'll go to Chengdu to buy the marinade
for you tomorrow.

468
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,640
Good idea.

469
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,070
There's a seminar tomorrow.

470
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,680
Salt.

471
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:37,942
I have to keep an eye on them.

472
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,510
I know someone from Wushan.
He's a food supplier.

473
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,270
He's been asking me to visit him.

474
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,200
I'll pay him a visit and see
if we can buy anything from him.

475
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,670
Tell Niaoniao and Zhuang Yan
to sell before the Chinese New Year.

476
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,070
They can earn some pocket money.

477
00:33:51,314 --> 00:33:53,310
They can learn a thing or two.

478
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,920
Don't need to rush home. Enjoy the trip.

479
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,350
Wake up for breakfast!

480
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,790
Look at you.

481
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,742
It's the first day
and you're lazing around.

482
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,657
Breakfast's ready!

483
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,660
(Lijin)

484
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:13,460
(Chengdu)

485
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,500
(Guaranteed quality)

486
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,590
Mr. Zhang.

487
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:26,170
Can you send out this batch
of goods first thing tomorrow?

488
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,000
My mom needs them.

489
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,320
In the future,
please keep up with the quality.

490
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,428
Don't make any mistakes.

491
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,230
Don't worry.

492
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,380
We will do our best
for an important client like you.

493
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,110
Don't worry.

494
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,960
All right.

495
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,840
Hey.

496
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,760
Zhuang Jie, are you home yet?

497
00:34:44,257 --> 00:34:46,220
Why do you keep asking me
the same question?

498
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,620
You caught the cold for a long time.

499
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,840
Why are you still in Chengdu?

500
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,190
Stop nagging me. I'll go home tonight.

501
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,880
I realized that you'd been
faking it all along.

502
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,090
When you're sick, you have no idea
to take care of yourself.

503
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,230
Zhuang Jie, I'm warning you.

504
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,100
If you're not at home
the next time I call,

505
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,085
I'll end our friendship.

506
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,800
Do you hear me? I've got to go.

507
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,550
What are you doing?

508
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,480
Do you think this is a basketball hoop?

509
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,710
I didn't hit you.

510
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,280
Of course, you didn't.
It'd be a big deal if you hit me.

511
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,320
Stop right there.
Did you sort the garbage?

512
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,710
Are you the old lady
from the neighborhood committee?

513
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,070
I'm a citizen.

514
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,590
It's a citizen's duty
to sort their garbage.

515
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,760
Madwoman.

516
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,150
Wait.

517
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:30,314
Did you call me a madwoman?
Stop right there.

518
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,710
Sort the trash or I'll report it
to the committee.

519
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,840
Stop filming me.

520
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,920
Do you hear me?

521
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:36,400
What are you doing?

522
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,150
Delete it now!

523
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:38,550
What are you doing?

524
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,510
What are you doing?

525
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,800
And who are you?

526
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:45,485
Just think of me as a member
of the neighborhood committee.

527
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,800
Sir.

528
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,760
Listen to me.

529
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,030
If you're in the wrong, don't argue.

530
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:52,360
You'll only embarrass yourself.

531
00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:52,971
You...

532
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,190
Why are there so many mad people today?

533
00:35:59,230 --> 00:35:59,920
Huh?

534
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,230
Thank you.

535
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,190
That guy...

536
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,360
I apologize on his behalf.
Don't stay mad.

537
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,942
How can you apologize on his behalf?

538
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,400
Do you represent all men?

539
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,150
You're mocking me again.

540
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,480
I don't want you to
suffer from Qi stagnation.

541
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,030
You're exaggerating it. Forget it.

542
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,110
What brings you here?

543
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,070
Didn't you order 50 transdermal patches?

544
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,190
I'm delivering it to you.

545
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,440
I wanted to just leave them
at your doorstep,

546
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,760
but I ran into you here.

547
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,960
You're delivering it yourself again?

548
00:36:50,857 --> 00:36:51,914
Didn't I say it before?

549
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,110
I want to serve you myself.

550
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,840
Then...

551
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,320
I'll pay you.

552
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,542
Don't worry about the money.

553
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,110
I brought you a gift.

554
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,230
Didn't you say
that you didn't like vegetables?

555
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,070
You'll definitely like this.

556
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,550
It's rich in collagen.

557
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,760
It tastes good too.

558
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,714
I'll put it here for you.

559
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,485
There are four of them. Enjoy the food.

560
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,771
It'll be more than enough.

561
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,960
Here.

562
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,070
Wait...

563
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,550
I can't read your expression again.

564
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,440
It's nothing. I'll take this.

565
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,230
Thank you.

566
00:37:34,914 --> 00:37:36,314
It's not the right gift again, huh?

567
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,760
To express my gratitude,

568
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,630
why don't you come over
for a cup of tea?

569
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,110
Thank you.

570
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,800
Why are you being so shy?

571
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,440
Are you attracted
to my unkempt appearance?

572
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,510
It's not your appearance
that attracts me.

573
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,000
You sound like a hypocrite.

574
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
Dr. Cui,

575
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,840
you don't care about one's appearance?

576
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,440
I'm used to reading the room.

577
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,320
Look.

578
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,840
These supplements show

579
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,320
that you want
to give yourself a good look

580
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,400
and a fair complexion.

581
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,590
I understand.

582
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,030
Fair skin makes an ugly woman pretty.

583
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,550
Watch your words.

584
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,960
I don't want to end it again.

585
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,800
What I'm trying to say is
that your complexion

586
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,360
is determined by your Qi and blood.

587
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,230
If you want a good complexion,

588
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,590
you need to take it slowly
and be patient.

589
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,030
You are a very disciplined woman.

590
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,760
You persevere and never give up.

591
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,150
Those are the things
that make you beautiful.

592
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,510
You're a pretty good doctor.

593
00:39:31,714 --> 00:39:32,714
Thanks for your advice.

594
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,514
You shouldn't doubt my professionalism

595
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,480
because I once embarrassed myself
in front of you.

596
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,230
You're right.

597
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,800
Sorry.

598
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
I have to answer the call.

599
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,030
Where are you now?

600
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,760
I listened to you
and I'm on a train home.

601
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,880
You're sick and you need a good rest.

602
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,320
Stop wandering around.

603
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,840
What bothers me now
isn't my physical health,

604
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,400
but my emotions.

605
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,920
I knew something was wrong.

606
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,880
What's the matter?
Is it about Chen Maidong?

607
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,400
All in all, this is really annoying.

608
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,400
Now I know why Plato advocated

609
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,670
an affectionate relationship
without any sexual desires.

610
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,150
Just cut to the chase.

611
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,590
On New Year's Eve,
I went on a date with Chen Maidong.

612
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,070
You brought this upon yourself,
Zhuang Jie.

613
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,440
Hey.

614
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,230
Wang Xixia.

615
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,880
Are you really my friend?

616
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,190
Why are you scolding me
when I've told you the truth?

617
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:53,800
I'm scolding you, huh? This is nothing.

618
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,800
If I were Chen Maidong,
I'd have beaten you up.

619
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,840
Of course, a man should never hit women.

620
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,510
Chen Maidong is a decent guy.

621
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,440
Look at you.

622
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,150
How could you do that, Zhuang Jie?

623
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,030
Apparently, this is consensual
between mature adults,

624
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,479
but you bailed out at the last minute.

625
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:07,760
I...

626
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,057
Stop explaining. Let me finish.

627
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,000
This is too much.

628
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,800
Whatever you did is against

629
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,760
the principle of gender quality.

630
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,440
Moreover,

631
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,480
it sounds to me that you were the one

632
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,150
who seduced him.

633
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,400
When he was in the mood,

634
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,760
you said that he forced you into it.

635
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,590
Do you know how terrible
those words sounded

636
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,630
to Chen Maidong?

637
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,028
Have you ever thought about it?

638
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,000
I wasn't thinking straight at that time,

639
00:41:30,857 --> 00:41:32,710
so I just said
whatever that came to mind.

640
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,430
Before that, I teased him and said

641
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,400
that he fought a lot
when we were in school.

642
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,360
Apparently, he took it to heart.

643
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,190
Of course.

644
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
A rumor in town says that

645
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,371
he used to be a gangster
when he was still a kid.

646
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,070
He could ignore what the outsiders say,

647
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,480
but he trusted you a lot.

648
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,110
He must have been deeply affected

649
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,710
and upset hearing it from you.

650
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,180
It's another matter if you can
spend your future together.

651
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,480
But now, as a decent person,

652
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,320
you have to apologize to him.
Did you hear me?

653
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:00,510
Besides, from now on,
stop talking about Plato.

654
00:42:00,571 --> 00:42:02,030
A sexual relationship is not inferior

655
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,590
to a spiritual relationship.

656
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,110
Besides, we are all humans.

657
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,060
You're not an immortal.

658
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:06,840
Understood.

659
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,590
Why are you so fierce?

660
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,514
Do you think this is a speech
and you have an audience?

661
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,700
I called you
because I wanted to confide in you.

662
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,885
You've made me more upset.

663
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,760
Enough.

664
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,085
Hurry up and apologize to him.

665
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,590
I'm disappointed in you.

666
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,030
When you're in Shanghai,
you act like a feminist.

667
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,190
You reveal yourself
when you're at home.

668
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,190
Hey.

669
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,670
Hey.

670
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,230
Hey.

671
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,550
You...

672
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,150
How dare you hang up on me?

673
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,150
Dang it.

674
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,400
She always makes me worried.

675
00:42:36,285 --> 00:42:38,310
What? Have you never seen
a quarreling woman before?

676
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,480
You're scolding her.

677
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,628
Are you scared now?

678
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,914
It's not too late to leave.

679
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,630
It's too late.
I've fallen deeper for you.

680
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,550
You...

681
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,030
You just can't stop
expressing your affection, huh?

682
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,685
I failed to hold it back.

683
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,960
What are you doing here?

684
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,630
This...

685
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,150
Did you fix it right?

686
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
I've placed it...

687
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,880
I'm really a doctor.

688
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,510
You can leave now, Dr. Cui.

689
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,840
Don't worry. I will see myself out.

690
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,630
I'm not seeing you out.

691
00:43:25,885 --> 00:43:27,870
Come down with me
and we can have supper together.

692
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,314
I'm hungry from the scolding.

693
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,280
Sure. What are we eating? My treat.

694
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,510
Consider this our first date.
Don't screw it up.

695
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,360
