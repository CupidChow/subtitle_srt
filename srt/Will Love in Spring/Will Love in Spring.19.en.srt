1
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,085
Are you the person in charge
of the funeral parlor?

2
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:42,920
Not really.

3
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,200
I'm just the embalmer.

4
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,640
Tell me, then.

5
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,240
How much would you charge
to cremate one leg?

6
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,679
That is a unique question.

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,719
You haven't been around much, then.

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,359
I don't pride myself on such things.

9
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,799
But if you want to
hear a practical answer,

10
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:06,040
you should be sincere as well.

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,079
At least tell me
some specific information.

12
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,680
I avoided a funeral parlor here

13
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:15,280
because I didn't want my family to know.

14
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:16,857
It's troublesome.

15
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,640
So you don't have to ask me so much.

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,719
Just tell me.

17
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,640
Does it cost more to cremate

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,159
one leg or an entire body?

19
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,640
I'll compare the prices.

20
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,159
Sorry,

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,120
but are you going
to undergo an amputation?

22
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,239
Yes. Bone cancer.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,959
I either cut it off or die.

24
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,480
Your mental state seems stable.

25
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,359
Everyone says so.

26
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,200
They say I'm still young
and am doing well financially.

27
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,159
As long as I can stay alive,

28
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,085
losing a leg won't impact me too much.

29
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,959
They're not right.

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,040
It will definitely impact you.

31
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,914
I know a young lady
who had an amputation.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,159
It took her a few years

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
to get her life back on track.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,280
Even so, she's doing very well now.

35
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:10,000
She has a successful career
and is lively and energetic.

36
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,479
Losing a leg hasn't affected

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,828
her optimism or pleasant nature.

38
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,000
That has nothing to do with me.

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,719
Just tell me the price.

40
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,919
You've been talking about
money since just now.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Maybe money is very important to you,

42
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,680
but I'll get straight to the point.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,719
I don't think money

44
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,080
can determine someone's value.

45
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm already at this stage of my life.

46
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,171
There's no point
in saying such vague things.

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,960
I know it all too well.

48
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:39,470
There's no point asking you.

49
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,228
I've thought it through.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,710
If all else fails,
I'll find an empty bridge

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,840
and jump off it to end everything.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
I will no longer cause anyone trouble.

53
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,719
You're wrong again.

54
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,639
If you really want to jump off a bridge,

55
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:59,942
you'd be causing trouble for
the public service workers.

56
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,960
The bridge you choose is as important.

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,240
For example, the Nanping Bridge
in my hometown.

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,120
If a body is washed upstream,

59
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,371
Ningfu Town would have to deal with it.

60
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,159
If it is washed downstream,

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,114
Ji'an Town would need to deal with it.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,080
If it happens to be in the midstream,

63
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:16,470
both towns would have to meet
and argue about it.

64
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:18,314
That'd be very troublesome.

65
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,840
You're pretty amusing.

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,159
Very few people say that about me.

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,840
I know you're having a tough time.

68
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,280
I can't say I understand how you feel.

69
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,639
But I want to tell you

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,190
that everyone has times
when they're tired of life.

71
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,639
The reasons may vary

72
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,560
but the pain is the same.

73
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,439
Including you?

74
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,120
Including me.

75
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,479
You're bluffing.

76
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,919
You look perfectly fine.

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Faced with death,

78
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,479
everyone is the same.

79
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,280
Some family members

80
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,759
want to use special coffins,
unique urns,

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,000
or expensive headstones
to prove the deceased was special.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,639
However, these are all just illusions.

83
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:16,630
When it comes to death,

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,439
everyone is the same.

85
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,399
We can only prove
how special we are by living well.

86
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,079
Just like the disabled lady

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,400
I mentioned.

88
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,279
Do you like this lady?

89
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,960
=Will Love In Spring=

90
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,620
(Adapted from the original work
"Lover" by She Mu Si)

91
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,540
=Episode 19=

92
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,480
For the next ten years,
import substitution

93
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,990
will be the priority pursued
by China's medical device industry.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,160
Right now, our difficulty is the

95
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,857
lack of synergy between the upstream
and downstream of our supply chain.

96
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,240
So, we need to come together
to build a single team

97
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:29,190
of medicine, supplies,
and engineering services

98
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,920
that can complement each other.

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,040
All right, take a rest.

100
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:35,240
I've been listening to that
for the past two days.

101
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,959
What are you doing?

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,085
Has the United Nations
invited you to deliver a speech?

103
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,000
To me, this opportunity is as important
as a United Nations speech.

104
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,040
Do you remember when I mentioned

105
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
my previous boss, Miss Huang?

106
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,759
She was interested in the
business plan Wang Xixia and I created.

107
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,480
She will invest a lot of money
to help us take off.

108
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,800
Have you discussed this with Maidong?

109
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,000
We can't talk about this over the phone.

110
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,319
When he returns and his mood is better,

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,514
I'll tell him everything honestly.

112
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,720
Why are you staring at me?

113
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,319
A mother knows her daughter.

114
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,480
Tell him honestly?

115
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,028
Are you planning to keep this from him?

116
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,600
How can I hide this from him?

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But I have to find a way

118
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,879
to talk to him about this.

119
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,319
Who was the one bragging to me?

120
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,990
If we have feelings for each other,
we should be together and enjoy life,

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,670
I'll still return to Shanghai after...

122
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,160
All right!

123
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,519
I knew I did say that.

124
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,657
But could you stop teasing me?

125
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,839
Did I do that?

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,360
Seriously...

127
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,828
I was thrilled to see both of you
getting serious in your relationship.

128
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:48,142
The more serious it is,
the more difficult it gets.

129
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:51,057
We're in our honeymoon phase
and it's a long-distance relationship.

130
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,000
I think he might
not be willing to do that.

131
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,879
Is it just up to him?

132
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:57,800
What is he going to do?
Break up with me?

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,628
The both of you aren't married yet.

134
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,319
You can't force him.

135
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,439
I won't let him go.

136
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,240
At most, I'll find some allies
to help me secretly.

137
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,439
Good luck.

138
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,360
The last time

139
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,800
Dong had conjunctivitis

140
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,839
was when his parents got a divorce.

141
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,457
He didn't tell me about that.

142
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,040
Just pretend you don't know.

143
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,839
He must have cried a lot recently.

144
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:27,028
We're here to see flowers,
let's not talk about this.

145
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,079
Have you read this poem?

146
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,279
Pick the flowers
while they are blooming.

147
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,720
Soon, nothing will be left
save bare boughs and tears.

148
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,399
You won't be able to witness

149
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,559
spring in our town every year.

150
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,279
Take a look and treasure it.

151
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,519
Grandma,

152
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,519
I know what you're trying to say.

153
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,600
You're so smart.

154
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,240
I won't say more.

155
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,919
Otherwise,

156
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,039
you youngsters may dislike it.

157
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:58,960
What do you mean?

158
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,360
You're so smart and pretty,

159
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,519
how could I dislike you?

160
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,879
If not for you,

161
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,000
Chen Maidong and I

162
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,600
wouldn't even be together.

163
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,799
But Grandma,

164
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,960
I also want you to understand
the situation I'm in.

165
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,879
I can't give up on my life in Shanghai.

166
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,840
I have a career and friends there.

167
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,000
Of course.

168
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,120
Times have changed.

169
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,200
It's understandable for women

170
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,559
to build a career.

171
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,639
I knew you were the most understanding.

172
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,240
Thank you so much for saying that.

173
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,200
But Grandma, don't worry.

174
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,440
I will be good to Chen Maidong.

175
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,720
Although I haven't thought
of a perfect plan,

176
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,840
I believe that I will.

177
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,559
I believe you.

178
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,080
But you have to tell me the truth.

179
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,279
Are you and Maidong just dating casually

180
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,399
or have you considered marriage?

181
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,720
Previously, I didn't
put much thought into it.

182
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:02,630
I felt that if we like each other,
we should be together.

183
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,720
We can be friends even if we break up.

184
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,559
But Grandma,

185
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,159
I'm now very sure

186
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,279
that I need him to be in my life.

187
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,399
I'm very thankful to hear you say that.

188
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,679
Well, Jie, I want to tell you this
from the bottom of my heart.

189
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,879
I think once you meet the right person,

190
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,440
you should get married.

191
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,399
I'm not old-fashioned.

192
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,080
And I'm not urging you to have children.

193
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,320
I just think

194
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,279
if a man and a woman

195
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,960
just want to have fun,

196
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:48,960
they may spend time or move in together.

197
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,230
There's nothing troublesome.

198
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
When you separate,
it will be less troublesome.

199
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,200
But such a relationship
that leaves no trace

200
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,320
won't help one to grow.

201
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,080
Although working in a marriage

202
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,559
or having a divorce

203
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,679
comes with a huge price,

204
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,440
and it will even leave behind

205
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,840
some unhappy experiences,

206
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,480
this in itself is meaningful.

207
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,559
In one's life,

208
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,559
one should seriously get hurt
and suffer losses.

209
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,542
That way, you get to live
a fulfilling life.

210
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,120
When I was young,
I got into conflicts often

211
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,440
with others because of my temperament.

212
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,240
In the past, I hoped
I could forget it all.

213
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,200
But after the passing of Grandma Lin,

214
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,720
I've been living vicariously
through memories.

215
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,200
Not only do I miss her,

216
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,639
but I also think of all the friends

217
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
who have hurt me or been hurt by me.

218
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:51,485
Jie,

219
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,759
life is full of ups and downs.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,679
Grandma, you're the best.

221
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,399
I knew you would be my ally.

222
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,879
No matter when,

223
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,080
girls will help girls.

224
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,759
Grow... Girl...

225
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,600
What?

226
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,799
Girls mean us.

227
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,720
Girls...

228
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,039
Great...

229
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,480
Girls are great!

230
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,759
Yes!

231
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,559
Great!

232
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,879
Good.

233
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,159
Didn't I tell you so?

234
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,399
Nothing is good or bad.

235
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,380
But everything should be in moderation.

236
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,399
Looking at your tongue,

237
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,799
your liver and stomach

238
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,480
are quite balanced.

239
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,879
Drink less concentrated alcohol
and you will be fine.

240
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Stick out your tongue.
Let me take another look.

241
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,000
Mom.

242
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,320
Why are you getting a consultation?

243
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,360
It costs a lot to see Dr. Cui.

244
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,519
No, no. What do you mean?

245
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,799
I'm back in Nanping
to open a free clinic.

246
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,799
He's been waiting for you!

247
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,279
If I didn't do this,

248
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,679
what

249
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,480
would I say to him?

250
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,200
Dr. Cui, go in and have a chat.

251
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,440
I'll cut some fruit for you.

252
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,440
Thank you.

253
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,759
Not at all, please go in.

254
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,320
Here, sit.

255
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:24,879
Thank you.

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,480
Sit.

257
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,039
Thank you.

258
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,679
Not at all.

259
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,399
Cui Ge, you came all of a sudden

260
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,240
and Xixia didn't even tell me.

261
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,519
I didn't tell Xixia.

262
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,480
Was I too hasty?

263
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,399
Not at all.

264
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,885
That's not what I mean.

265
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,159
Don't worry.

266
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,080
Your mother is very healthy.

267
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,559
If I didn't check on her,

268
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,100
we wouldn't have anything to talk about.

269
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,159
Well, Cui Ge, is there something
I can do for you?

270
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,980
(Xi)

271
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,240
Wait...

272
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,960
You want me to help you
with the proposal?

273
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,840
I want you to take a look at this

274
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,799
and tell me if Xixia will like it.

275
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,324
(Xi)

276
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,480
Xi...

277
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,440
I...

278
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,600
I dare not make such a decision
on her behalf.

279
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,519
If it's clothes or shoes,

280
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,639
I might be able to help.

281
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,440
As for a ring, you should ask her.

282
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,360
Actually,

283
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,360
I've asked some vague questions

284
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,240
about her preferences before I got this.

285
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,120
Then...

286
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,360
That's great.

287
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,559
Then, you don't have to check with me.

288
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,279
But I'm not sure
if she wants to get married.

289
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,120
Xixia probably started imagining

290
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,240
her wedding when she was six.

291
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,480
Talking about it is one thing,

292
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,399
but getting married is another.

293
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,960
I've been wondering

294
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,559
why independent women

295
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,519
like both of you

296
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,559
would need to get married.

297
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,320
Men take up space and are messy.

298
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,399
Besides, this is my second marriage.

299
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,399
Am I indispensable?

300
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,480
What can I give her?

301
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,440
Cui Ge, not many men

302
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,759
share your thoughts.

303
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
It's exactly because Xixia and I

304
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,200
are modern women that we
are used to being misunderstood.

305
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,320
Actually, we aren't against marriage

306
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,039
or think that it's better
not to have kids.

307
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,960
The key is meeting the right person
at the right time.

308
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
Since we have already turned 30,

309
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,540
all the more reason
we should live the lives we want

310
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,640
and be responsible for our decisions.

311
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,720
So don't worry about
marriage or kids for us.

312
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:12,960
I got it.

313
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,720
Thank you.

314
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,200
Zhuang Jie, don't worry.

315
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,119
I'll treat Xixia well.

316
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,400
I know.

317
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,140
(I miss you)

318
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,480
Are you crazy?

319
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,880
I've been sleeping.

320
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,799
I didn't see my phone.

321
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:53,920
I miss you too.

322
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,240

I want to ask you something too.

364
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,457
Would you accept
a long-distance relationship?

365
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,720
Honestly?

Of course.

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,200
If we were married,

368
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:03,270
then there'd be no choice
but to overcome it.

369
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,960
But if I still had a choice,

370
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:07,960
I wouldn't want to.

371
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,079
Why?

372
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:12,839
Because

373
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,359
I'm no longer a young lad.

374
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,319
I'm very aware that time and distance

375
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:19,114
will surely take a toll
on a relationship.

376
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,428
I wouldn't want to take the risk.

377
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,880
Let's be realistic.

378
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,160
What I need is someone who eats with me

379
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,440
and sleeps by my side
rather than communicating

380
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,559
through WeChat or phone calls.

381
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,640
To a mature man, it doesn't mean much.

382
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,559
(Today,)

383
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,799
(Health and Healing Channel)

384
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,680
(will narrate a prose
written by Mr. Wang Zengqi.)

385
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,400
(When anyone mentions him,)

386
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,799
(they'll always say)

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,759
(he's China's last
pure literary scholar.)

388
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,519
(He ever came up)

389
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,720
(with this famous quote.)

390
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,714
(It goes like this:)

391
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,160
(Love is non-professional.)

392
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:11,079
(It has nothing to do
with one's talent or capability.)

393
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,519
(It grows like flowers and trees.)

394
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,279
(Like our love and attachment)

395
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,559
(to time and seasons.)

396
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,240
(So,)

397
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,920
(when we find frustrations)

398
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,839
(and contradictions in life...)

399
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,640
(Contradictory.)

400
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,480
(Among the people of Chu,
a man sold shields and lances.)

401
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,799
(He praised them and said,)

402
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,799
("My shields are so firm,
there is nothing that can pierce them.")

403
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,079
(He also said...)

404
00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:45,750
If you continue playing with your toes,

405
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,400
someone will come to beat you up.

406
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:50,342
It's been so long but you
haven't memorized a single word.

407
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,020
What will you do
when Zhuang Yan tests you?

408
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,319
Jie, just worry about yourself.

409
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,559
Leave me be.

410
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:56,630
I'm already depressed listening to this.

411
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,680
You're depressed?

412
00:23:57,857 --> 00:23:58,960
We're more depressed than you.

413
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:00,942
Do you want to repeat a year
in elementary school?

414
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,160
To me, this fable is a piece of cake.

415
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:07,000
Come on, keep on bragging.
Recite one for me.

416
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,759
Why should I?
There's just one word to summarize this.

417
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,680
Contradictory.

418
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,314
I don't need to know
about the people of Chu.

419
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,839
Just look at you.

420
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,559
In what way am I contradictory?

421
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,119
Last night, you called
someone in Shanghai

422
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,600
and were on the phone for two hours.

423
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,885
Then, you had a video call
with Xixia for half an hour.

424
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,400
You said you don't know
how to tell Dong.

425
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,480
In the morning,

426
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,990
you asked Yan to help you check for
tickets to return to Shanghai.

427
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,920
Now, you're putting on makeup

428
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,759
to go on a date with Dong.

429
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,480
Aren't you being contradictory?

430
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,400
Your grades are so horrible,

431
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,160
but you have time to spy on me.

432
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,680
I've also learned this idiom.

433
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,000
Flying off the handle.

434
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:59,839
Jie. You'll find peace in honesty,
it's never too late to change!

435
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,599
Chen Maidong,

436
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,440
I will never break up with you.

437
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,279
I... I'm going back to Shanghai...

438
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,440
I can't say that.

439
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,720
Chen Maidong, I...

440
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,519
I didn't tell you
because you've been in a bad mood,

441
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,240
so I didn't dare...

442
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,519
What am I talking about?

443
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,319
Why am I saying this
right off the bat?

444
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,079
Chen Maidong,

445
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,799
it's different this time.

446
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,279
It's a different...

447
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:31,371
How long are you going
to linger down there?

448
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Should I take a nap?

449
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,620
♪Midnight plagued with memories♪

450
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,740
♪The past is brought out by the moon♪

451
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,940
♪The room, surrounded by longings♪

452
00:25:56,574 --> 00:26:01,460
♪Can't withdraw myself
from the alluring illusions♪

453
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,500
♪A chance encounter♪

454
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:14,220
♪Destined to fall for you♪

455
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,340
♪As the meteor passes by♪

456
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,940
♪You became my wish♪

457
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,039
What?

458
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:31,485
Are we having a meeting?

459
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,559
Let's have a serious chat.

460
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,799
Behave for a while!

461
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,200
Have some self-control.

462
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,799
It's a bit late

463
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:54,799
to say so.

464
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,240
Here.

465
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,039
What's on your mind?

466
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,599
Nothing.

467
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,680
Then, is there anything you want to say?

468
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,720
I don't know where to start.

469
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,039
Chen Maidong.

470
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,799
I can be your best friend.

471
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,799
You already are.

472
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,680
Then tell me what I can do

473
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,599
to make you feel better.

474
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,359
Actually,

475
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Grandma Lin left the world peacefully.

476
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,880
I also know that death

477
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:27,800
might have been a good thing for her.

478
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,319
I comfort others every day

479
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,160
so I understand that.

480
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,519
To me,

481
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240
there are two kinds of goodbyes.

482
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,880
Separating in life
and losing someone to death.

483
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,079
The last thing

484
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,000
Grandma Lin said to me

485
00:28:53,885 --> 00:28:55,514
was for me to live a good life with you.

486
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,920
The last thing I said to her was,

487
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,000
"Grandma Lin,

488
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,880
I'll go pack my stuff first.

489
00:29:11,514 --> 00:29:13,742
I'll be right back
to hear what else you have to say."

490
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
But when I turned around,

491
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,960
she was already gone.

492
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,559
I ever thought

493
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,359
that the most difficult thing
in the world was death.

494
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,640
So when you told me

495
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,559
I was a great person,

496
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,359
I neither agreed

497
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:00,640
nor denied it.

498
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,920
But when a separation turned into

499
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,559
an eternal loss in a matter of minutes,

500
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,079
I suddenly realized

501
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,680
that a separation

502
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,400
might even be scarier.

503
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,240
So, Zhuang Jie,

504
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:38,314
I don't want to play tough anymore.

505
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,119
Now,

506
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,000
I don't want you

507
00:30:46,171 --> 00:30:48,428
to disappear from my life in any manner.

508
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,839
Chen Maidong, me too.

509
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,480
I won't allow you to disappear
from my life in any manner.

510
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,200
Did you know?

511
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,559
When I was in Shanghai,

512
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,640
I met many outstanding men
who fit those worldly standards.

513
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,319
They all knew how to complete
tasks perfectly for others,

514
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,640
how to be gentlemanly and caring,

515
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,880
amusing and witty.

516
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,559
But I've never been attracted to them.

517
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,480
I used to think there was

518
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,519
something wrong with me

519
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:30,485
because I couldn't find a boyfriend.

520
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,880
It was not until your reappearance

521
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,400
that I realized I wasn't interested

522
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,640
in the lions and tigers in the zoo.

523
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,200
I only have my eyes

524
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,319
on a lone wolf like you.

525
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,799
You never need to pretend

526
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,279
to be strong with me.

527
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,119
Although

528
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,519
I've not experienced
as much death as you,

529
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,200
I know the kind of separation

530
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,440
you talked about

531
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,680
is very hard to overcome.

532
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,759
You're already doing well.

533
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,240
In the future,

534
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,640
you don't have to be so great.

535
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,119
I'll be right by your side.

536
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,319
Get some sleep.

537
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,000
Do you like that lady?

538
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,880
More than that.

539
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,119
I love her.

540
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,359
As long as I think of her,

541
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:55,942
no matter how difficult things are,

542
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,720
I'll have some hope.

543
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,720
She's pretty lucky.

544
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,599
I'm the lucky one.

545
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,159
What I want to say is,

546
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,559
whether or not you have this leg,

547
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,000
you are the hope
of your family and loved ones.

548
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,679
Don't leave them so easily

549
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,360
