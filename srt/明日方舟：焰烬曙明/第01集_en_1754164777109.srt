1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Sherlock Holmes

2
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,920
About 32 hours after that, she wasyi

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
spikes a collision along the Czerno-Borg border with Lomen.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,920
The city of that movement is now under the control of the Reunion.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Nevertheless, it continues to send out messages that it is the Ulusas region.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,920
If we stop the collision by force, it will be a matter of course.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,920
Heate will be attacked by the Ulusas from the far east.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,920
We have arrived at the target area, the comprehensive infection biome.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
We will end the guidance.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,920
You are the Doctor?

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Yes, it seems that you are the one.

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,920
I can feel it. It's a little strange.

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Who is this person? A friend?

14
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,920
She is a soldier.

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,920
Is she your enemy? It seems that she hurt you.

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,920
No, it's not.

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Doctor, you look like you lost something important.

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,920
But the connection is very thin.

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,920
I'm sorry. Don't be angry with me.

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
I'm not angry.

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,920
I have nothing to do with it. I have no right to touch her.

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,920
You want to use this facility, don't you? I'll help you.

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,920
I've been doing it many times and I'm used to it.

24
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
The infected people of Rhodes will all come here at the end.

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Well... how to operate...

26
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
This way.

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,920
It's okay. Even if you forget, you'll get used to it as soon as you read it.

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,920
It's a feeling that you can send out.

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,920
A feeling that I can send out?

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,920
You untie the thread that connects people.

31
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,920
The thread remains here.

32
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,920
It's been left in the case all the time.

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,920
So I can understand that person's presence there and that person's absence.

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,920
That feeling.

35
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Put her on here.

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,920
One of the untied threads remains connected to itself.

37
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Even if the other person is gone, the thread will not fall and disappear.

38
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,920
But I feel like something has disappeared from my body.

39
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Why do you try to get used to that feeling?

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,920
If you get used to it, you can endure the pain of losing it all of a sudden.

41
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Elite Operator Rosmo Tissima.

42
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Update the code of the order.

43
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Update the code of the order.

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Wait. I'll write down the current data.

45
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,920
If you release the operation experience to me, I will send you the information at the end.

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,920
No! I have to write this down myself.

47
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Understood.

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
You're an elite operator, aren't you?

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Ah, Rosmo Tissima. My name.

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Right?

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Yes.

52
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,920
May I ask your name?

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Frost Nova.

54
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Frost Nova.

55
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
What a beautiful name.

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Nice to meet you, Frost Nova.

57
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Goodbye.

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
The End

59
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,920
It's a dream come true that Reunion is giving Ursaus a new day.

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,920
The Ursaus Empire was born by the desire to make progress.

61
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Rearaba waged war without hesitation.

62
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Even if the enemy is this land itself.

63
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,920
But if it becomes a collision with the Empire, it will be a great war.

64
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,920
The war that has been decided to be defeated without the damage of the current unstable Ursaus.

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
There is no way to start it.

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,920
The Chernobog will be dealt with here in the Ursaus Empire, on the basis of the meeting with the Vitech.

67
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,920
You mean you trust Ursaus?

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,920
We have a little bit of a mutual understanding.

69
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Fumizuki, send a message to the Vitech.

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Before that, I have something to ask you.

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Sorry, but please wait.

72
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Right now, I'm with the Vitech for a while.

73
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Chairman, if you hear this message, please call me immediately.

74
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
This voice. My transporter.

75
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,920
The Third and Fourth Corps have taken a boycott.

76
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,920
The internal forces have been formed in Ursaus, and there is no movement to collect the Chernobog's land.

77
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
The Empire's parliament, the Vitech, has been in a battle of war.

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Currently, we are under attack, and we cannot move.

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Please respond immediately!

80
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Who is he?

81
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,920
His whereabouts and whereabouts are unknown.

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I see.

83
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,920
As far as I know, the Vitech seems to be just guarding the body.

84
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,920
The Ursaus's maintenance mechanism may be in a state of malfunction.

85
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,920
No, if the Ursaus army increases its power, it should be easy to suppress the Reunion.

86
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,920
However, more than a week has passed since the Chernobog was elected.

87
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,920
The official statement from the Ursaus government has not yet been issued.

88
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I will be honest with you.

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
There will be no movement to collect the body.

90
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Ursaus went ahead and handed over the Chernobog to the Reunion.

91
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,920
The current Chernobog is full of oryx.

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,920
If it is interrupted, the infection will spread rapidly in the area.

93
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,920
If that happens, it will be impossible to control us without our own help.

94
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,920
We can no longer solve it alone.

95
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
We must be prepared for battle with the people of Rhodes.

96
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,920
The area will immediately be prepared for battle, and the Chernobog will be definitely neutralized.

97
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Mr. Wei!

98
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Are you going to start it yourself?

99
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,920
That's the only way.

100
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,920
The pipeline with me and the Vitech was the last defense line that maintained the peace of the two countries.

101
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
If that happens, I will take care of everything.

102
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Wait, Mr. Wei!

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
We must not start a war from here!

104
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
That is the aim of the Ursaus.

105
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,920
No matter what the truth is, the enemy will be eliminated from the surrounding countries and the fear of isolation will be there.

106
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Let's think about it again.

107
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I understand you, Kelshi.

108
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,920
But for us, the other side is more serious.

109
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
I will go.

110
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
I will do something.

111
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Jin!

112
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
It's the same.

113
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,920
You are a man of the Romen.

114
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
I should be the one to leave the Romen.

115
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
I will do it.

116
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,920
If you need a traitor in the Romen, I will be the one to do it.

117
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,920
What are you talking about?

118
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
You are a fool.

119
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Since you started to attack the Slums, I am no longer a human being in this town.

120
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,920
You seem to be very close to the Slum residents.

121
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Why did you make such a terrible attack?

122
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
What did they do?

123
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Oh, right. They did nothing.

124
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,920
The invasion of the Reunion and the ambush.

125
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,920
They didn't try to tell us anything.

126
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
There is a possibility that they were threatened.

127
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,920
We should have been the first to report to the Slums and figure out the situation.

128
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,920
They were the ones who refused to report to the Reunion.

129
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,920
They refused to report to the Reunion and took the Reunion's hand.

130
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Until now, me and Rin Grey have been helping them and eliminating the criminals who saved the Slums.

131
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
We have been protecting their lives.

132
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Tell me, Chen.

133
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Did I reject them?

134
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Look at me and answer me!

135
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
They are not the cause of the problem!

136
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Unfortunately, there is no reason to support them anymore.

137
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
That's why you told me to abandon them!

138
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
They must not be taken away by the ideal.

139
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Chen, we have made many mistakes.

140
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,920
But now, there is something that only I can do.

141
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,920
So, Chen, do what you should do.

142
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
There are infected people in the Reunion.

143
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
That is a mistake.

144
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I want to say that what you should do is to eliminate them.

145
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Then, you should deal with me.

146
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
I am an infected person.

147
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Chen...

148
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:14,920
I am sorry that the infected people in this region are infected.

149
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Chen...

150
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,920
If you want to eliminate the infected people from this city, I will definitely be your target.

151
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
That's why I will go.

152
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Stop it.

153
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I am a traitor, so I deserve this job.

154
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Stop it!

155
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Stop it!

156
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
I knew it.

157
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
You don't have to hide it anymore.

158
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Mrs. Fumitsu, thank you for taking care of me for a long time and treating me like a family.

159
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Chen!

160
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I will return it to you!

161
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Chen!

162
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Seikido!

163
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Blow the air away!

164
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I have to kill this one.

165
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Leave the rest to me, Chen.

166
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Can you trust me?

167
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Seikido!

168
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,920
I don't want to take the sword you taught me.

169
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,920
I have someone to defeat and protect in this war.

170
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,920
If she really wants to destroy the Rondian, I will stop her!

171
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Face!

172
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
The End

173
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Captain Chen has been exposed?

174
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
That's right.

175
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,920
I still can't reach him.

176
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
I see.

177
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Go back to the mochi.

178
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Is this what you call fate?

179
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,920
But I can't just die like this.

180
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Your Excellency, we will take Chen back and take her head.

181
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Please take care of her.

182
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Maran, step back.

183
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
But Your Excellency...

184
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Don't call me that.

185
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Step back.

186
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Yen Wu, I know you have sacrificed everything for this city.

187
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,920
But this situation is not what you wanted.

188
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,920
You only increased the secret and hurt her.

189
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,920
I was given this city because of this tragic situation.

190
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,920
I think Feize wants to change that from the basis.

191
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,920
She wants to start over.

192
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,920
She wants to take this city from my land.

193
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,920
I have taught her what she needs and what she should throw away.

194
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
But...

195
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,920
That's not what I meant.

196
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,920
You want to end it like this with those girls?

197
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,920
You want to lose Chen and Tarla?

198
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
That's why I have to go.

199
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
I can't let Feize make the same mistake.

200
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
That's enough.

201
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,920
You're making up excuses again.

202
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Can you help Rodos and the other girls?

203
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I will pay for the cost.

204
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,920
I don't want to depend on the infected.

205
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Who can prove that you infected will not be reunited?

206
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,920
I only care about whether you and Reunion are enemies.

207
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Don't act cool.

208
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
That's enough.

209
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

210
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,920
No, Ms. Fumizuki.

211
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Can I ask you something?

212
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Yes, go ahead.

213
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,920
What kind of relationship do you have with Chen and Tarla?

214
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
We are sisters.

215
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Fumizuki!

216
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
She is Yeh's sister.

217
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,920
We raised them together when they were young.

218
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Why Tarla?

219
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Before Yeh took over Romain,

220
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,920
the son of Ulusas, Koshchei, was trying to get Romain.

221
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,920
At that time, Yeh left him,

222
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,920
but in the end, the prince made Tarla his hostage

223
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,920
and he tried to choose between Romain or Tarla.

224
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,920
I think you know the result.

225
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Now that he is the heir of Ulusas,

226
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Tarla is the one who is heading to Romain.

227
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
He is already...

228
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
No, it's not that.

229
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,920
A few days ago, Koshchei was attending a party

230
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,920
and he said he was attending it.

231
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Koshchei will never show up except when necessary.

232
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,920
If he shows up to show his sister Tarla...

233
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
He is the heir.

234
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,920
You proved my guess.

235
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,920
I didn't want to believe it.

236
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,920
If he is the heir of Koshchei, the situation will change.

237
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Of course, Romain is aware of you.

238
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Do you think we need help from outside?

239
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
This is our problem.

240
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
I have to do the production.

241
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Are you going to risk your life?

242
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I don't think I can do that,

243
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,920
but at least the people of this town will not stop.

244
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
What about Mr. Fumizuki?

245
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
What?

246
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,920
After your death, your wife will be a valuable witness.

247
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,920
I don't know what they will do.

248
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Are you threatening me?

249
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,920
I am ready to die.

250
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
That's ridiculous.

251
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,920
If you have any problem, I will help you.

252
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Fumizuki...

253
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,920
The Rodos ship has already left the area of Romain.

254
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
The Rodos has broken the contract.

255
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,920
What is going to happen has nothing to do with Romain.

256
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Amia, don't you think so?

257
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Yes.

258
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Mr. Wei, we don't intend to stand on the ground alone.

259
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,920
But we want to stop the tragedy that is coming.

260
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Why do you say that?

261
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Because we think that Romain and your family and Chen

262
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,920
have the value of accepting our mission.

263
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Amia...

264
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Is it okay if I say something?

265
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,920
I want you to promise me that you will not use force against Rodos.

266
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,920
We need a promise to trust you.

267
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
All right.

268
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Please take care of the girls.

269
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Yes.

270
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
I will definitely take them home.

271
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Please wait.

272
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
A star cloud?

273
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Why are you here?

274
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Are you okay?

275
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Yes.

276
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,920
I don't have any scratches.

277
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
I see.

278
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
What a wonderful machine.

279
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,920
The latest model of Rembiliton.

280
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,920
I had a hard time buying it.

281
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.

282
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
You have a mission.

283
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,920
This is the only place I can go without being noticed.

284
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Are you going to stop me too?

285
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Of course.

286
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,920
I can't let you play a dangerous hero anymore.

287
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
If you're my friend, please pass through here.

288
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Star cloud!

289
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Then let me say it like I used to.

290
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
What?

291
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Stop thinking about it!

292
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,920
You can solve it, but you're going to make Rembilion a pricey place alone?

293
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,920
No one wants you to die.

294
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
You're necessary for the Rembilion.

295
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,920
You're going to be a new Rembilion.

296
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Get out of my way, Star cloud!

297
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,920
This is the only way to save the Rembilion.

298
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
This is not what you should do.

299
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,920
I don't want you to be in danger.

300
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,920
There are other reasons why I can't stay here anymore.

301
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,920
I'm an infected person.

302
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
What?

303
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,920
I was infected with Nine in the same mission as you three years ago.

304
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Why did you keep quiet again?

305
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Wei ordered me to do so.

306
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I also decided to hide the fact that I was a human in this village.

307
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,920
But I've been exposed to the truth of this town.

308
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Nine also went out of this town looking through the truth.

309
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,920
There are no infected people in this town.

310
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,920
I don't care if you're infected or not.

311
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Both you and Miss Zweier, Nine and this song, they all have the same idea.

312
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,920
You don't have to bear the sin of not being infected.

313
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,920
Even so, I have to go.

314
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Tarula is my sister.

315
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
I see.

316
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
So that's what it is.

317
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,920
There's no other way to stop you now.

318
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,920
There's no other way but to hit you!

319
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm sorry.

321
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
I'm sorry.

326
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm sorry.

327
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
I'm sorry.

337
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm sorry.

345
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm sorry.

347
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,920
If you think you're evil,

348
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,920
you can go and beat them up together.

349
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
If you have something you want to do,

350
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
you can do anything!

351
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
That's why...

352
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Don't go, Zen!

353
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Thank you, Hoshiguma.

354
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,920
You're a terrible young lady.

355
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
You've been in this town since the beginning!

356
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
You're different from me.

357
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
You're different.

358
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,920
I've given up my heart for this town.

359
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
I can't do it forever.

360
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,920
I've been running away from the past.

361
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,920
I don't want to run anymore, Hoshiguma!

362
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Go.

363
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Before my mind changes.

364
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,920
If a infected child in SLAM gives you a bear doll,

365
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
take it.

366
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
It's what Misha left behind.

367
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
I understand.

368
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
I'll take one.

370
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
It's not like you.

371
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Go now.

372
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Don't look back.

373
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Take care.

374
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,920
I can't forgive this town?

375
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Where is there anyone who loves this town more than you do?

376
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,920
You stubborn, kind, liar.
