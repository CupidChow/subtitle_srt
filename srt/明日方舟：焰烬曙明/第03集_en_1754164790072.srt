1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Sir Patriot.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,800
What happened?

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,800
W betrayed me.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,000
I've already disposed of her, so don't worry.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,600
I'll take over her Sarkaz mercenaries.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,500
W...

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,300
Leader...

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,600
Why did you launch the neutral zone without telling me?

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,400
The situation was so dire that there was no way to make it work.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Tarla...

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,400
If you start moving, things won't stop.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,700
That's why I entrust the key to you.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,200
I want you to keep watching to see if we should stop.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,900
I understand.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,400
I won't let anyone get in the way.

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,500
I'm counting on you, Mister.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's go pick up Frost Nova and the others who are waiting for help at the Ronmen.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,400
Tarla...

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,800
No matter how evil it is,

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,800
it's the end of all sins.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,200
I believe so.

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,300
I believe so too.

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,200
Farewell, Leader.

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,100
You want to protect your life?

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
This stone?

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,200
Such a sacred thing...

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,000
I understand.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,800
You can take it.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll live a long life.

31
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,300
You can take your own life.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I will destroy my own life.

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,600
Who will I save?

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,100
I will end everything.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The small flower I stepped on

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
hurt my heart, but

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
does it really hurt?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Even the place where I was born,

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
even the place where I was scattered,

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
can I choose something?

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't you see what I see?

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My life is burning.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The light is far away.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't you see?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm living.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Lose, make a mistake,

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
hurt, hurt,

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
End of Days, please, please,

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the end.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
End of Days

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I understand.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Walpharin, you seem to have forgotten your duty.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't say the word Demon King again.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Red, I'm asking you to leave.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I understand.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I learned that Chen has endured so far.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I learned that he knew what he was trying to protect.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Chen and we have the same feelings.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I promised Ms. Fumizuki that I would take her home.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes, I promised to save Tarla.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If I can reduce even one of the sorrows that are born in this land,

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I will do anything.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's stop the collision.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Good morning, everyone.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm Ameya, the representative of Rhodes.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm Ameya.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have an important message for all operators.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ameya...

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
As I reported last night,

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
our selection team will head to the planning station of the Reunion.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It will be a tough fight.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And if this mission fails,

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
the war will begin.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then, regardless of the conspiracy behind the Reunion,

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
there is only one reality that we can push.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The infected people have started a war.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
A war...

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think it has nothing to do with the contract company.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But it's the same for Rhodes, who is already in the middle of a war that is invisible.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Since the capture, we have been working hard to control the Oripathy.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But the conflict between the infected and the non-infected continues to deepen.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Some people make a profit by using the conflict.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Our enemies are no longer just the Oripathy.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
At the end of the war between the Ulusas and the Abyss,

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
there will be hatred that will never disappear for the infected.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The future of Rhodes, where the Oripathy treatment and coexistence with the infected are not allowed,

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is waiting for the future where it will lose its meaning of existence.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We must succeed in our mission.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And I would like to ask everyone in the ship to maintain the normal operation of Rhodes.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Regardless of whether Rhodes will return from our strategy...

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Ameya-san!

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Please go home.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Rhodes, please continue to save as many people as possible.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ameya-san...

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's all.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I shouldn't have said that.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why, Blaze? Something's strange.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why? You shouldn't go.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This mission is always different from the others.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm going to die.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't say that so easily!

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ace and Scout died, right?

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I want to go and find out what happened to them.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have to let go of such memories and look back...

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No, that's not how you say it.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sorry.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Sad things are also important parts of memory, right?

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You mean you forget that you don't look back, right?

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I want to remember everyone.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I will never forget that I died.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We are elite operators, right?

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Dasmakis, come back safely.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I understand.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Are you really taking her?

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I checked the data to see if she's alive.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I know there's a contradiction.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But she's too young.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I also have something to think about.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I didn't expect you to worry so much.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Huh?

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You won on the basement floor of the building.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't call that a victory.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You yourself are the enemy commander of Rhodes.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
She's not an enemy.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Doctor, you can't judge the enemy's side.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, I have no intention of blaming your judgment.

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I understood her will as an enemy and took responsibility.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
As long as I keep facing the events and events that are happening in this land,

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I respect your judgment.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Whatever the result, I will take responsibility with you.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Responsibility is established by keeping power and integrity.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The destruction of the enemy's allies is also entrusted to your judgment as commander.

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It has nothing to do with memory.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I respect your judgment now.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Thank you for waiting.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It was a good speech.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It was great.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you very much.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's a contradiction.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What's the difference between them?

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Then let's get started.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This operation is carried out in the joint ceremony of the three of us.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
All the city structures are understood from the data obtained from Azadel's clinic,

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but communication is difficult due to the influence of genius.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
At the site, the communication is the key to the communication of the radian captain Ars and her reconnaissance unit.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
In addition, the special investigation team of Captain Mantra,

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
we will deploy with the five small teams of three combat units.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We will enter from the numerous maintenance ships on the city side.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I will approach you.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I will take a look at the camouflage armor from the ground,

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
which is like a dancing team of the sky.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The camouflage technique of the aircraft is completed.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Start the transport.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The design idea that is in the middle of the city.

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Ulsan is violent, but not all citizens are like that.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's the same as ordering a war.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry. The burnt bones are scattered.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Firewatch, I couldn't give you a chance to save you.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The reconnaissance unit is approaching.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Please ask before being captured.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Now we can fight together.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's protect this area until we succeed in entering.

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I will enter the city.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Roger.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wow, it's bright.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A mercenary can do this.

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Right, Captain Mantra?

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Wow, the view is clear even in the photo.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It is a minute to hide yourself. Hurry up.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Roger.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All members, start to enter.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is really going to go.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It was not time for you to learn how to handle this.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I told you that the skill is to make instant noodles in your mouth.

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What are you talking about?

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hold on this much.

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Wait.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm kidding.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How is it? It's a good skill.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Huh? You don't like the sky?

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I told you to be careful, but you're not going to do extreme flight.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is Amiya. All troops have entered.

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Roger. We will start to pray now.

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Amiya, you are also necessary for Rodos.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
All of you return safely. I pray for success.

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're safe.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm safe. Many of my friends have died.

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Frost Nova, Snow Devil, Faust...

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I see.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The situation on the surface was completely different from the plan.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The communication between the Reunion and the Central District is blocked.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hey, you!

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What do you mean?

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Where is Matriot?

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This is strange!

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Shut up!

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The Reunion will never forget Faust.

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We must avenge our comrades.

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I want to make Mephisto rest.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You need a break, too.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll take you to the Central District.

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Roger.

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Leave those people and leave the other troops.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
For eternity.

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Who are you?

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Who am I?

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What did you do?

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What?

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Fight for yourself.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Fight?

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You proud Ulusas people.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I thought you two were the only ones who survived until the end.

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We've confirmed the situation.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Mantra Team, find out how the enemy is communicating.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The Radiant Team, continue to monitor and keep the communication environment.

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Please deploy all units.

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The Radiant and Mantra, the elite operators, are all my family.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Family?

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But I don't want them to think that way.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you know Ace and Scout?

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I know Ace.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You haven't seen them in days.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Where did they go?

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Los Montes, they're already...

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
As we expected.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The city's communication network is temporarily shut down.

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But we're also leaving the Originium that's blocking the communication.

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Tarla is measuring the division of the organization.

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's hard to read the movement of the soldiers on the way back.

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's increase the number of enemy targets.

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Rabaka.

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes.

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Blitz Silver.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes.

241
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Your team, go back and proceed with the subroute.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Roger.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What is this?

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can sense something strange.

245
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a little bit, but it smells like death.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The ancient Sarkaz ritual?

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

248
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How could this be possible?

249
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The pure blood of Wendigo.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So he's still here.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's go.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's line up.

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There's no mistake.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know.

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is only Chen's.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's hurry.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:26,340
Get out of the

258
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,340
I'm in a panic.

259
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Let's let him out.

260
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,340
You're the servants, aren't you?

261
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,340
If so, you're already dead.

262
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,340
That voice.

263
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Mr. Card.

264
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
You're safe.

265
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,340
It's been a while.

266
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,340
Thank goodness.

267
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,340
If you're alive, you can meet again somewhere.

268
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
It was true.

269
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
What's that look?

270
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,340
I'll explain.

271
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,340
But please wait a minute.

272
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
Doctor, let's go back.

273
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,340
Shut up!

274
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Reunion!

275
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
You're a traitor!

276
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,340
The Patriots are now away from this area.

277
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,340
It's dangerous outside.

278
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,340
Patriots?

279
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,340
They're just the same people!

280
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
They're...

281
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,340
They're just letting the city be ruined!

282
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,340
That's not it!

283
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,340
The Sarkaz circle will pass through here soon.

284
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,340
You guys stay in the warehouse.

285
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,340
You can't believe it!

286
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
Calm down.

287
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
And...

288
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,340
Please be quiet.

289
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
Mr. Card!

290
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,340
Dr. Eros!

291
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,340
Did he hurt the civilians?

292
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,340
He's a traitor.

293
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,340
Your reply will determine the outcome.

294
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,340
Why?

295
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,340
The enemy is getting closer.

296
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,340
Did he hurt you?

297
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
No way!

298
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,340
35 meters.

299
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,340
Hurry up and hide!

300
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
The answer is ahead.

301
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
28 meters.

302
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,340
That's...

303
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,340
23.

304
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,340
Mons.

305
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,340
27.

306
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,340
21.

307
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,340
He didn't do anything wrong.

308
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,340
He didn't do anything wrong.

309
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,340
You can think of it as a fake act.

310
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
It's like a psychological treatment.

311
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,340
This will ease your pain.

312
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,340
Thank you.

313
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,340
I was suspicious that he was connected to another Reunion.

314
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,340
I was wrong.

315
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,340
Don't worry about it.

316
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,340
You're the one who's going to be in the front line.

317
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,340
Mr. Card.

318
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,340
She's...

319
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
It's a mission.

320
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,340
I'll take revenge for that.

321
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
For the sake of my wounded family.

322
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
That's the reason I'm here.

323
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,340
I see.

324
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,340
I'm sorry for saying something so strange.

325
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,340
There's a reason for everything.

326
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Just like how you didn't return.

327
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
Yes.

328
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:41,340
The reason the civilians are surviving in this city is because of the support of the Patriots and the guerrillas.

329
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
I'm helping them.

330
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,340
He tried to escape while knowing that I was Rodost.

331
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,340
But I decided to stay on my own.

332
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,340
To see through everything.

333
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:58,340
He respected the will of Scout, who died in order to protect me.

334
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,340
He died.

335
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,340
The white-haired old man came to deliver the black-baked thing.

336
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,340
That was Scout's.

337
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
Scout is no longer there.

338
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
Scout is gone!

339
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,340
I wrote it! I wrote it right!

340
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,340
I...

341
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,340
Ace! Ace!

342
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,340
Let's get some fresh air outside.

343
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,340
Why did you forget?

344
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
Why?

345
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:36,180
Everyone, extend the

346
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,340
I never forgot even after I got sick.

347
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,340
But I think it's better for the Doctor not to go to the battlefield.

348
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,340
If the war and the massacre had changed the Doctor...

349
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,340
No, you can't do nothing right now.

350
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,340
Scout and Captain Ace had a strong belief.

351
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,340
I'm alive now with the lives of the two elite operators.

352
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,340
So this time, I want to repay the faith that Patriot has.

353
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:19,340
Guard, our situation has changed, but our belief in saving people is the same.

354
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
Ms. Amia.

355
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,340
If Patriot is here, the organization will not be shaken.

356
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,340
Yes. It's the last pillar for Reunion to maintain its morale.

357
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,340
Even if Tarla betrayed him?

358
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
Huh?

359
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
A separation code?

360
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,340
A collision?

361
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,340
I haven't heard of that!

362
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,740
I can't believe the

363
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,340
It's Tarla's strategy.

364
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Are you going to fight Patriot?

365
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
I will try to communicate.

366
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,340
I will inform you of the situation.

367
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,340
I won't let you fight.

368
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Please!

369
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
Vajokhasty.

370
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,340
Do you know his name?

371
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,340
Frost Nova is my father.

372
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,340
His real name is Rodos.

373
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,340
He was called the shield of the infected when he was in the snowfield.

374
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,340
The guerrilla is another Rodos.

375
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,340
Mr. Rosmontes.

376
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,340
Let's go. I don't want to remember.

377
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,340
I don't want to leave Reunion in my memory.

378
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Yes, that's right.

379
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,340
The guerrilla is transmitting encrypted information using telecom soldiers.

380
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
It's primitive, but it's certain.

381
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
Let's go.

382
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,340
Captain Mantra.

383
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:36,340
Radian, if you feel a mental disorder, you need to take the medicine immediately.

384
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,340
I'll be by your side.

385
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,340
Yes.

386
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,340
Let's start.

387
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
I found it.

388
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,340
Three, four, five people.

389
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,340
Radian, disconnect from her!

390
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,340
Mr. Rosmontes!

391
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,340
Everyone is here.

392
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,340
I'll be with you.

393
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,340
It's okay.

394
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
Radian, connect me.

395
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
The ninth person.

396
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,340
Thirteen, fourteen.

397
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,340
I found everyone.

398
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
Good job.

399
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,340
From now on, we will use the telecom soldiers as a force and march into the central area.

400
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
Mr. Rosmontes.

401
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
I'm fine.

402
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,340
I came here to protect everyone.

403
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,340
I have this power, so I'm here.

404
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,340
It doesn't matter if it's because I'm a child.

405
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,340
Amia is the same.

406
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,340
We are monsters, aren't we, Doctor?

407
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,340
Rhodes, I'll let you go on like this.

408
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,340
Let me through!

409
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,340
What did you know?

410
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,340
Confirmed a raid on the Eight Seventh!

411
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
Roger.

412
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Keep your guard up and wait.

413
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340
You won't come out of nowhere, will you?

414
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,340
A child of Feline?

415
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
From there to there.

416
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
Kill.

417
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,340
Grab it with your hands.

418
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,340
Kill.

419
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,340
Like cutting a potato.

420
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,340
This is far more than a test.

421
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,340
That's what the spirit of Rosmontes was made of.

422
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,340
This is a false information, but she is a artificially generated infected person.

423
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,340
She was taken into the brain tube during the infection period, and died if removed.

424
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
To make her a weapon?

425
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Maybe.

426
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,340
The art that oozes out of the body will take the lives of others.

427
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,340
After protecting her with Rhodes, she trained to control the arts with her own will.

428
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
Of course, it's her own hope.

429
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
Do you think she's a weapon?

430
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
She's not a weapon.

431
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,340
But this is too powerful a power.

432
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,340
The scouts must have felt the same way.

433
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,340
There are things that can only be dealt with with a powerful force.

434
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,340
She understands that.

435
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,340
That's why it's important to use your power to achieve something.

436
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,340
You're the same, Doctor.

437
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
The assault team is retreating!

438
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,340
There's no other way.

439
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,340
All units, prepare for defense!

440
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,340
We're getting closer to the scene.

441
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,340
I feel power.

442
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,340
From behind those people.

443
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,340
But his presence is also...

444
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,340
Mr. Card...

445
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,340
That's what I'm going to destroy.

446
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,340
Wait, Rosmontes!

447
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,340
Are you okay?

448
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Patriot...

449
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,340
The shield of the infected...

450
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,340
Last night

451
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,340
I arise from the ground

452
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:26,340
Now to the sky they seek

453
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:35,340
I must face brightened gods

454
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,340
Caught by blood

455
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,340
That the stars left

456
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,340
In the world

457
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,340
Trailing sorrow

458
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,340
Out of dear

459
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:01,340
Embrace the truth

460
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:17,340
La...
