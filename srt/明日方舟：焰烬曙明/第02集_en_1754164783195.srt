1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Wake up...Wake up...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You're conscious, aren't you?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm glad you're awake.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Can you talk?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Do you know who you are?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's your name?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why do you carry the W gun?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey, it's my friend's.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're lying.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm waiting for you to turn your back on me.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's not a bad answer.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I understand.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll make you a member of our unit.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hey, Hedrick!

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll follow our rules and give him a chance.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Follow me, the monkey monkey.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You know what it means to take the weapon of the dead, right?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Of course.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All right.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
From today on, you're the W.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The W is the place of peace and tranquility.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I stepped on a small flower.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
My heart was hurt.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Does it hurt?

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Even where you're born, even where you're scattered.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Can you choose something?

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't you see what I see?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
My life is burning.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The light is far away.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't you see?

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm living.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Lose, make a mistake, get hurt, get hurt.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
End of days.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Please, please, end it.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What's that?

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's a list of test funds.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Does it have your name on it?

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
W. The old one is S...

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
S...

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's been produced.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The new one is considered a gift.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The picture is a financial code.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is how our lives are labeled.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you raise the name, the price will go up.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The battlefield will give us value and show us the way to live.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's impressive.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Do you know this person?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sometimes a familiar face comes to the end like this.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is what it means to have more candy.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Which one is stronger, me or the old one?

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What?

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is the battlefield fun?

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He's like the previous W.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're pretty good at raising it.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm actually doing well.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But I refuse to take her weight.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can't trust me?

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There's nothing in my heart.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When you cheat or kill, that's a mercenary.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is it too much?

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If it's an important mission, there's a reason to use her.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll use everything I can.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's all.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There's no place for mercenaries to return to.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We'll use whatever it is to get the land and the place.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
When I calm down, the shadows are shaking.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The fire is just shaking.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're always fooling yourself.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I understand.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So who's the client?

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't say.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you trust your own friends...

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Knowing is taking responsibility.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You don't have to hold the king alone.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We're the same mercenaries.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Be careful.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Really?

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So?

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The client is...

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Babel?

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What?

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
A company?

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't know.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I see.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You don't trust me at all.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Trust?

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've never trusted you.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're close to the Candy Maid of Hedory, aren't you?

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Maybe.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
His head is still connected, but...

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Is it a change of heart?

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I wonder.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You want something, don't you?

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, I don't think it's anything.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Stop.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're upset.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're surprisingly honest.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It has nothing to do with it.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let go.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's Babel's...

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's costing money.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Most of the transports are dummy.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There's no main unit.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are we a decoy too?

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's up to you.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The mission is to protect the captain.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The destination will be reached in three days.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Kill those who are not in the same class.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No warning is required.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's all.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Put them in position.

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a gun.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Who are they attacking?

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're scary.

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No way.

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm doing something else.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You two should do your best during the mission.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ines, it's a breach of contract.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Stop it.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The contents of the luggage...

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ines.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I mean...

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The communication...

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No, it's being interrupted.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Only we are surviving around here.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thanks to that, the enemy hasn't reached the transport main unit.

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We didn't get that much information.

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We have to meet with the Hedlian squad.

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The enemy is not just a mercenary.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Maybe they're Kazutel.

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Isn't that too much?

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So what?

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We'll be finished one day.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Choose.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The place of the transport main unit or the head of the Hedlian squad.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you're ready, we'll prepare a party for you.

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You're so kind.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You'd better have more useful tools.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What do you think?

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a waste of time.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I refuse.

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What the hell?

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ines!

146
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You fool.

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do it.

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What?

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't be so stubborn.

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The ship isn't Kazutel.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Your Highness...

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's sit down and talk, Hedli.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I sympathize with him.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There were only monsters in that room.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I didn't expect Kazutel's client to be the organization of the construction of the ship.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, if you were carrying parts to the construction site, you were attacked by the enemy?

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What is this place?

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not just a ship.

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've never seen such a structure.

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a mess, but it doesn't matter.

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Fine.

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Stop it.

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I have to find a way out.

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm relieved that you're awake.

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm responsible for the damage that's been caused.

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I apologize.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But the operation was successful.

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're a great mercenary.

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I want you to continue to lend me your strength.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Please heal my wounds now.

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
See you later.

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Scary.

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Scary.

174
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's faster to open the door.

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But I've received a lot of injured people.

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Then give me three days. I'll rebuild the system.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Can you do it?

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can. I'll do it.

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you don't know how to use it, you can replace it with something you know.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's easy, isn't it?

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes. I'll leave it to you.

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Roger that.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're W, aren't you?

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Your Highness...

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You can call me Terezia.

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Your Highness Terezia...

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Thank you for saving me.

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm glad you woke up.

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Is the ship's construction going well?

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No, it's a little different.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This ship was originally sleeping in the basement.

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We're discovering and repairing that part.

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Rhodes Island.

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's the name of the ship in the documents.

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't know what the doctor and Kelsin say, but I want to call it by its original name.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Names are always forgotten.

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You don't have a real name.

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's not unusual for a monkey born in Kazudel...

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't want to forget.

200
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You and everyone else.

201
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No, you can't forget.

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're not going to be able to go.

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
When you're no longer W, I'm sure you'll want your own name.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can stay here forever.

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I welcome you.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's dangerous there, so I don't want to go in.

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Kelsin...

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll be out in a minute.

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes, be careful.

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Is there another one?

211
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I think I found what I wanted to do.

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I see.

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
A mercenary who does not desire independence claims freedom and independence.

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Unfortunately, your work has been excellent for the past few months.

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What the Sarkozy warriors want, what you want, is what you want.

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's another path I've chosen.

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have no choice but to move on.

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I hope it goes well.

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hey, Scout.

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Huh?

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Where's Terezia?

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Are you chasing after the queen again?

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What's that?

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The camera that the caught spy had.

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I heard he could stay there, and I was happy to hear that.

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He's a stranger.

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hey, what did you feel about the people there?

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I know.

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Your Highness was sad, but it was very warm.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't think you're the center of this cruel civil war.

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I thought the doctor was cold and like a machine, but he never called Sarkozy a demon.

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He looked at everyone equally.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The doctor...

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes, for example, chess players and soldiers are just pieces for him.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Your Highness, it seems like the doctor was pretending not to see that.

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes, the doctor is controlling the war itself.

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I've told W that something might be starting to go wrong in Babel.

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think it was the right thing to leave there.

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The End

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Everyone made the right choice.

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That Babel commander.

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The battle ended with her neck.

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
My team is returned to you and will remain silent forever.

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Everything is as you wanted, Your Highness.

245
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The only one who deserves your name is Terezia.

246
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Terezia...

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We want to stop her with our hands.

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But she...

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Until the end...

250
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I... I...

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's been a while.

252
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes, it's been six months.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This is the place where I first met you.

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Were you thinking about me?

255
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No way. The last one was here.

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What is it?

257
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm collecting the Terecius.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The remaining mercenaries will be organized as an army.

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You're all going to follow Terecius?

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Most of Sarkozy's thoughts have given up on themselves.

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How was your horn?

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

263
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I heard you shaved your horn to defeat Sarkozy.

264
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Did it hurt?

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No.

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're different.

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If you play with me forever, you'll die.

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I decided it myself.

269
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I have no choice but to live.

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
W.

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Even if we fight against the King of Sessh now, there is no way to survive.

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Then why don't you do it quickly?

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You came here with that intention, didn't you?

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, listen.

275
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We're going to Ursus.

276
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What?

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The infected organization that has a base in the north of Ursus has presented a hot-handed army to the mercenaries of Kazdel.

278
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The King of Sessh is going to use this.

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're going to get rid of Kazdel after the organization is in place?

280
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And it's a group of people who have been damaged.

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It might be a good sign for Sarkozy.

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
How about it?

283
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're not coming either?

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I see.

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The monsters of the mask and the barbarians have disappeared.

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There's no point in staying with Kazdel.

287
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm on it.

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But I'll let you do whatever you want.

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll decide what I'm going to do myself.

290
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You can do whatever you want other than following orders from the destroyer.

291
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I welcome the family.

292
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
W.

293
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What are you doing here?

294
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm enjoying being a genius.

295
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Come back quickly.

296
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I can't go through.

297
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm not angry.

298
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
She was crazy before, but she's like a genius in a human form.

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
She looks calmer than before.

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't know anymore.

301
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, you liked her so much.

302
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Babel doesn't seem to have any feelings for people.

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You don't want to hear it, do you?

304
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I think that's better.

305
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

306
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How are you?

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We're going to get involved with the genius.

308
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's good to be a teacher.

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Huh?

310
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You won't be suspicious of doing something weird.

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We're just following you, boss.

312
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So, Rhodes Island.

313
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The ship left Kazdel.

314
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's just that it didn't hit the hands of Telesis.

315
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's enough.

316
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I welcome the soldiers who have come.

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Do they look like Telesia?

318
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's a story of emotions.

319
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Unlike the king's deep sadness, it's like a strong anger.

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I want to hear what happened to Kazdel.

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You're also a monkey, aren't you?

323
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Was that also a Wendigo?

324
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
An old race?

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's right.

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, Kazdel's story is not...

327
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Telesia left a living proof for you.

328
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
My race was once chased by Kazdel.

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm a monkey.

330
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It doesn't change even now.

331
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I want to know the truth.

332
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What happened to the tribe and the village.

333
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We'll go and see what's going on with Amia and Doberman.

334
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Roger.

335
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's go.

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's okay now.

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's been three years since we last saw Aist.

338
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's terrible.

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So, what's the deal?

341
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I want the doctor to be safely discharged.

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Doctor?

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's a high price.

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What did you do to my life?

345
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What did you do to my life?

346
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, my friend.

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Tell me your real name at the end.

348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm a scout.

349
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You know, mercenaries are all famous.

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Right, Galsin?

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
A soldier of Rhodes!

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What's your name?

353
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
My name is Aist!

354
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm the elite operator of Rhodes, Aist!

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Galsin was the platoon leader of the mercenaries

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
that Telesis sent.

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's a good news.

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Your squad was wiped out.

359
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
As you said.

360
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This is the end of the doctor's time saving.

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Did you know all my team members?

362
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It would be a problem if the person you killed was different.

363
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're right.

364
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
W is worried about others' names.

365
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I thought he would be responsible for my work.

366
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's hard to do it yourself.

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't know if it's true or not.

368
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The monkey family.

369
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Tarla.

370
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There are two shadows.

371
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I see.

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You're called Amia.

373
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, it's okay.

374
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You have something else to do.

375
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I've never cared about the name of the little rabbit.

376
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I wanted to miss you too.

377
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Please rest soon, my friend.

379
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Hedri, we shouldn't be used by the monkey family anymore.

380
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You shouldn't be here.

381
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Find the truth with your eyes.

382
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't waste it.

383
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Tell W.

384
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I understand.

385
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Why?

386
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Scout.

387
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Do you hear the sound of Rodos's war cry?

388
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's the same as three years ago.

389
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But it's different from Terezia.

390
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Tarla is trying to destroy the tower she noticed.

391
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Did you use Arts on Tarla?

392
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I have to tell W.

393
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Wait, Ieze.

394
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You missed the mercenary who was about to escape, didn't you?

395
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't know.

396
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Your eyes have become more strict since the reunion.

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm going to take over and defend the sword of Galsin.

398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Are you going to die?

399
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Following Ines.

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
No way.

401
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He was trying to tell you something.

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
There are two shadows.

403
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Tarla is acting strange.

404
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You can start the central area without a ninja.

405
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's easy to start, but it's difficult to stop.

406
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Misha entrusted the key to his father, Sergé, to stop the operation.

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He didn't know that.

408
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The key was a way to make our plan perfect.

409
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It disappeared because of my mistake.

410
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's not your fault.

411
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're so kind.

412
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So you don't have the key anymore?

413
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No.

414
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The key to the key of the Chalunobog's mayor, Boris, is left.

415
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The one who was burned by Mephisto in the city of Hyta?

416
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Did you burn the key?

417
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The Patriots have recovered and stored it.

418
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Now you can trust me a little.

419
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We have to support each other.

420
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Is that true?

421
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Of course it is.

422
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
W.

423
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The son of a vile beast.

424
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
My flame is already burning its wings.

425
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Nanji will pay for betraying.

426
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you talking about?

427
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Are you really Tarla?

428
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're so annoying.

429
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Soresha.

430
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Was this toy decorated on the floor your trump card?

431
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Where are you?

432
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You want to stop the collision, little girl of the monkey.

433
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If you call me a demon...

434
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Do you want a special prize that means a rift?

435
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Everyone calls us that because they're afraid of us.

436
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So welcome.

437
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You want to save your friends from me, right?

438
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You're a very hot, cute demon.

439
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm the first one to be pierced with that sword while I'm alive.

440
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The second one.

441
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What a shame.

442
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't know what number you're in anymore.

443
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm here.

444
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Do you know what it means to inherit the swords of the monkey?

445
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Shut up, demon.

446
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You tricked him.

447
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The medicine to suppress the initial symptoms of Oripathy is only available in that hospital.

448
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Then why is it so late?

449
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He was under the rubble, so I saved him.

450
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If I wasn't there, he would...

451
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Did he run away?

452
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
As long as that girl doesn't come back, you won't know the truth.

453
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You don't believe me, do you?

454
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You look down on her.

455
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's not...

456
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You don't even know her name.

457
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Tell me if you can't stand the pain.

458
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll make it easier for you.

459
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If you don't like it, live and suffer.

460
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That girl was saved by you, so I just want to save her.

461
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It doesn't matter if she's a sheep or a horse.

462
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'll give you that sword as a gift.

463
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Loubref!

464
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I did it!

465
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Here's the medical kit.

466
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You're not hurt...

467
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's okay.

468
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll fix it right away.

469
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hey, what's your name?

470
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You finally asked.

471
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm Andre.

472
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Thanks, Andre.

473
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Huh?

474
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That monkey...

475
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
As the cover of the cave, it's not easy.

476
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey, Hedley.

477
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I said the battlefield would give me value.

478
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
W, you're the monkey statue.

479
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
From now on, we will decide our own value.

480
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Were you trying to release me from the control?

481
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's weird.

482
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's not weird, is it?

483
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm sorry.

524
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm sorry.

525
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm sorry.
