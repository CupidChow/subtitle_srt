1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He won't give in to anyone's strategy!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Battlion won't die!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You know how to play the fool, but what about you?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This...

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Rudos...

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you're going to the Commander's, who are you?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Who are you to us?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll kill you!

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's not the way to talk.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's been a while, Lady Castile.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So it was thehad animals that stopped them.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Do you want to stay?

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Even the place where you were born, even the place where you were scattered

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then can you choose something?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't you see what I see?

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My life is burning

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The light is far away

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't you see?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm living

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Lose, make mistakes, get hurt, get hurt

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
End of days

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please, please, end

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You don't get old?

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Even the old man can't change you?

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No, Bojo Castille, we've changed

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You left Kazdel and now you're fighting against the evil and the evil as the source of the infected

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't stand killing people, I left the king

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I've been killing Ulsas, the motherland

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You still call her the king?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The king is the king

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We didn't come here to shed blood

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I believe

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The king believes in you

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Even if they are carrying the smell of your daughter's death

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
She is...

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The daughter is young and beautiful

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
She trusts you

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She put everything on the line to show her anger and ideals

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Her life has irreplaceable value in that fight

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You don't have the right to say that

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The daughter gave up on fighting against fate

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, she accepted us and entrusted her feelings

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,620
Listen, they are trying to make this city a

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sure they are running the signal of Ulsas

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you knew, why?

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The king was crazy, he had no sense

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He wanted to tell everyone

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He couldn't have the reunion next time

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you want revenge, Patriot?

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, Shack

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I hate fate

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If fate will give you back to me and make me change

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will give up my right to see everything back

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You have a way to throw your life away

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You should know the loss

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If it was my position, I wouldn't have to do anything

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is war

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Not for the sake of the dead daughter

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Fight for the lives of all the infected

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And for the sake of the dead

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't believe in the coincidence of fate

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Until now

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The value of the children is proved by killing me

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If fate is on my side, I will kill you and kill fate

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What? What do you want to say?

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I will crush everything

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Only the ones who survived are right

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Rhodes, I will die

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The enemy is the reunion ship Patriot

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He is different from Frost Nova

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He believes in nothing

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He can only kill him in war

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mission Start

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That wave

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It seems to be activating the scenery to take his body away

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It is a special object that is effective on life

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It won't stop the infection even if it falls

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's right

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Master

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What is new?

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The body of the Yadavis is being repaired

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It is abnormal fusion

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Many of the power functions are being stolen

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I will not lose

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's the key, go outside

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm going to try.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm going to try to do it.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm going to try to do it.

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm going to try to do it.

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm going to try to do it.

92
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,000
All those feet.

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:53,540
Our

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We have to get past this wall.

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Continue attacking until his regenerative power is at its highest.

96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes!

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Everyone, please be careful until then.

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Roger!

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Monster, fire the device!

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The device...

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You did well. Replace!

102
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Good.

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't stop thinking about it.

104
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've sacrificed my body.

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We can't wait to see each other.

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's do it again.

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can't do it!

108
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Monster!

109
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You bastard!

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ojokasti...

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Monster, fire!

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Even if I'm gone, this child is by your side.

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Children are the batons of life.

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You know love.

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's why even I, who don't know love, was able to love you.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't say that you want to be alone forever.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I love you.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You and your family in the future.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Everything.

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Helen, I couldn't protect you.

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I have no right to be loved.

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're strong.

123
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Helen, my child, where is your food?

124
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You should carry it.

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Someone else has to carry it.

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's already light.

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not a child.

128
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's a child.

129
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a child.

130
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't listen to the imperial orders anymore.

131
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Father, it's a terrible lie to discriminate against such a infected person.

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If I continue to pretend not to see the same thing even if I get an oripathy,

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
will father be more important than being a soldier Ojokasti?

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Groas, you're not bad.

135
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Father, you didn't walk the right path either.

136
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You can't stop fighting.

137
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Their pain, resentment, sadness, their death, everything.

138
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They're all dead.

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They're all dead.

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They're all dead.

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They're all dead.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
They're all dead.

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They're all dead.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They're all dead.

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They're all dead.

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's okay now.

147
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Are you crying?

148
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Father is my number one family.

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It doesn't matter if you're a good or bad person.

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's okay if you can be with everyone.

151
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Elena, I couldn't do anything for you, my daughter.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Koutas's daughter!

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can't even beat her.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Can you stop this war, Tardis?

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Father, there's a lot of them.

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I won't let you die yet!

157
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're at your limit.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I know.

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Mr. Patriot, you've already fought enough.

160
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The End

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You've won.

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The End

163
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The key to stopping this age.

164
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Mr. Patriot...

165
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't be so sure.

166
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm not your daughter.

167
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I believe in the results of the war.

168
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I want you to be my witness.

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I want you to be worthy of being my successor.

170
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll take it.

171
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The End

172
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm here as one of Sarcas's witnesses.

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Bojo Castille, Castel's...

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're just going to be the scapegoats of others!

175
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're going to be killed!

176
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Don't kill them.

177
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Let them go.

178
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Then I'll give you a body that doesn't know pain.

179
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're going to make it a home?

180
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's not just a home.

181
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll give you my life.

182
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You can keep fighting forever.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll take on that deal.

184
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But I'll keep an eye on you.

185
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't want to be a coward yet.

186
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Go.

187
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Go.

188
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hey, I have a place I want to go.

189
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
His spirit and soul are no different from Wendigo's warm blood.

190
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I thank you, Captain.

191
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This is my last order.

192
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Live on. Keep walking.

193
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Keep walking.

194
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Make your own path.

195
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Make it yourself.

196
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This is enough.

197
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm the only one who's going to die.

198
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
My life is finally over.

199
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Mu...

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Helen...

201
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Groza...

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Helena...

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm finally...

204
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
at your side.

205
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No...

206
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What is this?

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Who is showing me an illusion?

208
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No, Amira!

209
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're the daughter of Koutatsu?

210
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The former commander of the Sarukazu army

211
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
showed you an illusion that you wanted as a reward for your soldiers.

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Are you the real one?

213
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Are you the Demon King?

214
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't want you to face this end.

215
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't want you to continue fighting for 200 years

216
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and lose everything.

217
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I want you to be more peaceful.

218
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
No!

219
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't need your consolation.

220
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If you want me to be peaceful,

221
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'll have to die.

222
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Be peaceful?

223
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
If you want to die, then die!

224
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If you want to be a fool, then be a fool!

225
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I lost to fate.

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This is fate.

227
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is the end I deserve.

228
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You're a young girl who believes in a happy ending, just like your daughter.

229
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I've been fighting for so long!

230
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Age doesn't matter.

231
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You should know.

232
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why are you here?

233
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You're the one who brought me back.

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You don't have the power to do that.

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you have the right to be the heir?

236
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Do you have the power to change this endless wasteland?

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Even if I can't do it alone,

238
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm not alone.

239
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Then change everything.

240
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You two must return to your fate.

241
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I will die in your hands, as predicted.

242
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
In the hands of the Demon King.

243
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Saka, Sarukas...

244
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I saw the destruction of the city of Yamata.

245
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,960
I saw the

246
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
enemy who was trying to destroy the city of Yamata.

247
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I saw the black dragon

248
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and the appearance of Nanji, who has a soul of 10 million.

249
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Nanji is the Demon King.

250
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He is the one who will bring the city of Yamata to its end.

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What?

252
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Don't listen to him.

253
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You've been fighting for your life.

254
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is the prophecy of Sarukas.

255
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
All prophecies will come true.

256
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The young Demon King will be the most terrifying demon.

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can't go either.

258
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Amira!

259
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You shouldn't kill her now.

260
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If things get crazy,

261
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
we should think about what will happen to her.

262
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What will happen to the future?

263
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The present is the truth, right?

264
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's walk together, Father.

265
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,000
tidak

266
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
zo

267
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
last

268
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
cut

269
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
sh gem

270
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
huh

271
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
huh

272
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Cough... Cough...

273
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What a terrible voice...

274
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Are you laughing?

275
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's impossible.

276
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I can't sing like you.

277
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I came to fulfill my promise, Taro.

278
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Are you worried that you won't come back?

279
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Shut up!

280
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Damn it, that stupid dragon...

281
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's okay.

282
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's Chen of the theory.

283
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If you're alive, you'll see her again.

284
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's the Shoukan's favorite word.

285
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What am I going to do with this play?

286
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I can't do it!

287
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You can't do it like that.

288
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Rin Yusha!

289
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I don't have any enemies.

290
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You're so tough.

291
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What's wrong with your usual behavior?

292
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Shut up!

293
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You're not stopping the stupid dragon,

294
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and you're being so stubborn.

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Maybe.

296
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But it can't be helped if you tell me to stop the old snow.

297
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If I'm alive, I'll see her again.

298
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I think so, too.

299
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I want to stop wasting his life.

300
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Shut up!

301
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Do you think we lost?

302
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Frost Nova's candy was spicy.

303
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Why did you do that?

304
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
She and Patriot acted on their own will until the end.

305
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Is it your own will to move you?

306
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Does it have more value than their lives?

307
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Enough.

308
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The captain was going to kill Tarla.

309
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
To prevent the organization from collapsing,

310
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
he broke the name of Rodos and made it his name.

311
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It was a plan to kill you.

312
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It seems that there are still no people who will obey Tarla.

313
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Without the captain, we will shoot her.

314
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Rodos and the Demon King.

315
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If you go astray, you will not be forgiven.

316
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Be prepared.

317
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
We're going to the capital.

318
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yes.

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
All my emotions disappeared.

320
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The last thing left was the fierce anger of fate.

321
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He was able to kill me, but he stopped.

322
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I heard the voice asking.

323
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I don't believe in fate.

324
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
My young Demon King, it is human to refuse.

325
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Where are you going, my King?

326
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He betrayed his master twice in his lifetime.

327
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He left Terezia and served the Ursa Empire.

328
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He turned the empire upside down and went to Tarla.

329
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And the third time, he won the curse that torments himself.

330
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He chose you.

331
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You are now in the depths of his heart, in the place where Tarla was.

332
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's probably the place where Frost Nova is.

333
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Until now, and in the future.

334
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He entrusted you with the future.

335
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
He chose to accept the difficulties, not to accept the difficulties.

336
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Let's end this war.

337
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Here.

338
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
For sure.
