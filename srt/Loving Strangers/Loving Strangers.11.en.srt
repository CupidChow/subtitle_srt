You've even joined the company dinner.

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,460
- Dongshan! - Come!

383
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,050
You're here?

384
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,770
Wrapping up so early today?

385
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,570
Sit!

386
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,010
Sit.

387
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,810
What are you doing?

388
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,330
This is... uh...

389
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,980
that...

390
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,700
Ai Youyou, right?

391
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,220
Yes.

392
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,050
Have a seat!

393
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,490
Please sit.

394
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,220
I remember you.

395
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,620
I once took my daughter

396
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,420
to see your show.

397
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,450
We really liked you!

398
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,390
- Thanks. - Hands...

399
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:05,790
Sit!

400
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,860
How come we haven't seen you act these years?

401
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,570
All thanks to Director Jiang earlier.

402
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,420
Never thought in my life

403
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,420
I'd meet someone from TV!

404
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,140
We're all neighbors.

405
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,330
We watched Jialu grow up

406
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,290
from when he was little.

407
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,420
And we've got a soccer team too.

408
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,250
Ding Zhe,

409
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,380
our team's Tony Leung.

410
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,140
Quit it!

411
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,860
Fei,

412
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,660
a chubby guy.

413
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,220
I'm the captain, Chi.

414
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,810
Shortest guy, best drinker!

415
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,980
Oh, shut it for a second.

416
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,530
This place is Ms. Dan's.

417
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,420
Everyone calls her Ms. Dan.

418
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,220
What "Ms. Dan"?

419
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,900
You're making me sound old.

420
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,290
I'm Chu Dan, the owner here.

421
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,140
Welcome.

422
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,290
Come on, let's all have a drink.

423
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,420
Welcome!

424
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,050
- Welcome! - Welcome!

425
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,980
Enjoy. I'm going back to work.

426
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,660
So tell us.

427
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,730
How did you two meet?

428
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,730
I acted in Director Jiang's film before.

429
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,770
Director Jiang even won awards,

430
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,700
you all know that, right?

431
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,980
Can you not bring that up here?

432
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,620
That short film was seriously brilliant!

433
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,380
After I watched it back then,

434
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,810
I swear, even in my dreams,

435
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,220
I wanted to be in his movie.

436
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,050
Then a month later,

437
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,490
my agent called me

438
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,050
and asked me to play the female lead

439
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,250
in Director Jiang's new film!

440
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,620
I'm telling you,

441
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,140
I was over the moon!

442
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,980
Every day I obsessed over the script.

443
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,220
And then...

444
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,980
first day of shooting, I was stunned.

445
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,620
One scene of mine

446
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,570
was shot dozens of times,

447
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,290
and it still didn't pass.

448
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,380
In the end, Director Jiang told me

449
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,250
to use my eyes

450
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,380
to scream without making a sound.

451
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,770
Chi, hey.

452
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,730
Look!

453
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,620
You all think that's weird, right?

454
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,810
Director Jiang had

455
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,660
a lot of weird ideas.

456
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,660
Every day I kept thinking,

457
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,980
what did he even mean?

458
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,250
And then...

459
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,250
the more I thought,

460
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,700
the less I got it,

461
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,290
the worse I acted.

462
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,810
It got to the point where

463
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,620
the moment I stood in front of the camera,

464
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,980
he'd frown.

465
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,530
And once he frowned,

466
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,770
I'd fall apart.

467
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,900
After about...

468
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,770
a month of shooting,

469
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,620
I developed this problem.

470
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,220
The second I see a camera,

471
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,980
I get scared.

472
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,010
Oh...

473
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,050
this hasn't gone away.

474
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,420
So I didn't dare take roles anymore.

475
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,860
Jialu, that's on you!

476
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,220
How could you treat her like that?

477
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,220
She couldn't act to begin with!

478
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,090
He said that about me too.

479
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,700
He ruined my confidence.

480
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,420
But I noticed

481
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,700
you're still happy

482
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,140
to see him.

483
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,050
Because a director hauling cargo in a van

484
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,940
is just too cute!

485
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,860
For a while,

486
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,290
I thought it was my problem.

487
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,620
But seeing the director

488
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,140
turn out like this,

489
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,380
maybe the problem was him,

490
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,420
not me.

491
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,660
If the director

492
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,660
made a blockbuster now,

493
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,290
I'd cry my eyes out.

494
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,530
Thank you, Director.

495
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,530
Thanks for making your life so pathetic.

496
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,940
Jialu!

497
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,570
Hello?

498
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:26,940
Where are you?

499
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,010
Out.

500
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,490
About that biotech company

501
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,770
you mentioned last time,

502
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,940
do you have any info?

503
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,530
Why ask all of a sudden?

504
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,090
Just want to take a look.

505
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,090
[Unknown number]

506
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,010
I still have something

507
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,660
to finish.

508
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,180
I'll give it to you when I get home.

509
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,620
Hello?

510
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,090
Anything else?

511
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,860
No.

512
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,250
Hello, who is this?

513
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,620
Sorry, wrong number.

514
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,530
Come on, kick it!

515
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,090
Dongshan,

516
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,900
can you be a little more ambitious?

517
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,010
Every time before we play,

518
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,490
you only think about the drinking after.

519
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,180
Can we not drink?

520
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,570
Oh, come on.

521
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,940
If you keep this up,

522
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,090
this team's done.

523
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,570
Isn't soccer just for

524
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,290
that post-game drink?

525
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,180
What's with you, Chi?

526
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,940
I got a cramp!

527
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,900
Who can sub in for me?

528
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,570
Oh!

529
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,980
Look...

530
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,730
you're getting old, huh?

531
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,050
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

532
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,090
You want eight of us

533
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,730
against nine of them?

534
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,050
We've lost five straight.

535
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,490
Lose again and no one will play us!

536
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,900
Jialu, sub in for me.

537
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,220
I can't. Not today.

538
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,330
Stop pretending. Hurry!

539
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,530
Harder.

540
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,860
My brother's here.

541
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,660
Let my brother play.

542
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,730
Jiaqi, hurry, sub in for me!

543
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,010
How is it?

544
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,980
Yeah, harder.

545
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:44,940
Feeling better?

546
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,530
Yeah.

547
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,730
Much better.

548
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,330
Go!

549
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,250
Charge!

550
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,730
Nice shot!

551
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,460
You can't stop him!

552
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,900
Nice!

553
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,180
This way!

554
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,320
Fall back!

555
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:14,940
Nice shot!

556
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,900
National Day break is coming up.

557
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,490
And add some annual leave,

558
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,980
we can take An

559
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,250
to Iceland to see the northern lights.

560
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,180
Why aren't you saying anything?

561
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,810
Don't you care?

562
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:31,900
Well,

563
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,810
I was going to take Mom out for a trip.

564
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,530
Then bring Mom with us.

565
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,700
She's scared of flying,

566
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,810
and she worries we'll spend a lot.

567
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,810
How would she agree?

568
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,420
Then what do we do?

569
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,010
How about we just travel around here?

570
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,730
It'll be lively with everyone together.

571
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,660
Honey,

572
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,490
just take me and An with you.

you've never forgiven yourself.

766
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,940
