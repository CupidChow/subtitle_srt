we shouldn't go public yet.

They told me to be careful.

417

When we met again,

you called me

431

"So beautiful."

572
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,170
"So beautiful."

573
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,570
This café seems pretty good.

574
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,920
Is that so?

577
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,080
I've got two coupons.

578
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,010
They're about to expire.

579
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,150
Hello, welcome.

580
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,420
- What can I get for you? - We're just looking.

581
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,300
A latte, please.

00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,270
One latte.

583
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,220
Americano is fine.

584
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,720
- You're the best. - Americano.

585
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,700
You're always helping me save money.

586
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,160
Large or medium?

587
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,800
Large.

588
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,640
Okay.

Thanks.

591

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,980
Pretty good.

610
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,880
I've been transferred to Chongjiang HQ.

611
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,610
