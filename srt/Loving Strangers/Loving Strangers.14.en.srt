who has helped me.

194
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,580
In my twenty-one years,

195
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,220
there have actually been many.

196
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,610
When they first heard

197
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,730
what I had been through,

198
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,220
they all felt sorry for me.

199
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,220
Some cried.

200
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,530
Some hugged me.

201
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,940
Others brought gifts.

202
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,820
As if they had a duty

203
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,220
to save my life.

204
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,530
Once.

205
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,700
Twice.

206
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,060
Three times.

207
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,770
After the third time,

208
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,820
they all left.

209
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,460
Maybe the novelty wore off.

210
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,370
A life like mine, with nothing at all,

211
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,700
is like a bottomless pit.

212
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,650
No matter what I do, it changes nothing.

213
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,370
They were all good people.

214
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,980
Anyone who helps you three times

215
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,460
is a good person.

216
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,610
Many would not even help once.

217
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,490
I have no right to pity you.

218
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,730
My life

219
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,010
is not any better than yours.

220
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,820
I only want a life that is calm and steady.

221
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,460
Even a wish this small

222
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,370
feels impossible to reach.

223
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,820
So I am not feeling sorry for you.

224
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,730
I genuinely want to thank you.

225
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,300
You were right earlier.

226
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,250
About the e-commerce gift cards,

227
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,220
it was Gu Chen.

228
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,250
If it were not for you,

229
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,530
I would have been pushed out long ago.

230
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,620
What do you plan to do next?

231
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,490
What else can I do?

232
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,290
Quit.

233
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,530
Why quit?

234
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,220
If giving it everything still fails,

235
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,730
then go all in and break it wide open.

236
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,050
Go report him to the Chairman.

237
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,220
It is not that simple.

238
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,700
The moment you expose him,

239
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,730
you splash filth all over yourself too.

240
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,090
There will be no good ending.

241
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,180
But you did nothing wrong.

242
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,810
The guilty ones

243
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,250
are the ones who should be punished.

244
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,570
That is just how life is.

245
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,420
We come into this world

246
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,010
to suffer for it.

247
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,050

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,180

Paralysis in the lower limbs.

275
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,530
Unable to care for daily needs.

276
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,380
As for the elderly person's children,

277
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,460
have they all passed away?

278
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,700
They fled over debts ten years ago.

279
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,050
There has been no news since.

280
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,620
Caring for the elderly alone

281
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,810
must be very hard.

282
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,770
We will review the materials as soon as possible.

283
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,860
Within five business days,

284
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,980
you will receive our response.

285
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,900
Chairman.

286
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,180
In addition to the on-site medical center,

287
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,940
we have also brought in nutritionists.

288
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,180
Based on each resident's condition,

289
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,180
we tailor meal plans.

290
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,670
Those admitted free of charge

291
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,700
are treated exactly the same.

292
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,490
Yes.

293
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,460
We do not give differential treatment.

294
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,900
You can rest assured.

295
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:32,900
Chairman.

296
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,250
It is a bit chilly out here.

297
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,380
Please wait a moment.

298
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,010
Get me a jacket.

299
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,330
No need.

300
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,940
Please put something on.

301
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,420
That will be all for today.

302
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,660
You can head back.

303
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,940
I will come again next time.

304
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,730
Let me ask you.

305
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,050
You and Jiang Jiaqi,

306
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,420
what exactly is going on?

307
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,700
You had better explain it clearly yourself.

308
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,770
I do not want

309
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,290
to hear it from someone else.

310
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,010
Mainly because

311
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,620
I contacted his wife privately.

312
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,810
He misunderstood it a bit.

313
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,010
About Director Jiang,

314
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,810
and his wife,

315
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,420
we were all schoolmates in college.

316
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,220
Last time,

317
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,010
because of the gift card bribery,

318
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,700
she was worried about him,

319
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,730
so she came to me.

320
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,010
She told me

321
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,490
Director Jiang is not that kind of person.

322
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,140
He would never do something like that.

323
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,770
We used to be close,

324
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,290
so I wanted to believe him.

325
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,420
We talked a few times.

326
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,180
You know

327
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,420
about this too, Chairman.

328
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,420
It's a sensitive matter,

329
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,700
and it involves company business.

330
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,250
So it really is not appropriate

331
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,770
for me to bring it up with Director Jiang.

332
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,660
As for his wife,

333
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,900
why did she not tell him herself?

334
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,570
My guess is,

335
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,900
she was afraid he would get angry.

336
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,900
After all, Director Jiang

337
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,010
has never liked me.

338
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,220
Why?

339
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,810
Was it not him who

340
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,730
recommended you to his mentor?

341
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,810
Yes.

342
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,530
His mentor

343
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,140
thought highly of me back then.

344
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,490
It could be

345
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,380
because of that.

346
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,330
When you are in the same field,

347
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,460
comparisons come easily.

348
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,770
Director Jiang's grades back then

349
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,620
were better than mine.

350
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,090
He also carried himself with more pride.

351
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,420
Later on I pulled ahead,

352
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,940
and in school I outshone him everywhere.

353
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,290
And then, by sheer irony,

354
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,330
once we entered the working world,

355
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,530
I ended up as his boss.

356
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,980
True.

357
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,860
Anyone would feel bitter about that.

358
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,220
Well,

359
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,900
that is understandable.

360
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,490
Chairman.

361
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,980
For the sake of the company,

362
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,090
I truly did not want

363
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,770
things to stay this way.

364
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,010
So I thought

365
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,330
I would swallow my pride

366
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,420
and take the initiative to make peace.

367
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,010
I never expected this outcome.

368
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,530
Fine. I will remember this lesson.

369
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,090
That is enough.

370
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,730
You and Wang Licheng

371
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,860
discuss it properly.

372
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,810
The position Pang Jian left

373
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,290
needs a replacement as soon as possible.

374
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,140
Rest assured.

375
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,090
Here.

376
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,620
All right. I will be going.

377
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,620
Take care.

378
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,090
I have been waiting for your update.

379
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,810
I called you and you did not answer.

380
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,570
All these days,

381
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,010
not even a single call back.

382
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,090
If you say you saw nothing,

383
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,090
I do not believe it.

384
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,860
I am sorry.

385
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,660
There have been many things at home lately.

386
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,730
Did you not ask me before

387
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,180
about Gu Chen's complex address?

388
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,980
What were you trying to confirm back then?

389
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,530
I must have been mistaken.

390
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,570
What did you see

391
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,900
that made you think you were mistaken?

392
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,140
In short, I did not see anything useful.

393
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,980
Are you sure?

394
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,010
Did you bring those photos?

395
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,730
Let me see them again.

396
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,380
I threw them away.

397
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,380
Why?

398
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,420
The Inspection Office searched my desk earlier.

399
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,250
They almost discovered them.

400
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,620
In the panic,

401
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,420
I disposed of them.

402
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,460
Jiang Jiaqi.

403
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,290
Have you lost your nerve?

404
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,330
Think whatever you want.

405
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,090
I just do not want

406
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,010
to keep digging into this.

407
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,420
Do not say I did not warn you.

408
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,900
Unless you side with Gu Chen,

409
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,180
this war is only just beginning.

410
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,860
I heard about what happened at the company dinner.

411
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,250
You two have already

412
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,250
fallen out completely, right?

413
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,420
Only one of you can survive.

414
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,810
Are you really willing to be eliminated like this?

415
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,010
What if you could vote him out

416
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,330
fair and square?

417
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,860
When you recommended it to me before,

418
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,980
I thought it was boring.

419
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,330
Now the more I watch, the better it gets.

420
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,530
Let us watch a few more episodes tonight.

421
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,810
Yijun.

422
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,140
I want to discuss something with you.

423
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,180
You know the old man

424
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,330
has been dealing with

425
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,660
this voting matter lately.

426
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,220
A lot of people are watching me.

427
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,250
If we keep meeting so often,

428
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,380
I am afraid there could be risks.

429
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,490
So?

430
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,380
So I was wondering

431
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,180
if we could stop seeing each other for a while.

432
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,250
For a while?

433
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,250
How long is that?

434
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,770
I do not know.

435
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,140
What about phone calls?

436
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,250
If something urgent comes up,

437
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,180
of course you can call.

438
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,570
Urgent?

439
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,380
I have to go.

440
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,770
It is so late. Where are you going?

441
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,940
To see the old man.

442
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:14,940
Wait.

443
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,700
At this hour,

444
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,050
do you really need to go whenever he calls?

445
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,620
I have no choice.

446
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,900
[All recordings]
Did you not ask me before

447
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,180
about Gu Chen's complex address?

448
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,980
What were you trying to confirm then?

449
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,900
I must have been mistaken.

450
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,140
What did you see

451
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,420
that made you think you were mistaken?

452
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,980
In short, I did not see anything useful.

453
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,810
Jiang Jiaqi.

454
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,330
Have you lost your nerve?

455
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,770
Think whatever you want.

456
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,570
Either way, I do not want

457
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,420
to keep digging into this.

458
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,700
You got pretty lucky.

459
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,420
Looks like he has made up his mind

460
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,770
to keep your affair with his wife buried.

461
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,490
If so, it will not pose a threat to you.

462
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,570
Then let us end it here.

463
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,660
What if he changes his mind?

464
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,900
Or gets drunk and starts talking?

465
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,420
You still have to keep listening.

466
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,180
Do I look that idle to you?

467
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,660
You will not be doing it for nothing.

468
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,770
Since you have been listening,

469
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,860
you should already know

470
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,010
we clashed at the camp.

471
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,180
Why did you not mention it?

472
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,860
Clashed?

473
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,050
Was that not just you

474
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,140
getting taught a lesson?

475
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,250
Do you really want me

476
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,940
to remind you again about something that embarrassing?

477
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,380
Then his investigation into Yunxi Residence,

478
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,770
you knew about that too, right?

479
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,330
He probably found it

480
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,380
by staking out Yunxi Residence.

481
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,290
But how he got

482
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,300
a lead on Yunxi Residence,

483
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,250
I cannot figure out either.

484
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,660
I did not hear him mention it to anyone on the recording.

485
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,490
Pay closer attention from now on.

486
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,330
Do not miss

487
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,290
information this important.

[Vice GM, Gao Jiming]

491
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,250
I heard you

492
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,010
went to the campsite.

493
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,330
Did the Chairman invite you?

494
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,810
No.

495
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,490
Then who gave you the right?

496
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,380
What makes you think you had the right

497
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,490
to go there on your own?

498
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,010
Just because the Chairman said

499
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,690
he would treat you to a meal,

500
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,900
you thought that gave you the right

501
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,570
to pull something

502
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,560
this far out of line?

503
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,460
Ridiculous.

504
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,180
Shallow.

505
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,620

Nothing to say now?

507
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,630
Do you think I am stupid,

508
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,980
or that I am easy to push around?

509
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,290
You actually dared to step over me

510

and show up at the campsite yourself.

And now the Chairman happens to like you,

00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,860
What exactly do you think you are?

572
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,340
You're nothing but a spineless coward,

573

575
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,690
You say you hate me.

576
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,300
Or are you jealous of me?

577
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,570
You never fought for it yourself.

578
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,340
You deserve to lose it to someone else.

579

586
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,090
who loses more in the end.

00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,380
