00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,100
at the bar last time.

193
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,130
What happened?

194
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,340
Start from the beginning.

195
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,100
I lost 200k. Hurry!

196
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,130
Two hundred thousand?

197
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,650
How did you get that much?

198
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,890
Stop asking. Just go!

199
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,980
What's the matter? I was half asleep!

200
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,820
This is huge!

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,180
How huge?

202
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,610
What does she look like again?

203
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,300
Tell me.

204
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,490
Small face, braid.

205
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,650
Not this one!

206
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,490
She's not that chubby!

207
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,420
You can't even remember?

208
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,850
Enough, stop looking.

209
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,490
Go to the back!

210
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,770
I'll watch. You grab her.

211
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,300
Didn't recognize her, did you?

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,580
You let her slip.

213
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,420
You definitely didn't recognize her!

214
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,940
I'm a film director.

215
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,420
You think I can't remember a face?

216
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,770
If you hadn't dragged your feet

217
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,490
getting out the door,

218
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,420
would we be late?

219
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,420
And you say I didn't recognize her?

220
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,770
I dragged my feet?

221
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,770
Hey, Jiang Jialu!

222
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,130
That's how you talk to your uncle?

223
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,220
I'm your elder!

224
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,580
You're just getting old.

225
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,370
How could I not recognize her?

226
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,100
You calling me old?

227
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,490
Time to eat.

228
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,820
Why'd we move out?

229
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,650
Did something happen?

230
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,180
Nothing.

231
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,700
It's closer to my jobs here.

232
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,580
We'll go back in a few days.

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,340
Jiaqi, do you need 200k?

234
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,100
How'd you get set up

235
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,770
over 200k?

236
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:14,890
Fine.

237
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,770
If he screwed us,

238
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,820
then that money should've been

239
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,730
in our pocket, right?

240
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,700
Jiaqi, I don't get it.

241
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,650
Why didn't you

242
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,130
turn it in right away?

243
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,310
Does saying this now help?

244
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,490
It's gone.

245
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,430
Yeah, gone.

246
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,820
Everything's gone.

247
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,580
No matter how broke we were,

248
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,490
we still had you

249
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,420
working at a big company.

250
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,010
Our mom could still hold her head up.

251
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,770
Now look.

252
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,610
Mom comes home,

253
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,940
and sees three jobless middle-aged men.

254
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,940
We're finished!

255
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,180
It's fine.

256
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,490
You still have me.

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,770
Yeah, you!

258
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,250
Didn't you tell my mom

259
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,530
to mortgage the house?

260
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,580
Take the money out!

261
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,890
Help my brother

262
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,820
buy those cards back

263
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,850
and fix this mess.

264
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,490
What's that attitude of yours?

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,610
I was just bullshitting about MLM.

266
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,490
How could I

267
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,770
really let my sister mortgage her house?

268
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,370
Besides,

269
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,610
the e-commerce cards you buy

270
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,610
will have different numbers.

271
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,490
If they trace it,

272
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,420
it'll be even harder to explain!

273
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,250
Weren't you saying we had you,

274
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,890
that you'd be there?

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,220
So tell me, what do we do now?

276
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,220
What do you think we do?

277
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,820
How old are you?

278
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,580
Are you a kid?

279
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,420
Enough. Stop fighting.

280
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,600
I never should've told you two.

281
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,370
Jiaqi!

282
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,700
I'm not done, Jiaqi.

283
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,370
Where are you going?

284
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,060
Home.

285
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,100
I'll wait at the company gate for her tomorrow.

286
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,100
Who took the money and still goes to work?

287
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,250
She said she didn't take it.

288
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,300
So what's she afraid of?

289
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,340
What if she doesn't show?

290
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,100
[Yijun]

291
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,100
Pick up.

292
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,580
Hello?

293
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,890
I'm off work.

294
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,730
I'll swing by and pick you up.

295
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,650
No need. I'll walk back.

296
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,650
Oh, come get me.

297
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,420
I'm across from the supermarket on Qingxi Road.

298
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,370
Okay. Ten minutes.

299
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,700
Okay.

300
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,250
What's the matter?

301
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,980
Where are you headed?

302
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,250
What were you just doing?

303
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,650
Unbelievable.

304
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,370
At a time like this,

305
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,490
you still feel like eating?

306
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,820
It's for your wife.

307
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,530
She loves the seafood here.

308
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,700
Jiaqi,

309
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,820
the more it's like this,

310
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,610
the better you should treat your wife.

311
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,850
You've got to keep her close.

312
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,610
If something really blows up,

313
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,530
at least you still have a home.

314
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,980
Steam it with water for five minutes.

315
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,980
Got it?

316
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,730
Five minutes.

317
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,180
Too short, it won't cook through.

318
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,610
Too long, it gets tough and chewy.

319
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,940
You waited on Auntie

320
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,730
like this too, right?

321
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,100
I learned it from taking care

322
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,850
of my girl.

323
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,840
Why would I wait on her?

324
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,300
Humph...

[Sen'an Pharma]

326
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,180
Jiang Jiaqi

327
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,300
is screwed.

328
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,980
The Inspection Office has it all figured out?

329
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,060
He won't cough up the cards.

330
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,650
Then this whole thing

331
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,250
is basically case closed.

332
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,980
Always acting all high and mighty,

333
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,980
who would've thought

334
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,180
that over 200k,

335
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,620
he'd show his true colors.

336
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,250
I just feel like

337
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,250
something's off.

338
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,810
If he really didn't want the money,

339
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,530
he should've returned it right away

340
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,050
to the Inspection Office.

341
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,860
What if he returns it?

342
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,050
That just makes the bribery look even more real.

343
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,810
He takes the 200k,

344
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,860
then returns it once there's an investigation.

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,940
You think he's that stupid?

346
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,730
Either way,

347
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,050
he's not getting out of this.

348

He has to go.

349
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,090
Don't be so sure.

350
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,700
Ever since

351
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,090
Jiang Jiaqi voted no at the SA-0988 meeting,

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,660
Wang Licheng took him as one of his own.

Those people won't just sit and watch.

354
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,180
If this case isn't airtight,

355
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,290
and they bite back,

356
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,290
that could happen too.

357
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,990
But him taking the money

358
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,940
is solid, right?

00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,490
If you're worried

360
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,180
Wang will stir things up,

361
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,730
maybe we should meet early

362
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,860
and make it official.

363
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,180
Go back to work. I'll consider it.

00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,220
Now the company is investigating.

381
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,730
What cards?

382
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,860
Who did it?

383
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,660
I don't know either.

384
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,180
Just go on.

385
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,810
I still have a work call

386
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,700
I missed earlier.

387
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,730
Hello?

388
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,980
What's with the e-commerce cards?

389
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,770
I was just about to tell you.

390
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,730
He got a pack of e-commerce cards yesterday.

391
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,220
Today the Inspection Office

392
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,250
went to check,

393
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,660
and that pack was gone.

394
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,660
Wait.

395
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,180
How did they

396
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,140
even know about the cards?

397
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,770
They got an anonymous tip-off letter.

398
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,770
He'd just gotten the cards,

399
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,010
then someone reported him.

400
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,770
That wasn't you, was it?

401
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,700
Believe it or not,

402
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,220
that wasn't what I meant.

403
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,290
But something went wrong,

404
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,620
and he got dragged into it.

405
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,380
That wasn't...

406
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,290
What do you mean?

407
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,860
Gu Chen, I'm going to divorce him.

408
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,860
But you need

409
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,730
to give me time.

410
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,980
Can you not blow this up?

411
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,900
I think we can

412
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,980
use this chance

413
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,090
to get him out of Sen'an.

414
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,140
We had to take that step sooner or later.

415
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,940
He leaves Sen'an first,

416
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,730
then you divorce.

417
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,660
That's more reasonable,

418
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,330
and better for all three of us.

419
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,050
What do you think?

420
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,490
You want him

421
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,530
to walk away without explanation,

422
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,810
then have me divorce him right away?

423
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,980
Do you have a better plan?

424
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,730
Now the key point is,

425
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,090
those cards are gone.

426
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,730
Yeah. He's freaking out too.

427
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,860
Could it be

428
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,700
he really took them?

429
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,330
No. No way.

430
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,330
At least confirm it.

431
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,250
Jialu and Uncle

432
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,570
are really okay?

433
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,730
You think

434
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,940
if something's wrong with them,

435
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,220
I'd take those cards?

436
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,980
That's not what I meant.

437
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,810
I'm just thinking,

438
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,620
those cards

439
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,220
vanished out of nowhere.

440
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,330
What on earth happened?

441
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,620
I told you I don't know.

442
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,700
You should've turned them in

443
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,620
right away.

444
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,770
I wanted to figure out

445
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,660
what was going on first.

446
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,940
Who sent them?

447
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,860
Was it a mistake?

448
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,140
Should I return them?

449
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,960
But the label only had my name.

450
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,140
I had zero clues.

451
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I planned to turn them in

452
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,770
this morning.

453
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,420
But when I got to work,

454
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,770
they were already gone.

455
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,900
Maybe you should just leave.

456
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,140
I warned you ages ago.

457
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,730
This isn't that simple.

458
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,810
Sen'an is a snake pit.

459
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,730
You're not built for it.

460
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,920
I just don't get it.

461
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,180
Why can't you leave?

462
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,660
It's not like you're incapable.

463
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,420
One step forward,

464
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,380
and you'll have chances everywhere.

465
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,900
Why stay there and suffer?

466
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,420
In your whole life,

467
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,050
can't you accept

468
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,050
even a tiny change?

469
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,530
Even if I leave,

470
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,730
I can't leave holding the bag.

471
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,490
I need an answer.

472
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,340
[Sen'an Pharma]

473
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,380
Did you take them or not?

474
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,090
If you're in trouble,

475
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,730
I can help.

476
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,770
Just give me the cards back.

477
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,010
I tossed them.

478
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,730
Zhou Yu'an, think this through.

479
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,010
This is your last chance.

480
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,980
I'm going upstairs now

481
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,250
to tell everything, start to finish.

482
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,290
If I can't clear my name,

483
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,490
don't think you'll walk away clean...

484
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,780
[To Mr. Chun: Have you given it to Pang Jian? Hurry.]

485
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,490
I did receive that pack,

486
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,530
but I really didn't take them.

487
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,900
I know you didn't.

488
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,980
We've been friends for over ten years.

489
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,220
I know your character quite well.

490
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,570
But why didn't you

491
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,050
come to me first?

492
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,140
You don't even trust me?

493
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,660
In this whole company,

494
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,380
you're the only one I trust.

495
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,050
I just panicked then.

496
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,700
I wanted to get it straight first.

497
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,290
Then tell me,

498
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,900
who sent you those cards?

499
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,050
You really don't know?

500
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,220
Jiaqi,

501
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,140
do you know?

502
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,620
From day one,

503
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,050
when I hired you at Sen'an,

504
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,860
I've already treated you

505
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,810
as my own.

506
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,220
All these years,

507
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,700
you never came to me for help.

508
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,490
But this time,

509
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,730
give it to me.

510
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,420
I'll handle it for you.

511
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,250
[Main Conference Room]
I called everyone here today

512
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,490
to talk it over

513
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,490
about Director Jiang's case,

514
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,380
and how to handle it.

515
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,290
It's pretty clear.

516
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,180
The day before yesterday,

517
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,600
Director Jiang received a parcel.

518
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,140
CCTV caught it all.

519
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,770
That night,

520
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,530
He came back to the office.

521
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,660
I ran into him.

522
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,420
He said he was grabbing files.

523
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,570
Let Director Jiang return to work.

524
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,330
What are you saying?

525
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,010
I'm not even done.

526
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,700
You want to put PV in the hands

527
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,490
of someone who took bribes?

528
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,380
PV is drug vigilance,

529
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,220
and it's the company's bottom line.

530
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,140
You say

531
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,380
he took 200k in e-commerce cards.

532
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,420
Where are the cards?

533
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,900
He did come back.

534
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,420
But I checked the CCTV.

535
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,940
It shows you were with him the whole time.

536
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,050
Did you see him take anything?

537
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,380
Only an idiot would take them in front of me.

538
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,380
And isn't it convenient?

539
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,940
The power went out that night.

540
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,570
Before he ran into me,

541
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,140
he had plenty of time to take them.

542
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,180
So,

543
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,490
you still have no proof

544
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,140
that he took

545
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,860
your so-called cards,

546
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,220
right?

547
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,620
No, I don't have proof.

548
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,090
Anyway, they're not with me.

549
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,860
So where are they?

550
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,700
You'll have to ask Director Jiang.

551
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,620
No need.

552
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,860
The cards are with me.

553
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,330

This morning,

556
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,050
a janitor turned this in.

557
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,900
You can go now.

558
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,180
There's definitely something fishy.

559
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,330
No matter what,

560
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,220
save him first.

561
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,180
This pack of cards

562
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,090
was found by the janitor

563
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,700
while taking out the trash that night.

564
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,330
He thought it was nothing,

565
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,490
so he tossed it aside.

566
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,900
The next day he opened it,

567
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,050
and found it was all e-commerce cards.

568
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,010
Director Jiang did come back

569
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,380
that night,

570
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,220
but not to take the cards.

571
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,900
He came to throw them away.

572

575
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,730
I tossed them.

576
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,380
You threw them away?

577
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,770
Why would you do that, Director Jiang?

578
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,770
Why not hand them to the Inspection Office?

579
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,220
The moment they showed up, they asked,

580
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,140
"Where are the 200k e-commerce cards?"

581
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,700
Let me ask you.

582
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,530
Did you count them when you got them?

583
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,620
I heard it from Director Su

584
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,660
that it was 200k.

585
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,510
I knew it because yesterday morning,

586
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,250
we received a tip-off letter.

587
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,770
It stated the amount.

588
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,330
Everyone.

589
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,180
Listen.

590
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,290
He just got the cards,

591
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,050
and the next day the Inspection Office got

592
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,810
a detailed tip-off letter.

593
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,980
Doesn't that

594
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,490
look exactly like a trap?

595
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,660
Good thing he didn't hand them in then.

596
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,940
Otherwise,

597
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,180
he might've ended up caught red-handed,

598
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,700
with no way to explain it.

599
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,420
Stop taking cheap shots.

600
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,380
Did he throw them away willingly,

601
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,180
or did he toss them

602
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,940
because of the investigation?

603
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,090

607
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,010
Yesterday he was under investigation all day,

608
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,220
or in the PV Dept.

609
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,530

610

614
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,010

don't reach so far.

617
