00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,180
She owes me a lot of money.

193
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,420
It was about a month ago.

194
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,240
She came to me

195
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,840
with a manila envelope,

196
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,890
and said she wanted to pay everything off at once.

197
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,400
When I opened it,

198
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,650
it was full of gift cards.

199
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,770
I thought it was strange.

200
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,650
Then I noticed

201
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,770
there was writing on the bag.

202
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,550
[To Jiang Jiaqi]

203
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,420
Jiang Jiaqi.

204
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,060
Right then, I suspected the money

205
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,770
wasn't legitimate.

206
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,650
I planned to hold onto it first,

207
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,770
then call the police.

208
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,890
But she grabbed the bag and ran.

209
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,130
Later, by chance,

210
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,340
I heard she worked at Sen'an Pharma.

211
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,580
I couldn't believe it.

212
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,370
So I looked it up online.

213
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,250
That's when I saw your name.

214
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,420
Those gift cards,

215
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,730
you got them all back, right?

216
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,250
Since I'm going to the police,

217
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,030
I figured she'd have to

218
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,850
keep a lower profile.

219
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,250
That woman has sticky fingers.

220
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,340
She'll resort to anything.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,530
I think you'd better be careful.

222
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,690

Young man.

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,370
What medicine are you pushing?

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,940
We're not selling anything.

227
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,730
We're here to promote safe medication use.

228
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,370
Is this free to take?

229
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,010
Yes.

230
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,780
You just need to answer a few questions

231
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,220
about your medication habits.

232
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,070
Okay, no problem.

233
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,580
Go ahead.

234
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,160
So,

235
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,250
what medicines do you usually take?

236
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:28,980
Young man,

237
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,890
look at your hands. They're red from the cold.

238
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,820
Why aren't you wearing gloves?

239
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,250
You have great taste, miss.

240
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,650
This is one of our newest arrivals.

241
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,770
It's handmade lambskin.

242
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,530
Is it for your boyfriend?

243
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,940
Take me out to dinner.

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,340
Next time.

245
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,250
Everything makes sense now.

246
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,530
First,

247
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,770
she stole the cards,

248
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,180
but then she threw them away.

249
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,420
That means she wasn't after money.

250
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,180
She only had one reason for doing this.

251
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,820
To protect you.

252
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,060
Thank you.

You're back.

262
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,940
Need me to pick anything up?

263
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,010
No.

264
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:45,890
You...

265
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,580
Could you please stop

266
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,460
asking me what I need you to bring?

267
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,180
You ask me every day

268
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,250
what to bring, what to buy.

269
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,200

what I actually need.

271
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,980
When were you going to tell me about that?

272
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,940
I mean, about you being a Vice GM candidate.

273
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,370
Mom called me.

274
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,250
She told me about it.

275
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,650
I'm only a candidate.

276
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,580
I was afraid I wouldn't get picked,

277
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,340
so I didn't tell you.

278

I'm sorry.

Don't.

I really didn't expect this.

You actually called me.

292
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,340
You called my company, didn't you?

293
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,180
Your company?

294
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,010
What?

You've only been a temp for a few days.

the kind of person you are.

301
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,650
Did he start to keep his distance?

302
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,650
I warned you, didn't I?

303
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,370

Stars that seem so close,

yet can never reach each other.

[Zhou Yu'an's Contract Staff Resume]
They say Jiang Jiaqi picked her

320
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,530
personally.

321
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,810
She's just a contractor.

322

What's the issue?

323
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,770
Sure, we have lower standards

324
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,050
for contractors.

325
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,770
But Sen'an Pharma is still

326
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,420
one of the top companies in the industry.

327
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,090
This resume

328
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,570
is simply below the bare minimum.

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,050
Her "special skill" is running,

330
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,420
and she barely went to school.

331
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,860
It's strange

332
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,730
that someone like her got picked.

333
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,940
But the PV people told me

334
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,530
that Jiang Jiaqi

335
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,810
has been taking very good care of her.

336
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,620
So I figured

337
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,980
something must be off.

Don't worry about that.

It's pointless, understood?

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,050

I thought that was strange too.

356
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,150
It's because Jiang Jiaqi

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,120

covering for her.

That explanation of yours

397
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,050

that Boss already knew her before,

409
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,260

410
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,330

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,490
About your relationship with Gu Chen,

568
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,770
Jiang Jiaqi has known about it long ago.

569
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,940
Yu'an's father

570
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,740
was addicted to gambling.

571
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,980
He borrowed money everywhere to gamble,

572
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,820
and could never repay it.

573
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,690
Yu'an was still very young back then.

574
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,050
Her family

575
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,420
was already deep in debt.

576
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,210
At the time,

577
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,650
I was also one of his creditors.

578
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,570
I heard both parents had run away,

579
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,420
so I went to their place

580
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,820
to see if there was anything left

581
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,050
that could be used to settle the debt.

582
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,690
There has been nothing of value left in their home

583
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,780
for a long time.

584
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,460
But when I arrived,

585
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,490
I saw Yu'an and her grandmother.

586
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,570
They were being beaten by Chen Ren's father.

587
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,650
Your son

588
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,820
[IOU]
owed me money.

589
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,980
But he's nowhere to be found.

590
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,260
He pushed me into a dead end!

591
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,460
Get up!

592
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,490
Tell me where your father is!

593
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,260
It was only at the police station that I learned

594
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,130
that day

595
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,050
was Yu'an's birthday.

596
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,490
So I went to a cake shop

597
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,570
and bought her a cake.

598
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,820
These photos

599
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,260
were taken around that time.

600
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,210
Back then, Yu'an was only 15.

601
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,170
She told me

602
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,900
she would definitely pay the money back.

603
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,860
She kept working nonstop to repay the debts.

604
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,130
She did repay

605
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,380
my money.

606
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,740
But the money owed to Chen Ren's father

607
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,010
could never be fully paid off.

608
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,780
After Chen Ren's father died,

609
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,820
it was Chen Ren

610
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,530
who continued pressing for repayment.

611
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,610
When Yu'an could not pay,

612
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,300
he took it out on her.

613
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,010
He threatened her grandmother.

614
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,300
To Yu'an,

615
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,530
the person she cared about most

616
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,090
was her grandmother.

617
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,420
At that time,

618
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,610
she did consider using those cards to settle the debt.

619
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,010
But that was because

620
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,010
she truly had no other option.

621
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,490
She was pushed to the edge,

622
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,420
and

623
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,650
still has family who depends on her care.

624
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,900
But

625
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,010
once she realized

626
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,780
the other party's intent,

627
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,610
she immediately brought them to me.

628
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,900
She asked me to return them right away.

629
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,300
Sir,

630
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,090
please show some mercy

631
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,260
and let her off.

632
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,980
Do you have that person's address?

633
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,380
Are you Chen Ren?

634
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,460
How much does Zhou Yu'an owe you?

635
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,300
I will pay it off for her.

636
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,260
What are you talking about?

637
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,900
You are paying on her behalf?

638
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,090
Yes.

639
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,490
Are you out of your mind?

640
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,380
What did she say to you

641
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,740
to make you come here playing the hero?

642
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,380
Let me make this clear.

643
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,170
That woman deceived you.

644
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,170
Enough talk.

645
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,610
Just tell me the amount.

646
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,740
Are you bewitched or something?

647
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,490
Do you understand the term "mind control"?

648
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,130
You have been manipulated!

649
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,490
Why pay for someone like her?

650
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,780
Watch your language.

651
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,300
How much?

652
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,490
I do not accept payments made on someone else's behalf.

653
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,090
And, one more thing.

654
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,780
I will not let Zhou Yu'an off.

655
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,900
Do you understand?

656
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,210
Leave.

657
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,010
Why will you not let her off?

658
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,130
Look at the life she is living.

659
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,010
Why treat her this way?

660
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,090
Is there no conscience left in you?

661
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,560
I truly do not understand.

662
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,150
What does her situation

663
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,340
have to do with you?

664
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,090
She's a worthless piece of trash.

665
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,490
What are you doing?

666
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,530
You haven't finished your work yet.

667
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,660
[Loving Strangers]

668
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,300
Before this,

669
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,900
I truly disliked

670
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,300
these struggles for power and gain.

671
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,940
But now, I understand.

672
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,300
I will become the Vice GM.

673
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,380
I do not care what methods you use.

674
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,010
Before the election, Jiang Jiaqi

675
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,170
must be eliminated.

676
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,340
I came here today to make this clear.

677
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,860
If you dare to harm him,

678
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,740
in any way,

679
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,420
you will pay the price.

680
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,460
