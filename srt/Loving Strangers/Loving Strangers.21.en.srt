I have no feelings.

139

But seeing someone good like him,

140
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,460
I just want to ruin him.

141
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,340
Maybe I hope he becomes

143

So why is it like this?

170
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,940
Doesn't it feel unfair?

171
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,220
Maybe you should've just run away

172
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,490
like I did before.

173
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,820
I thought all along

174
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,300
that if I held on,

everyone would be happy.

176
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,420
You've stuck it out for most of your life,

177
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,370
and who's happy in the end?

178
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,060
It's all just excuses.

179
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,460
If you tell your son An

180
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,850
that you kept going just for him,

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,980
what will he think?

182
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,420
Buddy,

183
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,850
failure is just failure.

184
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,300
Stop making excuses.

185
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,730
But isn't this how everyone lives?

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,420
Yeah.

187
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,730
Then let An live like this too.

188
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,730
That's not going to happen.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,700

190
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,890

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,980
Why?

193
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,940
You need to be happy first.

194
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,460
Once you're happy,

195
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,700
you'll have the ability to make others happy.

196
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,300
I don't care what reason you use,

197
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,700
but break up with her as soon as possible.

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,530
And also,

199
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,300
don't let her know

200
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,300
what I know.

201
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,250
He knows everything.

202
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,460
Stop contacting me.

203
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,610
Can you understand me?

204
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,890
Tell me, do you hate me

205
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,940
or are you jealous of me?

206
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,940
Jealous of me doing

207
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,980
what you're too afraid to do?

208
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,820
If you don't fight for it,

209
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,730
then you deserve to have it taken away.

210
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,060
Jiaqi,

211
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,340
you're weighing yourself down too much.

212
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,890
You need to be happy first.

213
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,460
Then you'll have the ability to make others happy.

214
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,770
What did I tell you?

215
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,980
How did Yijun find out?

216
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,390
I have just one request from you.

217
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,490
Can't you even do this?

218
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,400
What's going on?

219
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,510
Jiang Jiaqi,

220
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,370
what are you doing in there?

221
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,940
Why are you locking the door?

222
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,490
What are you doing?

223
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,750
[CEO Gu Chen]

224
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,530
Jiang Jiaqi!

225
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,130
Jiang Jiaqi!

226
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,060
She already knows!

227
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,700
She came and questioned me!

228
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,250
You're done for.

229
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,130
What are you doing?

230
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,370
Jiang Jiaqi!

231
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,130
There was a little misunderstanding

232
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,820
between Director Jiang and me.

233
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,250
We've cleared it up.

234
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,940
I hope no one blames him.

235
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,980
And that it doesn't affect the work.

236
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,940
Is this even allowed?

237
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,460
In the company,

238
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,820
going after your superior openly!

239
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,650
That's personal revenge.

240
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,940
Just fire him.

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,820
Now, if we fire Director Jiang,

242
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,980
that would be true personal revenge.

243
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,890
I can overlook this matter.

244
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,530
But I hope some people

245
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,300
can be more straightforward.

246
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,850
Don't pull any shady moves

247
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,100
and investigate me behind my back.

248
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,250
Yes, I know

249
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,060
Director Jiang's wife.

250
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,770
Because we were schoolmates.

251
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,940
We met up, had a few chats.

252
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,610
What's the problem with that?

253
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,460
Why secretly take photos of us?

254
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,220
As if there's some affair

255
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,490
going on between us,

256
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,940
making Director Jiang

257
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,530
cause a scene today.

258
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,180
What's the point?

259
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,890
Well, I don't know

260
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,700
who's pulling shady moves.

261
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,490
But I have to clarify something.

262
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,180
Currently,

263
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,650
the list of candidates has been published,

264
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,340
and the Chairman has been informed.

265
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:49,980
At this point,

266
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,250
if we take down Director Jiang,

267
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,130
we need

268
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,980
to get everything cleared up,

269
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,300
all the facts.

270
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,650
It's only right to give a proper explanation.

271
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,010
Investigate, no problem.

272
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,730
A clear conscience needs no defense.

273
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,940
Mr. Gu already said,

274
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,100
this is a private misunderstanding.

275
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,340
A private misunderstanding

276
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,890
shouldn't affect company affairs.

277
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,650
Who did it?

278
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,370
It wasn't me.

279
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,490
It wasn't me either.

280
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,580
Could it be...?

281
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,130
Yeah.

282
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,420
Just say I did it.

283
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,010
Get Director Jiang to sign this.

284
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,010
Zhou Yu'an.

285
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,380
Where are my gloves?

286
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,220
I threw them away.

287
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,940
Why did you throw them away?

288
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,620
Don't I have the right

289
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,620
to accept your gift?

290
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,570
Am I that terrible to you?

291
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,860
Would you even wear them if I kept them?

292
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,010
Tomorrow, when work starts,

293
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,980
fire me.

294
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,660
You have to say it

295
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,700
in front of everyone.

296
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,180
Say I kissed you forcibly,

297
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,010
and I confessed to you.

298
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,680
You only helped me a few times

299
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,050
because you felt sorry for me.

300
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,490
It's me who kept pestering you.

301
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,490
You couldn't escape.

302
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,810
This is all the truth.

303
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,660
I'm serious.

304
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,870
Given this situation,

305
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,010
and us seeing each other every day,

306
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,180
it's pretty awkward, right?

307
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,810
I'm just a contract staff.

308
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,940
It's the same wherever I work.

309
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,940
I'll leave eventually.

310
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,180
Just fire me.

311
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,980
Don't make it hard for yourself at work...

312
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,660
That's not going to happen!

313
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,530
Just because of what you said,

314
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,570
you want me to fire you?

315
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,980
Am I that childish?

316
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,460
What if I fire you?

317
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,700
What if we run into each other on the street later?

318
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,220
Should we act like strangers,

319
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,140
pretending we don't know each other?

320
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,730
Sorry, I can't do that.

321
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,530
Just imagining

322
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,180
that awkwardness

323
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,180
makes me feel uncomfortable.

324
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,090
My life

325
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,330
has already been through too much.

326
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,570
I don't want our relationship to end up like that.

327
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,220
Stop overthinking.

328
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,570
Just stay.

329
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,010
I'll let go

330
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,460
of all the unpleasantness between us.

331
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,420
I'll treat you normally,

332
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,330
just like any other colleague.

333
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,620
I'll also make sure

334
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,660
they treat you better,

335
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,050
stop being so hard on you.

336
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,460
So you need to work hard too.

337
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,490
You need to learn

338
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,660
and get along with people well.

339
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,380
Stop pulling that sour face

340
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,980
in front of others.

341
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,290
You don't have any enemies here, right?

342
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,730
Even if you really want to leave,

343
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,330
I'll make sure

344
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,140
you fulfill your contract first.

345
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,490
That way, you'll get

346
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,220
a good review.

347
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,900
When you join another company,

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,220
they'll take you seriously.

349
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,980
Got it?

350
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,460
Only then,

00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,420
and our debts are paid off.

382
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,290
Why not stay out of sight for a while?

383
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,770
A few tens of thousands

384
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,900
is simply nothing

385
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,700
to people like them.

386
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,490
If you leave now,

387
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,660
they won't do anything to you.

388
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,180
Staying at this company

389
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,050
right now

390
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,010
is what's really dangerous.

391
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,570
It's almost over.

392
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,700
I want to stay and wait for the result.

393
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,260
[Galaxy Tavern]

394
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,700
Look at how hungry you are.

395
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,290
So delicious!

396
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,950
Eat up!

397
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,660
There's more coming!

398
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,460
[Ai Youyou]

399
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,730
This is heaven.

400
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,010
This is

401
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,090
the taste of first love.

402
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,050
The first time

403
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,050
I asked a girl out

404
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,510
[Ai Youyou]

405
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,420
we had oysters.

406
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,900
After the oysters,

407
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,980
we sat by a quiet roadside,

408
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,420
held hands,

409
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,980
then went lips to lips...

410
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,530
Jialu, eat while it's warm.

411
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,810
Go ahead.

412
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,810
Still reminiscing?

413
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,660
First love, huh?

414
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,730
Your first love would be disgusted

415
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,380
to see you live like this.

416
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,570
Hey, are you on something?

417
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,340
Isn't that

418
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,900
how you eat oysters?

419
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,090
You just snap back

420
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,330
at everything I say?

421
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,700
Which one of you

422
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,180
has the contact info for that actress?

423
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,180
Online ones are fine.

424
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,900
Hurry and get that girl over here.

425
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,620
Or Jialu will go crazy tonight!

426
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,490
Yao Dongshan,

427
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,330
are you done yet?

428
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,270
Come on.

429
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,350
[Ai Youyou: I'm home, so tired.]
- Drink up. - Cheers.

430
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,380
[I'm resting now.]
- Come on. - That's more like it.

431
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,400
Come on.

432
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,530
You're wasting time replying to texts.

433
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,460
If I were you,

434
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,460
I'd just go find her!

435
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,010
Jialu?

436
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,420
Right!

437
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,180
Jialu?

438
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,220
What's going on?

439
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,090
Didn't you say on the phone

440
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,180
that everything was going smoothly?

441
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,290
Sorry.

442
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,700
I still can't make it.

443
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,180
The director criticized you?

444
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,220
He's not even criticizing me anymore.

445
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,700
He won't coach me either.

446
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,900
Every day it's the B-team director

447
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,220
dragging me along to catch up.

448
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,940
But I still don't get recognized.

449
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,980
They say my lines aren't good enough,

450
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,940
and my moves are stiff.

451
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,940
They cut my scenes every day,

452
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,900
rewrite my parts.

453
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,490
They've almost cut me out.

454
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,980
Every morning,

455
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,140
on my way to set,

456
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,220
it feels like I'm walking to my execution.

457
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,620
Why am I so useless?

458
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,290
I'm full.

459
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,220
[Ai Youyou
Let's go out for dinner tonight.]

460
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,660
How strange.

461
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,250
It's this late,

462
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,570
still no orders?

463
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,730
Nope.

464
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,380
You open the app?

465
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,220
Yeah.

466
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,420
Yeah.

467
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,980
You've been there,

468
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,460
scrolling your phone.

469
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,330
Who's been scrolling?

470
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,900
Haven't you?

471
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,420
When I got out,

472
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,180
you were scrolling.

473
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,220
When I came up,

474
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,250
you were still scrolling.

475
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,810
Show me. What's on there?

476
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,940
Why should I show you?

477
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,010
What's the matter?

478
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,620
Aren't we partners?

479
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,530
So what if we are?

480
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,460
That means I have to show you my phone?

481
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,330
I have no privacy?

482
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,610
Even if I'm working for you,

483
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,620
you don't get to check my phone.

484
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,220
Who's checking your phone?

485
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,460
I want to check the app!

486
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,180
I'm not showing you!

487
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,660
Why shouldn't you show me?

488
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,900
If I could register,

489
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,940
would I need you?

490
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,660
Let's just wrap it up.

491
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,180
Fine!

492
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,670
Anyway, our performance this month

493
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,420
has already dropped.

494
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,730
Just keep at this pace,

495
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,090
and we'll see

496
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:13,980
when we can finish five bottles.

497
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,730
What five bottles?

498
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,780
Alcohol.

499
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,810
What kind of alcohol?

500
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,770
I haven't seen you

501
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,460
finish five bottles.

502
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,180
Why do you care?

503
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,140
Do I have to tell you

504
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,180
every trick I've got?

505
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,490
We got an order?

506
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,010
That was WeChat. Can't you tell?

507
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,940
Chu Dan invited us

508
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,420
to drink at her place tonight.

509
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,900
What for?

510
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,900
To drink.

511
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,700
Come on, have another drink.

512
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,860
Cheers!

513
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,090
Let me tell you,

514
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,860
today on set,

515
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,290
I was the center of attention!

516
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,810
Everyone smiled at me.

517
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,660
All smiles, staring at me.

518
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,290
But I know the truth.

519
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,490
They were laughing at me,

520
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,490
laughing at how bad my acting is.

521
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,730
That's mockery.

522
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,180
Who dares to mock you?

523
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,810
Tomorrow, Chi and I will go after him!

524
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,570
Tell me,

525
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,980
why hasn't the Earth

526
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,380
destroyed yet?

527
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,660
Don't destroy it.

528
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,460
Well,

529
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,290
some people haven't gotten married yet.

530
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,700
I'm not married either.

531
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,050
But right now,

532
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,290
I just want to make myself less miserable.

533
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,900
Come on.

534
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,900
Who doesn't have their own pain?

535
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,860
Youyou,

536
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,330
living itself

537
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,730
is a kind of pain.

538
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,330
When it comes to pain,

539
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,770
the kind

540
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,860
you just can't shake off,

541
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,860
I've got a lot to say.

542
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,180
Wanna compete?

543
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,180
Still, Chu Dan is the best.

544
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,620
I've heard of that person before.

545
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,810
When he was an assistant director,

546
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,900
he already had quite the temper.

547
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,050
Okay.

548
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,770
When you have time,

549
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,490
I'll go check the footage at your place.

550
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,620
I'll get a better understanding.

551
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,660
Don't worry.

552
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,980
I know the rules.

553
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,770
I won't cause you trouble.

554
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,860
Pass me a rag.

555
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,010
Stop this already.

556
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,740
The fridge is full.

557
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,820
I'll place this on the balcony.

558
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,170
Sorry!

559
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,780
Sorry...

560
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,940
Sorry...

561
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,260
It's all my fault.

562
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,610
It's all my fault.

563
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,050
Don't!

[Loving Strangers]

565
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,300
Jiaqi, what happened to your hand?

566
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,530
Nothing.

567
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,170
Speak up.

568
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,300
You definitely have something going on.

569

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,050
with the current situation,

571
