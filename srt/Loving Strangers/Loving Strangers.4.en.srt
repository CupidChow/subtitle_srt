00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,340
is for three months.

193
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,300
I want it extended to six.

194
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,420
You should be prepared.

195
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,700
With her condition,

196
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,770
she only has six months at most.

197
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,770
I want a stable job.

198
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,700
I want the same benefits

199
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,700
as full-time staff.

200
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,940
Overtime pay.

201
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,700
Daily meal allowance.

202
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,490
How much is that in total?

203
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,250
I'll pay you double.

204
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,820
Pay first, then call the cops,

205
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,180
say I extorted you?

206
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,820
I'm not touching that money.

207
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,460
A man who has an affair

208
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,300
with his subordinate's wife.

209
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,650
What credibility does he have?

210
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,980
We were only minutes from home.

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,530
Why couldn't you

212
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,890
hold it in?

213
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,490
Fine. I'll pass.

214
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,650
Even taking a piss feels off.

215
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,730
That's mental decline.

216
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,220
You're the one declining.

217
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,650
Just now,

218
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,820
out of nowhere,

219
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,010
I thought of my wife.

220
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,940
Look,

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,420
why did she pop into my head

222
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,130
just now

223
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,340
out of all time?

224
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,250
Jiaqi.

225
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,340
All jokes aside,

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,340
if something like this happens again,

227
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,770
you ought to be very careful.

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,610
Anyone

229
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,340
would hesitate

230
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,610
when they see the money.

231
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,300
But I know you wouldn't.

232
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,060
Our family is dragging you back.

233
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,820
I'm the one

234
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,820
dragging you back even more.

235
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,100
It's not your fault. This has nothing to do with you.

236
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:38,850
Jiaqi,

237
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,010
I share the blame too.

238
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,220
But the investment

239
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,980
in the script I mentioned is looking promising.

240
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,010
Anyway, I'll work harder.

241
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,010
I won't let you worry about me anymore.

242
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,820
At our age,

243
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,300
life and health

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,100
can't take

245
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,220
too much shock.

246
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,700
Look at me,

247
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,340
and you'll get it.

248
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,980
If you lose this job,

249
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,850
your mom

250
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,250
won't have any hope left.

251
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,490
You could say

252
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,340
you dodged a bullet this time.

253
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,940
You've got to thank that girl.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,010
Find a chance

255
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,530
and thank her properly.

256
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,820
You take all the good lines and the bad ones.

257
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,610
I'm having a serious talk with your brother.

258
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,220
Jiaqi,

259
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,530
home

260
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,130
is always home.

261
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,940
It's fine

262
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,980
if your thoughts

263
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,220
wander once in a while.

264
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,010
That's fine.

265
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,850
But

266
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,610
you can't cross the line.

267
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,770
That's enough.

268
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,340
You're getting carried away.

269
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,490
No, that's true, Jiaqi.

270
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,850
There's barely room at home anymore.

271
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,850
If Junyi kicks you out,

272
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,820
Uncle

273
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,490
will have nowhere to go.

274
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,100
Who are you taking shots at?

275
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,730
What?

276
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,250
Hey.

277
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,060
Stand right there.

278
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,820
Stand right there.

279
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,530
Stay there.

280
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,980
[Sen'an Pharma Zhou Yu'an: Buy me dinner.]

281
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,700
[I'm Zhou Yu'an.]

282
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,980
What do you want to eat?

283
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,370
Something expensive.

284
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,250
Why did you help me?

285
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,820
I felt like it.

286
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,010
You were panicking so badly.

287
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,180
I acted on impulse.

288
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,010
How did you notice?

289
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,880
Your face when you opened the paper bag

290
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,700
gave you away.

291
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,810
It was so obvious as if you wanted everyone to know.

292
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,380
You turned back,

293
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,290
and our eyes met.

294
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,180
And when I asked you to buy me dinner,

295
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,420
you agreed right away.

296
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,050
If you weren't guilty,

297
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,290
why say yes?

298
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,570
Thank you.

299
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,900
A man who has an affair

300
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,900
with his subordinate's wife.

301
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,660
What credibility does he have?

302
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,460
I can agree to your request.

303
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,140
But you have to agree to mine.

304
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,180
What do you want?

305
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,010
Everyone in the office knows

306
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,330
Pang Jian wants to bring me down.

307
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,730
Jiang Jiaqi may not be ambitious,

308
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,900
but he's turned into a ticking time bomb.

309
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,700
I need you to take them both out.

310
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,220
All I want is a six-month contract.

311
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,090
Your request is worth more than this.

312
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,860
I can fire you right now.

313
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,490
You think you have a choice?

314
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,140
Keep the phone.

315
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,620
Fifty thousand per person.

316
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,900
Does that work for you?

317
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,770
Why should I trust you?

318
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,220
I told you.

319
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,530
You don't have a choice.

320
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,730
Get the money ready.

321
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,460
So now you're willing to take it?

322
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,250
This is a deal

323
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,180
we both agreed to.

324
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:40,860
Hello?

325
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,010
Hello?

326
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,530
How did it go?

327
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,250
You have to help him.

328
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,810
We've confirmed it.

329
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,220
He threw the gift cards away.

330
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,490
Threw them away?

331
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,490
Where?

332
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,530
That's impossible.

333
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,420
He kept saying he lost them.

334
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,490
They were dumped in the office trash.

335
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,010
A janitor found them today

336
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,140
and handed them in.

337
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,290
But he told me they were lost.

338
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,940
Are you sure?

339
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,290
He wouldn't lie to me.

340
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,250
That's two hundred thousand worth of gift cards.

341
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,330
He just threw them away?

342
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,900
Would you believe that?

343
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,170
When he came home last night,

344
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,390
he was tense.

345
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,660
He said he couldn't explain himself anymore.

346
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,290
Doesn't that sound strange?

347
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,050
You don't need to worry about it.

348
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,900
Gu Chen.

349
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,010
I hope

350
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,940
what's between us

351
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,290
doesn't affect

352
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,620
his situation at work, okay?

353
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,980
Keep the gift cards quiet

354
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,940
for me.

355
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,290
I don't want more trouble.

356
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,220
Buy me meals for a month.

357
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,290
Sorry.

358
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,250
I can't do that.

359
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,940
If people from the office see us,

360
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,770
it won't look good.

361
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,420
We can make sure no one sees us.

362
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,810
Meeting in secret is even worse.

363
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,770
What would that make us?

364
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,570
Are you

365
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,810
under some illusion about yourself?

366
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,490
Do you really think

367
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,980
I asked you to treat me to meals

368
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,380
because I want to spend time with you?

369
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,330
Then cash it out.

370
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,250
I'll pay you.

371
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,290
Good.

372
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,660
Three months of your salary.

373
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,490
Is that too much?

374
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,530
Alright.

375
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,730
But I can only pay in installments.

376
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,220
Until it's paid off,

377
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,330
treat me to meals

378
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,490
for interest.

379
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,940
[To Mr. Jiang Jiaqi]

380
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,460
[To Ms. Wu Yijun]

381
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,380
What's going on?

382
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,490
It's all handled.

383
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,250
Everything's fine now.

384
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,010
How was it handled?

385
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,090
The cards were found.

386
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,620
How were they found?

387
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,010
I'm asking you.

388
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,330
How exactly were they found?

389
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,330
Someone threw them away.

390
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,380
A janitor found them in the trash.

391
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,810
Then why did he say

392
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,460
you were the one who threw them out?

393
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,010
Who said that?

394
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,730
Who told you I threw them away?

395
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,380
I couldn't reach you during the day,

396
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,380
so I called Gu Chen.

397
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,980
Why did you call him?

398
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,860
Last night, you told me

399
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,330
a bag of gift cards was missing.

400
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,380
Then today,

401
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,090
I couldn't find you all day.

402
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,660
If I didn't ask him, who else could I ask?

403
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,380
Have you ever thought about

404
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,940
how I got through today?

405
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,700
Have you ever thought

406
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,530
that I'd worry too?

407
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,460
That I'd panic?

408
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,220
That I'd want to

409
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,900
help you get to the bottom of this.

410
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,220
You only care about how you feel.

411
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,660
Did you ever think about

412
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,770
how anxious I was?

413
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,010
Shouldn't I be the first

414
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,700
to know what really happened

415
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,980
when something this serious happened?

416
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,530
But when you came home,

417
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,530
you didn't want to

418
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,570
say one more word.

419
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,940
You could spend the whole night

420
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,530
with Jialu

421
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,010

422
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,620
drinking and talking about everything.

423
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,220
But what about me?

424
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,010
They're your real family, right?

425
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,420
Then what is this place?

426
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,530
What is this family?

427
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,530
What am I?

428
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,220
What is this life we're living?

429
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,700
I've told you many times.

430
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,460
Don't tear the bags like that.

431
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,980
I'm sorry.

432
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,770
I shouldn't have made you worry.

433
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,810
Stop calling him.

434
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,050

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,660
Can you hear me?

443
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,730
Weren't you playing me?

444
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,660
Thought you were smart, huh?

445
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,770
Who is that?

446
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,820
Why are you banging on the door in the middle of the night?

447
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,080
Knock again, and I'll call the police.

448
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,860
Who's calling the police?

449
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,140
Come on.

459
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,860
it's okay.

460
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,940
Sorry.

461
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,700
It's fine.

462

Thank you, Yu'an.

464
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,620
Grandma has eaten.

465
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,490
You should get some rest.

466
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,250
If you keep this up,

467
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,220
something bad will happen.

468
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,570
I still owe rent.

469
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,950
Didn't that Gu guy say

470
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,050
he'd give you money?

471
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,380
He must be loaded.

472
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,770

You can also hear what he's saying.

481
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,700

482

Who knows.

483
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,050

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,770
I'll think of something.

Don't do anything reckless.

487
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,120
If something goes wrong, you'll be in danger.

493
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,900

you judge my background,
