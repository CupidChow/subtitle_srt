124
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,340

your colleagues,

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,420
your friends, your childhood friends,

140

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,180
I feel pain,

145
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,060
I become sensitive,

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,130
I complain,

I feel unbalanced.

148
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,250
It's because you are my everything.

So many times,

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,850
I had already made up my mind.

153

I told myself I would come home

and say, "Let us get divorced".

155
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,980
But when I truly

156
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,300
stood in front of you,

157
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,770
I could not say it.

158
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,100
It's because you are a good person.

159
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,610
But the truth is, I am deeply unhappy.

160
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,940
I have asked myself countless times

161
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,820
why I'm not happy

162
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,370
being married to someone like you.

163
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,710
But I don't want to keep pretending

164
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,220
inside this marriage.

165
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,650
I pushed myself to become

166
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,530
the person you wanted me to be.

167
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,530
I tried to learn to like

168
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,610
every single person you liked.

169
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,610
But one day, I suddenly realized

170
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,130
I had forgotten myself.

171
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,300
I forgot who I was.

172
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,100
I forgot what I liked

173
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,420
and what I actually needed.

174
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,650
You always...

175
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,300
You always

176
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,370
ask me every day after work

177
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,890
what I need you to bring back.

178
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,650
But the things I need,

179
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,650
and the things I like to do...

180
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,130
Do you really know?

181
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,980
I also tried

182
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,220
to talk things through with you calmly.

183
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,730
Even if it meant arguing,

184
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,770
I thought that we could

185
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,530
come to understand each other better.

186
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,340
But the way you chose

187
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,370
was to hide away,

188
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,490
as if once today passes,

189
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,770
everything will be fine tomorrow.

190

are scars we carry inside,

192
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,650
aren't they?

193
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,130
I just could not get past them.

194
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,850
Don't you agree?

195
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,610
Once, twice, three times.

196
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,890
After a while, I started to feel

197
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,580
that I was doubting myself.

198
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,580
Why was I being so unreasonable?

199
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,490
And then eventually,

200
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,250
I gave up completely.

201
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,940
Jiaqi!

202
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,770
Keep an eye on him!

203
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,010
Beautiful!

204
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,180
Great shot!

205
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,180
No matter how many reasons I give,

206
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,980
they still cannot

207
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,010
become an excuse for what I did.

208
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,530
This is all on me.

209
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,300
I am the one who destroyed our marriage.

210
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,610
Saying sorry 10,000 times

211
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,340
would still change nothing.

212
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,460
I know you didn't say it out loud

213
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,100
because you were worried about Mom,

214
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,250
about An,

215
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,300
and about the impact on the whole family.

216
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,060
No matter

217
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,010
whether you choose to carry on for now

218
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,370
or decide to divorce,

219
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,770
I will respect your decision.

220
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,820
I don't know.

221
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,060
I don't know how I am supposed to face you,

222
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,060
or face all of this.

223
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,250
After walking together for so many years,

224
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,490
I don't know how I should end it.

225
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,370
I once thought

226
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,060
that pretending not to know

227
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,650
might let life go on.

228
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,770
But now,

229
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,820
I don't know.

230
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,420
You see, Jiaqi,

231
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,060
he was upset not long ago

232
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,010
because he couldn't even touch the ball.

233
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,010
But look at him now.

234
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,890
Once he became a Vice GM candidate,

235
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,250
he became a completely different person.

236
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,980
If you ask me, power

237
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,460
means everything to a man.

238
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,300
You should ride with Fei.

239
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,730
Fei.

240
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,730
Get him out of here, now.

241
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,300
What is that for?

242
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,220
He's full of nonsense.

243
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,770
Come on.

244
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,060
They don't even want to give you a ride.

245
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:41,820
Me?

246
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,730
I wouldn't even bother with them.

247
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,220
Hey.

248
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,010
You're talking as if there are

249
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,150
some secrets we shouldn't know.

250
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,890
You were impressive

251
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,580
today.

252
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,340
You scored with one shot.

253
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,940
Yeah, right?

254
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,730
Come on.

255
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,300
That was amazing.

256
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,010
We are here.

257
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,650
This is the place.

258
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,420
All right, tell me. What is going on?

259
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,420
It's nothing.

260
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,050
Don't give me that.

261
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,570
You just called my name

262
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,810
with that kind of tone.

263
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,770
Do you think I couldn't tell?

264
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,900
Something is definitely off.

265
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,460
Just drive.

266
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,490
I'm not driving unless you talk.

267
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,090
Fine, I'll stop asking.

268
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,980
It's just the position of Vice GM.

269
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,250
If it makes you unhappy,

270
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,050

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,250
Jiang Jiaqi.

300
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,900
Because of that one so-called

301
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,900
SUSAR,

302
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,530
the drug regulator sent back

303
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,180
our marketing approval application.

304
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,900
They are demanding

305
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,860
that we submit a more complete

306
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,660
Phase III clinical trial report.

307
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,420
The launch of SA-0988 is definitely getting delayed.

308
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:28,940
Are you satisfied now?

309
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,140
Now, the entire company

310
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,660
has to pay for your reckless stunt.

00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,250
Why act so shocked?

313
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,940
Did I not warn you?

314
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,420
When you insisted on pushing through

315
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,660
with the marketing approval application,

316
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,050

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,900

and you are already cracking, huh?

00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,900

323
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,250

324
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,810
You really think I care about any of that?

If you do not want me speaking up,

326
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,010
then just shut down

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,570
Got it.

352
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,940

that Boss has changed?

354
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,330
Strictly speaking,

355
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,180
this should be Regulatory's job.

356
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,810
They dumped it on us.

357
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,420
They are clearly targeting us,

358
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,700
so we have to be even more careful.

359
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,010
Don't give them anything to pick apart,

360
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,530

Otherwise, this job

364
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,980
would be impossible.

376
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,810
Leave this to us.

Go. Don't worry.

378
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,460

From his perspective,

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,660
of course he would be unhappy.

Wait!

570
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,940
Is this the last train?

571
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,170
Buddy, it is the last train.

572
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,860
What do we do now?

573
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,940
I heard you volunteered to stay late.

574
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,090
I wanted you to praise me.

575
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,570
You're getting better.

576
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,740
Keep it up.

577
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,780
Truth is, I was waiting for you.

578
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,260
Even though I didn't know

579
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,420
whether you would come back,

580
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,420
I still wanted to wait for you.

581
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,130
Why are you making that face?

582
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,980
What's with that expression

583
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,090
even though you've already drawn

584
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,820
a clear line between us?

585
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,740
The more you try

586
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,490
to draw a line between us,

587
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,050
the more I find myself drawn to you.

588
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,940
Did I scare you?

589
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,650
Don't worry.

590
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,300
I'm not going to do anything.

591
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,300
Do you know

592
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,530
why you think you like me?

593
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,820
It's because you think I am pitiful.

594
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,490
Just like you.

595
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,940
We're merely in the same plight.

596
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,010
This isn't love at all.

597
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,490
What about you?

598
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,210
Did you treat me so well

599
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,610
