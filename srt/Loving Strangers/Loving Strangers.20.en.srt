Oh my god.

You really...

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,180

I'm worried you'll get hurt.

You were full of energy a couple of days ago.

26

Now you haven't even made back the gas money.

She's not home?

She said she'd come by after the audition.

- You can't even go home. - You're so immature.

You played soccer with Jiaqi a few days ago, right?

87
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,380
Yeah.

How did you two end up

getting into a fight

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,010
and making it that bad?

91
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,010
That's on me.

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,100
You know how it is.

93

There's always some friction when playing soccer.

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,890
I lost my temper at the time.

95

with my brother.

97
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,570
What?

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,890
You were in a fight with your brother?

99
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,290
What happened?

100
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,570
He slide-tackled me

101
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,900
and knocked me down.

102
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,250
I was just gesturing back at him,

103
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,660
but I accidentally hit his face.

104

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,410
Why would you

110
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,370
hit him like that?

111
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,140
It's fine.

112
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,980

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,050

Besides, he hit me first.

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,900
Tell me.

Your brother works at a big company.

126
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,280
He's a respected professional.

127
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,370
And, you actually hit him in the face.

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,290
- How is he supposed to work like that? - Mom.

129

He's really fine. Don't be upset.

Just ignore him, Yijun.

Here comes the drinks!

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,020
Fine. I won't bring it up.

191

Go find her if you can.

192
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,930
Exactly.

If you won't call, I will.

194
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,850
I'll call her right now.

195

What does that have to do with you?

196
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,020
Fine, I won't drink then.

We can drink.

Alright then.

Then I'll just take a sip.

204
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,850
Why are you even taking a sip?

205
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,290
Where's your wife?

206
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,700
Mom, you're confused.

I'm not even married yet.

208
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,220
At least you know you're not married.

209
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,250
If you were married,

210
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,610
you wouldn't act this recklessly.

211
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,460
You beat up your own brother

212
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,290

How was the food?

It was really good.

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,850
It was quite heaty.

00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,890

He said he has a girl

he's really into.

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,700
It's someone from our company.

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,820
The woman is practically about to get married.

324
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,610
How can he still not get that?

325
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,610
Exactly.

326
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,060
He said

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,370
he still has a chance

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,340

I'm sure

331
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,610
that's just in his head.

One good knock to the head

00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,940
I didn't say anything, Boss.

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,610
I'll head out first.

338
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,650
How was dinner last night?

339
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,460
Why did you leave so early?

340
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,340
Was everything okay at home?

any trouble before,

348
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,370
so I didn't pay much attention.

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,850
Please take a look at this.

352
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,180
I didn't want anyone else to mess things up,

353
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,130
so I followed her myself.

354
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,460
Who is the one fighting with him?

355
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,530
This guy is called Chen Ren.

356
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,420
He's Zhou Yu'an's creditor.

357
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,900
I heard Zhou Yu'an's parents

358
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,940
owed his family some money.

359
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,140
Jiang Jiaqi went to confront him,

360
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,700
saying he'd pay the debt for Zhou Yu'an.

361
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,460
The two of them got into a fight.

362
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,490
That elderly woman is

Zhou Yu'an's grandmother.

364
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,460
Mr. Gu,

365
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,010

366
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,290
there's something off about these two.

367
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,700
I didn't expect things to turn out like this.

368
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,620
This must have caused you trouble.

369
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,860
I can fire her immediately.

370
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,980
Don't act rashly for now.

371
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,250
Send me the photos.

372
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:41,940
Good work.

373
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,460
Explain yourself.

374
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,330
You had someone follow me.

375
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,770
Is there a problem with that?

376
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,520
Do you really think

377
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,700
I'd put all my chips

on you alone?

379
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,090
I was doing exactly what you told me.

380
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,010
I changed my tactics and got close to Jiang Jiaqi.

381
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,330
Parents gone,

382
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,700
buried in debt,

383
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,290
and a disabled grandmother...

384
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,420
Isn't that exactly the kind of backstory

385
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,980
that people like Jiang Jiaqi fall for?

386
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,180
After he heard my backstory,

387
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,530
his attitude changed right away.

388
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,660
The way he looked at me

389
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,980
was like I was a stray puppy.

390
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,700
You knew he got hurt

391
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,180
because he fought your creditor.

392
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,530
Why didn't you tell me?

393
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,940
What good would it do you

to hear about this mess?

395
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,010
He fought for you,

396
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,090
and even paid your debt.

397
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:53,900
Are you touched?

398
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,180
Were you afraid that if I knew,

399
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,620
I'd use it against him?

400
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,530
How is that leverage for you?

401
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,090
Have you ever heard of

That he helps subordinates in need,

410
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,940

that he'd do something like this?

420
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,380

As far as I know,

he hadn't.

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,980
a chance for us.

567
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,900
But little by little, I realized

568
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,860
there was no way back.

569
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,250
Every day I'm exhausted,

570
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,010
dragging myself home from the shop,

571
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,420
yet I still can't fall asleep.

572
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,180
Insomnia always strikes.

573
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,700
I'm really sorry.

574
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,290
I only meant to ask you

575
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,380
to recommend another medication to me,

576
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,940
but I ended up rambling on.

577
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,980
Bill, please.

578
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,570
How much?

579
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,290
Zhou Yu'an.

580
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,660
Why are you pretending you didn't see me?

581
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,620
Did I do something wrong?

582
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,420
Go ahead, hit me.

583
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,700
What?

584
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,290
That uncontrollable urge

585
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,730
to see someone,

586
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,760
didn't you say a good knock to the head

587
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,860
would snap us out of it?

588
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,330
I want to forget everything.

589
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,250
Come.

590
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,290
Stop spouting nonsense.

591
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,490
When I saw you weren't wearing

592
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,250
the gloves I gave you,

593
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,570
it really hurt.

594
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,080
I kept wandering the streets

595
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,730
all because I wanted to see you.

596
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,900
I hate myself for that.

597
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,380
You're making no sense here.

598
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,220
Just give me a good punch.

00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,620

602
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,490
Do you like me?

603
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,290
Have you lost your mind?

604
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,290
That's right!

605
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,290
I must have lost my mind to fall for someone like you!

606
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,090
