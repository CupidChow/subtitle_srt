00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,340
after it's released,

194
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,860
all the prior costs

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,770
will go down the drain.

196
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,050
You're acting like you're the only one

197
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,380
worried about the company's drug safety.

198
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,500
Have you asked

199
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,570
other departments

200
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,220
what they think

201
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,770
about PV?

202
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,290
You have no big-picture awareness!

203
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,980
You're holding the company back!

204
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,450
Don't you even

205
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,690
realize this?

206
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,530
Let me be clear.

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,860
If you end up

208
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,980
harming the company's interests,

209
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,980
don't blame me for not warning you.

210
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,740
Boss,

211
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,980
should we

212
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,140
change the plan?

213
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,410
Our dept

214
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,570
only does technical assessments.

215
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,380
Mr. Gao is something else.

216
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,810
He was just blowing up at Jiang

217
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,690
in front of so many people.

218
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,900
He didn't give Jiang any face at all.

219
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,450
No matter what,

220
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,380
Jiang has been working here

221
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,570
for over ten years.

222
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,620
But who's he really working for?

223
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,530
Just look at his shifts

224
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,650
these two years,

225
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,450
moving from R&D to PV.

226
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,380
Even though both are director positions,

227
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,690
the difference between them

228
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,690
is huge.

229
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,740
So,

230
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,860
his personal case

231
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,290
is worth studying

232
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,570
and we can learn a lesson from it.

233
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,450
If you don't want to end up like him,

234
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,570
don't repeat

235
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,930
whatever he's done.

236
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,020
Back in school,

237
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,340
your junior used to suck up to you.

238
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,100
And now he's your boss,

239
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,260
and always trying to trip you up.

240
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,690
Who wouldn't feel terrible?

241
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,530
That's his problem.

242
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,740
The workplace isn't where

243
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,740
you find your emotional balance.

244
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,930
When his junior

245
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,500
becomes his superior,

246
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,620
he should just walk away.

247
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,650
He wouldn't have ended up

248
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,290
in this situation,

249
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,260
totally pinned down,

250
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,770
and waiting

251
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,740
to be kicked out.

252
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,930
Zhiyuan...

253
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,810
looks like I'm really getting old.

254
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,380
Unlike you,

255
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,860
always so young.

256
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,140
My body feels like...

257
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,570
it weighs a thousand pounds.

258
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,770
Get up!

259
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,690
Mom?

260
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,690
Why didn't you knock?

261
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,810
My son...

262
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,020
why haven't you gotten married yet?

263
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,980
Why did you guys

264
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,290
end up in one bed?

265
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,220
I fell down last night,

266
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,810
and I couldn't be bothered to climb back up.

267
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,290
Get up.

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,530
Get up.

269
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:24,930
Mom,

270
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,930
you can't do this!

271
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,620
Mom, you can't.

272
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,340
One's my brother,

273
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,170
and one's my son.

274
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,450
When you both were young,

275
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,570
I changed your diapers!

276
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,020
Sis...

277
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,810
What's there to be shy about?

278
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,650
You know I'm almost fifty.

279
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,930
Can you show some respect

280
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,450
for a working person like me?

281
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,260
What kind of working person

282
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,020
sleeps in late

283
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,290
at this hour?

284
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,900
Hurry up and get to work.

285
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,050
Jiaqi does

286
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,810
both mental and physical work.

287
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,050
Has he ever said he's tired?

288
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,140
Now he's walking to work,

289
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,650
full of energy.

290
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,620
Don't blame me for being biased.

291
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,260
You should learn from him!

292
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,020
Jiaqi,

293
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,530
your body weighs just 100 pounds.

294
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,980
It's your heart feels like it weighs a thousand pounds.

295
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,340
A perfect place for relaxation,

296
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,220
a scenic retreat in the suburbs.

297
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,570
Lia Resort,

298
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,860
your natural oxygen bar,

299
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,450
bringing your heart back to nature.

300
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,140
[Chu Dan: Feeling refreshed now.]

301
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,930
Even with your own pets,

302
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,140
you wouldn't greet them with your feet, right?

303
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,580
What job are you taking?

304
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,820
We're hauling goods.

305
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,930
Why are you ending up with a human model?

306
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,780
A human model?

307
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,340
What's wrong?

308
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,620
Are you getting interested

309
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,490
in a fake person?

310
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,210
No, I just think she looks familiar.

311
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,170
Enough.

312
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,210
You need to get a girlfriend.

313
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,170
Is it working or not?

314
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,820
Why is delivering this stuff

315
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,730
so troublesome?

316
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,580
Such a small job,

317
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,650
can't you do it by yourself?

318
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,490
Why bring me?

319
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,490
You're blaming me now?

320
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,170
Go talk to the security.

321
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,140
Who knew?

322
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
He won't let the car in.

323
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,250
Can't I carry it myself?

324
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,930
You always cause trouble.

325
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,170
Hello.

326
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,900
Hi.

327
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,340
We're the delivery team.

328
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,580
Hello?

329
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,170
We're downstairs right now.

330
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,650
Please open the door access.

331
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,820
Open the access!

332
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,380
Miss.

333
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,100
Open the access!

334
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,650
This is a KTV, not your house.

335
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,580
What's going on?

336
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,100
Our customer's drunk.

337
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,900
Ask her,

338
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,010
can we just leave it by the door?

339
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,210
Or we'll leave it

340
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,010
by the door.

341
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,650
You can grab it later.

342
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,580
Are you her friend?

343
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,450
Please help her out.

344
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:21,860
She's too drunk.

345
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,380
No. We're the delivery team.

346
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,140
I'll pay for the delivery fee!

347
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,100
Two hundred.

348
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,100
Two hundred?

349
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,930
Two hundred.

350
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,860
You'll give two hundred, right?

351
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,820
Fine.

352
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,410
Okay.

353
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,580
Please give me the address.

354
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,730
Okay, got it.

355
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,860
What now?

356
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,540
Just took a job.

357
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,100
She's drunk. We're picking her up.

358
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,780
We'll get two hundred for it.

359
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,380
I'm not going.

360
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,730
We're picking her up for two hundred!

361
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,140
Isn't that better than hauling goods?

362
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,210
Are you going or not?

363
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,860
I refuse to go.

364
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,650
Jiang Jialu!

365
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,820
It won't let us through?

366
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,250
No worries.

367
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,340
We can go.

368
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,900
It's okay.

369
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,100
Don't burn yourself.

370
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,650
Hello.

371
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,010
Was this your order?

372
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,010
You'll pay two hundred?

373
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,900
We're leaving!

374
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,650
Let's go.

375
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,490
We're leaving now.

376
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,210
Let's go.

377
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,550
Time is running out.

378
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,450
Why are you so late?

379
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,250
We're leaving.

380
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,930
Can you make it?

381
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,930
Take care.

382
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,860
Move.

383
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,690
Director?

384

00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,650
Shouldn't you make us

577
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,780
some Spanish paella?

578
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,580
Sure! In a couple of days!

579
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,300
I didn't have time to shop for ingredients.

580
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,300
Today's seafood

581
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,930
was all sponsored by Chi.

582
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,060
Enjoy whatever's available.

583
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,780
Don't be picky!

584
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,580
Alright!

585
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,340
Alright!

586
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,690
We finally got Dan

587
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,490
back here with us!

588
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,140
You don't know

589
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,060
how tough

590
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,540
it's been

591
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,490
without you here.

592
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,780
It's been like living under someone else's roof.

593
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,340
You know?

594
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,490
If you stay a little longer,

595
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,300
the waiter will start giving you the cold shoulder.

596
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,210
What's wrong?

597
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,930
Today, Chu Dan's back.

598
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,140
Our pure friendship

599
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,300
and group life have officially resumed.

600
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:19,860
Alright!

601
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,580
Alright!

602
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,580
I propose

603
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,350
that we all raise a glass

604
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,210
to Chu Dan,

605
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,490
our legendary heroine from Qingxi Road!

606
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,780

607

608
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,060

609

610
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,580
Pure friendship, invincible!

611
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,620
Cheers!

612
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,140
It feels so good to be remembered.

613
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,620
Exactly!

614
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,410

615

643
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,220
Not yet.

Jiaqi,

653
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,660
didn't you tell your wife

654
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,970
that we're doing quick deliveries now?

[Galaxy Tavern]

656
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,220
Are you afraid she'll mind us?

657
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,050
Is that it?

658
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,820
I didn't have time to mention it.

659
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,340
Don't be embarrassed to say it.

660
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,860
If she understands you,

661
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,930
she won't mind these things.

662
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,660
All these years,

663
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,410
I've wanted to make my own movie,

664
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,490
and do the things I love.

665
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,010
Because I know,

666
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,450
since dad left

667
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,610
this family

668
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,820
has been on your shoulders.

669
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,820
No matter how messy

670
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,820
I make it,

671
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,380
you're the one to handle it.

672
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,380
But now I've realized...

673
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,450
I need to take responsibility for myself.

674
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,050
Really.

675
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,220
Jiaqi, you can get drunk now.

676
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,050
Now I just want to make money,

677
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,570
and then treat you to abalone.

678
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,570
I want the expensive ones.

679
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,340
Sure, the expensive ones!

680
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,450
The five-count, three-count, two-count...

681
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,260
Let's steam them, boil them...

682
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,450
Is he thinking

683
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,820
he's Pavarotti or something?

684
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,260
It feels much better

685
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,570
to say it out loud.

686
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,820
Jiaqi, you too.

687
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,700
You can't keep bottling it up.

688
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,340
If you don't say anything,

689
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,220
who will know what you're thinking?

690
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,930
Who will understand you?

691
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,700
Isn't that right?

692
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,930
Someone seems to understand me.

693
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680
I also understand her.

694
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,410
Isn't that great?

695
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,050
She understands me.

696
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,050
And it makes me feel pretty sad.

697
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,180
Get up.

698
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,740
Jiaqi,

699
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,050
I've transferred the money to you.

700
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,730
Got it.

701
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,820
Jiaqi, I've transferred mine too.

702
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,340
Chi, you don't need to give me money.

703
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,340
You brought all the seafood.

704
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,660

Don't mess it up.

710
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,820
I'm leaving.

711
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,340
I've collected the money for you.

00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,930

What do you mean?

720

722
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,010

724
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:16,700

725
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,570
get closer later on?

727
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,090
Always so improper.
