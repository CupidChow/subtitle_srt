00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,580
is unnecessary.

188
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,940
Right?

189
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,850
So, tell me.

190
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,490
What's going on?

191
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,010
According to the Inspection Office,

192
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,770
it looks like Jiaqi has been

193
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,100
digging into Mr. Gu in secret.

194
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,460
What exactly is the bad blood between them?

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,980
Jiaqi seems to think the gift card thing

196
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,770
and even what happened to Pang Jian

197
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,820
were arranged by Mr. Gu.

198
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,980
Does he have proof?

199
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,610
The Inspection Office searched everything,

200
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,340
but they didn't find anything.

201
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,010
Su Gengsheng,

202
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,130
as the head of the Inspection Office,

203
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,180
never said a word to me about it.

204
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,420
He's probably thinking Mr. Gu

205
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,490
is very likely to stay on,

206
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,610
so he has his concerns.

207
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,420
Finding someone I can truly trust

208
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,610
is harder than it sounds.

209
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,730
- Chairman. - Chairman.

210
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,060
You should've told me you were coming.

211
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,130
I could've picked you up.

212
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,130
You're all the pillars of this company,

213
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,130
unlike me, who has nothing better to do.

214
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,490
- Chairman. - Chairman.

215
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,100
Chairman.

216
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,890
Good day, Chairman.

217
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,100
Hello.

218
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,820
Have a seat.

219
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,730
Chairman.

220
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:49,940
Jiaqi,

221
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,130
I'd like to have a chat with you.

222
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,820
How about it?

223
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,980
This weekend, the day after tomorrow,

224
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,850
let's play a round of golf.

225
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,460
I'm sorry, Chairman.

226
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,980
I don't play golf.

227
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,460
Then, what do you play?

228
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,890
Soccer.

229
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,420
Soccer?

230
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,300
All right.

231
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,940
If it's soccer,

232
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,420
I could've played a match with you

233
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,700
50 years ago.

234
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,610
Now,

235
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,340
no chance.

236
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,010
Not now, definitely not.

237
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,890
Chairman.

238
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,890
I found a great spot

239
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,940
on Baihua Mountain.

240
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,940
I was thinking,

241
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,300
this weekend I'll have the firewood

242
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,010
and the tent ready.

243
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,940
Let's take a trip out there.

244
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,220
Sure.

245
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,940
The day after tomorrow's the weekend, isn't it?

246
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:32,890
Pick me up early.

247
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,460
You got it.

248
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,850
Jiaqi, what do you say?

249
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,700
Come along the day after tomorrow.

250
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,420
Why does it smell like charcoal smoke?

251
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,100
Had barbecue with coworkers.

252
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,130
Sooner or later,

253
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,490
we'll find something

254
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,700
we can do together.

255
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,940
Chairman,

256
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,770
if you'd like, I can let the doctor know

257
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,010
and take you out

258
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,850
for some fish ball soup tonight.

259
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,770
No need.

260
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,820
This weekend

261
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,580
is for you, the young people.

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,460
I

263
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,890
know when to step aside.

264
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,980
All right, you can all head back now.

265
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,130
I'll see you out.

266
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,060
Go on.

267
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,300
So shallow.

268
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,980
Judging from the old man's attitude,

269
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,130
Jiang Jiaqi

270
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,940
is someone we have to win over.

[Subject Statement]

272
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,340
Boss,

273
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,250
take a look at this.

274
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,950
This is

275
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,580
the subject statement

276
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,700
for that SUSAR case.

277
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,850
What statement?

278
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,890
He admitted that,

279
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,820
when he joined the trial,

280
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,940
he hid his drug allergy history.

281
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,420
But

282
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,730
our

283
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,770
SUSAR report was already filed.

284
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,420
Yeah.

[Subject Statement]

286
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,010
If the subject

287
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,130
had concealed an allergy to a certain medication,

288
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,300
and during the trial took something

289
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,820
with a similar active ingredient,

290
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,850
then the adverse reaction

291
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,130
may not have been caused by SA-0988 after all.

292
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,060
In that case,

293
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,940
our SUSAR report

294
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,340
might not hold up.

295
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,340
What the company feared most was

296
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,130
that this SUSAR

297
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,770
would lead the regulators

298
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,250
to reject SA-0988 for marketing approval.

299
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,980
It always hits where it hurts.

300
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,700
Right?

301
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,770
What a coincidence, no?

302
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,940
Pull up all related data

303
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,180
and reports

304
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,900

305
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,570
Okay.

306
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,250

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,770
Did you get it?

310
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,770
The subject statement.

311
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,570
I'm looking at it now.

312

The project lead

313
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,700
got it too, I heard.

314
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,290
Recently, did you

315
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,050
go looking

316
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,940
for this subject?

317
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,050
No.

318
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,250
Why would I do something like that?

319
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,180
I only just got the email myself.

320
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,940
An electronic copy?

321
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,180
A scan.

322
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,810

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,010
was the original with a signature.

What's your take?

325
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,530
It means whoever's behind this knows exactly

326
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,220
how adverse reactions

327
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,530
are reported and the rules around it.

328
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,730
Your Pharmacovigilance Dept

329
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,940
is the responsible team,

330
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,250
so you got the original,

331
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,460
and we got the scan.

332
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,250
Even the way they handled this

333
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,940
was pretty professional.

334
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,770
That's overly professional.

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,330

Absolutely not.

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,420

won't your intentions be too obvious?

354
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,090

What's our duty

in the PV Dept?

358
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,290
Isn't it to confirm the facts?

359
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,570
If the subject's adverse reaction

360
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,090
were caused by something else,

361
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,620
there would be no need to report it.

362
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,490
But if it could still

363
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,420
be related to SA-0988,

364
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,420
we would have to get to the bottom of it.

Fine.

379
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,570
Get ready. We're leaving.

380
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,810
Boss,

381
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,490
don't let Tong Rui go.

382
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,330
Stay here.

383
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,940
If anything happens, contact us.

384
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,420
I...

385
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:03,860
All right.

386
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,340
Let's go.

387
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,570
Did you bring the subject statement?

388
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,940
Yes.

389
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,180
Thanks.

390
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,940
Of course.

391
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,090
Here, have some water.

392
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,010
Thank you.

393
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,490
Thank you.

394
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,810
Mr. Wang,

395
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,330
we're here today

396
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,660
for a brief follow-up.

397
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,860
It's about your father

398
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,860
taking part in the drug trial earlier,

399
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,050
and a few details

400
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,090
we need to confirm with you.

401
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,290
Okay.

402
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,200
How is your father doing

403
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,900
right now?

404
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,940
Still an early stage.

405
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,180
We heard you came forward on your own

406
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,530
and told our project team

407
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,810
that you had previously kept quiet

408
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,220
about your father's drug allergy history.

409
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,570
So what medication

410
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,660
is your father allergic to?

411
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,900
Alteplase.

412
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,250
When he had

413
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,220
the adverse reaction,

414
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,490
why didn't you

415
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,330
mention that then?

416
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,290
At the time, my dad

417
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,570
suddenly couldn't speak.

418
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,090
My first thought

419
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,220
was that it had to be

420
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,490
because of the drug trial.

421
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,140
I didn't even think to look for another cause.

422
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,740
[Alarm]

423
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,090
Give me a second.

424
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,730
Excuse me.

425
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,050
I was worried I'd forget my meds,

426
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,660
so I set an alarm.

427
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,460
Are you not feeling well?

428
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,330
Uremia.

429
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,010
I need dialysis twice a week.

430
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,660
Because of it,

431
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,220
I can't hold a job.

432
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,490
My treatment costs,

433
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,220
plus my dad's condition,

434
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,730
we simply can't afford them.

435
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,140
If it weren't for our situation,

436
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,660
I would never have had the heart

437
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,010
to let my dad join the drug trial.

438
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,140
Does your father

439
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,730
know about

440
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,700
the situation now?

441
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:04,940
He does.

442
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,570
Anyway, at this point,

443
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,250
there's no real miracle drug

444
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,180
for Alzheimer's disease.

445
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,940
Who knows, this new drug

446
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,770
might actually help?

447
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,180
Not only did it not cost us a thing,

448
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,090
but we could also earn some money.

449
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,140
Deep down, I know

450
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,180
he's really doing it

451
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,490
to make a little money

452
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,330
and help me out.

453
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,090
When my dad heard he'd passed the physical,

454
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,290
he was pretty happy.

455
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,380
Keep talking.

456
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,490
I'll water the plants.

457
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,860
Dad,

458
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,250
you already watered them just now.

459
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,770
I did?

460
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,980
Dad,

461
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,860
here.

462
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,090
Go set up the board.

463
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,900
In a bit,

464
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,940
we'll play a game.

465
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,050
Okay.

466
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:57,860
Mr. Wang,

467
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,860
aside from treatment

468
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,660
related to Alzheimer's disease,

469
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,660
his other checkups

470
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,530
were basically normal.

471
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,140
Has he ever had a cerebral

472
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,010
or myocardial infarction before?

473
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,050
No.

474
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,090
Alteplase

475
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,180
is specifically used

476
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,660
as an emergency clot-busting drug for cerebral infarction.

477
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,770
Since he hadn't

478
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,980
ever had a stroke before,

479
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,330
how did you find out

480
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,010
that he's allergic to Alteplase?

481
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,530
After my dad had a cerebral infarction this time,

482
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,770
I asked the doctor.

483
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,530
The doctor said my dad

484
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,180
did have an allergic reaction.

485
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,460
Yes, Mr. Wang, I understand.

486
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,050
But if your father

487
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,010
had never had a stroke

488
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,050
and never used Alteplase before,

489
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,090
how could you know

490
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,090
he had an allergy history with Alteplase?

491
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,420
In our family,

492
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,620
we have two people who are sick.

493
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,460
I know

494
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,770
what it feels like to be waiting on a drug

495
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,140
to save a life.

496
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,250
If it's because of me

497
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,330
that the research on this drug gets affected,

498
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,140
I'll feel bad.

499
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,330
Right there, park here.

500
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,050
Just park it in.

501
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,570
Enter.

502
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,420
Just enter and park it,

503
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,140
and that's it.

504
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,980
I'll do a back-in parking.

505
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,660
It'll be easier to exit.

506
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,420
Why are you making it so complicated?

507
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,490
Look.

508
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,730
How do you even drive?

509
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,330
Who parks like that, fighting for a spot?

510
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,700
Isn't this all your fault?

511
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,380
Was that really necessary?

512
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,490
We can look farther up ahead.

513
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,420
Look where you parked it.

514
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,570
In a bit, you'll have to move it for someone.

515
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,420
Was that really necessary?

516
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,090
How is it not necessary?

517
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,330
You finished all the buns this morning.

518
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,460
I didn't even get breakfast.

519
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,330
My blood sugar's low right now.

520
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,460
When my blood sugar drops, I get snappy.

521
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,290
If I hadn't told Wang

522
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,220
to get all the food ready,

523
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,050
there would have been nothing left later.

524
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,420
Wang.

525
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,330
Yao,

526
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,290
why are you so late today?

527
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,010
I had three runs this morning.

528
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,810
I'm worn out.

529
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,330
All these dishes can be added?

530
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,490
Help yourself, eat whatever you want.

531
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,250
The same goes for those?

532
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,050
Yeah...

533
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,570
Chicken leg.

534
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,250
Add a chicken leg.

535
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:20,860
Chicken legs are fine too.

536
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,290
Just pick what you like.

537
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,220
Then, I'll add a chicken leg.

538
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,770
Chicken leg?

539
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,530
Okay.

540
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,140
Five yuan.

541
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,770
All right.

542
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,290
Anything else? Enough?

543
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,050
Yes, thanks.

544
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,570
That's enough.

545
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,010
Okay.

546
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,660
Come back if you want more.

547
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,420
Isn't that Youyou?

548
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,220
Mr. Jiang.

549
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,290
She's my nephew's friend,

550
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,700
an actress.

551
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,810
- Hurry, sit down. - Come on.

552
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,220
Sit.

553
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:40,860
Here.

554
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,140
No wonder you looked so familiar.

555
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:44,980
Youyou,

556
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,770
why did you

557
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,770
come here for a meal today?

558
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,050
The food here is good.

559
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,420
Fifteen yuan for eight dishes.

560
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,010
And you get a big chicken leg too.

561
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,860
It's a steal.

562
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:55,940
Right.

563
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,770
Director,

564
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,770
you don't have a chicken leg.

565
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,700
Have...

566
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,050
Have a chicken leg and build yourself up.

567
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,770
It's just

568
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,940
simple home cooking here.

569
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,290
Hope it suits your taste.

570
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,140
It does.

571
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,330
I've got a great appetite.

572
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,940
And honestly, your meals here

573
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,490
are even better

574
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,570
than what I had on set before.

575
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,220
Right, Director?

576
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,050
Director?

577
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,250
So Jialu

578
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,570
really was a director.

579
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:18,900
Yes.

580
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,860
He used to

581
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,980
have a short film under his belt.

582
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,330
It even won an award at a film festival.

583
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,220
He's really talented.

584
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,220
Really?

585
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,090
So Jialu

586
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,420
was actually a big-time director.

587
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,730
Then, why are you now

588
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,770
driving a delivery truck with us?

589
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,570
What was that film of yours

590
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,050
called again?

591
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,090
I'll look it up online later.

592
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,010
Come on. Get out of here.

593
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,140
My food...

594
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,330
I'm not done eating yet.

595
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,860
Say it. What do you want?

596
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,250
This is strange.

597
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,140
Ten years ago, when you were directing,

598
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,490
I didn't even dare look at you.

599
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,770
The moment I did, I got scared.

600
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,250
Now, the more I look at you,

601
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,180
the more agreeable you seem.

602
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,940
Enough already.

603
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,140
You're clearly holding your breath,

604
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,250
waiting to make a comeback

605
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,530
to create

606
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,420
the most powerful film,

607
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,050
right?

608
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,090
Listen.

609
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,660
No movies.

610
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,860
No directing. No creating.

611
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,140
Right now, I'm just

612
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,140
a courier.

613
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,330
I never planned on going back.

614
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,620
You just came here

615
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,330
to laugh at me, didn't you?

616
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,530
Now that you've seen enough,

617
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,180
you can leave now.

618
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,980
I'm not here to laugh at you.

619
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,530
Why did you stop being a director?

620
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,220
Why did you stop creating?

621
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,490
Can't you understand plain words?

622
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,700
Please

623
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,700
stop appearing in front of me.

624
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,180
All right?

625
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,660
But I feel happy every time I see you.

626
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,980
I honestly want to see you every day.

627
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,900
Before, I pitied you.

628
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,620
I'll tell you the truth.

629
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,180
I know these past years

630
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,860
haven't been easy for you.

631
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,330
You've been unhappy and stuck.

632
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,860
But have you ever thought about it?

633
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,730
It's been ten years.

634
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,490
Whether it was singing

635
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,250
or acting,

636
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,620
if you truly had the ability,

637
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,380
you would've made it long ago.

638
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,420
Would you still be like this now?

639
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,330
Once or twice, you can blame others.

640
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,180
But ten years?

641
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,460
Who do you blame, then?

642
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,180
So, don't push the responsibility

643
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,050
onto me, all right?

644
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,330
Okay?

645
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,330
You're simply incompetent.

646
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,980
Why is there no printer paper again?

647
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,860
I'm talking to you.

648
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,900
Where's the printer paper?

649
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,140
Are you treating my words like nothing?

650
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,860
Zhou Yu'an, I'm telling you,

651
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,010
I've put up with you for a long time!

652
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,420
I only held back because you're a woman.

653
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,220
If you were a man,

654
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,620
I would've hit you already!

655
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,700
Zhou Yu'an, come out here.

656
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,180
I have to say this to her today.

657
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,570
Calm down.

658
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,010
I have to make her come out today.

659
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,460
- I need to make things clear with her. - Calm down.

660
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,460
- Calm down. - Listen.

661
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,620
I must make everything clear today!

662
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,330
Dong Yalin!

663
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:18,860
I just...

664
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,530
Go on. What exactly happened?

665
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,730
Boss,

666
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,330
you know

667
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,380
he never liked

668
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,250
that girl.

669
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,140
Isn't Zhou Yu'an always like that?

670
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,290
But we never saw Dong

671
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,250
lose his temper like that.

672
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,090
Well, maybe that was because

673
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,420
of what happened at the gathering.

674
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,420
I was there too.

675
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,860
What else happened?

676
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,980
That day, when you and Song Hong went out,

677
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,900
she slapped Dong Yalin.

678
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,770
Why?

679
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,250
Well...

680
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,620
We drank a bit too much that day.

681
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,620
I don't really remember it.

682
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,180
What is going on between you and Dong Yalin?

683
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,050
Why did you hit him?

684
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,730
I dislike him,

685
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:49,900
so I hit him.

686
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,980
Does disliking someone justify hitting him?

687
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,570
What did he do to you?

688
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,140
Did he insult you

689
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,050
and say something offensive?

690
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,700
Tell me. Why exactly?

691
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,620
He said you were weak.

692
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,770
He also said your junior is walking all over you

693
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,810
because your junior is capable,

694
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,770
and at your age,

695
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,980
if you're still being publicly humiliated,

696
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,980
that's entirely your own doing.

697
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,810
Did I really

698
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,290
say that?

699
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,250
Yes.

700
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,730
You've got quite a mouth on you.

701
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,570
Boss.

702
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,770
Dong Yalin, you've gotten quite bold, haven't you?

703
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,140
You even dared speak disrespectfully to me.

704
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,010
How outrageous.

705
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,900
Apologize to me right now.

706
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,770
Boss.

707
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,330
I'm sorry.

708
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,050
Say it ten times.

709
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,810
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

710
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,730
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

711
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,660
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

712
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

713
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,980
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

714
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,010
Boss, I love you.

715
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,660
Crazy.

716
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,490
Who hasn't spoken badly about someone

717
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,380
behind their back at some point?

718
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,900
Once it's said, it's said.

719
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,620
Why not just pretend you never heard it?

720
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,660
Why insist on bringing it up?

721
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,810
Thanks for standing up for me.

722
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,530
Dinner's on me.

723
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,290
Between people,

724
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,570
there are things you can't just say casually.

725
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,140
If you hear someone

726
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,250
speaking ill of your friend,

727
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,090
telling your friend about it

728
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,340
will just make things

729
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,090
awkward between you.

730
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,980
In the end,

731
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,050
you might not even stay friends.

732
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,940
But if you already know,

733
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,090
how can you really pretend you don't?

734
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,420
That's the rule of being an adult.

735
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,340
As long as you act like you don't know,

736
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,780
you can treat it

737
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,740
as if nothing ever happened.

738
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,090
But that fear

739
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,380
of being found out

740
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,260
can weigh on you

741
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,210
until you can hardly breathe.

742
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,380
Every time you meet someone,

743
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,170
you can't help wondering

744
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,860
if they know.

745
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,210
And if they do, would they still accept you?

746
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,860
You have to stay tense every single day

747
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,260
and be afraid to even take a full breath.

748
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,780
♪No one knows...♪

749
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,860
Sometimes, I think,

750
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,170
maybe I should just say everything.

751
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,490
If it were all out in the open,

752
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,260
maybe it wouldn't feel so exhausting.
