193
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,610
and live without any burdens.

194
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,100
I thought

195
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,060
he was joking.

196
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,300
Then a month before his wedding,

197
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,370
he went to Spain alone,

198
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,060
headed to the Bardenas Desert

199
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,940
for a hiking trip.

200
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,180
Then he never came back.

201
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,100
Everyone thought

202
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,060
he'd died out there.

203
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,940
Only his fiancée believed

204
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,010
he'd dropped everything

205
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,700
to live the life he wanted.

206
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,700
After that, I started thinking

207
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,010
about what we chase

208
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,730
so hard:

209
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,650
a respectable job,

210
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,060
a happy family,

211
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,490
society's approval,

212
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,820
more money...

213
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,770
All the things

214
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,770
that help us build confidence

215
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,980
and feel safe,

216
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,250
all the things

217
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,730
we think can define us,

218
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,700
if they collapse,

219
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,130
what's left?

220
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,580
What's left

221
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,300
is the real us, I guess.

222
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,940
Compared to people who want it all,

223
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,610
those who aren't afraid of having nothing

224
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,730
are the truly strong ones.

225
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,700
So on your resume,

226
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,770
only writing "running"

227
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,100
makes you seem really strong.

228
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,250
I hate winter.

229
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,340
Spring's coming soon.

230
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,530
Spring sucks too.

231
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,940
And summer, and fall.

232
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,460
Why do the seasons

233
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,850
keep repeating,

234
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,220
without change,

235
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,530
and never end?

236
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,580
Does that sound like something

237
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,300
a 21-year-old would say?

238
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,580
Do I look 21?

239
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,610
How could I

240
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,770
have only lived one life?

241
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,570
I've been here too long.

242
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,980
If one life is 60 years,

243
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,220
then I've lived

244
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,140
500 lives already.

245
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,050
How old is that?

246
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,860
Thirty thousand.

247
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,250
Thirty thousand...

248
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,530
If someone

249
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,530
keeps returning to the same place

250
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,810
but can't find release,

251
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,980
then maybe

252
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,090
they went to the wrong place.

253
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,770
Like meds with side effects.

254
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,010
They're made

255
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,860
with hopes to heal and save lives,

256
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,290
but in the end, they become a curse.

257
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,010
If only life had a warning system,

258
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,380
so the wrong life would flash red early,

259
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,860
and you could just not start.

260
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,050
But lots of side effects

261
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,220
are discovered later

262
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,700
to treat other illnesses.

263
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,460
Like metformin.

264
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,460
It was first extracted

265
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,380
from a plant

266
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,700
that was harmful to cattle and sheep,

267
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,010
but later it became

268
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,380
a lifesaver for diabetics.

269
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,420
You think this is the wrong place,

270
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,050
the wrong life,

271
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,250
but it might become

272
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,010
someone else's hope.

273
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,050
Good night.

274
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,250
See you tomorrow.

275
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,010
See you tomorrow.

276
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,180
Hang in there!

277
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,220
Mom came by?

278
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,330
She...

279
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,770
she hung the soup on the door and left.

280
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,220
What's wrong?

281
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,620
Nothing.

282
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,700
Just thinking about work.

283
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,180
It's fine.

284
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,570
I'll sort it out.

285
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,460
For me,

286
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,140
a married woman is safest,

287
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,810
because she won't go blabbing.

288
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,770
Mom, we're back.

289
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,090
You're back.

290
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,700
Doing a deep clean?

291
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,530
You even wiped the windows.

292
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,960
Mom, I'll do it.

293
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,370
Sis, why do it yourself?

294
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,620
We'll help when we're back.

295
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,700
You're trying to wreck your back?

296
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,490
Like your back's in great shape or something.

297
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,250
Yunxia came to help me,

298
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,180
then left.

299
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,180
She didn't even eat.

300
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,380
Sis, don't scare me like that.

301
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,220
What is it?

302
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,530
She was bringing up divorce again?

303
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,460
You gotta talk to her.

304
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,700
I made over 400 yuan gross these past two days.

305
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,250
Almost like an office worker now.

306
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,010
Look at you, so proud.

307
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,530
Yunxia knew

308
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,730
my birthday's coming up,

309
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,380
so she came to help out.

310
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,490
You two probably forgot

311
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,250
my birthday already, huh?

312
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,380
How could we forget?

313
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,530
Yunxia may throw a fit,

314
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,660
but when it matters,

315
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,010
she's never missed it.

316
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,010
She's just sharp-tongued.

317
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,980
Even when she fights, she feels like family.

318
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,700
Not like your sister-in-law,

319
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,290
always keeping a distance.

320
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,290
Mom, that's not fair.

321
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,180
Sis-in-law's spent plenty on this family.

322
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,570
When we bought this place,

323
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,940
she paid the biggest share.

324
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,250
That's your brother's money!

325
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,980
My brother's money?

326
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,140
With his income,

327
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,050
how much could he chip in?

328
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,620
It was all her covering us.

329
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,330
Mom,

330
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,530
you can't play favorites.

331
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,700
Be nicer to her.

332
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,770
When have I not been nice?

333
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,050
Every time she comes,

334
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,860
aren't there dishes she likes?

335
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,660
Even when I'm swamped,

336
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,980
I still make something good

337
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,770
every few days

338
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,090
and have your brother bring it over.

339
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,330
I bend over backward for her!

340
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,330
I just want to warm her heart up,

341
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,380
so she'll treat your brother better.

342
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,220
Alright, sis.

343
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,330
Look at you.

344
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,860
Jiaqi's wife

345
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,250
treats him plenty well.

346
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,250
In this family,

347
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,530
who has it

348
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,980
better than him?

349
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,770
What do you know?

350
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,490
Where are you going?

351
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,770
Mom, let's eat.

352
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,420
Not hungry.

353
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,980
This old lady, honestly.

354
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,220
Hurry up,

355
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,570
drink your warm porridge.

356
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,810
I'm telling you,

357
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,530
this schedule wrecks your stomach.

358
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,290
You hear me?

359
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,050
Get going.

360
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,180
Got it.

361
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,140
You're the best.

362
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,090
What's wrong with you?

363
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,090
Whenever I think of Jiaqi,

364
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,090
my heart hurts.

365
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,460
They're both my children.

366
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,860
I've treated them the same.

367
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,140
But I always feel

368
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,900
I've failed him.

369
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,650
You say that

370
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,220
because you favor Jiaqi.

371
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,380
And Jialu's not pitiful?

372
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,530
His best moment was just day one.

373
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,730
Jialu's carefree.

374
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,290
Good or bad, he doesn't take it to heart.

375
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,530
He just blurts it all out.

376
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,730
No inner wounds, you know?

377
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,330
That's true.

378
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,220
But Jiaqi's different.

379
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,050
He never tells you anything.

380
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,900
Since he was little, he's never asked me

381
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,770
for a single thing.

382
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,220
Even when he's wronged,

383
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,460
he won't say a word.

384
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,730
The more he's like that,

385
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,250
the worse I feel.

386
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,530
Next up

387
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,980
is the critical vote:

388
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,860
the CEO re-election.

389
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,420
The Chairman has made it clear

390
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,050
he'll abstain.

391
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,140
So,

392
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,810
under the company bylaws,

393
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,700
Gu Chen

394
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,420
has to win

395
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,290
an absolute majority

396
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,290
to keep his seat.

397
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,980
When Pang Jian was here,

398
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,660
it was five to five.

399
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,050
But now Pang Jian

400
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,460
has been forced out,

401
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,810
Gu Chen's side

402
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,980
will try hard to put their own guy in,

403
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,900
so they can make it six to four.

404
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,290
That they set Pang Jian up

405
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,980
is basically an open secret.

406
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,090
We just don't have proof yet.

407
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,140
So,

408
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,860
we can't touch Gu Chen for now.

409
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:02,860
But

410
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,180
no matter what,

411
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,980
we can't let him

412
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,770
keep running wild in Sen'an.

413
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:08,940
So,

414
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,530
Jiaqi,

415
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,570
you have to make a call.

416
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,050
Run for Vice GM.

417
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,490
What do you say?

418
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,660
I want Gu Chen out too.

419
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,900
But you know,

420
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,620
all these years at the company,

421
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,860
I've never picked a side.

422
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,700
I'm really not good

423
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,330
at this faction stuff.

424
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,530
I get it.

425
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,620
Honestly,

426
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,700
you don't have to pick a side.

427
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,770
Just make your own call

428
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,730
based on yourself.

429
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:47,860
Think about it.

430
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,460
In terms of ability,

431
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,180
you're the backbone of R&D,

432
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,380
but they still had to shove you

433
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,250
into Pharmacovigilance.

434
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,620
Can you

435
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,420
just swallow that?

436
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,010
We

437
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,140
just happen to want the same thing,

438
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,010
to drag Gu Chen down.

439
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,380
Just thinking about what Mr. Pang went through,

440
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,460
I'm exhausted enough.

441
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,860
And once you start this,

442
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,420
you can't back out.

443

444
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,050
think about it.

445
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,050
If Gu Chen

446
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,940
gets re-elected as CEO,

447
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,330
can you still stay at the company?
