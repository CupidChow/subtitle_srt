We split into two groups

What really happened?

Usually, if there's a commotion on the street,

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,650
you'd take a detour.

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,130
and end up like this?

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,370
You were always like,

"Uncle's here, don't worry."

237
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,940
And now you're chickening out?

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,130

You're calling me a coward?

So what do we do?

250
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,420
Just say he's busy at work,

251

254
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,850

It kept escalating,

We are named Jiaqi, Jialu

579
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,220
because our parents are from Shandong.

Chairman.

602
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,690
You...

603
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,300
you're all here.

604
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,340
Afraid you won't make it

605
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,260
in time for the last look?

606
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,050
The doctor said

607
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,010
you should talk less,

608
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,130
rest more.

609
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,050
Rest?

610
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,820
I saw it with my own eyes

611
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,490
that line...

612
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,570
went straight.

613
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,460
And I thought...

614
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,340
well, great.

615
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,010
Now I can finally rest.

616
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,260
Chairman...

617
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,380
I may be younger,

618
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,610
but I understand

619
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,340
how tough it's been for you.

620
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,490
Sen'an

621
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,690
is what you built

622
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,940
with your own blood and sweat.

623
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,530
And only you

624
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,050
can shape Sen'an's future.

625
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,940
You'll get better,

626
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,130
and lead the way

627
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,530
for all of us.

628
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,130
Following your instructions,

629
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,780
I made a five-year plan.

630
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,610
With SA-0988 launching

631
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,460
as our springboard,

632
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,130
I promise you,

633
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,650
I swear,

634
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,780
in my next term,

635
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,900
I'll get Sen'an into the top five

636
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,650
in the industry.

637
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,050
Good...

638
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,010
Good...

639
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,130
Top five...

640
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,260
Not far from number one...

641
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,090
Top five...

642
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,420
Gu Chen

643
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,650
is really something.

644
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,300
The Chairman hasn't even named a successor yet,

645
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,260
and he's already submitting his pledge.

646
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,610
"Don't worry,

647
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,380
in my term,

648
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,530
I'll get us into the top five."

649
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,490
Just look at that fake face of his.

650
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,170
How does he

651
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,740
even have the nerve to say that?

652
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,130
No matter what,

653
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,130
we can't let someone like that

654
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,780
ride over us.

655
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,900
Jiaqi's here!

656
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,530
Come on.

657
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,130
Sit!

658
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,170
Sit.

659
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,260
Let's serve the food.

660
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,690
Waiter.

661
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,530
Bring the dishes.

662
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,010
Right.

663
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,300
After Wang Licheng and Zheng Jiuliang

664
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,300
left the hospital,

665
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,050
they didn't come back here.

666
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,130
Where'd they go?

667
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,050
No idea.

668
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,820
[Gu Chen: Come out and meet me.]

669
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,980
Where did Jiang Jiaqi go?

670
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,170
No idea.

671
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,780
Isn't your phone able to hear

672
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,780
what he's saying?

673
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,530
Hand it over.

674
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,650
Hand it over.

675
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,780
Jiaqi,

676
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,570
your experience and ability

677
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,530
are both better than Deng Ning's.

678
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,260
This is something

679
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,130
everyone in the company knows.

680
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,260
The toughest part

681
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,650
is the questioning.

682
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,860
Jiaqi,

683
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,460
you're a man of integrity.

684
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,570
You've never handled an inquiry before.

685
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,010
We'll book a hotel

686
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,170
and do intensive mock training with you.

687
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,650
No more overtime.

688
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,570
And,

689
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,780
this has to stay secret.

690
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,820
What's really going on

691
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,170
between you and that contractor?

692
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,900
What is this attitude

693
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,130
supposed to mean?

694
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,460
Jiaqi,

695
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,570
if this is something

696
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,460
you find hard,

697
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,210
or you think doesn't matter,

698
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,090
you can quit.

699
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,980
If you don't have confidence,

700
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,010
then all our efforts

701
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,860
are for nothing.

702
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:25,980
I hope

703
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,860
you'll think it through carefully,

704
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,380
and make the right choice.

705
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,980
I will become Vice GM.

706
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,740
Before,

707
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,490
I really didn't like

708
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,980
all this power struggle.

709
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,690
But now I see it differently.

710
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,570
That was just me running away.

711
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,740
I have to fight

712
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,460
for the life I want.

713
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,090
So this time,

714
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,340
I'm giving it my all.

715
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,610
Very good.

716
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,860
But there's one more thing,

717
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,490
the most important thing you missed.

718
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,610
And that is,

719
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,340
take Gu Chen down.

720
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,130
Making him the target

721
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,260
gives him too much credit.

722
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,260
I'm only fighting for myself.

723
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:36,940
So that from now on,

724
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,380
I won't ever have to cross paths

725
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,010
with people like him.

726
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:40,980
Right.

727
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,210
People like that aren't even worth

728
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,090
a second glance.

729
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,740
I heard

730
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,260
he's still bragging about it,

731
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,900
saying he's so-and-so's ex-son-in-law.

732
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,210
I've never seen

733
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,420
someone get divorced

734
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,860
and still live off a woman like that.

735
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:53,820
So,

736
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,860
let's kick Gu Chen

737
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,130
out of Sen'an Pharma.

738
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,860
Out of sight, out of mind.

739
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,460
Come on.

740
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,610
Let's raise a toast.

741
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:01,820
Cheers.

742
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,490
They're just talking trash.

743
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,860
Don't listen to it.

744
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,780
If anything happens,

745
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,610
I'll tell you.

746
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,260
How's it going

747
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,130
with Jiang Jiaqi?

748
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,340
How many times have you met?

749
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,380
Two or three.

750
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,130
Two or three?

751
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,490
You can't fool me.

752
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,130
You took my money, so do your job.

753
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,070
You said

754
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,110
for someone like Jiang Jiaqi,

755
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,090
I need to take it step by step,

756
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,010
can't rush it.

757
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,260
I meant the method,

758
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,130
not the time.

759
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,420
I don't care how you do it.

760
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,010
Before the election,

761
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,260
Jiang Jiaqi has to be out.
