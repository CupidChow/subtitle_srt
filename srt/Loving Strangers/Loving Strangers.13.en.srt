00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,660

72

Do you want me to spell it out for you?

Director Jiang,

77
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,940
I'm very clear in my mind

78
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,380

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,170
So I want to ask everyone,

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,730
who doesn't know how important safety is?

83
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,340

87
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,660

93
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,010
the sooner

94
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,850
we can help them

95
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,060
delay the progression of their disease,

96
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,980
and alleviate their suffering.

97
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,890
We have such a large trial base.

98
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,220

99
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,730
on such a small probability

100

101
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,100
I believe we can

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,980
push SA-0988 to market quickly,

103
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,340

Director Jiang,

105
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,370
if this is because

106
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,540

107
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,020
I must remind you,

108
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,170
don't let them affect your work.

109
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,250

110
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,340
what the subject told me?

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,170
If it's his fault

112
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,220
that this drug won't make it to market,

113
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,810
he'll feel guilty.

114
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,580
In our family,

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,730

Mr. Wang,

120
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,340
did someone tell you something?

121
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,410
Did he tell you

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,580
if your father hides his drug allergy history,

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,980
he is likely

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,290
to be dropped from the trial?

125
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,220
What?

126
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,900
That's not what he said.

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,020
What's his name?

128
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,660
I...

129
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,020
I honestly don't remember.

130
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,340
He only said

131
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,220
he's from Sen'an Pharma.

132
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,100
He promised my dad could continue the trial.

133
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,980
That's why I agreed to say that.

134
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,810
So who should feel guilty?

135
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,850
We saw the risks,

136
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,050
yet plan to ignore them.

137
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,580
Shouldn't we feel ashamed?

There are over 10 million Alzheimer's patients

Why are we making drugs?

144
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,410
Is it for profit?

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,050
Or to save people?

146
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,930
Isn't the original intention

Are you free tonight?

194
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,900
Mom wants us to come home for dinner.

195
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,290
I still have work to finish.

196
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,290
Can't you just do it at home?

197
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,980
Mom said she hasn't seen you in a long time.

198
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,900
How about you go by yourself?

199
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,290
I'll definitely go next week.

200
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,810
I'll check my schedule

201
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,580
and let you know which day, okay?

202
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,540
No need. Go on with your work.

203
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,180
Mr. Gu.

204
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,340
Mr. Gao.

205
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,370
Mr. Gu,

206
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,730
do you have any plans for the evening?

207
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,490
Mr. Han would like to invite you to dinner.

208
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,730
There's a new restaurant.

209
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,340
He just sent me the location.

210
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,340
I have an appointment.

211
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,700
Alright.

212
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,490
I'll turn him down.

213
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,420
Next time.

214
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,340
Okay.

215
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,010
I want to play you

216
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,940
a nice song.

217
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,700
Why won't this Bluetooth speaker

218
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,700
connect to my phone?

219
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,530
Is it broken?

220
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,940
I'll help you with it in a minute.

221
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,850
He's getting pretty close with the old man.

222
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,730
What?

223
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,180
Why do I feel

224
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,490
like he's not leaving Sen'an?

225
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,730
What happened?

226
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,770
Our chairman

227
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,940
suddenly came to the company yesterday.

228
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,490
He didn't greet anyone.

229
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,060
Guess what?

230
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,610
He came specially to invite him to play a round of golf.

231
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,060
He and our chairman

232
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,940
have been in contact privately.

233
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,490
He never mentioned it to you?

234
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,610
Don't you talk

235
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,580
at home at all?

236
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,820
Maybe the Chairman

237
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,980
isn't that important to him?

238
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,820
But he's important to me.

239
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,490
The Chairman goes out

240
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,770
with you every week.

241
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,300
But he only invited him once.

242
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,940
Are you so nervous about it?

243
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,700
Do you think he'll leave Sen'an?

244
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,820
Whether it's changing jobs or starting a business,

245
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,420
it all takes time.

246
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,300
Besides,

247
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,490
you know his character.

248
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,060
He won't make decisions so easily.

249
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,770
Don't worry about it.

250
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,220
Let's eat.

251
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,300
Let's eat.

252
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,940
Jiaqi!

253
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,490
Mom!

254
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,580
You forgot to take this!

255
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,580
Crispy Ribbonfish.

256
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,650
Why deliver them?

257
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,700
I can have them next time.

258
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,530
They're for Yijun.

259
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,530
Don't refrigerate them. Eat them fresh.

260
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,940
I have water boiling on the stove.

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,850
I need to head back.

262
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,220
Take care!

263
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,650
Let's down another bottle...

264
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,700
One more bottle...

265
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,700
Not too much...

266
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,100
Watch where you're going!

267
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,490
Are you blind?

268
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,890
Paying attention...

269
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:05,850
Come here!

270
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,940
He's just an old guy. Stop...

271
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,650
Come here!

272
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,420
Get lost already!

273
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,180
Let's go. Watch out...

274
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,730
Is everything okay with Mom?

275
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,340
She made Crispy Ribbonfish for you.

276
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,250
Eat them for me.

277
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,010
They're your favorite.

278
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,940
The information

279
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,100
on the biopharmaceutical company,

280
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,850
I found it for you.

281
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,650
I'll place it here.

282
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,490
Well,

283
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,100
Jiangbei High-tech Park

284
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,130
is currently recruiting.

285
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,370
I contacted their operations director.

286
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,770
They're really interested

287
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,700
in clinical pharmaceutical

288
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,940
trial service companies.

289
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,890
If it's from Sen'an,

290
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,060
we can talk about...

291
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,490
we can talk about the first year

292
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,010
with tax exemptions and rent-free terms.

293
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,530
They also helped apply

294
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,820
for high-tech enterprise qualifications.

a nice spot at Baihua Mountain.

300
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,420
I plan

301
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,820
to bring firewood and a tent there

302
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,530
this weekend.

303
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,490

The doctor said,

312
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,770
you shouldn't drink strong tea.

313
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,570
This one is light.

314
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,090
Please.

315
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,180
When people get older,

316
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,940
they're always being taken care of.

317
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,570
It's really uncomfortable.

318
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,700
What about this?

319
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,010
I'll roast some lamb kidneys for you at noon.

320
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,980
Good!

321
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,860
Good?

322
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,700
You just can't stop eating.

323
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,010
Why didn't you

324
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,090
bring more people with you?

325
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,940
You're still a CEO after all.

326
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,730
Look at you,

327
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,090
running around doing everything,

328
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,900
you know.

329
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,420
Out here in the wild,

330
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,490
you gotta do things yourself.

331
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,330
That's where the real fun is.

332
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,420
I'm very similar to you in this respect.

333
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,980
Besides,

334
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,900
I really enjoy hearing your stories

335
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,770
from your time in the countryside.

336
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,140
I always learn so much.

337
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,490
Alright.

338
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,660
I know you're just trying to make me happy.

339
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,250
Today's young people

340
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,570
are not interested

341
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,010
in this at all.

342
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,250
That's because they've never heard of it.

343
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,330
I actually can't wait for it.

344
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,140
Add some firewood.

345
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,490
When I was little in the village,

346
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,090
after harvesting the rapeseed,

347
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,570
we would burn the straw.

348
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,420
The whole field

349
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,730
would crackle with fire and smoke.

350
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,220
It was beautiful!

351
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,570
Let me tell you...

352
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,940
You're here too?

353
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,380
Chairman.

354
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,140
Mr. Gu asked me to come.

355
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,620
Why didn't you tell me?

356
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,730
Chairman,

357
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,490
weren't you always trying to invite Director Jiang out?

358
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,140
Here he is.

359
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,050
Alright.

360
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,010
Sounds good!

361
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,900
Grab a chair for yourself.

362
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,860
Okay.

363
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,220
That's great.

364
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,700
Director Jiang, I didn't expect you

365
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,530
to be so knowledgeable about the outdoors.

366
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,420
I haven't heard the sound of burning firewood in a long time.

367
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,140
Looks like we've finally found

368
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,050
something we can both enjoy doing together.

369
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,290
You two were in the same major

370
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,900
back in college?

371
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,010
Yeah.

372
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,700
Same major.

373
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,530
We both studied pharmaceutical chemistry.

374
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,250
My senior was a grad student,

375
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,010
and I was an undergrad.

376
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,700
Before graduation,

377
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,010
I was lucky to join his project

378
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,860
and help.

379
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,290
As an undergrad,

380
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,730
you got into a graduate project group?

381
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,620
I owe it to his recommendation.

382
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,570
My senior's advisor

383
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,330
is a top figure in the research world.

384
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,380
All of their projects are national-level.

385
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,860
It really helped me with my application to go abroad.

386
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,050
Here, Jiaqi.

387
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,490
Your coffee.

388
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,810
So you two aren't from the same year?

389
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,490
How did you meet?

390
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,010
The choir.

391
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,220
The choir?

392
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,180
You

393
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,380
actually joined the choir?

394
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,770
It must have been

395
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,140
to chase after a girl, right?

396
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,420
Flip it over.

397
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,420
It's almost burnt.

398
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,180
Look at you.

399
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,730
Where's the salt?

400
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,490
It's in the back tent.

401
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,380
[What's going on? Why is he here?]

402
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,180
What are you doing?

403
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,180
[What's going on? Why is he here?]

404
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,940
If you dare contact her,

405
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,530
you're done for.

406
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,290
Chairman, please stay seated.

407
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,090
We'll take care of it.

408
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,810
It's fine.

409
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,380
Let's do it together.

410
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:24,940
Chairman,

411
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,420
your car's here.

412
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,700
Why don't you go back first?

413
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,420
No need.

414
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,980
We'll finish up

415
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,730
and leave together.

416
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,330
Hurry up.

417
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,860
What do you want, exactly?

418
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,900
You came here today

419
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,530
just to show off

420
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,380
in front of the Chairman?

421
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,180
Does it help you for the Chairman

422
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,810
to know that?

423
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,620
From the first time

424
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,570
I saw you in school,

425
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,770
I felt uncomfortable all over.

426
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,180
The way you were full of ambition

427
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,180
because of your self-doubt

428
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,570
just made me feel uneasy.

429
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,900
I know what kind of person you are.

430
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,730
To climb higher,

431
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,490
you'll stop at nothing,

432
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,220
no morals whatsoever.

433
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,490
But I didn't expect

434
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,730
you'd do something

435
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,530
so disgusting!

436
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,090
Frame me, get rid of me,

437
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,700
and then what?

438
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,940
Have her divorce me,

439
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,010
and you'll marry her?

440
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,220
No way.

441
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,140
How could someone like you marry a woman

442
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,180
who has no money, no background,

443
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,570
is divorced,

444
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,380
and has a kid?

445
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,420
Go ahead.

446
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,290
What do you want to do?

447
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,570
I have just one question.

448
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,420
Does she know

449
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,700
that you framed me

450
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,940
and tried to get rid of me?

451
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,980
Does she know, exactly?

452
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,330
This has nothing to do with her.

453
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,980
I can guarantee that.

454
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,330
My original intention was never like this.

455
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,220
There were some unexpected events.

456
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,660
She's afraid you'll be wronged at the company.

457
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,660
She hopes you can leave

458
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,860
with some dignity.

459
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,010
Jiang Jiaqi,

460
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,770
as long as you resign voluntarily,

461
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,180
I guarantee you the best conditions.

462
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,700
I'll personally write you a recommendation letter.

463
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,570
I'll make sure you leave

464
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,050
with enough dignity.

465
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,700
Dignity?

466
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,290
Hurry and go to the hospital.

467
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,490
Take care.

468
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,770
Break up with her soon.

469
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,090
I don't care what reason you use.

470
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,730
Just do it as soon as possible.

471
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,490
And,

472
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,050
she cannot know

473
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,010
what I know.

474
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,730
It's impossible

475
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,290
to hide it now.

476
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,530
It must be hidden.

477
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,090
As long as you two break up quietly,

478
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,290
I can overlook the past.

479
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,530
But no matter what,

480
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,660
she can't know.

481
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,140
This is the only condition on which I'll forgive you.

482
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,570
Don't even think about secretly telling her,

483
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,180
or making her act in front of me.

484
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,770
After living together for so many years,

485
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,940
she won't be able to fool me.

486
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,700
Just do as I say.

487
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,940
If you try any tricks again,

488
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,730
it's over for you.

489
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,500
[Emergency Department]

490
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,530
Look at the time.

491
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,420
Weren't we supposed to get up early?

492
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,900
Why are we working late again?

493
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,220
What time can we drink tonight?

494
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,090
There's almost nothing left.

495
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,900
Seriously,

496
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,940
anyone else can do this little task.

497
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,900
Why does Chi have to ask us?

498
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,140
He's got a few shares in us,

499
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,330
and that makes him special?

500
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,330
Just bossing us around.

501
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,530
Yeah, we owe him.

502
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,530
We're at his mercy.

503
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:35,980
We drive his car.

504
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,940
We owe him a lot.

505
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,330
You scared me to death!

506
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,570
Youyou,

507
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,530
what are you doing here?

508
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,220
It's so late,

509
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,220
and it's cold out here.

510
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,290
Come on, let's get inside.

511
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,010
Jiang Jialu, where are you going?

512
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,090
Why are you just leaving

513
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,290
without a word?

514
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,380
Youyou,

515
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,490
don't mind that.

516
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,490
Get inside now.

517
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,420
Only instant coffee left.

518
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,380
Just drink that.

519
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,290
Or just warm your hands on it.

520
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,380
Well...

521
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,330
that day, I was wrong.

522
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,810
I said it too harshly.

523
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,940
You were just unlucky

524
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,090
to end up in my crew.

525
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,660
So you're saying

526
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,420
my acting isn't that bad?

527
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,900
It's actually

528
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,570
your agent's fault.

529
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,140
Why not be a good idol

530
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,570
instead of acting in my crew?

531
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,490
You're not even getting paid much.

532
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,010
I forced my agent to make the deal.

533
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,420
Then it's your fault.

534
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,010
Right.

535
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,770
It's my fault

536
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,090
I fell for a fool like you.

537
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,420
With that EQ,

538
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,220
you're probably hopeless.

539
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,900
Why haven't you been answering your phone?

540
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,050
Your son can't even find you.

541
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,460
Your dad's here.

542
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,460
Look!

543
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,730
He's changing clothes.

544
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,460
Tell him whatever you want.

545
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,460
Dad,

546
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,380
where are you?

547
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,250
I can't see you.

548
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,420
He's here.

549
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:34,980
Dad,

550
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,770
hurry up.

551
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,460
Hello, Dad.

552
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:41,860
Dad,

553
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,900
why haven't you been

554
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,810
answering my calls?

555
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,730
Sorry, I didn't hear them.

556
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,490
It's fine.

557
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,090
Dad,

558
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,090
our school gave us an assignment

559
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,290
that requires your help.

560
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,570
What assignment?

561
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,180
Show your special skills in a video.

562
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,730
Just film it and send it over.

563
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,140
You've got a few days to prepare.

564
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,460
Send it to me by the weekend.

565
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,730
Mom,

566
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,730
help my dad.

567
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,010
Help him prepare properly.

568
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,660
Did you hear that?

569
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,010
Your son wants you to prepare well.

570
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,610
No problem.

571
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,860
But

572
