The moment food comes up, you sit right down.

190
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,980
The moment work comes up, you run to the bathroom.

191
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,250
What did you tell me back then?

192
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,530
You said, "All you'd do was drive,

193
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,940
and when it came to heavy lifting,

194
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,850
you'd give me a little hand."

195
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,420
Is that what this is? Is it?

196
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,490
All you know is how to slack off.

197
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,770
You have a new order.

198
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,420
Yu Garden. No loading or unloading required.

199
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,700
I'll take it.

200
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,890
The moment you hear it's close to home

201
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,420
with no lifting involved, you're all in.

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,420
Didn't you say I'm the elder?

203
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,060
If I'm the elder,

204
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,420
shouldn't I be setting an example?

205
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,220
None of this makes any sense.

206
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,770
You're something else, seriously.

207
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,540
[Sis]

208
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,420
Sis.

209
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,220
Dongshan.

210
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,700
What time are you coming to pick up the food?

211
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,010
I've already got everything ready here.

212
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,700
In a bit.

213
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,250
Your good son

214
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,850
assigned me another job again.

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,010
Said it's near our place.

216
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,850
Later, give all the food

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,890
to Jialu.

218
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,370
At my age,

219
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,250
what am I eating for anyway?

220
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,100
I'm not eating.

221
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,100
So many issues.

222
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,770
If you're not eating, then nobody eats.

223
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,490
Honestly...

224
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,300
Oh, give it a rest.

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,820
Aren't I the elder?

226
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,980
This elder will set an example for you.

227
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,610
Right?

228
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,220
I'll carry it up myself later.

229
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,530
You don't have to lift a finger.

230
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,850
Just stand there and watch.

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,610
Get up.

232
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,530
Stop putting on an act here.

233
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,890
Leave it alone.

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,980
Go take your order.

235
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,490
Help me carry this inside.

236
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,220
Thanks.

237
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,130
One, two, three.

238
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,650
Put this all the way inside.

Yes, move everything today.

251
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,580
Right.

Okay.

Well then...

just call me.

Come help me move the beauty machine.

262

Oh my god.

263
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,100
How can this be placed here?

264
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,490
I went to so much trouble

265
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,580
to invite it from a master.

266
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,580
Can it really stay here?

267
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,100
Move it inside.

268
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,610
Boss.

269
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,890
Buddy, hold on a second.

270
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,370
This is Lord Guan, right?

271
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,490
You can't say "move."

272
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,220
You have to say "invite."

273
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,370
Right.

274
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,370
Isn't that so?

275
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,940
As the saying goes,

276
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,010
when the God of Wealth enters, you must first honor the gods.

277
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,650
So,

278
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,180
now that Lord Guan has arrived,

279
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,850
there needs to be a small ritual

280
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,220
to invite the God of Wealth inside.

281
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,580
Lord Guan enters the door.

282
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,490
Lord Guan comes home.

Good. Very good.

Come take a look at this.

I've been coaxing him all day.

after I split up with Jialu,

359
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,290
I went to a shop

00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,660
called Peterfu.

361
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,010
I saw they were short-handed,

so I figured I'd lend a hand.

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,290
because I, a stinking hauler,

368
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,050
broke it.

00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,570
You're the owner here, right?

567
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,860
Hello.

568
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,820
You are...?

569
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,130
Yesterday, was there someone

570
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,210
who knelt down here?

571
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,610
What exactly are you trying to do?

572
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,690
That man was my uncle.

573
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,490
And?

574
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,090
Honestly, kneeling is just kneeling.

575
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,010
It's nothing worth making a fuss over.

576
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,570
Everyone gets hurt

577
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,570
at some point growing up.

578
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,420
You've knelt before.

579
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,530
So have I.

580
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,530
Getting slapped, being humiliated.

581
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,530
None of that really matters.

582
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,610
As long as your family doesn't know,

583
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,010
it's nothing at all.

584
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,530
So what do you actually want?

585
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,740
My mother saw it.

586
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,820
When you made my uncle kneel,

587
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,860
my mother saw everything.

588
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,530
So what?

589
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,860
She saw it, so what?

590
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,490
What difference does that make?

591
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,900
Isn't that just how the world works?

592
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,690
When you're down, you kneel to others.

593
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,530
When you make it,

594
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,570
others kneel to you.

595
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,690
But everyone has a line they won't cross.

596
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,820
My family is that line.

597
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,690
If anyone

598
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,570
hurts my family,

599
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,820
there's nothing I wouldn't do.

600
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,130
Your son ran off.

601
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,740
You are the ones left to pay it back.

602
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,210
Everything that happened today

603
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,490
was brought on by your son.

604
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,780
What exactly do you want?

605
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,170
I want you to go and apologize.

606
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,530
What?

607
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,090
Me?

608
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,050
Apologize?

609
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,420
Are you out of your mind?

610
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,340
Are you going or not?

611
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,170
I am not going.

612
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:17,940
Not going, right?

613
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,490
Fine.

614
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,740
Get out now!

615
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,650
Telomerase, right?

616
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,340
Automatically synthesized too?

617
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,820
If you could really do that,

618
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,130
you would already have a Nobel Prize.

619
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,530
What are you trying to pull here?

620
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,420
I am running a business.

621
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,210
Fifty-nine percent

622
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,010
fullerene essence?

623
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,010
If that were real,

624
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,130
you would have gone bankrupt long ago.

625
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,170
Put that down.

626
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,260
Where is the production license?

627
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,490
Where is the hygiene permit?

628
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,010
Product standards and batch numbers.

629
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,260
There is no expiration date either.

630
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,380
None.

631
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,940
No!

632
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,170
None of it!

633
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,340
There is nothing at all!

634
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,490
Stop smashing them!

635
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,940
Do you want me to keep going?

636
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,980
Or should I call

637
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,010
the market regulators and the drug authority?

638
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,690
I will go.

639
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,050
I will go, okay?

640
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,980
Go apologize right now.

641
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,980
Then shut this shop down.

642
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,090
If I see

643
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,420
you selling these unlicensed products again,

644
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,740
you are finished.

645
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,050
It is nothing.

646
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,050
It is nothing.

647
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,780
It is nothing.

649
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,570

Chu Dan is back.

651
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,820
How was Spain?

652
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,530
You listened for so long.

653
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,820
Did you find anything?

654
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,050
Are you going to a part-time job?

655
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,300
See you tomorrow.

656
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,940
He is a good person.

657
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,900
Maybe I just do not understand him.

658
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,490
There is someone who seems to understand me.

659
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,570
And I understand her too.

660
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,340
She understands me.

661
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,300
That makes me feel really sad.
