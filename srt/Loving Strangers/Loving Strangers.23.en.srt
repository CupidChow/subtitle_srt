Gu Chen wants to harm Jiang Jiaqi.

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,980
Let's meet.

196
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,770
Right now.

197
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,340
I knew you'd do something

198
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,220
out of the ordinary.

199
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,820
But I didn't expect it

200
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,130
to be so despicable.

201
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,100
Faking Jiang Jiaqi's scandal?

202
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,490
Fine.

203
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,490
Then let's spill everything.

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,980
My affair with you,

let's reveal it all.

208

Let everyone know.

209
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,730
I can also ruin you right away.

210
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,890
Why did I do this before?

211
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,940
Wasn't it to make sure

212
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,700
we could be together?

213
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,250
Stop beautifying yourself.

214
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,980
In your ambition,

215
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,250
everyone's just a tool.

216
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,220
Is that wrong?

217
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,730
Since I was born

218
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,770
in this jungle,

219
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,220
I have to play by its rules

220

to survive.

221
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,980
It feels good dumping all the blame on me,

222
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,850
doesn't it?

223
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,300
Let me tell you, Gu Chen.

224
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,530
Being with you

225
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,940
has already ruined me.

226
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,730
But,

227
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,340
I won't allow you

228
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,850
to ruin Jiang Jiaqi.

229
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,940
You have no idea how glorious he is now.

232
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,250
Stop doing

234
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,370
And leave Sen'an.

235
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,850
It's too late.

236

It's already blown up.

Face what?

239
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,770
The company is gossiping

240
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,890
about my scandal with him,

241
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,060
and they even took photos.

242
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,980
If I leave,

243
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,650
it'll make the situation even more suspicious.

244
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,530
If you don't stop,

245
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,010
I'll go to your company today

246
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,610
and announce it to everyone.

247
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,130
Shall we stop?

248
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,730
Do you need me to decide that?

249
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,650
Why are you doing this?

250
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,300
What's the point of all this?

251
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,610
Can't we just live our lives peacefully?

252
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,490
I'm not like you.

253
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,420
I can't go back.

If it's my fault,

257
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,210
I'll take the blame.

258
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,770
But he can't be hurt anymore.

259

If you keep doing this,

260
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,850
then wait for it...

261
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,250

Do you really think Zhou Yu'an's after money?

265
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,300
For what, then?

it was fine to speak well of Deng Ning,

Director Jiang chose you

it was Director Jiang who picked me.

316

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,570
that the small things

When there's a staff gathering,

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,900
he'll invite me along.

When the company customizes notebooks,

367

he'll put my name on the distribution list.

When I do something right, he praises me.

369

When I make a mistake, he corrects me.

00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,730

I can't help but take a second look,

375
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,980
because I feel

376
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,250
it's connected to me.

424

Yes, I'm crazy!

573
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,660
Crazy enough to like someone like you!

574
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,330
Come on.

575
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,380
Hit me.

576
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,660
Let go.

577
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,620
Just hit me.

578
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,620
If you don't hit me,

579
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,180
I'll take it as you like me too.

580
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,980
I'll tell everyone

581
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,660
Jiang Jiaqi likes Zhou Yu'an!

582
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,620
Seducing older men?

583
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,530
Let's listen again.

584
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,290
Yes.

585
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,170
That's none of your concern.

586
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,530
Inside the company,

587
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,530
when men and women with such a gap

588
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,740
get involved like this,

589
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,980
is it love

590
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,530
or is it using position for harassment?

591
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,090
It all depends on how the story is told.

592
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,380
This is...

593
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,300
that Gu,

594
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,050
the CEO of the company.

595
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,170
He should be interested

596
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,090
in this.

597
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,740
Looks like we're going to get rich.

598
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,490
Jialu,

599
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,900
why are you in such a hurry?

600
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,340
What are you here for?

601
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,540
You didn't even take the dumplings.

602
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,210
It's okay, hurry up.

603
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,690
The door's been fixed.

604
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,620
Call if you have any problems.

605
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,300
Okay, thanks.

606
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,170
We'll take the broken door away.

607
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,620
Bye.

608
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,380
Yijun.

609
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,530
Yijun.

610
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,420
Jialu,

611
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,380
Uncle.

612
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,530
Why are you here?

613
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,420
- Yijun. - Mom asked us

614
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,650
to bring these dumplings to you.

615
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,090
Have a seat.

616
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,170
I'll get you some fruit.

617
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,300
Change your shoes.

618
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,690
No need to change.

619
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,530
Just sit on the couch.

620
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,170
It's fine.

621
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,690
We haven't been here in a while.

622
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:39,940
What a comfy couch!

623
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,940
You guys had an argument?

624
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,170
What are you talking about?

625
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,340
No way

626
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,380
they would argue.

627
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,280
Well, there's a huge hole at the door.

628
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,650
You can tell it was punched.

629
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,300
Yijun, is something wrong?

630
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,090
Nothing's wrong.

631
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,260
Then,

632
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,460
why was he so upset?

633
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,610
Is it necessary for him?

634
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,820
I made a mistake.

635
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,050
What could you have done wrong?

636
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,130
Did you cheat?

637
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,260
Hey, I'll slap you!

638
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,860
You're being so rude!

639
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,650
Look,

640
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,940
you really speak without thinking.

641
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,260
If you stay silent, I'll take it as yes.

642
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,130
Yijun,

643
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,130
don't take this kid seriously.

644
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,900
He's out of his mind today.

645
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,530
What's wrong with you?

646
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,530
You really cheated?

647
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,260
Jiaqi, what happened to your hand?

648
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,570
It's fine.

649
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,940
No, a big wound like that is not fine.

650
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,650
It's really nothing.

651
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,650
You've left it exposed.

652
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,650
It could get infected

653
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,530
or cause tetanus.

654
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,170
Hurry up, I'll help you with the bandage.

655
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,300
Quick, I'll tear this open.

656
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,050
Jialu...

657
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,010
What happened?

658
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,260
What's wrong, Jiaqi?

659
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:48,900
Not playing anymore?

660
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,820
How am I supposed to play?

661
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,260
What does this mean, Jiaqi?

662
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,780
Jialu.

663
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,380
What are you doing, Jialu?

664
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,650
What are you doing, Jialu?

665
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,300
I'm looking for my brother!

666
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,380
Why are you looking for your brother?

667
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,780
I'm going to find that person!

668
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,900
I'm going to kill him!

669
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,780
Calm down. Jialu!

670
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,650
I can't calm down!

671
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,690
He's my brother!

672
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,420
My real brother!

673
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,820
Are you crazy?

674
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,820
How old are you, huh?

675
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,820
You don't really get it?

676
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,740
Can we say that out loud?

677
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,210
Can we say that out loud, huh?

678
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,210
Look at what you've become!

679
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,860
How much must your brother be suffering?

680
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,260
Director, huh?

681
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,860
Jiaqi,

682
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,210
what's going on

683
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,130
with you and that outsourced girl?

684
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,380
When I heard this rumor,

685
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,650
my first thought was,

686
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,130
it must have been arranged by Gu Chen.

687
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,690
But it's fine.

688
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,130
Keep an eye on that girl,

689
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,570
and you'll surely catch

690
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,490
Gu Chen's tracks.

691
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,940
Impossible.

692
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,050
When you're involved,

693
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,090
it's hard to see clearly.

694
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:30,980
You...

695
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,820
you're just not the type

696
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,170
to have rumors.

697
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,380
If you go over this from the start,

698
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,210
it'll become clear.

699
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,420
First, the cards that bribed you

700
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,570
were thrown away.

701
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,050
That way,

702
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,420
no one in the company would believe

703
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,610
you'd do something like that.

704
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,980
He had no other choice.

705
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,050
In his panic,

706
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,260
he found a female employee

707
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,570
and set a trap for you.

708
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,160
But their good days

709
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,090
are about to end.

710
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,210
I'll find the clue soon,

711
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,820
and clear my name.

712
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,940
I've checked all the surveillance

713
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,900
around the karaoke bar

714
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,610
that night.

715
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,300
And I've got leads

716
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,570
on that kid who tricked me.

717
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,170
Where are you?

718
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,740
It was my mistake

719
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,780
that Chen Ren took the computer.

720
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,090
Now you need to worry about Pang Jian.

721
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,380
He must have found something.

722
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,170
To be safe,

723
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,460
you should find a place to hide.

724
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,300
And switch your phone.

725
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,380
Let's go together.

726
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,740
The computer has all the recordings.

727
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,010
Chen Ren will definitely use them

728
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,780
against you.

729
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,530
I need to wait a little longer.

730
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,530
You're doing this for Jiang Jiaqi?

731
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,210
After the Vice GM election,

732
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,530
I'll leave Sen'an.

733
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,010
You can't even protect yourself.

734
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,530
Why are you still worried about him?

735
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,940
Whether he gets selected or not,

736
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,690
Gu Chen won't let you off the hook.

737
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,740
Since he's so overwhelmed right now,

738
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,530
you should take the chance and escape.

739
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,570
Grandma doesn't have much time left.

740
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,860
I want to stay with her.

741
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,260
You're not planning to turn yourself in?

742
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,980
I can't turn myself in just yet.

743
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,530
If I do,

744
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,130
everything about his wife and Gu Chen

745
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,010
would come out.

746
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,530
So?

747
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,300
I've dragged you into this.

748
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,300
You should go first.

749
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,980
