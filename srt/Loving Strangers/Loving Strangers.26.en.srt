and feed her the information.

195
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,220
I'm not as good

196
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,100

197
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,100
You really are.

198
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,060
You're an exceptionally good person.

199
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,460
She didn't come?

200
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,580
Who?

201

That girl.

202

She's here.

203
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,300
My dad used to say,

204
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,010
nothing was ever a big deal.

205
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,630

206
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,100

After he passed,

[Nothing is a big deal.]
no one ever said that to me again.

208
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,180
You said you didn't know Pang Jian.

209
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,300
Why lie?

210
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,490
That surveillance app,

211
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,650
did Zhou Yu'an install it,

212
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,610
or did you?

213
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,300
We already

214
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,700

215
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,980
on Jiang Jiaqi's phone.

216
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,130
Under normal circumstances,

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,130
Zhou Yu'an...

218
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,130
I installed it.

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,940
Computers and networks

Who put you up to this?

222
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,730
No one.

223
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,340
Zhou Yu'an is my friend.

224
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,420
At work,

225
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,060
her bosses and coworkers bullied her.

226
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,420
I got angry,

227
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,650
and wanted to stand up for her,

228
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,490
to get back at them.

229
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,340
This whole thing,

Sure, no problem.

Now.

244
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,270
You forced Zhou Yu'an

to spy on me.

246
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,250
You made a young girl

do your dirty work.

248
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,980
Do you have no shame?

249
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,130
You said you were standing up for her.

250
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,770
Standing up for her, right?

251
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,340
What did I do wrong?

252
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,220
Why don't you ask her

253
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,220
what she did to me?

254
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,490
She took my money,

255
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,650
then turned on me,

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,250
and helped you become Vice GM.

257
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,730
I had her spy on you,

258
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,220
but she spied on me instead.

259
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,010
She even made me abstain from voting.

260
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,580
Because of the girl

261
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,460
you keep defending,

262
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm about to lose

Where is she?

266
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,420
Where is she?

267
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,700
You're asking me?

268
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,490
You don't know?

269
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,980
She said she'd run as hard as she could

270
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,730
so as not to get caught.

271
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,460
Because once she's caught,

272
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,220
everything comes out.

273
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,010
And then you

274
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,820
would be publicly humiliated.

275
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,010
She also said, no matter what,

276
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,700
she'd never reveal the affair.

277
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,580
Publicly humiliated...

278
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,490
Isn't that what you fear most?

279
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,300
Am I the only one at fault?

280
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,130
You're the most disgusting of all.

281

You're filthy yourself,

283
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,980
be so loyal to you?

284
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,420
You two aren't clean, are you?

285
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,530
What you did to her,

387
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,490
that coworker who quit,

388
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,490
it was her, wasn't it?

389
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,900

390
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,290

If she comes back,

394
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,050

461
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,250
So, Jiaqi,

462
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,420
are you in contact with Zhou Yu'an?

463
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,530
No.

Gu Chen

467

wants Zhou Yu'an

to take the fall alone.

He said she did all this on her own

470
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,570
because she likes Jiang Jiaqi,

471
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,460

474
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,090

you'll need to go to the hospital.

Those injuries from before,

498
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,860
did he do that to you?

499
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,570
Why didn't you call the police?

500
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,900
I couldn't.

He used to be kind when we were kids.

502
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,900
After my parents ran off,

503
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,770
his dad kept coming to my place for money.

504
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,010
He'd find ways

505
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,290
to warn me in advance.

506
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,620
And he took plenty of hits for me, too.

507
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,290
He only turned into this

508
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,530
after his father died.

509
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,770
One time,

510
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,980
I saw him use broken glass

511
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,140
to cut his arm.

512
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,130
And I thought,

513
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,300
maybe it'd be better if he hit me instead.

514
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,170
So I said things on purpose,

515
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,010
just to set him off.

516
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,900
He finally laid a hand on me.

517
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,090
Like hitting me

518
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,650
was the only way he felt less pain.

519
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,420
And when he hit me,

520
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,610
I somehow felt calmer inside.

521
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,900
