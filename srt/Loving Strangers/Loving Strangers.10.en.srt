Does it make any difference?

15
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,980
You're already a month and a half late on rent.

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,660
I don't think I need to spell it out.

17

I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,500
You should just move out.

19
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,170
You've got some nerve.

20
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,100
You actually leave

Don't take this the wrong way.

29

Besides,

32

when I rented the place to you,

33
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,850
I made it

34
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,690
very clear.

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,500

only you would live here.

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,100
That's why I gave you a low rent.

38
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,170
Turns out my kindness

39
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,820
was misplaced.

Didn't you say

76
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,810
you'd get some juicy photos

77

This kind of recording won't hold up.

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,250
So there's something hidden

in those photos?

113
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,780
Pang Jian handled this in a pretty disgusting way.

114

116
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,850
Then send the recording to the Inspection Office.

117
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,580
If they dig up

118
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,410
the photos,

119
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,410
that gives us the evidence.

120
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,140
Send the recording to the Inspection Office mailbox.

Okay.

122

Even if you don't want to pick a side,

123
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,540
you'll still need to keep yourself safe.

124
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,780
If they're set on

125
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,170
taking you down,

126
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,290
you'd better have a gun in your hand

127
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,700
to stay alive.

128
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,730
I have no way back.

129
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,410
I can only go all in.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,220
But you still have a choice.

131
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,490
If you switch over to Gu Chen now,

132
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,410
it's not too late.

133
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,980
I'm just a researcher.

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,170
I don't want to climb the ladder.

135
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,810
There's no need to get involved in those.

136
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,290
I really want to ask

137
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,410
what exactly is going on

138
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,780
between you and Gu Chen?

139
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,250
There's no beef.

140
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,930
We're just not the same kind of people.

141
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,370
Be honest.

142
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,020
Why do you

143
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,810
hate him so much?

144
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,020
Last year,

145
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,490
we ran into each other in the elevator.

146
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,410

147
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,700
That's it?

148
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,370
He smiled at you?

149
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,810
Someone who never talks to you

150
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,660

151
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,580

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,540
Doesn't that feel off?

153
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,020
I knew right then

154
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,980
he must've done something.

I should go.

Zhou Yu'an.

You're kind.

215
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,490
Director Jiang,

216
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,420
the company laptops have arrived.

217
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,050
Please sign here

218
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,980
so I can collect them.

219
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,660
Okay.

220
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,530
Isn't everyone getting one?

221
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,290
Yeah, everyone gets one.

222
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,770
Include Zhou Yu'an as well.

223
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,010
But she's a contractor.

224
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,860
We've never

225
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,900
issued laptops to contractors.

226
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,660
She works for Sen'an too.

227
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,180
Her performance reviews

228
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,380
come through our department, right?

229
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,420
Exactly.

230
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,900
It's just one more name.

231
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,220
Fine, I'll do it.

232
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,050
Which character is her name?

233
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,530
Who looks after your grandma

234
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,620
while you're at work?

235
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,010
A friend helps out when they can.

236
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,140
Zhou Yu'an.

237
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,660
It's a good name.

238
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,530
My son's name

239
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,420
also has "An" in it.

240
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,660
Before the child was born,

241
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,770
I had all kinds of expectations.

242
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,530
But the moment he's born,

243
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,810
there's only one wish left.

244
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,050
I hope he lives safely and well
["An" means "safely and well"]

245
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,420
for his whole life.

246
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,530
He will.

247
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,660
He was born into a good family.

248
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,420
No matter what kind of family it is,

249
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,770
parents

250
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,620
love their children.

251
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,940
Some parents see their children

252
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,810
as a burden.

253
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,010
Move a bit to the right.

254
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,250
Can you turn?

255
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,900
Give it a push on your end.

256
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,530
I am.

257
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,180
Can you move it that way?

258
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,860
Can you turn it?

259
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,620
Hey. You're on top. Give it a push.

260
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,290
I can't get a grip. It's slipping.

261
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,250
I'm done.

262
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,770
Come on.

263
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,010
We're almost at the door.

264
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,220
Hurry up.

265
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,770
Didn't you hear that crack?

266
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,980
Hang in there.

267
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,090
Why are you taking orders?

268
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,900
I didn't. I turned it off.

269
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,220
Tips?

270
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,140
[Tip]
Isn't this your human model?

271
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,660
What's wrong?

272
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,980
You took off too hard.

273
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,290
Don't bring her up again.

274
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,380
You talk like you have a grudge against her.

275
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,330
Is she the one

276
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,180
who couldn't act?

277
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,490
Yeah. Her.

278
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,860
Because of her,

279
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,380
I ended up like this.

280
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,900
Didn't you win

281
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,010
that international award?

282
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,770
Everyone at your company

283
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,050
was supporting you.

284
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,180
They were.

285
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,010
I shot my first film

286
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,380
not long after.

287
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,180
Who knew

288
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,980
I'd run into

289
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,530
a female lead who couldn't act at all?

290
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,250
You were the director, weren't you?

291
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,380
You called the shots.

292
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,700
You could've replaced her

293
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,420
with someone better.

294
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,700
I wanted to.

295
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,570
The investors wouldn't allow it.

296
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,700
I coached her for days, but nothing worked.

297
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,660
I had no choice but to shoot it.

298
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,220
If she acted badly, that was on her.

299
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,860
But that shouldn't have ruined you

300
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,620
for years.

301
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,860
I was the director.

302
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,140
The film came out

303
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,180
and flopped on its first day.

304
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,810
Word got around fast.

305
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,050
No one dared hire me again.

306
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,940
And of course,

307
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,700
no one hired her either.

308
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,660
Quick.

309
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,860
Two catties each.

310
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,490
This and this.

311
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,220
Okay.

312
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,570
Scan here.

313
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,140
Take your stuff.

314
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,380
Why didn't you lend a hand

315
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,490
when we were carrying the mattress?

316
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,010
Fine.

317
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,940
Close the door for me.

318
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,180
Director Jiang.

319
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,900
What a coincidence.

320
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,490
What a coincidence.

321
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,490
Yeah.

322
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,660
I was passing by to buy some fruit.

323
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,490
How did you find me?

324
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,220
I didn't. I passed by here.

325
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,860
That act was terrible.

326
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,220
If I had a monitor,

327
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,380
I'd replay it for you.

328
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,980
Was it terrible?

329
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:42,940
I...

330
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,700
Be honest.

331
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,660
Were you following us?

332
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,490
What do you want?

333
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,180
Why would she follow you?

334
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,700
You're Director Jiang's...

335
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,290
I'm his uncle.

336
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,250
That explains it.

337
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,700
You two

338
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,860
do look alike.

339
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,860
Do we?

340
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,290
Uncles look like their nephews,

341
00:23:59,310 --> 00:23:59,900
right?

342
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,700
How could I take after him?

343
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,900
My bad.

344
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,140
It's fine.

345
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,580
Director Jiang.

346
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,620
What is it?

347
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,620
Wait a second.

348
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,860
Can we take a photo?

349
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,050
For what?

350
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,860
Head back already.

351
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,100
I'm really busy today.

352
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,180
Maybe next time.

353
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,100
Okay.

354
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,580
Alright. Bye.

355
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,490
Bye, Mr. Jiang.

356
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,940
What do you want to say?

357
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,380
Director Jiang,

358
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,940
are you doing fine?

359
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,010
What?

360
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,010
Did you come to see how miserable I am?

361
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,730
I'm the miserable one.

362
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,980
After that film

363
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,980
with you,

364
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,530
my company terminated my contract.

365
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,010
I haven't landed a role since.

366
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,490
Good for you. Bye.

367
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,010
Director Jiang.

368
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,140
I bought these for you.

369
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,770
Thank you...

370
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,490
I don't want it.

371
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,490
Thank you for sending me home that day.

372
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,140
What exactly do you want?

373
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,380
Nothing.

374
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,490
I honestly feel happy

375
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,220
seeing you again.

376
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,730
Just seeing you makes me happy.

377
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,180
Director Jiang,

378
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,730
if I want to drink next time,

379
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,220
I'll ask you to join me.

380
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,660
I don't drink.

381
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,460
Take them back.

382
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:06,980
Director Jiang, please take it.

383
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,810
I'll go now. Bye.

384
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,290
Jialu,

385
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,140
don't you think that was a bit too convenient?

386
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,490
She just shows up

387
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,490
out of nowhere.

388
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,660
Do you think it's fate brought you both together,

389
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,570
or is it written in the stars?

390
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,980
Tough luck instead?

391
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,980
Oh, come on.

392
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,050
It was obviously staged.

393
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,770
Her acting hasn't improved at all.

394
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,140
She can't even

395
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,900
fake a chance encounter properly.

396
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,010
Really?

397
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,050
I thought it did look kind of staged.

398
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,490
Why do you think she went there?

399
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,530
To get revenge?

400
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,290
Revenge?

401
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,380
How?

402
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,220
Poison the fruit?

403
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,490
You're that old.

404
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,570
Why are you still greedy for food?

405
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,180
It's probably not poison.

406
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,250
But I think that girl

407
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,290
is a little off.

408
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,900
Who buys that many lemons?

409
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,860
That's too sour.

410
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,220
Oh, lemons.

411
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,700
Why are you so sour?

412
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,290
But you never know.

413
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,220
How can you be sure without tasting?

414
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,860
What if it's sweet?

415
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,220
Right?

416
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,530
I'm serious, Jialu.

417
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,420
Try one.

418
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,490
See if it's sour or sweet.

419
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,330
Chi, you try too.

420
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,220
Try it.

421
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,050
See if it's sweet or not.

422
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,810
Stuff your face.

423
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,860
These days

424
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,940
have been tough on everyone.

425
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:49,980
Mr. Gu

426
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,900
wants to thank you all

427
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,940
for your hard work.

428
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,010
So we're having a company dinner.

429
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,620
Let's keep striving

430
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,730
for Sen'an!

431
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,380
- Great! - Great!

432
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,220
Everyone must come.

433
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,700
Eating together like this would be awkward.

434
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,620
They might as well give us cash.

435
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,330
We could have our own department dinner.

436
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,980
That's better.

437
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,570
They tell us to go, so we just go.

438
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,700
It's free anyway.

439
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,380
We get to drink.

440
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,770
Zhou Yu'an.

441
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,940
You should come too.

442
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,380
Join the dinner.

443
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,530
Boss.

444
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,700
Listen to this.

445
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,860
Photos of Gu Chen's home.

446
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,420
I pulled some strings

447
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,460
and got

448
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,660
the cleaning lady...

449
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,530
Who sent this? Do we know?

450
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,250
No.

451
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,530
It was an anonymous tip.

452
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,940
Anonymous?

453
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,380
Should we report it?

454
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,490
Hold it.

455
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,810
Mr. Gu,

456
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,050
you see,

457
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,290
Pang Jian is already gone.

458
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,940
As for how I should deal with this,

459
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,220
I thought I should

460
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,220
let you know.

461
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,660
During the dinner,

462
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,010
take someone and look into it.

463
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,290
Try to find some proof.

464
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,620
That way, they won't have anything to say.

465
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,220
You're backing me. I know.

466
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,330
Yes.

467
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,570
It's almost seven.

468
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,860
Maybe you should ask Mr. Gao

469
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,730
to start with the cold dishes.

470
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,730
You ask. I don't dare.

471
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,010
I'm starving.

472
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,700
Here you go.

473
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,860
Prawn crackers.

474
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,570
Thank you.

475
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,330
There you go.

476
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,770
Take this to her.

477
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,570
Boss said you can start eating.

478
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,140
- Thanks. - Thanks.

479
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,860
I talked to a friend last night.

480
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,730
My friend said

481
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,490
I'm too kind.

482
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,860
But life treats me hard.

483
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,330
Go pour some water for everyone.

484
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,700
Pour your own.

485
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,810
Can't you read the room?

486
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,810
Who else here

487
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,900
should be doing this but you?

488
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,940
People like you only stay visible

489
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,050
by being useful.

490
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,490
If I take this from you,

491
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,250
what do you have left?

492
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,900
I'll do it. I'll pour.

493
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,570
Stand up.

494
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,180
Stand up.

495
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,860
Hello, Mr. Gu.

496
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,900
Hello, Mr. Gu.

497
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,570
How nice.

498
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,050
Sorry.

499
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,460
I was on a conference call.

500
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,010
So I'm late.

501
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,900
My apologies.

502
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,810
No, not at all.

503
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,770
You're not late.

504
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,810
It's fine.

505
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,530
Sit, everyone.

506
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,530
You don't have to stand.

507
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,860
Over there.

508
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,250
Mr. Gu is here.

509
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,250
Start serving.

510
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,770
- Okay. - Okay.

511
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,770
Look carefully.

512
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,330
Got it.

513
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,860
Wow. Amazing.

514
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,900
Chen, you...

515
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,290
Oh my.

516
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,700
You can really drink.

517
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,010
Come on, everyone.

518
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,980
Let's raise a glass

519
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,050
for Mr. Gu.

520
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,700
Yeah.

521
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,290
No need.

522
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,730
Tonight is just for celebrating

523
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,460
and relaxing.

524
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,290
You don't have to do this.

525
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,810
Mr. Gu, just one around.

526
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,860
- Right. - We all hope Sen'an

527
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,810
will keep growing

528
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,700
under your leadership.

529
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,620
Right?

530
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,210
Yes.

531
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,610
To Mr. Gu.

532
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,290
- To Mr. Gu. - To Mr. Gu.

533
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,490
To everyone. Cheers.

534
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,290
Only the PV

535
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,290
hasn't come to toast yet.

536
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,010
Director Jiang.

537
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,050
I'll go.

538
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,460
Yeah, right.

539
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,770
But...

540
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,330
Director Jiang.

541
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,860
Patience.

542
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,290
Come.

543
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,050
Mr. Gu.

544
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,700
Beer isn't right though.

545
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,140
We're all on baijiu, and you...

546
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,010
Have this.

547
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,330
Mr. Gu, I toast you.

548
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,330
Director Jiang.

549
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,860
Are you keeping a goldfish in there?

550
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,010
There's a rule at the table.

551
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,660
You owe a penalty shot if you didn't finish your drink.

552
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,810
It's fine.

553
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,810
Director Jiang

554
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,010
never likes this drinking culture.

555
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,900
He was like this back in school.

556
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,490
It's been years.

557
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,010
You haven't changed.

558
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,860
You've been in the real world this long.

559
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,900
You can't still act

560
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,090
like you're on campus.

561
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,770
I don't care.

562
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,380
I say

563
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,810
drinking shows character.

564
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,290
If your drinking is bad,

565
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,860
your character is bad.

566
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,900
That's more like it.

567
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,330
No rush, Director Jiang.

568
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,620
There's a second round.

569
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,810
Come on. Pour him another.

570
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,140
Give me some too.

571
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,530
This shot.

572
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,620
As your direct superior,

573
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,010
I'll drink with you.

574
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,490
Let's toast

575
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,490
Mr. Gu together.

576
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,250
Come on.

577
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,140
Let's toast Mr. Gu.

578
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,220
Why is it so hard

579
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,860
to get you to drink?

580
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,420
Leaders,

581
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,940
I'll drink

582
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,330
for my boss.

583
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,290
I'll drink too.

584
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,330
He's your boss?

585
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,900
But does he look like one?

586
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,570
Such a coward.

587
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,010
Your staff even needs to cover for you.

588
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,900
Forget it.

589
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,700
Stop drinking.

590
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,380
Come.

591
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,140
Mr. Gu.

592
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,620
Don't let them ruin your mood.

593
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,660
Let's drink.

594
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,460
Let's drink. Come on.

595
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,460
Fill them all.

596
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,700
- Pour some for me. - Here.

597
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,140
Come on.

598
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,530
Let's toast Mr. Gu.

599
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,610
What are you still doing here?

600
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,050
Just go.

601
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,570
Let's drink.

602
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,740
Come on.

603
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,530
Take it easy.

604
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,130
Thank you all

605
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,380
for always looking after me.

606
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,340
Make sure to restore everything.

607
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,460
[Su Gengsheng: We didn't find anything.]

608
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,900
You guys keep drinking.

609
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,900
I need to head out.

610
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,090
You're leaving?

611
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,900
I'll walk Mr. Gu out.

612
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,570
Bye, Mr. Gu.

613
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,650
Bye, Mr. Gu.

614
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,900
- Mr. Gu. - Bye.

615
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,820
Mr. Gu.

616
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,940
Hold on.

617
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,380
Our boss toasted you

618
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,570
with a full pot just now.

619
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,380
I saw

620
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,650
you only had one glass.

621
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,860
He's your senior.

622
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,050
You should finish this pot.

623
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,690
I'll drink with you.

624
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,650
Okay?

625
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,820
Another time.

626
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,740
We have more chances to drink.

627
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,420
Drink less.

628
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,210
Mr. Gu.

629
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,170
When you were in school,

630
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,490
did you drink like this

631
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,650
- with your seniors? - You're drunk.

632
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,460
Let go.

633
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,820
I just want to ask.

634
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,340
Why are you going after

635
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,130
my boss?

636
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,530
Let go!

637
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,570
Stop making a scene.

638
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,130
Come on!

639
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:58,900
What's wrong?

640
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,530
I'm just asking Mr. Gu.

641
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,050
- Why is he giving my boss a hard time? - Stop it.

642
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,460
- What's wrong with that? - Who gives you a hard time?

643
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,010
Seriously?

644
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,050
- Watch your tone. - You're targeting PV

645
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,610
- and my boss. - No.

646
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,940
- This is your guy, right? - That's enough!

647
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,540
If you can't handle him, I will.

648
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,010
Move.

649
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,090
- No. - He's drunk.

650
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,650
So what if he's drunk?

651
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,650
- Stop it. - Even so,

652
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,090
is that how he talks to his superior?

653
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,050
- Enough. Stop it. - So rude.

654
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,900
I wasn't talking to you.

655
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,300
- Stop it. - I was talking to Mr. Gu.

656
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,730
Move.

657
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,830
Move!

658
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,460
Boss.

659
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,050
I'm fine.

660
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,690
Sorry.

661
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,130
This is on me.

662
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,650
I'll apologize for him.

663
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,380
Enough!

664
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,570
You only

665
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,570
made me look worse.

666
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,380
Do you understand?

667
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,490
Boss.

668
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,690
I'm sorry.

669
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,690
Don't overthink it.

670
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,820
Let's just do our jobs

671
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,260
and keep a clear conscience.

672
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,170
I think

673
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,340
what he said makes sense.

674
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,170
Your junior

675
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,010
has gotten ahead of you.

676
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,170
Isn't that because

677
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,570
he's more capable?

678
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,380
Why don't you

679
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,530
swallow your pride?

680
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,210
What's so hard about that?

681
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,300
In a situation like this,

682
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,170
is it really your junior who's wrong,

683
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,260
or is it you?

684
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,010
To say the least,

685
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,820
even if

686
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,490
you don't think about yourself,

687
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,130
shouldn't you

688
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,300
think about those who work under you?

689
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,530
Shouldn't you think about us?

690
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,490
Didn't we end up like this

691
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,050
because you were too much of a coward?

692
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,860
Gross.

693
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,820
Can you say something decent for once?

694
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,130
Did she

695
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,900
just slap me?

696
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,010
I can't die yet.

697
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,740
It's nothing.

698
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,050
Nothing at all.
