I'll also change my number.

380
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,330
Don't call this number again.

381
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,220
I'll contact you once I settle things.

382
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,730
Don't worry about me.

383
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,730
Be sure to stay safe.

384
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,770
Got it.

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,750
[Police]

386
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,290
Hello.

387
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,530
Is this Liu Mingzhe?

388
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,770
Yes.

389
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,090
This is Chongjiang Police.

390
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,180
We received a report,

391
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,490
and need you to come in for questioning.

392
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:56,300
[Police]

393
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,220
Where are you?

394
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,010
Are you worried

395
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,330
I'll get caught and implicate you?

396
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,250
You carried out everything.

397
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,290
Should I be worried?

398
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,860
Remember what I'm saying.

399
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,900
If I get caught,

400
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,050
I won't spill the details of your affair

401
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,730
with Wu Yijun.

402
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,980
You'd better not say anything either.

403
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,220
It won't

404
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,220
do you any good.

405
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,030
Even if you leave Sen'an,

406
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,420
you'll still have to work in this industry.

407
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,180
You're not really concerned about me.

408
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,770
You're worried that if this blows up,

409
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,140
Jiang Jiaqi will lose face.

410
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,330
How touching.

411
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,140
You're even coming to me to give testimony?

412
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,250
Does he know

413
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:42,940
you care so much about him?

414
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,940
Right now,

415
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,660
he must be celebrating his election.

416
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,090
He's probably already forgotten about you.

417
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,330
Who do you think you are?

418
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,090
If you don't do as I say,

419
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,090
think about what consequences await you.

420
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,980
You know what I've done before,

421
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,660
don't you?

422
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,090
I don't mind doing it again.

423
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,620
[Zhou Yu'an
I've been elected. Thank you.]

424
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,090
[Galaxy Tavern]
Cheers!

425
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,240
Didn't I say before

426
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,570
Jiaqi would definitely make it?

427
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,670
Yes, you said that.

428
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,530
Of course!

429
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,660
Right?

430
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,250
You and your mom look so alike.

431
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,460
My mom hates hearing that.

432
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,570
The lamb leg's here!

433
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,420
Alright. Come on.

434
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,460
Your favorite beef.

435
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,530
Don't start yet!

436
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,460
Someone's not here yet.

437
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,380
We can't eat now?

438
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,460
She's here!

439
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,700
Everyone's here!

440
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,660
Long time no see!

441
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,900
Long time no see.

442
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,220
Mom.

443
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,290
Congrats!

444
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,860
Thank you, Yijun.

445
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,420
You've worked hard.

446
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,900
Don't say that.

447
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,770
You've lost weight.

448
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,460
Be sure to take care of yourself.

449
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,220
I've been busy all along,

450
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,460
and no one cares about me!

451
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,460
I care about you!

452
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,770
Stop with the grand talk.

453
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,570
This foul mouth of yours!

454
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,140
Sit, Yijun.

455
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,900
- Mom, where are you sitting? - Sit.

456
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,600
- Come on, Yijun. Sit here. - I'm busy. Don't mind me.

457
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,330
Jiaqi.

458
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,460
Sit down.

459
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,460
- I'll take care of the flowers. - Thank you.

460
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,330
Is everyone here?

461
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,660
Then let's get started.

462
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,870
Let's congratulate

463
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,220

464
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,770
Jiang Jiaqi,

465
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,120
on his promotion to Vice GM!

466
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,840
Congrats!

467
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,660
Cheers!

468
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,180
Wait!

469
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,290
We're Pure Friendship!

470
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,140
We're Unbeatable!

471
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,140
Come on!

472
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,140
Look, everyone's here today.

473
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,900
Even our big movie star

474
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,980
showed up.

475
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,490
I have some good news

476
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,250
to announce.

477
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:15,940
What good news?

478
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,770
I've finally landed a role.

479
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,010
What role did you get?

480
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,770
This time, I'm playing

481
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,660
a very introverted person.

482
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,050
Someone who doesn't talk much,

483
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,290
but with eyes

484
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,380
that hold a lot of stories.

485
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,530
Recently, I've been preparing

486
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,770
by observing life

487
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,090
and looking for prototypes in real life.

488
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,180
Sounds a lot like

489
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,050
that person.

490
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:31,530
Who?

491
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:31,940
Who is it?

492
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,420
That girl...

493
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,380
Your female colleague,

494
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,460
Zhou Yu'an!

495
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,290
- Right? - Yes!

496
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,420
Why didn't she come today?

497
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,330
She resigned.

498
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,330
She's already moved out.

499
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,530
Moved out?

500
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,770
Honestly,

501
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,770
we shouldn't have made such a fuss

502
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,050
and sent her home that night.

503
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,620
She couldn't say it out on the surface,

504
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,420
but inside,

505
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,770
she must have been fed up with us.

506
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,180
She didn't say that though.

507
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,660
She said she really liked it here.

508
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,620
Could she say that

509
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,620
in front of us?

510
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,290
I truly believe

511
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,420
she doesn't dislike us.

512
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,140
I think she doesn't dislike you.

513
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,010
She doesn't dislike Jiaqi!

514
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,010
Then why did she resign?

515
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,010
Enough.

516
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,090
You're so gossipy

517
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,010
at your age.

518
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,940
I have an idea.

519
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,700
Jiaqi just got promoted, right?

520
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,180
So he must have gotten a raise.

521
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,700
His first month's salary

522
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,940
should go to Pure Friendship,

523
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,330
and everyone should get a big red envelope.

524
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:24,940
What do you think?

525
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,700
Yes!

526
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,460
Great!

00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,660

it's a happy day,

but don't drink too much.

544
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,660
You weren't like this before.

545

On such a night,

546
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,250
how can I not drink up?

547
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,600

548
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,010
take care of that kid for me.

Okay, Ms. Yao.

550
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,730
Go on celebrating.

551
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:28,940
I'm leaving.

552
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,420
See you.

Don't lock the door!

558
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,980
Just close it.

will have to knock!

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,700
Come on, buddy!

570
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,250
Are you okay?

571
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,140
I'm fine.

572
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,420
I'm alright.

573
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,460
Come on, cheers!

574
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,420
Come on!

575
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,460
Yijun,

576
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,140
do you know?

577
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,620
When I first met you,

578
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,530
I thought

579
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,180
you were so different.

580
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,860
And sure enough,

581
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,380
you and Jiaqi are living

582
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,620
a life different from ours.

583
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,860
So what?

584
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,010
Our life isn't that bad either.

585
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,810
What're you doing?

586
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,490
Weren't you just over there,

587
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,900
drinking happily?

588
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,420
Go ahead.

589
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,530
I'm talking here.

590
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,540
I knew!

591
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,830
You hid the money in the bottle.

592
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,530
Everyone knows that.

593
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,090
Well...

594
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,380
I hope that our future days

595
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,530
will be happier and happier.

596
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,010
Cheers!

597
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:44,940
Campus heartthrob!

598
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:45,940
I toast to you.

599
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,330
Why are you saying that?

600
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,420
Why can't I say it?

601
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,250
Jiaqi and I

602
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,730
went to the same elementary school

603
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,770
and middle school.

604
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,290
I'm only a few years older than him.

605
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,420
Speaking of Jiaqi,

606
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,860
you and I have

607
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,180
a deep connection.

608
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,050
Look,

609
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,980
we were schoolmates at first.

610
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,770
Later, I became your aunt.

611
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,380
You both

612
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,900
grew up together?

613
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,050
Sure.

614
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,790
I remember

615
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,930
when we were in school,

616
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,940
a lot of girls

617
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,030
at our school

618
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,120
used to talk about

619
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,650
who the best campus heartthrob was.

620
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,010
Jiang Jiaqi?

621
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,010
Tao Zhiyuan!

622
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,570
But to be honest,

623
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,460
you were only in second place.

624
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,420
Tao Zhiyuan was first.

625
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,640
Let me tell you,

626
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,780
Tao Zhiyuan was really handsome.

627
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,120
Talented,

628
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,490
great at what he does.

629
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,860
All the girls at our school

630
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,780
were chasing after him.

631
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,010
You know what happened later?

632
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,300
He was taken by Chu Dan!

633
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,570
What's wrong?

634
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,420
What's the matter?

635
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,740
We can't bring it up?

636
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,900
Wasn't Tao Zhiyuan

637
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,050
our shared memory?

638
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,170
He was our neighbor and friend

639
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,260
for so many years.

640
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,780
Tao Zhiyuan

641
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,010
was Jiaqi's best friend.

642
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,780
On such a special day,

643
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,900
he can't even mention

644
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,490
his best friend's name?

645
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,940
How painful, how lonely must that

646
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,860
be for him?

647
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,300
Is it really because of me

648
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,170
that you all stopped mentioning his name?

649
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,780
Not mentioning his name

650
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,300
must be hard for you, right?

651
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,980
I'm sorry!

652
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,340

655
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,420
is now unbanned.

656
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,530

go ahead.

658
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,380
