Sorry, Director.

191
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,540
I'll do it again.

192
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,460
All right, keep rolling.

193
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,370
Pause for a second. And action.

194
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,530

195
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,890

196

Cut!

197
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,060
Ai Youyou.

198
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,130
Do you understand what the director is saying?

199
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,050
I told you to bring a bit more emotion out.

200
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,890
Didn't you hear me?

201
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,890
Do you even know how to act?

202
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,060
Can you hear me?

203

She's completely breaking down already.

204
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,850
We agreed on this.

205
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,340
Just this once.

206
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,420
The footage cannot be leaked.

207
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,770
I need to tell you something.

208
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,700
I might regret it

209
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,050
after I walk away from here.

210
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,530
I lied to you.

211
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,810
I lied to everyone.

212
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,360
Back then, after I won

213
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,700
the short film award,

214
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,700
I got carried away.

215
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,530
Very quickly,

216
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,050
before I was ready at all,

217
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,090
I went ahead and shot

218
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,010
my very first feature film.

219
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,380
Halfway through filming,

220
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,380
I finally sobered up.

221
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,490
With a script that bad,

222
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,050
there was no way

223
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,050
I could ever make a good story.

224
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,770
If the film were released,

225
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,290
everyone would find out

226
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,620
that I am painfully ordinary.

227
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,490
After that, I fell into panic

228
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,220
and fear of failure.

229
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,620
But I couldn't let anyone know

230
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,620
that I am painfully ordinary.

231
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,420
So I needed a scapegoat

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,290
to ruin my film.

233
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,250
And then, you showed up.

234
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,050
I saw your weakness,

235
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,730
and also

236
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,860
your sensitivity.

237
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,010
By tearing down your acting,

238
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,250
I pushed you into a breakdown.

239
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,700
Things spiraled out of control very quickly.

240
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,730
In the end, the outcome was

241
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,980
Ai Youyou's acting was terrible.

242
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,290
It ruined the film,

243
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,620
and destroyed the director's name.

244
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,010
But my label as a genius

245
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,730
was preserved.

246
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,810
That's how it was.

247
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,730
But why did I think

248
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,490
I had the right to bully you?

249
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,730
Have you ever thought about that?

250
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,660
When I bullied you,

251
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,900
why didn't you fight back?

252
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,660
Are you saying this was all my fault?

253
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,940
Yes. It was all your fault.

254
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,180
Because of your weakness,

255
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,860
I kept pushing further and further.

256
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,140

Tell me.

260
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,140
Say something.

261
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,490
Why didn't you fight back?

262

Fight back!

263
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,180
That's the feeling.

264
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,530
If anyone ever bullies you again,

265
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,810
use this feeling to curse them out,

266
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,700
and stand up to them.

267
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,140
Since life gives you no real choice,

268
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,700
you still have to push through no matter how bad it gets.

269
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,770
But acting is different.

270
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,420
If you're unhappy, you can walk away.

271
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,050
If a director ever yells at you again,

I'm afraid you won't be able to.

274

It sounds kind of special, actually.

When did you start liking me?

The first time I saw you.

294
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,770

You clearly hated me back then.

When I first saw you,

I thought you were pretty cute.

your very first sentence to me,

300
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,290
I started to feel

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,180
a tiny bit annoyed.

302
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,050
What did I even say to you?

303
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,700
You said you really

304
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,460
liked my films,

But at that time,

307
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,220
I had only made one short film,

308
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,380
and it wasn't even released domestically.

309
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,770

310
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,980

After I watched the screening,

315
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,140
I pushed my agent hard

316
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,420
to contact your crew.

although Director Deng

476

this is completely

477
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,380

479

480

We have already confirmed

the subject's adverse reaction

482
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,490
was unrelated to Barituo.

484
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,530
during the medication period,

485
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,260
which triggered acute hepatitis.

486
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,010
Since we traced it back

487
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,010
to a clear source of infection,

488
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,740
the subject's clinical presentation

489
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,980
was also fully consistent

490

with acute hepatitis.

491
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,340
So we believe

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,380
there was no need to report it.

[Justified Self-Defense. Not Guilty.]

566
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,100
[Police Report]

567
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,130
She didn't murder anyone.

568
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,010
It was legitimate self-defense.

569
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,530
You all heard that.

570
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,420
So you knew all along.

571
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,130
Then why didn't you report it

572
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,010
to HR immediately?

573
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,650
And even now you still protect her.

574
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,170
Do you even care about Sen'an's reputation?

575
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,530
Or the safety of its employees?

576
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,490
Do those still matter?

577
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,460
She shows up on time every day,

578
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,740
does whatever she's asked,

579
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,420
and never once complains.

580
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,490
How does that

581
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,490
threaten anyone's safety?

582
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,300
She only reacted instinctively

583
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,490
when her family was in danger.

584
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,420
That was self-protection.

585
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,570
If it were me,

586
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,530
I would have done the same.

587
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,010
Wouldn't you?

588
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,420
She's clearly the victim,

589
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,650
yet she still

590
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,050
has to take accusations like these.

591
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,650
The law has already cleared her.

592
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,780
Who are you to judge her again?

593
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,170
The law set up all those safeguards

594
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,260
to protect

595
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,940
a child,

596
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,860
so she could have a chance

597
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,740
to start over.

598
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,380
Why do you insist

599
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,650
on holding her past against her?

600
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,380
Everyone

601
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,780
has a past they want to forget.

602
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,980
Why can't you

603
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,940
give her a chance?

604
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,380
Why must you,

605
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,400
in front of so many people,

606
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,170
lay her entire past bare?

607
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,260
Why?

608
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,530
Because this is a company,

609
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,980
not a place for misplaced sympathy!

610
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,260
So what if it's a company?

611
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,050
Aren't the people working here

612
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,610
still human beings?

613
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,260
Between people,

614
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,010
shouldn't there be

615
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,460
at least some basic kindness?

[Loving Strangers]

617
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,300
This is bad.

618
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,900
Did she see the messages

619
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,130
in our group chat?

620
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,530
What did she see? Let me see.

621
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,130
Where did you hide Zhou Yu'an?

622
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,300
How did you find me?

623
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:00,460
If I want to, I can find anyone.

624
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,900
I've already located the ride-share driver.

625
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,300
I'll send you the info later.

626
