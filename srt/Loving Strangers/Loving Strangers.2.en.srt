I enjoy doing.

190
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,340
It smells pretty good.

191
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,060
Get out.

192
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,650
You must be thirsty.

193
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,730
Have some.

194
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,180
Here.

195
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,570
Open your mouth.

196
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,490
I said get out!

197
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,010
Looks like I've been too nice to you.

198
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,620
Have you seen a debtor

199
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,730
acting as arrogantly as you?

200
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,050
I'll pay back every dime

201
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,620
I owe you.

202
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,770
Paying it back piecemeal like this?

203
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,050
How long do you think that'll take?

204
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,980
Until I'm dead.

205
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,140
You still don't know

206
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,460
why the nursing home

207
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,460
stopped asking you for money, do you?

208
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,940
I paid for it for you.

209
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,620
What kind of creditor

210
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,250
would be kind enough

211
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,730
to pay someone else's debt like I did?

212
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,860
I want to make sure

213
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,050
you'll never pay it off in your lifetime.

214
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,900
Don't worry.

215
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,140
As long as I can get rid of trash like you,

216
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,090
I'll do anything.

217
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,980
Isn't it weird to wear sunglasses at work?

218
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,620
Yeah.

219
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,810

220
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,530

221
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,900
It's daytime, and she's wearing sunglasses.

222
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,460
What's her problem?

223
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,140
That's way too much.

224
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:48,980
Look at her.

225

Hurry up.

I'm almost done.

You suddenly get busy

257
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,940
Boss,

258
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,250
there's a barbecue place downstairs.

259

Half price. Let's go together.

Alright. Next time then.

263
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,490
Why are you working again?

264
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,940
Don't touch it. I didn't save it yet.

265
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,740
Your jacket.

266
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,330
I already booked a table.

267
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,460
Okay.

I'm hungry.

271

If you're done,

272
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,730
I'll go pay.

273
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,420
Take me for a drink too.

Sorry. I have plans later.

275

Let's go to this place.

277

It's pretty dark here.

How did you get hurt?

280
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,980

things are going to get complicated.
