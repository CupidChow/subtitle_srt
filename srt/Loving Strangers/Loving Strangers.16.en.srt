00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,100
Go ahead.

195
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,700
They've already noticed

196
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,890
that I show up here a lot.

197
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,420
Finding out about us

198
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,010
is only a matter of time.

199
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,130
Let's break up.

200
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,010
No wonder I could never picture

201
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,060
what our future would look like.

202
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,730
It turns out that deep down

203
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,220
I always knew this day would come.

204
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,650
You probably

205
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,610
hoped I'd end this gracefully.

206
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,220
Like most people,

207
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,340
choosing silence

208
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,770
and keeping it quiet.

209
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,730
But

210
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,530
there's an impulse deep inside me.

211
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,610
I keep wondering

212
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,610
if I should let you fall apart.

213
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,180
You know, Gu Chen.

214
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,180
Back when you were in college,

215
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,770
your face said it all.

216
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,370
You were desperate to climb higher.

217
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,700
To hide that,

218
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,820
you pretended nothing really mattered.

219
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,940
But in reality, you calculated everything.

220
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,820
I just forgot.

221
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,420
How did I forget

222
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,820
that someone like you

223
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,820
was never going to change?

224
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,010
I naively believed

225
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,650
that to you,

226
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,940
I would be someone special.

227
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,730
But none of it was real.

228
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,220
It was just me lying to myself.

229
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,370
People like you

230
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,770
will never change.

231
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,530
You don't have to

232
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,650
trash what we had like this.

233
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,130
If it weren't real,

234
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,370
who would ever risk

235
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,460
losing everything

236
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,650
for a relationship like this?

237
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,180
What have you lost?

238
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,650
I...

239
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,370
I really was ready

240
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,770
to divorce for you.

241
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,100
All

242
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,730
for someone like you.

243
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,250
Breaking up

244
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,420
is actually the best choice.

245
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,180
You still have a way out.

246
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,180
Did you

247
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,580
ever love me?

248
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,420
Even if it was

249
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,100
for one minute,

250
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,010
or even one second.

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,940
I was so stupid.

252
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,180
Ladies and gentlemen,

253
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,850
we now see Player No. 10

He's adjusting his breathing.

256
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,820
The crowd is holding its breath.

257
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,060
What will the outcome be?

258
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,340
Let's wait and see.

259
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,420
Wait. Come on.

What's this for?

We're the hype crew.

263
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,530
We've got to let our foreign friends

264

feel our passion

265
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,370
and Pure Friendship's unity.

Right?

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,530
Right.

268
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,170
Okay.

269
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,130
That makes sense.

So what's it going to be?

Let's see how it turns out.

Let's not just show this to the foreigners.

284
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,890
We should post it ourselves too, right?

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,890
Post it in the group.

286
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,890
- Post it. - Share one.

287
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,060
Someone told me

288
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,250
she's lived for thirty thousand years.

289
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,340
Thirty thousand years? What does that even mean?

290
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,700
She said

291
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,100
she's lived life after life,

292
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,370
constantly being reborn,

293
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,850
all the way to now.

294
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,940
So she figured she must be thirty thousand years old.

295
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,730
I think I understand what she meant.

296
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,130
Each rebirth

297
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,460
is a search for a place to belong.

298
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,940
When you finally come across

299
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,700
a place that feels like home,

300
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,610
you still know deep down

301
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,980
that it isn't where you truly belong.

302
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,420
So you set off again,

303
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,770
carrying that longing,

304
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,010
and are reborn once more.

305
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,700
So what does it take

306
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,100
to break this cycle?

307
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,580
Do you really not know?

308
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,770
It's loving without holding anything back,

309
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,940
giving yourself completely.

310
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,940
In this world,

311
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,530
leaving nothing to regret

312
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,940
is the only way out of the cycle,

313
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,580
so you're no longer reborn.

Goodbye, Director.

Stop calling me that.

Alright, Director.

How old are you?

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,010
I just turned eighteen.

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,330
Eighteen and already auditioning?

That's not old either.

You're overthinking it.

430
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,380
Yeah, it looked gentle enough,

431
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,530
then suddenly bit me.

Let me tell you,

463
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,730
I've auditioned for three roles recently.

464
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,090
For the first one,

465
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,460
the assistant director asked me

466
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,490
to play a pianist.

467
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,530
I played for a few minutes,

468
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,460
then he stopped me.

469
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,420
He said I wasn't professional enough.

470
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,770
I've passed Piano Grade Eight,

471
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,700
and he still said the same thing.

472
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,730
You should have argued back.

473
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,620
I let it go.

474
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,660
After all, not everyone

475
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,810
has a natural sense for music.

476
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,570
Let me continue with the second role.

477
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,770
For the second one.

478
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,330
The assistant director asked me to play someone mentally unstable.

479
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,010
He handed me a crumpled piece of paper

480
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,380
and told me to repeat just one action.

481
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,770
All I had to do was

482
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,810
smooth the paper flat.

483
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,330
The more I acted, the more anxious I became.

484
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,980
The assistant director said it was right.

485
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,530
That was exactly the state he wanted.

486
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,530
Then he told me to stop.

487
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,090
But I just could not stop.

488
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,250
I desperately kept trying to smooth out

489
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,530
that crumpled paper.

490
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,900
But I still could not make it flat.

491
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,530
Then the assistant director asked me,

492
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,980
are you actually okay?

493
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,010
I said,

494
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,050
that crumpled paper felt a lot like me.

495
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,620
He said I was not in a good state

496
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,700
and told me to stop the audition.

497
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,700
He even suggested I take a break and see a professional.

498
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,380
Then came the third one.

499
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,900
The director auditioned me personally.

500
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,980
I had prepared extremely well.

501
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,180
It went pretty smoothly at first.

502
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,530
Then, in the third scene,

503
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,220
the director suddenly frowned.

504
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,530
I completely froze.

505
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,860
Because what flashed through my mind

506
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,530
was Director Jiang frowning like that.

507
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,420
The moment I saw that expression,

508
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,980
I could not

509
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,980
say a single line.

510
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,290
That's everything?

511
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,770
So this is what you meant by settling things with me.

512
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,050
Go on then. How do you want to settle it?

513
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,010
Once it's done, I'll leave.

514
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,530
Can it really be settled?

515
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,010
That crumpled piece of paper of mine,

516
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,810
can you smooth it out?

517
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,140
My life has been folded and wrinkled.

518
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,570
Can you fix that for me?

519
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,290
Ever since I was little,

520
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,900
people always said I was pretty.

521
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,050
Wherever I went,

522
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,250
people were kind to me.

523
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,050
I never had to read the room.

524
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,570
I was just

525
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,700
an easygoing person.

526
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,180
And yet,

527
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,940
I was happy every single day.

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,380
