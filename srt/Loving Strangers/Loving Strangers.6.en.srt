lend me a hand.

571
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,620
Don't do it back and forth.

572
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,090
Turn it.

573
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,330
That's it. Right.

574
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,860
Turn and roll.

575
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,050
Good.

576
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,940
That's enough. If you keep rolling, it'll break.

577
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,620
That's good.

578
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,180
Do another one.

579
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,700
Jialu!

580
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,330
I brought you a large one.

581
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,570
Why do you start wasting time

582
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,330
as soon as you start working?

583
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,530
What do you mean by wasting time

584
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,220
as soon as I start working?

585
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,700
I went to get you a shirt.

586
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,250
I'm telling you. This is called life.

587
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,460
You must have a sense of ritual.

588
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,730
I've not worn a uniform for a long time.

589
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,010
Doesn't this yellow one look like a uniform?

590
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,650
Don't act arrogantly

591
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,480
with these dirty jackets.

592
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,360
Hurry

593
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,980
and start wrapping the dumplings.

594
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,330
You're just watching my two sons work.

595
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,000
Exactly.

596
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,570
Sure.

597
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,700
I won't just let

598
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,900
you two precious children work without helping.

599
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,530
Have dumplings when you start your career.

600
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,530
Tomorrow is your first day at work.

601
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,860
This is for good luck.

602
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,330
Everything is tough in the beginning.

603
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,940
There's a journey for everything.

604
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,730
Don't rush things.

605
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,250
Mom, don't worry.

606
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,050
I'm not worried.

607
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,810
Yesterday, I dreamed of my father.

608
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,720
It's a good dream.

609
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,730
I'll make more dumplings.

610
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,540
Enough to last till tomorrow afternoon.

611
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,010

and still have to hunt for food.

614
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,570
Mom, that's enough.

615
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,900
We can't finish them all if you make more.

616
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,620
I'm intending to make more.

617
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,660
We only have enough for six portions.

618
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,250
I haven't made enough

619
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,090
for both of your meals tomorrow.

620
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,300
We already have enough for eight.

621
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,940
Keep making more

622
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,860
and don't slack.

623
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,260
You know nothing.

624
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,820
My sister worries about us.

625
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,490
These dumplings are delicious.

626
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,650
You won't find

627
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,340

Move.

629
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,130
Exactly.

630
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,420
From tomorrow onward,

631
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,300
Jialu and I

632
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,130
will go all out.

633
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,090
When we make money,

634
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,090
I will treat you well.

635
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,420
Gosh.

636
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,010
I'm already living my final years.

637
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,610
I don't need you to treat me well.

638
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,900
Both of you just need to take good care

639
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,530
of yourselves.

640
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,980
You are fine

641
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,090
but I'm most worried about Jialu.

642
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,740
What's wrong with me, Mom?

643
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,010
Am I worse than him?

644
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,630
Your uncle was born before you.

645
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,690
He suffered in life before.

646
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,340
What about you?

647
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,260
You received an international award

648

when you were still a student.

649
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,940
You were even featured in the newspaper.

650
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,980
That was a good time for you.

651
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,690
You drew and wrote at home every day.

652
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,010
You were so busy back then.

you are in your thirties

655
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,130
but you still have to start from scratch.

656
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,210
Mom, I know you worry about me

657
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,380
but I think

658
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,610
this job suits me well.

659
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,980
That's right, Jialu.

660
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,340
Let me tell you.

661
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,120
Being a courier

662
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,380
is just a start.

663
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,420
We will be successful in the future.

664

Just wait and see.

667
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,210
Sure. I'll wait and see.

When the time comes,

669
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,130
you should save a spot for me.

670
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,820

671
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,380

674
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,210
You have a proper job.

675
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,130
Exactly.

676

Yes.

It's hot.

697
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,240
The water will be boiled soon.

698

Of course, I remember.
