193
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,980
[Mr. Gu]

194
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,010
Okay. Got it.

195
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,010
Fine.

196
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,530
I'll talk to Su Gengsheng.

197
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,580
When he got promoted to director,

198
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,130
I helped him.

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,300
He should know which side to stand on.

200
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,060
Thank you!

201
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,820
Thank you, Mr. Gu!

202
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,730
Hello, Director Su.

203
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,300
It's Gu Chen.

204
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,460
Su Gengsheng,

205
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,700
stop playing dumb with me.

206
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,460
Why not?

207
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,700
Investigating bribery

208
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,010
is Inspection Office's job.

209
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,820
Those gift cards are evidence.

210
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,370
How could we let you take them?

211
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,980
How about this?

212
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,060
I'll buy a few cards myself,

213
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,010
swap them one-for-one.

214
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,460
That works, right?

215
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,460
You want me to sell you

216
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,240
criminal evidence?

217
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,130
I'm not playing word games with you.

218
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,130
I'm the Vice GM.

219
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,530
You have to do what I say.

220
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,370
Sorry, Mr. Pang.

221
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,980
Inspection Office

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,060
has its own way of handling things.

223
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,820
Su Gengsheng,

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,610
so the Vice GM doesn't count,

225
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,340
but the CEO does,

226
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,610
am I right?

227
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,650
Mr. Pang,

228
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,610
I hope you know

229
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,460
what you're saying.

230
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,180
I know exactly.

231
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,300
Boss,

232
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,460
the hospitals are lined up.

233
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,300
Hey, did you actually

234
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,420
explain it clearly?

235
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,180
We have to hit three hospitals today.

236
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,010
No car available.

237
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,980
Can you stop

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,010
spitting out few words at a time?

239
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,010
Will a full sentence kill you?

240
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,010
Always pulling that sour face.

241
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,980
What's with the attitude?

242
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:29,850
If I were Admin,

243
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,850
even with a car, I'd still say no.

244
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,060
Real funny.

245
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,530
Boss,

246
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,130
want me to ask again?

247
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,340
Let's just get a cab.

248
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,820
Didn't the forecast say

249
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,010
today would warm up?

250
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,340
The sun's out already.

251
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,730
So why's it still freezing?

252
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,300
Since when did the forecast

253
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,250
have to be right?

254
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,300
And since when

255
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,980
did sun automatically mean warm?

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,490
Song,

257
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,530
you're just picking a fight.

258
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,940
Dong,

259
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,360
when can we get a ride?

260
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,700
My phone's about to freeze dead.

261
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,940
Boss, I'm not complaining,

262
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,850
but I've been

263
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,180
with this company for years,

264
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,100
and I've only used the company car once.

265
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,890
I almost forgot

266
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,250
what it even looks like.

267
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,340
Why don't you walk back yourself?

268
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,250
Well...

269
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,130
Give it back to me!

270
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,250
In this weather,

271
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,890
aren't they cold in those short socks?

272
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,580
Fashion and sexy

273
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,580
keep the cold out.

274
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,650
Not everyone

275
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,610
thinks that way.

276
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,580
Dongshan,

277
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,940
you played great today.

278
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,250
Was that kick yours?

279
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,180
Wide-open goal,

280
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,420
I think Fei could've caught it.

281
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,890
Right?

282
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,820
We didn't even have enough people.

283
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,180
I was covering two spots by myself.

284
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,080
Where's Chi?

285
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,940
I'll call him and chew him out.

286
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,770
Chi!

287
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,060
Over here!

288
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,820
It can't stop!

289
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,370
Dongshan, run!

290
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,460
[Yao "Stinky Foot"]

291
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,770
Let me pat and comfort you.

292
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,770
It's okay now.

293
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,460
Yeah.

294
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,100
Chi,

295
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,650
you really need to fix that car.

296
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,460
Or sooner or later,

297
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,490
you're going to get my uncle killed.

298
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,010
Hey, Jiang Jialu,

299
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,420
you really want me dead that bad?

300
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,980
Today's on me.

301
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,730
Sooner or later,

302
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,650
I'll change those brake pads.

303
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,180
Sorry, I scared you.

304
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,460
Who got scared? I didn't...

305
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,650
Chi,

306
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,370
I saw your van

307
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,420
got a "For Sale" sign on it.

308
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,130
What's up?

309
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,980
Yeah, why are you selling it?

310
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,100
Nothing...

311
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,180
What are you thinking?

312
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,730
So what was it today? I missed it.

313
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,650
Lose? Win?

314
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,580
Don't ask the score.

315
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,530
Don't bring it up.

316
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,370
You weren't there. Jiaqi wasn't there.

317
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,130
How were we supposed to play?

318
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,770
It's you. You can't serve!

319
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,580
You never could!

320
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,300
Right?

321
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,220
Now I know

322
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,010
why you're selling it.

323
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,340
[For Sale]

324
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,850
How much did you win?

325
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,820
What?

326
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,940
You think I hit the jackpot?

327
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:15,980
No.

328
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,530
I just switched jobs.

329
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,340
Switched jobs?

330
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,100
To what?

331
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,820
Driver.

332
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,100
Isn't that still driving?

333
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,190
Not the same.

334
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,460
Drivers come in tiers.

335
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,850
This time I'm driving

336
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,610
for a government-affiliated unit.

337
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,980
So you're in the system now.

338
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,420
How much are they paying?

339
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,940
4,500 a month.

340
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,730
That's just so-so.

341
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,460
You know what!

342
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,730
The job before has me up early, home late,

343
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,010
and I have to help carry stuff.

344
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,610
My back can't take it.

345
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,850
Let's do the math.

346
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,700
Yeah, the pay's low now,

347
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,940
but it's legit.

348
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,890
Once the contract's signed,

349
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,370
you get full benefits.

350
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,340
And then,

351
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,730
holidays, festivals,

352
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,850
all the perks are there.

353
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,370
There's a year-end bonus too.

354
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,300
Most importantly, it's steady and easy.

355
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,650
When the boss clocks out, I clock out.

356
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,490
Doesn't mess with my drinking.

357
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,330
Nice.

358
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,290
So you got a connection?

359
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,730
My cousin works at City Hall.

360
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,330
He put in a word early,

361
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,730
so I got ready.

362
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,900
Then talk to your cousin for me.

363
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,980
Get me in too.

364
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,050
Jialu and I will go together.

365
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,810
You serious?

366
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,810
Alright then!

367
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,010
We're tight, us three!

368
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,530
I'm not going.

369
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,980
If you want it, go yourself.

370
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,620
I'll reach out for you tonight.

371
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,010
Solid, right?

372
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,980
Let me pick up the tab!

373
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,570
Alright, enough. The interview's starting.

374
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,380
Yao Dongshan!

375
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,250
Here!

376
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,090
Dude, hold this for me.

377
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,770
Hello, sirs.

378
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,050
Have a sit.

379
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,090
Why do you think you're a good fit

380
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,250
for this position?

381
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,490
I'm in great shape,

382
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,180

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,820
I can tighten my grip

763
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,900
until you can't breathe.

764
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,610
All these years,

765
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,260
who else ever cared about you but me?

766
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,740
You're trash!

767
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,460
I don't want to live like this anymore.

768
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,980
Are you afraid of gossip?

769
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,900
Or are you scared

770
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,300
you'll lose control

771
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,530
and actually fall for me?

772
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,420
What on earth do you want?
