1
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,570
Come on, we've got to go.

2
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,280
- We have to go.
- Hurry!

3
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,365
Go, all of you!

4
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,159
Move!

5
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,577
Come on, let's go!

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,494
Let go!

7
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,412
Come on!

8
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,208
- Let's go, man!
- You fucker!

9
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,710
Let go of me! Fuck!

10
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,545
I have to kill him to get paid!

11
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,713
Just run, damn it!

12
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,100
So, you do know?

13
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,312
If you pull this out,

14
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,813
you'll die.

15
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,611
Fuck, I'm screwed.

16
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,323
How am I supposed to clean this up?

17
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,873
This is Han
from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

18
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,583
We have a homicide.

19
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,584
The address is…

20
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,325
MERCY FOR NONE

21
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,536
119 AMBULANCE

22
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,997
Okay, keep it coming!

23
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,374
Now turn it around! Okay!

24
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,587
Okay, lower it straight down. Be careful.

25
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,007
That's it. Yeah, set it down.

26
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,928
Can we pull out now?

27
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,014
Everything's been washed away.

28
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,267
I want to leave too.

29
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,687
But the higher-ups want it retrieved,
however long it takes.

30
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,316
You know, there's an inspection coming up.

31
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,319
<i>Report received.</i>
<i>Drowned body found near Jara Island.</i>

32
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,737
Copy that.

33
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,071
Let's head to Jara Island.

34
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,115
To Jara Island! Get the crane out too.

35
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,950
- Clear the barricades!
- Let's move.

36
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,351
Doctor, we're on our way.

37
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,645
Please be ready to treat him
as soon as we arrive.

38
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,366
The accident happened
right after he killed Gu Jun-mo.

39
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,327
Should I look into it more?

40
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,928
<i>You know why I'm calling, don't you?</i>

41
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,056
<i>I need to see you now.</i>

42
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,003
I'm sorry about Jun-mo.

43
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,433
Did you take out Gi-jun?

44
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,185
What do you think?

45
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,857
What do you think
was going through my head

46
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,819
when I saw my only child's dead body?

47
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,656
Nothing but revenge, I assume.

48
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,825
That's right.

49
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,619
So if you knew,

50
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,205
why did you do that?

51
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,723
Detective Han rigged
Nam Gi-seok's case for money.

52
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,976
I followed the trail,

53
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,105
which led me to a shell company
under your corporation.

54
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,065
TRANSACTION HISTORY
SENDER, JW GALLERY

55
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,067
You want to know what I think?

56
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,278
You…

57
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,241
never intended to hand over
your company to Gi-seok.

58
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,078
Your plan was to kill him,
pin it on Jun-mo,

59
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,291
then use that to bait Gi-jun
into killing Jun-mo.

60
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,375
And lastly…

61
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,421
kill Gi-jun too…

62
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,550
and hand everything over

63
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,595
to your precious prosecutor son.

64
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,684
That's the best you could come up with?
Sounds like a cheap crime novel.

65
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,361
Yeah.

66
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,905
That's the Lee Ju-woon I know.

67
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,283
After all these years,
you still don't know me?

68
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,284
Wrong.

69
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,745
You never knew me.

70
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,790
Now,

71
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,668
for this to end,

72
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,879
one of us has to disappear.

73
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,391
<i>Since it's come to this,</i>

74
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,684
let's end it here.

75
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,643
Come on.

76
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,272
We live in a different time now.
We can't just spill blood recklessly.

77
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,819
Then what? Are you just going to sit back
and let them take us out?

78
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,573
Gu Bong-san has lost it.
He's not thinking straight.

79
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,575
He can't be reasoned with.

80
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:40,538
BONGSAN HEADQUARTERS

81
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,622
What's the situation?

82
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,334
I've contacted everyone available
and told them where to meet.

83
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,421
BONGSAN GANG BASE

84
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,590
- Where's the chairman?
- He's on his way.

85
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,924
Why are we meeting here?

86
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:56,012
Hong Hyeon-seok said it should be discreet
to stay under Juwoon's radar.

87
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,346
He said that?

88
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,307
Since when are we afraid of Juwoon?

89
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,349
- Who are you?
- Stop!

90
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,267
Hey!

91
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,811
- We're from the Prosecutors' Office.
- Against the wall.

92
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,233
Quite the turnout, isn't it?

93
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,443
Who the hell are you?

94
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,738
This is a warrant
for assault and solicitation of murder.

95
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,573
You'll get the details later.

96
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,408
Please cooperate.

97
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,659
Take them in.

98
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,952
From that side first.

99
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,412
Can you handle this?

100
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,330
Take them out.

101
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,374
How did you know we were here?

102
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,884
All our guys got arrested.

103
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,971
The prosecutors hit us unexpectedly.
We couldn't do anything.

104
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,515
Lee Ju-woon.

105
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,018
That son of a bitch must've…

106
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,104
Sir, you need to get out of here.

107
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,328
Gu Bong-san!

108
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,537
That's him!

109
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,374
Damn it!

110
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,546
<i>While the prosecution continues</i>
<i>its investigation into the Bongsan Group,</i>

111
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,091
<i>they are doing their best</i>
<i>to find its chairman</i>

112
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,093
<i>who disappeared during the probe.</i>

113
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,552
<i>When you served the warrant,</i>

114
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,306
if you'd waited a little longer,
you could've gotten Gu Bong-san too.

115
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,852
Just can't get that timing to work, right?

116
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:33,234
I heard from the investigators
that you moved in 30 minutes early.

117
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,737
Why? Did your father put you up to it?

118
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,244
Did your father make you do it…
to protect his friend?

119
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,210
I put you in charge,
and you went behind my back?

120
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,090
Hope you're ready.
You're getting fired for this.

121
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,552
Damn thugs.

122
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,096
You told me before, didn't you?

123
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,559
I should pick a side and prove it.

124
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,022
This is my answer.

125
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,445
You're starting to scare me.

126
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,623
After Gu Bong-san, my father is next.

127
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,336
Are you sure you're ready?

128
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,088
I've been ready

129
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,550
since the day…

130
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,137
I became a prosecutor.

131
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,030
Sir.

132
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,531
Yeah.

133
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,951
Why didn't you call first?

134
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,788
I wasn't expecting you today.

135
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,290
Yeah, that's the thing.

136
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,167
For some time now,

137
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,128
we've been meeting only when it suits you.

138
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,214
Why should I agree with that?

139
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,634
Is… something bothering you?

140
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,635
Yeah.

141
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,137
You told me that

142
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,974
I was the one who could lead this game.

143
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,062
That I had no choice 11 years ago,
but now it's different.

144
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,815
Yes,

145
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,775
I remember saying that.

146
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,236
But I still don't have a choice.

147
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,492
Why did you do it,

148
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,246
Mr. Kim… I mean, Cha Yeong-do?

149
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,457
Hold on a second.

150
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,128
You think I'm the one

151
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,840
who went after Bongsan?

152
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,551
I'm not talking about Bongsan.

153
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,933
Before I knew it,
money started leaking from my account.

154
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,311
And of all people,
it ended up with Detective Han.

155
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,897
Not long after that, Gi-seok was killed,

156
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,402
and Han took the case and buried it fast.

157
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,073
As far as I know, there's only one person
who could've made that happen.

158
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,577
So tell me.

159
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,954
Why did you do it?

160
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,795
There's a big flaw in your logic, sir.

161
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,967
Setting up a shell company, bribing a cop,

162
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,802
rigging a case…

163
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,014
And so on.

164
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,060
There's someone else besides me
who can do all that.

165
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,395
Someone in prosecution.

166
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,732
Why do you think

167
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,068
that person isn't one of yours? No…

168
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,781
That's just what
you want to believe, isn't it?

169
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:12,411
If you really dragged my son into this,
I'll smash your goddamn head in.

170
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,664
Sir, someone once told me

171
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,043
that the older people get,

172
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,921
the more they believe
what they want to believe.

173
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,426
Good day, sir.

174
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,762
Take care

175
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,348
of yourself.

176
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,516
Thanks.

177
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,593
- Did you have lunch?
- Yes.

178
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,858
Here's Gi-seok's stuff you asked for.

179
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,907
And this is the key to his car.

180
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,124
I swapped the plates,
so don't worry about being tracked.

181
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,261
Good job.

182
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,808
It feels damn good
now that bastard Gu Bong-san is gone.

183
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,729
It's his dumbass son
who put us through all this shit.

184
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,522
You're right. That asshole.

185
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:09,069
By the way, do you think Lee Ju-woon's son
hit Bongsan Group on his own?

186
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,738
Who knows?

187
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,907
Either he did it
to make a name for himself,

188
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,243
or Lee Ju-woon made him do it.

189
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,124
But who the fuck cares?
What's that got to do with us?

190
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,880
- Hey, Yang-sik.
- Yeah.

191
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,803
We don't need to overthink this, okay?

192
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,305
- What do I always say?
- Yeah.

193
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,307
The survivor is the strongest.

194
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,684
Just look at Nam Gi-jun.

195
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,855
That pathetic loser should've just
kept his mouth shut and moved on.

196
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,483
But no, the dumbass wanted revenge.

197
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,152
What's the point of being the toughest guy
if you're dead?

198
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,780
You're right. That dumbass.

199
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,742
That fucking asshole.

200
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,996
I spared that asshole's life,
and he still ended up dead.

201
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,081
Unbelievable.

202
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,001
I need to talk to him.

203
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,294
- Sorry?
- Alone.

204
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,629
Sure.

205
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,424
Holy shit. Thank God.

206
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,428
You could have knocked.

207
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,477
Have a seat.

208
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,689
Who was it?

209
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,399
What now?

210
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,026
The one who killed me.

211
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,655
Come on, Gi-jun. How would I know that?

212
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,200
You're alive! So what do you mean,
"The one who killed you"?

213
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,619
- How could I know? Why--
- Find out.

214
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,330
I'm not asking.

215
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,166
I'm giving you a chance to live.

216
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,880
What about Chun-seok and Byeong-ho?

217
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,008
THE LATE CHOI BYEONG-HO
THE LATE KIM CHUN-SEOK

218
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,387
I was going to handle it my way,
but it just didn't feel right.

219
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,306
So I cleaned them up
and gave them a proper funeral.

220
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,434
It cost me a fortune,

221
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,894
over 14 million…

222
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,273
No, forget it. It doesn't matter who paid.

223
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,278
Those damn fools.

224
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,115
What was the point
of trying to be so damn cool?

225
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,245
They should've just kept their heads down
and live the way I do.

226
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,727
You're here.

227
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,493
Anything you want to tell me?

228
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,123
If this is about Bongsan Group,
there was nothing I could do.

229
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,960
The higher-ups had been planning it
for a long time.

230
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,962
I just did what I was told…

231
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,589
Did you meet someone recently?

232
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,468
Who?

233
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,471
Cha Yeong-do.

234
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,556
I mean, Mr. Kim.

235
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,266
What did he tell you?

236
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,770
Did he say
he'd let you be a part of this world?

237
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,150
Did he promise to help you take my place?

238
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,781
Father, what are you…

239
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,957
You've always said that

240
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,293
there's no place for me in Juwoon.

241
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,087
And I get that.

242
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,673
I really do.

243
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,094
So honestly, I have no idea
what you're even talking about.

244
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,764
I'm just doing my job the best I can.

245
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,518
And besides, nothing's going to change

246
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,437
as long as you're here, right?

247
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,318
Get some rest.

248
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,054
Stop!

249
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,683
It's Juwoon!

250
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,393
You motherfucker!

251
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,939
Sir, Ju-woon is here.

252
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,693
You should get out of here.

253
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,949
<i>I've been a bystander</i>
<i>ever since Chairman Oh died.</i>

254
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,954
I always let others make the decisions.

255
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,167
And that's how I managed to survive
without getting my hands dirty.

256
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,754
But I was dead wrong.

257
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:23,008
My hands were already as dirty
as they could get. I just didn't see it.

258
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:24,885
So,

259
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,971
since I'm already in this mess,

260
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,475
I might as well
get my hands dirty one last time, sir.

261
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,658
I'll hold them off.

262
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,329
Get him out of here.

263
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,939
Hey!

264
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,442
Don't move!

265
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,407
Hey!

266
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,053
Come on!

267
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,097
Bring it on!

268
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,438
Hold on.

269
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,643
Send everyone out.

270
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,533
I'm sorry about this.

271
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,702
Don't be.

272
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,542
This is just how it goes…

273
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,505
for guys like us.

274
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,013
Just like you,

275
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,767
there's nothing I wouldn't do for my kid.

276
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,186
I hope you understand.

277
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,649
Hang in there.

278
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,611
Your turn's coming soon.

279
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,734
Let's go.

280
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:16,950
Chairman Gu

281
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,119
is really dead.

282
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,079
I see. Good work.

283
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,248
Like I promised,

284
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,585
you're the boss of Bongsan now.

285
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,671
Yeah, all right.

286
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,935
See? You should've been nicer.

287
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,062
GU BONG-SAN
GU JUN-MO

288
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,401
LEE JU-WOON
NAM GI-SEOK

289
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,616
LEE JU-WOON

290
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:03,371
Juwoon called me
to clean up after they attacked Bongsan.

291
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,249
But something feels off.

292
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,254
The Lee Ju-woon I know
wouldn't make this kind of move.

293
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,424
He made up his mind.

294
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,137
There's something he wants to protect.

295
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,723
Even if it meant killing Gu Bong-san.

296
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,832
Who is this?

297
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,403
It's been so long.

298
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,456
So… how are you holding up?

299
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,147
Of course.

300
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,274
I knew you wouldn't die that easily.

301
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,194
I suppose you have some questions for me.

302
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,446
Did you…

303
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,908
have me killed?

304
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,787
Just like you killed Chairman Gu?

305
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,629
There's someone you don't know about.

306
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,386
If you were the one who set the stage,

307
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:29,434
he's the one who's been
controlling the game since you left.

308
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,188
We call him Mr. Kim.

309
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,105
<i>Come in.</i>

310
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,742
Say hello.

311
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:48,787
Nice to meet you.

312
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,749
<i>Chairman Oh brought him in</i>
<i>through his police connections.</i>

313
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,758
Superintendent Cha Yeong-do, as before.

314
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,261
<i>He gave us internal police intel</i>

315
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,598
<i>and helped cover up</i>
<i>our illegal activities.</i>

316
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:20,318
VETERANS' APARTMENT

317
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,036
<i>At first, Mr. Kim wasn't too greedy.</i>

318
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,122
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

319
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,050
- Good to see you, yeah.
- Good to see you.

320
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:49,138
<i>Even after Chairman Oh died,</i>
<i>he didn't leave this world behind.</i>

321
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,813
<i>He stayed with me and Bong-san</i>
<i>and made a lot of money.</i>

322
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,316
MR. KIM'S SECRET OFFICE

323
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,736
<i>A lot more money than he made</i>
<i>back in Oh's time.</i>

324
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,792
<i>But that still wasn't enough for him.</i>

325
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,964
<i>He held our weaknesses</i>

326
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,634
<i>and controlled us from behind the scenes.</i>

327
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,595
<i>Well,</i>

328
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,180
<i>that's how</i>

329
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,350
<i>we managed to keep the peace up until now.</i>

330
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,022
But then…

331
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,776
it suddenly hit me.

332
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,862
Back then and even now…

333
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,035
maybe it wasn't you
who started all of this but Mr. Kim.

334
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,705
Because it always bothered me.

335
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,041
Gi-seok was a rookie 11 years ago.

336
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:02,462
So how did he get information
on Chairman Oh's son?

337
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,636
<i>So,</i>

338
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,597
<i>if I kill Chairman Oh's son--</i>

339
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,724
<i>I never told you to kill him.</i>

340
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,978
<i>I'm just saying he's after your brother.</i>

341
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,648
<i>That's all, yeah.</i>

342
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,613
It was Mr. Kim
who gave Gi-seok that information.

343
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,617
I understand if you don't believe me.

344
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,996
But just know this.
He's pulling the strings again.

345
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,793
Gi-seok's dead,
and now he's dragging you into this.

346
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,712
Just like 11 years ago.

347
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,055
I really did plan to hand over the company

348
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,432
to Gi-seok.

349
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,852
But now that he's gone,

350
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,563
there's no one in the group
that I can trust.

351
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,692
So I…

352
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,945
want you, Gi-jun,

353
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,739
to take over Juwoon.

354
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,451
Like before,

355
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,662
my choice is the same.

356
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,837
Where do I go

357
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,922
to find that guy?

358
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,425
I'll make him show himself.

359
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,674
DIRECTOR LEE JU-WOON
INCOMING CALL

360
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,802
Yes, Chairman.

361
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,097
Right now?

362
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:24,062
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE

363
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:44,373
MERCY FOR NONE

364
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,252
But why me, of all people?

365
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,546
I'm not the only director at Bongsan.

366
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,674
Mr. Hong,

367
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,844
let me ask you in return.

368
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,931
What about Juwoon, then?

369
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,520
Who do you think is the right person
to take over after Lee Ju-woon?

370
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,983
Nam Gi-seok is dead, so he's out.

371
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,569
Park is too old-school.

372
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,863
If you rule out everyone else,

373
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,824
maybe Choi Seong-cheol?

374
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,784
Exactly.

375
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,871
That's why I chose you.

376
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,755
I ruled out everyone else,
which left only you.

377
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,764
Go ahead.

378
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,232
Yes, come in.

379
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,741
It's been a while.

380
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,412
So, I do know him.

381
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,750
Oh, really? That's not what I heard.

382
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,713
He wasn't on your list, Mr. Hong,

383
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,382
but Juwoon Group

384
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,552
already has its rightful successor.

385
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,432
Here he comes.

386
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,446
So…

387
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,658
are you sure you're ready?

388
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:57,978
