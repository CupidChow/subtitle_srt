1
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,946
CONDOLENCES

2
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,961
Are you all right?

3
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,047
Gi-jun stopped by.

4
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,301
Nam Gi-jun?

5
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,304
That name takes me back.

6
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,183
So, he's still alive, huh?

7
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,101
But he asked me something strange.

8
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,896
If there is anything he should know
about Gi-seok's death.

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,528
Given the way his brother died,
is that such a strange question?

10
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,781
It seems pretty normal to me.

11
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,991
So I wanted to ask you.

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,786
Is there anything
I should know about Gi-seok's death?

13
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,959
That's actually something
I wanted to ask you.

14
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:30,965
I heard that Mr. Nam had talked recently
about his plans to leave the company

15
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,467
with you, sir.

16
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,137
That must've upset you quite a bit.

17
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,140
Come on, you know how nosy I am.

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,312
Find out if it was really done by kids.

19
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:47,982
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,062
MERCY FOR NONE

21
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,233
Nam Gi-seok was
Juwoon's second-in-command.

22
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,819
He turned it into a legitimate business.

23
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,989
We believe he was running
Juwoon Group's gallery

24
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,033
to launder the group's money.

25
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,327
Let's go back in time a bit further.

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,872
Juwoon and Bongsan gangs were formed

27
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:48,209
when Beomyeongdong gang,
which once controlled Seoul, split in two.

28
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,253
That gang was led by this guy,

29
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,380
Chairman Oh.

30
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,467
His right-hand men, Lee Ju-woon
and Gu Bong-san, staged a coup.

31
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,596
The incident that triggered the coup

32
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,681
was the death of his son, Oh Seung-won.

33
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,476
It's oddly similar
to the recent Nam Gi-seok case.

34
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,105
Are you saying that
Nam Gi-seok's death, the heir apparent,

35
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,732
could lead to another war?

36
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,650
Aren't you overreacting?

37
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,861
Not even close.

38
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,282
Dozens died when those thugs started
a knife fight in the middle of Seoul

39
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,161
just five months
before the presidential election.

40
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,957
Do you know how many people
in law enforcement were fired over this?

41
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,713
Are we sure
those kids acted alone in Nam's case?

42
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,634
Based on the police report, yes.

43
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,638
Forget the police report.
Do we know for sure?

44
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,182
I guess…

45
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,353
Everyone leave the room.

46
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,270
Excuse me?

47
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,147
Get out.

48
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,785
No, you stay.

49
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,330
You worked hard
to join Special Investigations,

50
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,540
but you're treated like an outsider.

51
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,585
And at home,
they act like you don't even exist.

52
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,216
I saw you being turned away
at the funeral yesterday.

53
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,760
Are you still keeping tabs on me?

54
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,345
Keeping tabs?

55
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,805
Don't flatter yourself.

56
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,848
I went to the funeral too.

57
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,729
It seems like
Chairman Lee isn't what he used to be.

58
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,569
When your father retires,

59
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,657
will you leave prosecution
and move to Juwoon Group as their lawyer?

60
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,785
I've never considered that.

61
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,869
Really?

62
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,955
Everyone here seems to think so.

63
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,252
Let's be honest with each other now.

64
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,587
At this rate,

65
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,924
you'll never move further up from here.

66
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,929
But you won't be welcomed
at Juwoon Group either. Am I right?

67
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,890
What are you trying to say?

68
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,234
I'm giving you a chance.

69
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,531
A chance to pick whose side you're on
and make your way up.

70
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,451
I want you

71
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,078
to handle the Nam Gi-seok case.

72
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,832
Where are you?

73
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,002
<i>Bro, just fucking do</i>
<i>whatever that guy says, okay?</i>

74
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,756
He's fine for now.

75
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,507
So tell me.

76
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,343
Who put you up to it?

77
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,017
Okay.

78
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,438
Fuck.

79
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:58,941
You win.

80
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,820
Hey.

81
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,281
Have you heard of the Graveyard?

82
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,080
Damn, you're freaking old.

83
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,874
There's this chat room
called the Graveyard.

84
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,169
They use runaway kids like me
to do their dirty work for some dough.

85
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,046
But this time,

86
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,757
<i>a crazy huge deal popped up.</i>

87
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,552
<i>They've never paid that much money before.</i>

88
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,971
<i>I swear I didn't know anything.</i>

89
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,224
<i>They just told me</i>
<i>where to go and who to kill.</i>

90
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,560
<i>And it's not like I cared who it was.</i>

91
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,437
<i>You know?</i>

92
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,315
Is that all?

93
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,818
Damn it.

94
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,407
Those assholes from the Graveyard
got me a lawyer.

95
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,659
Ask her yourself.

96
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,411
I'll get her here.

97
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,038
STATEMENT
JEONG HUI-CHAN

98
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,416
Well done. See?

99
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,751
I told you that you could do it.

100
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,086
Honestly.

101
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,505
And let me be clear.

102
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,590
Don't try to be smart.

103
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,844
In situations like this,
just follow the expert's advice. Got it?

104
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,308
Wait, ma'am.

105
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,479
Bye.

106
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,273
Okay.

107
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,902
Yeah, I just got his statement.

108
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,613
I don't think there'll be any issues.

109
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,907
You know how kids are.

110
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,535
They start behaving
once they're in custody.

111
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,036
Yeah.

112
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,165
Anyway, send me
the remaining balance right away.

113
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,334
He'll be transferred
to a detention center next week.

114
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,086
You can finish him then.

115
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,004
Yeah.

116
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,673
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

117
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,716
Okay.

118
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,681
Who are you?

119
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,769
I'm the older brother
of Nam Gi-seok, the guy who died.

120
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,697
Are you out of your mind?

121
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,993
You do realize where we are, don't you?

122
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,787
We're at the police station,
and I'm a lawyer.

123
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,959
Do you honestly think you can threaten me?

124
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,630
Why?

125
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,883
Did you do something to deserve blackmail?

126
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,845
You know about the Graveyard, right?

127
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,475
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

128
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,477
So, this Graveyard…

129
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,358
Just like how food delivery apps
connect stores with riders,

130
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,985
<i>it connects clients with substitutes.</i>

131
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,447
Do something!

132
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,865
Shut up!

133
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,076
I screwed up.

134
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,537
I need someone
to go to prison for me right now.

135
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,791
My mom's candidacy review
is next month! Just get someone already!

136
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,543
Yes, I'm on it.

137
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,128
Got it. All right.

138
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,756
Ladies, an urgent one!

139
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,802
"Need a fall guy for the death
of a woman in her twenties."

140
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,719
Let's post it.

141
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,139
<i>Let me break it down for you.</i>

142
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,560
Person A commits a crime
but doesn't want to go to prison.

143
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,396
B is ready to take the fall
for anything if they're paid.

144
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:28,067
A is the demand, and B is the supply.
The Graveyard connects the two.

145
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,864
<i>There's always plenty of demand,</i>
<i>but supply is the issue.</i>

146
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,910
<i>But the Graveyard is full of runaway kids</i>
<i>who haven't done military service yet.</i>

147
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,870
Hey! It's the Graveyard.

148
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,414
- The Graveyard?
- Hang on.

149
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,873
- What is it?
- Damn.

150
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,294
I found a match!

151
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,878
Okay.

152
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,506
<i>Going to prison lets them dodge the army</i>
<i>and make money.</i>

153
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,759
The charge is attempted sexual assault,
but public indecency…

154
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,344
<i>Once the groundwork is laid,</i>

155
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,722
<i>they bring in an expert</i>
<i>like me to finish the job</i>

156
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,473
the legit way.

157
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,059
That's all I know, really.

158
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,102
I'm just someone

159
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,439
who gives that company
occasional legal advice.

160
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,648
I swear.

161
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,110
If you don't believe me,
go ask them yourself.

162
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,153
Seriously.

SIM SEONG-WON, CEO

00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,745
Remember that shaman I saw? She was right.

165
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,293
She said I'd have great luck this month.
And, damn, I'm closing deals overseas.

166
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,462
So damn sweet.

167
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,505
We're going global.

168
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,091
Congratulations, boss.

169
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,803
Don't congratulate me yet, dumbass.
We're just getting started.

170
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,391
Are there any updates from Yoon?

171
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,810
She said it's all taken care of.

172
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,982
See? She might be uptight,
but she gets the job done.

00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,446
Who's that at this hour?

175
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,909
We should talk to Mr. Sim
and change the show host.

176
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,786
- It won't work.
- You're right.

Sir, may I help you?

We're actually closed…

00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,503
Go get him.

180
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,131
I'm sorry, sir.

181
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,966
We're closed for the day.

182
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,594
May I ask what brings you here?

183
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,013
Call Sim Seong-won. Tell him to come.

184
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,516
So you're here to see Mr. Sim.

185
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,977
If you don't mind me asking,
do you know what we do here?

186
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,233
You know, don't you?

187
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,984
What's going on?

188
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,319
Show him the way out.

189
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,196
Get this jerk out of here.

190
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,159
Damn it!

191
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,716
What about Juwoon Group? Still nothing?

192
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,928
Nothing. It looks like they have concluded
it was foul play by the kids.

193
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,389
Still, just to be safe,

194
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,559
shut down the Graveyard for now.

195
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,769
Yes, boss.

196
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,943
HEAD OFFICE RECEPTION

197
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,487
What is it?

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,531
<i>Sim Seong-won.</i>

199
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,871
What the fuck is this shit now?
Who's this?

200
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,707
It's me, Nam Gi-jun.

201
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,418
<i>You know why I'm calling, right?</i>

202
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,420
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

203
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,473
How could I forget
the most important person?

204
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:46,932
Holy shit.

205
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,605
Hey, how many guys
are at the office right now?

206
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,478
Die!

207
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:42,988
Fuck!

208
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,846
Boss.

209
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,233
Hey, look who it is!

210
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,528
Gi-jun, my man! It's been so long.

211
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,780
Hey.

212
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,909
You stupid little shit. Get up, you idiot!

213
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,035
Come on.

214
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,542
It's great to see you, Director Nam.

215
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,085
No, that's not right.

216
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,462
What should I call you now?

217
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,465
Mr. Nam Gi-jun?

218
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,518
Gi-jun.

219
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,980
Even if I seem
like I'm some kind of a big shot,

220
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,483
nothing's changed since you were around.

221
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,028
They say, "Clean this up."
I say, "Yes, sir."

222
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,113
They say, "Cover that up."
I say, "Yes, sir."

223
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,781
You know how it works.

224
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,744
I'm just a guy who follows orders.

225
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,747
So you knew the target was Gi-seok.

226
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,457
Says who? Fucking bastards.

227
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,418
I was just following orders,
same as always.

228
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,296
I didn't know.
I had no idea. Not at first anyway.

229
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,217
But I'd already taken the money.
What could I do?

230
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:28,928
I mean...

231
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,805
there was nothing I could do.

232
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,974
Shit, my legs.

233
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,228
I'm not crazy. If I knew…

234
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,523
I wouldn't have done it.

235
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,486
You got anything else to say?

236
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,404
Listen, Gi-jun.

237
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,282
I mean, Mr. Nam.
Let's think logically here.

238
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,993
Why do you think
I sent those little brats?

239
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,163
The target was Nam Gi-seok.
I'd have sent a pro if I wanted him dead.

240
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,167
Man, I can't believe he actually died.

241
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,090
Who is it?

242
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,135
What?

243
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,180
I said who is it?

244
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,062
Gi-jun, you know
that trust is everything in this business.

245
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,858
If word spreads that I gave away a client,
my business will be…

246
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,865
If I tell you, you will be in trouble too.

247
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,492
I will be the judge of that.

248
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,219
<i>Gu Jun-mo.</i>

249
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,890
Chairman Gu Bong-san's son.
He's the one who ordered the hit.

250
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,329
<i>Now what?</i>

251
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,875
Are you going to war with Bongsan
all by yourself?

252
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,303
Really?

253
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,639
Are you sure it was Jun-mo?

254
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,391
Yes, sir. I'm sure.

255
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,686
I'll get everyone ready.

256
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,480
Gu Bong-san.

257
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,442
I'm going to go see him first.

258
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,739
Yes, sir.

259
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,211
Don't you think it's time we pick a side?

260
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,129
Lee Ju-woon is going to kill us.

261
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,593
Maybe it's time to cut Juwoon off for good
and team up with Bongsan--

262
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,929
Shut up. You're giving me a headache.

263
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,264
Do you think I pay you to nag me?

264
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,645
I'm trying to think here, so keep it down.

265
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,689
Boss, it's Mr. Kim from Bongsan Group.

266
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,108
Tell him I'm not here.

267
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,820
Did Gi-jun come here last night?

268
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,030
Don't ask me.

269
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,033
Do I have to report
every little thing to you?

270
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,035
Gi-seok's hit…

271
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,039
Did Mr. Gu hire you himself?

272
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,625
Yes, he did. Screw it!

273
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,878
I don't give a damn anymore.
You guys clean up your own shit.

274
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,004
You're pissing me off.

275
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,138
Step outside.

276
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,518
You fucking asshole.

277
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,728
Can't you see what's going on?

278
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,356
Come on, man.

279
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,568
No need to swear like that.

280
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,528
How much does Gi-jun know?

281
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,283
Don't try to bullshit me, for fuck's sake.

282
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,953
Does Gi-jun know
it was Gu Jun-mo who hired you?

283
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,873
What do you expect?

284
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,669
It's Nam Gi-jun
we're talking about, all right?

285
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,462
Do you think I had a choice?

286
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,048
Is that all you've got to say,
you scumbag?

287
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,888
What about you guys?

288
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,640
Do you think
you could've stood up to Nam Gi-jun?

289
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,605
Shit.

290
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,487
I'm going to beat the hell
out of that goddamn shaman.

291
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,165
What a nice surprise.

292
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,460
I can't believe
you reached out to me first.

293
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,593
When did we start meeting here for drinks?

294
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,764
I guess you didn't call me
just for drinks.

295
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,515
Tell me.

296
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,186
What made it possible
for us to meet like this?

297
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,150
It's because of the rule we made
when Chairman Oh died.

298
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,653
That's right.

299
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,158
"Anyone who messes with the other side
must pay the price."

300
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,871
Whoever makes a mess must pay the price,

301
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,915
either with their life

302
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,626
or something of equal value.

303
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,505
For God's sake.

304
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,841
Stop beating around the bush

305
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,135
and get to the point.

306
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,766
Even if it's your son,

307
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,686
there are no exceptions.

308
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,903
Hold on.

309
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,490
What are you talking about?

310
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,660
Do you know what I thought
as soon as I heard about Gi-seok?

311
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,664
I thought, "This better not be an attack.
It has to be an accident."

312
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,749
"An accident caused
by some reckless kids."

313
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,002
Did you not hear me?

314
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,087
What are you talking about?

315
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,842
Your son, Jun-mo, hired Sim Seong-won.

316
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,220
And that's why
Gi-jun wrecked NClean last night.

317
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,474
You'll have to take responsibility
for what you just said.

318
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,102
Do you think I didn't check the facts?

319
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,190
Do you see now why I brought up the rule?

320
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,152
I get it.

321
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:05,032
But I hope you haven't forgotten
why that rule was made.

322
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,911
If Nam Gi-jun
hadn't screwed things up 11 years ago,

323
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,205
we wouldn't have needed that damn rule.

324
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,208
What you just said

325
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,378
is going to be a problem

326
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,589
whether it's true or not.

327
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,301
How dare you threaten my son's life.

328
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,679
If you lay a finger on Jun-mo,

329
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,766
do you think I'll stay quiet?

330
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,892
Fair enough.

331
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,854
Now that you know the truth,
you'll have to act.

332
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,898
Or rather, you have no choice but to act.

333
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,736
Either you make your son follow the rule,
or you go to war with me.

334
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,032
But, Mr. Gu,

335
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,161
I didn't call you here to talk about us.

336
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:57,542
I told you. Gi-jun wrecked NClean.

337
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,753
Don't you get it yet?

338
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,547
Don't you see what's coming?

339
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,426
- Sir.
- Are they inside?

340
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,669
Let me ask you one last time.

341
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,714
Did you have anything to do
with Gi-seok's death?

342
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,508
Nam Gi-jun!

343
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,679
Just answer my question.

344
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,013
You little shit!

345
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,014
Gi-jun.

346
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,269
Your brother's death
isn't just your concern.

347
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,147
It concerns Juwoon Group too.

348
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,982
I'll take care of this.

349
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,983
Does that mean

350
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,862
you're going to follow the rule?

351
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,613
You left this line of work.

352
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,575
The rule is none of your business now.

353
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,246
You will follow it, won't you?

354
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,585
Fine.

355
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,547
We'll deal with Sim Seong-won
and those brats.

356
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,091
You stay out of it.

357
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,885
That won't be necessary.

358
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,554
I already know…

359
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,143
who was behind it.

360
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,153
You weren't involved,

361
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,280
correct?

362
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,995
I trust you weren't.

363
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,841
In that case,

364
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,469
don't do anything.

365
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,305
Just watch.

366
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,716
Let me make up for what Jun-mo has done.

367
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,970
Just tell me what you want.
The casino? The duty-free shop?

368
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,137
Or something else?

369
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,767
You've got to do something.

370
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,520
You can't just let Gi-jun

371
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,064
tear everything apart.

372
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,321
What do you want me to do? Kill him?

373
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,202
If Jun-mo dies…

374
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,415
this relationship is over.

375
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,293
Mark my words.

376
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,880
This will be the last time
we drink together.

377
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,888
Take it.

378
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,935
Even if you start building your hotel now,

379
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,854
you won't live to see it.

380
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,025
So why bother building one?

381
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,068
Just take mine instead.

382
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,405
De'Cro Hotel.

383
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,743
I'll give it to you.

384
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,879
Sir--

385
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,007
Hello, sir.

386
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,635
Was it really you?

387
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,345
What?

388
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,766
Did you do it?

389
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,559
Answer me!

390
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,105
How can I answer when I don't know
what you're talking about?

391
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,608
Nam Gi-seok.

392
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,569
Did you do it?

393
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,160
Shit!

394
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,499
Yeah.

395
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,085
I did it.

396
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,795
So what?

397
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,590
"So what?"

398
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,717
"So what?"

399
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,803
You asshole!

400
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,898
Wasn't Cha enough?
Did you have to take Nam too? Why?

401
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,198
That bastard insulted me

402
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,617
in front of my men.

403
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,620
That's it?

404
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,331
It's not the first time
someone insulted you.

405
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,502
You've faced it your entire life.
What would one more day matter?

406
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,337
See?

407
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,633
Even my own father

408
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,680
makes me look like
a worthless piece of shit!

409
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,642
That's why I'm trying to prove myself!

410
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,817
Why do you need to prove yourself?

411
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,403
If you're incompetent,

412
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,364
does that mean you're not my son?

413
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,201
Jun-mo.

414
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,079
Don't you understand
why I'm so angry with you?

415
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,980
If you don't want to get killed
by Nam Gi-jun,

416
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,150
don't do anything without asking me first.

417
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,444
Do you understand?

418
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,785
Listen, Ji-ho. Use your hips.

419
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,661
Bam! One, two.

420
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,038
Bam! Try it.

421
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,457
Did you come here to bat?

422
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,294
We only do lessons for kids
at this time of day.

423
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,254
Gi-jun.

424
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,932
I went to the funeral.

425
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,144
I thought I should say goodbye
to Gi-seok at least.

426
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:18,149
But I didn't stay long because
I didn't want to run into those bastards.

427
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,820
Someone put a hit on Gi-seok, right?

428
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,864
And you know who it is, don't you?

429
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,578
Gi-seok came to see me
right before it happened.

430
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,706
Did he say anything?

431
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,709
No, not much.

432
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,670
But I could just tell.

433
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,755
Something was going on.

434
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,384
So now

435
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,847
I need a bat, just like my old one.

436
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,066
Of course. You got it.

437
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,738
It's going to take some time
to make it, so…

438
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,412
Here, take this first.

439
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,631
This isn't just anyone
we're talking about. It's Mr. Nam.

440
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:28,803
If you ignore this,
our men won't accept it.

441
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,764
Are you suggesting we go to war
with Bongsan Group?

442
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,523
- We'll lose more than we gain.
- Sir, if you set a precedent like this--

443
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,441
Hey!

444
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,612
I'm tired.

445
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,605
Hey.

446
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,608
What's going on?

447
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,693
What are you doing here?

448
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,279
I need to talk to the chairman.

449
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,823
You do?

450
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,329
All right. What is it?

451
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,914
Tell me instead.

452
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,670
I said tell me.

453
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,343
I already told you, didn't I?

454
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,888
The day he had that run-in with Gu Jun-mo…

455
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,516
He was taken out later that night.

456
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,646
I get that we had to wait
until the funeral was over,

457
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,440
but it's about time
the chairman does something.

458
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,778
He knows that it was Gu Jun-mo.

459
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,614
What?

460
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:15,451
All we have to do
is follow our boss's decisions.

461
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,413
So, he wants to do nothing?
And you're okay with that?

462
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,330
Hey.

463
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,416
Don't forget

464
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,293
where you stand right now.

465
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,670
Yeah.

466
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,880
I know my place.

467
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,635
You must be feeling pretty good.

468
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,348
You'll be taking over
Gi-seok's position soon.

469
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,944
Mr. Choi.

470
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,156
That doesn't look good.

471
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm teaching him some manners.

472
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,621
Still, you shouldn't beat him
like some thug.

473
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,095
This is company work
which doesn't concern you.

474
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,395
What do you think, Mr. Choi?

475
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,692
Do you really think
you'll lose more than you gain?

476
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,507
<i>This is my business.</i>

477
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,926
You should stay out of it now.

478
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,720
The company wants to put this behind them.

479
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,973
You should follow their decision.

480
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,475
Yeah.

481
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,062
Someone told me the exact same thing.

482
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,065
That all we have to do
is follow our boss's decisions.

483
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,362
But I could never respect
someone like that as my boss.

484
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,326
This isn't just your business.

485
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,204
It's mine too.

486
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,259
Damn it, I'm fucking starving.

487
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,103
<i>Name, Gu Jun-mo.</i>

488
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,064
Managing Director at BS Group
and CEO of De'Cro Hotel.

489
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,024
He drives a white Maserati Ghibli

00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,278
with license plate number 26D 7123.

491
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,445
Let's post it.

492
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,156
GU JUN-MO
DE'CRO HOTEL CEO

493
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,746
Let me know if you see him.

494
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,081
GU JUN-MO
DE'CRO HOTEL CEO

495
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,749
- Hey, look.
- What's up?

496
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,297
It's not him. Keep looking.

497
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,631
- STOP IT
- LOOKS IDENTICAL

498
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,009
GRAVEYARD MANAGER

00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,263
The plate number is different!

502
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,056
They're already haggling.

503
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,683
Yeah, like he'd be at a church.

504
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,236
26D 7123

505
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,452
Shit.

506
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,206
Damn it.

507
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,586
Here, we got Gu Jun-mo!

508
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,049
Oh my, we got him!

509
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,550
We did?

510
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,227
<i>Sir.</i>

511
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,230
<i>I've got his location.</i>

512
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:17,360
DE'CRO HOTEL

513
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,990
MERCY FOR NONE

514
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,415
<i>I knew he'd pull</i>
<i>this kind of shit someday.</i>

515
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,462
<i>Are you sure</i>

516
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,756
it was Jun-mo?

517
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,968
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>
<i>Gu Jun-mo, managing director at Bongsan.</i>

518
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,846
<i>He's the one who hired NClean</i>
<i>to murder Nam Gi-seok.</i>

519
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,475
<i>I knew he'd pull</i>
<i>this kind of shit someday.</i>

520
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,143
Does Gi-jun know?

521
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,397
<i>Yeah, he already wrecked NClean.</i>

522
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,483
But, sir,

523
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,362
this could just be the beginning,
not the end.

524
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:07,326
<i>The rule from 11 years ago</i>
<i>was made when Nam Gi-jun left.</i>

525
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,289
<i>Now that he's back,</i>
<i>it's time to set a new one.</i>

526
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,623
What?

527
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,042
<i>So what I'm saying is,</i>

528
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,169
<i>you could stick to the old rule</i>

529
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,339
and make Gu Jun-mo pay with his life,

530
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,385
or you could strike a deal with Mr. Gu
and let the whole thing slide,

531
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,344
