1
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,310
I'm sorry, sir.

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,856
I can't take this job.

3
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,316
Why not? Is the money not enough?

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,277
No, <i>I'm </i>not good enough.

5
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,073
It doesn't matter how much you offer.
I can't do it.

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,702
Are you scared of Nam Gi-jun?

7
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,663
Yes.

8
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,916
I was there too.

9
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,502
Eleven years ago, at that place.

10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,106
Do you believe it?

11
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,275
Nam Gi-seok.

12
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,404
Do you honestly think
some kids just killed him?

13
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,241
Do you think that's even possible?

14
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,544
- Hello, Pastor.
- Good evening.

15
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,505
- Hello.
- Let's go inside.

16
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,923
Awful weather, isn't it?

17
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,889
Where's Jun-mo right now?

18
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,016
He's with Kim Chun-seok.

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,477
Tell him to move Jun-mo
to the Yangpyeong safe house.

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,939
No, you go and handle it yourself.

21
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,568
And have our boys dig into the cops.

22
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,905
The cops, sir?

23
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,659
I want to know
who found Nam Gi-seok first,

24
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,121
who's investigating the case,
and if it really was done by some kids.

25
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,997
Get every detail.

26
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:04,999
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,201
MERCY FOR NONE

28
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,454
DE'CRO HOTEL

29
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,004
Mr. Gu.

30
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,423
We need to leave right away.

31
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,802
The chairman wants me to take you
to our safe house in Yangpyeong.

32
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,971
We'd better get moving.

33
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,101
Am I supposed to go
wherever my father says now?

34
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,187
Sir.

35
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,273
Nam Gi-jun is looking for you.

36
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,947
So,

37
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,243
you're going through all this trouble
because of that one bastard, huh?

38
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:26,080
Sir, I don't think you understand
how serious Nam Gi-jun is--

39
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,166
What the hell is the deal with Nam Gi-jun?

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,628
Why are you all so damn scared of him?

41
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,424
Hey!

42
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,302
What the hell?

43
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,470
Everybody out.

44
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,264
What's his deal?

45
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,183
What are you doing here?

46
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,520
Sir, we need to go. I'll take you.

47
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,939
What are you doing?

48
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,024
I'm taking you to Yangpyeong.

49
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,738
How long do we carry on
cleaning up his shit?

50
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,741
Yeah.

51
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,701
You can't come this way.

52
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,455
"Take Jun-mo to Yangpyeong."

53
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,125
"Beat him up if you have to."
That's the chairman's order.

54
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,669
Have you lost your mind?

55
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,839
I'm doing this
'cause you're not doing your job properly.

56
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,638
You goddam bastard!

57
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,641
Is Gu Jun-mo upstairs?

58
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,150
Fuck, let go!

59
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,318
Let him go!

60
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,319
Are you insane?

61
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,863
Do as he says, asshole.

62
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,250
Fuck.

63
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,210
Sir, you've got to go now.

64
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,962
You have to leave immediately.

65
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,006
Just chill.

66
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:02,176
Damn it. Can you please
listen to me just this once?

67
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,762
- Come on, I want to watch.
- Sir, seriously…

68
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,556
That asshole is actually here.

69
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,225
Please get up. Listen to me, please!

70
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,862
You bastard!

71
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,996
Gi-jun! Please stop, okay?

72
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,206
Can't you stop, for my sake?

73
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,583
Please stop.

74
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,876
You're walking well.

75
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,105
Sir, are you all right?

76
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,608
Get up. Come on, get up!

77
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,525
Get him out.

78
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,735
Get up. Now!

79
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,454
We have to go. We have to get out of here!

80
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,714
Fuck.

81
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,342
How many times did I tell you
to just listen to me?

82
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,137
Who the hell is that? Shit.

83
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,850
Cheon Hae-beom, that freaking asshole.

84
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,893
Gu Jun-mo!

85
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,812
- Hey!
- Hands off the door.

86
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,564
- Stop!
- Get the hell off!

87
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,108
Goddamn it! Fuck off!

88
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,366
You goddamn idiot!

89
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,162
So, is Jun-mo all right?

90
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,290
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>He's a bit shaken, but he's all right.</i>

91
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,958
<i>I'm taking him to Yangpyeong.</i>

92
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,378
Keep the security tight.
No one can find out he's there. Got it?

93
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,504
<i>Don't worry, sir.</i>

94
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,897
Damn, does this road ever end?

95
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:10,948
Sir.

96
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,201
We're here.

97
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,381
Do you want me to shred this too?

98
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,674
I don't know, damn it.

99
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,885
Just figure it out yourselves!

100
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:35,556
Look, they're going to catch us
and beat the shit out of us again.

101
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,266
We can't just take off like this.

102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,644
Are you a strategist now, you fucker?

103
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,103
I told you to pack right away,

104
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,731
but you spent 40 minutes
taking a shit, you bastard.

105
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,109
We've got to make a run for it
while we can, dumbass.

106
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,987
- You know…
- Mr. Sim.

107
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,366
Bongsan's tied up
with Nam Gi-jun right now,

108
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,702
so if we want to run,
this is our only shot.

109
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,789
Let me get you some coffee.

110
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,919
Are you going somewhere?

111
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,511
No, I'm not going anywhere.

112
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,597
I just got back.

113
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,891
I was away on business.

114
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,393
I'm exhausted.

115
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,979
Do you know where Gu Jun-mo is?

116
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,152
Come on.

117
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,989
I told you.
I just got back from a business trip.

118
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,868
He's probably in proper hiding.
Even the Graveyard wouldn't find him.

119
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,203
Find him.

120
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,331
You have one day.

121
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,841
What do you think, Mr. Choi?

122
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,637
Do you really think
you'll lose more than you gain?

123
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,416
Mr. Lee.

124
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,433
What's the reason?

125
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,728
What do you mean?

126
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,230
The wiretap.

127
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,274
Why did you tip me off?

128
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,739
Mr. Choi.

129
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,371
I'm a prosecutor,
and my father's a gang boss, so I know.

130
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,666
Prosecutors and gangsters
aren't so different.

131
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,086
They both put the group
ahead of the individual.

132
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,214
What do you think, Mr. Choi?

133
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:01,137
Do you think brushing aside Mr. Nam's
death is what's best for the company?

134
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,685
I stand by the chairman's decision.

135
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,895
Look, I understand my father.

136
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,567
Gu Jun-mo's death will start a war.

137
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,485
Of course he'd be terrified.

138
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,448
Everything he's built
could fall apart all at once.

139
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,744
But I see this as an opportunity.

140
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,749
A chance to bring
Bongsan Group down for good.

141
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,044
A chance for Juwoon Group

142
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,756
to take it all.

143
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,010
Just this week, hon,

144
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,637
could you please
take care of the recycling?

145
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,598
I won't be able to come home for a while.

146
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,516
- So could you--
- Mr. Kim!

147
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,559
Hold on.

148
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,606
Hon, I have to go. I'm hanging up.

149
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,983
Mr. Kim Chun-seok!

150
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,737
Did you call me, sir?

151
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,450
Let's pick up
where we left off last night.

152
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,244
What do you mean?

153
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,498
Nam Gi-jun.

154
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,666
Tell me more about him.

155
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,585
Gi-jun?

156
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,261
I guess
you're finally getting curious about…

157
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,556
Nam Gi-jun.

158
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,477
Mr. Gu.

159
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,065
How much do you know about him?

160
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,568
Back in the day,

161
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,946
<i>Nam Gi-jun was like a god to us.</i>

162
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,910
<i>Because he's the one who made</i>
<i>Ju-woon and Bongsan what they are today.</i>

163
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,413
Boss! The Busan gang…

164
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,875
<i>Back when Lee Ju-woon and Gu Bong-san</i>
<i>worked under Chairman Oh,</i>

165
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,253
<i>they clashed</i>
<i>with the biggest gang in Busan.</i>

166
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:02,299
<i>Chairman Oh wanted to expand into Japan,</i>
<i>so he needed control of Busan Port.</i>

167
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,889
<i>He was going to send the two of them</i>
<i>to take Busan, but they were too late.</i>

168
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,475
<i>The Busan gang struck first.</i>

169
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,907
<i>They held out as long as they could</i>
<i>but got overpowered.</i>

170
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,576
<i>They were about to fall.</i>

171
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,202
Kill them all!

172
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,788
<i>That's when Nam Gi-jun showed up.</i>

173
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,347
Kill him!

174
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,689
Die!

175
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,901
You fucking bastard!

176
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,495
What the hell?

177
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,347
<i>We realized once again</i>

178
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,516
<i>that it didn't matter to Nam Gi-jun</i>

179
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,019
<i>who he was up against,</i>
<i>or how many there were.</i>

180
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,690
<i>From that moment on,</i>
<i>Lee Ju-woon and Gu Bong-san's power</i>

181
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,359
<i>grew significantly.</i>

182
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,280
Hey, Seung-won.

183
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,992
<i>Rumors spread that Chairman Oh</i>
<i>planned to hand the company to them.</i>

184
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,787
What is it, son?
Do you have something to say?

185
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,332
No, not really.

186
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,417
Thank you.

187
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,169
<i>Those rumors were the problem.</i>

188
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,214
<i>They didn't sit well</i>
<i>with Chairman Oh's son.</i>

189
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,346
Are you sure…
the order came from the chairman's son?

190
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:13,847
Yes.

191
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,851
I thought the only way I could survive

192
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,188
was to tell you the truth
and ask for your forgiveness.

193
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,399
Please believe me. Please.

194
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,651
Here.

195
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,195
Please listen to this.

196
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,656
Here, listen to this. Please, here.

197
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,116
Go ahead and listen.

198
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,077
<i>Don't make me keep repeating myself.</i>

199
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,163
<i>Lee Ju-woon and Gu Bong-san! Go kill them.</i>

200
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,208
<i>Chairman Oh's son</i>
<i>crossed the line in the end.</i>

201
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,378
<i>It turns out</i>
<i>he put a hit on the two of them.</i>

202
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,799
<i>That's when all hell broke loose.</i>

203
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,009
- Damn.
- Is it a blackout?

204
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,468
Get the lights back on.

205
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,679
Who the hell are you?

206
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,403
Lee Ju-woon and Gu Bong-san.

207
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,280
Bring them to me.

208
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,370
What's going on?

209
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,212
<i>I thought taking out the chairman's son</i>
<i>was the best move for the company.</i>

210
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,007
Are you kidding me right now?

211
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,261
- You idiot.
- <i>Boss, you have to make a choice.</i>

212
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,972
<i>Either we let Oh kill us,</i>

213
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,267
<i>or we kill him first.</i>

214
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,395
Gi-jun.

215
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,608
<i>Sir,</i>

216
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,778
this was all Ju-woon.

217
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,238
I didn't know anything about it, sir.

218
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,615
I swear.

219
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,384
I appreciate you protecting the chairman
while I was away.

220
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,054
I hoped…

221
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,849
it wasn't you who did this.

222
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,976
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,566
Gi-jun.

224
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,777
Why did you do it?

225
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,488
I just don't get it.

226
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,116
There was no reason
for you to go this far.

227
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,286
The chairman's son…

228
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,707
You didn't kill him, did you?

229
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,884
Does that matter?

230
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,658
I'm sorry

231
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,119
I'm late.

232
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,430
<i>One day.</i>

233
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,017
<i>That's all it took</i>
<i>for Chairman Oh to go down.</i>

234
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,569
<i>And…</i>

235
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,072
<i>for Lee Ju-woon and Gu Bong-san</i>

236
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,867
<i>to take over everything.</i>

237
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,709
<i>After that incident,</i>

238
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,128
they created a rule to keep the peace.

239
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,758
"Anyone who causes trouble
must pay the price."

240
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,887
And Nam Gi-jun
was the first victim of that rule.

241
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,390
He helped them take everything,

242
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,518
but he also started the whole mess,
you know.

243
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,687
Still, he deserves some credit--

244
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,399
So that's why
they just cut his Achilles tendon?

245
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:36,944
Yeah.

246
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,280
Maybe they were afraid of him,

247
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,032
both Lee Ju-woon…

248
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,702
and Chairman Gu.

249
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,247
So…

250
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,752
you expect me to believe that bullshit
and stay stuck here.

251
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,088
Right?

252
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,299
Okay.

253
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,761
Go ahead
and spend your whole life scared of him.

254
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,931
I'm sorry.

255
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,768
I should've done whatever it took
to stop Gu Jun-mo.

256
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,646
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

257
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,364
Did Chairman Gu's son have Gi-seok killed?

258
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,451
Gi-jun, we need to rethink this.

259
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,245
I get how you feel,

260
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,456
but we can't take on
the entire Bongsan Group alone.

261
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,501
You don't have to help me.

262
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,921
That's not what I'm saying.

263
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,466
I'm worried about you.

264
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,469
Look,

265
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,763
I'll go talk to Chairman Lee, so--

266
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,433
He's not going to do anything about it.

267
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,852
What?

268
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,939
He knows it was Gu Jun-mo,
but he told everyone to forget about it.

269
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,903
That just proves
how little Gi-seok meant to him.

270
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,009
Shit.

271
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,427
Let me out.

272
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,554
You bastards.

273
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,973
Let me out!

274
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,060
Hey!

275
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,021
Hey!

276
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,192
This is not a house. It's a prison!
You bastards!

277
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,568
Let me out!

278
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,653
Let me out of here! Fuck!

279
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,700
Hey, I'm heading back to Seoul.

280
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,079
- Call me if anything happens.
- Yes, sir.

281
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,465
GU JUN-MO

282
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,633
GU JUN-MO
MANAGING DIRECTOR

283
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,551
Mr. Gu.

284
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,928
<i>So what you're saying is,</i>

285
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,890
the problem is
that Nam Gi-jun is still alive.

286
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,727
Once he's dead…

287
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,023
there will be no problem.

288
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,277
I'm sorry?

289
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,403
<i>Nam Gi-jun.</i>

290
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,531
I will take care of him.

291
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,077
I looked into Nam Gi-seok's case,
but something feels off about it.

292
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,413
INITIAL DISCOVERY AND REPORT
BY: HAN SEOK-YUN

293
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,582
"Discovered by

294
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,168
Han Seok-yun."

295
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:26,673
The officer in charge is Han Seok-yun,
but he's also the one who found the body.

296
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,134
Get him.

297
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,220
Bring him to me

298
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,182
right now.

299
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,516
Yes, sir.

300
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,362
Bro,

301
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,532
you didn't get hurt last night, did you?

302
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,160
It's been a while.

303
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,120
Are you okay?

304
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,419
Listen, it looks like

305
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,714
Gu isn't backing down.

306
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,343
It doesn't matter
how good you are, all right?

307
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,638
You're not just up against him
but Bongsan Group.

308
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,349
If you keep this up,
you're in real danger.

309
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,810
Does the whole group include you too?

310
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,110
Come on, give me a break.

311
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,950
Now that I think about it,

312
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,245
back when I was tagging along with you…

313
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,457
that was when the plaza was at its best.

314
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,502
At least back then,

315
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,921
people took responsibility
for their actions.

316
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,132
Why did you want to see me?

317
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,764
Here, take this.

318
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,432
That's where Gu Jun-mo is hiding.

319
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,103
What?

320
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,607
I can't just keep running forever.

321
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,359
Don't worry about me.

322
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,237
I was going to leave the company anyway.

323
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,785
Hey, Gi-jun.

324
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,246
Just go

325
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,250
and finish what you need to do, all right?

326
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,554
UNDER RENOVATION
10TH TO 13TH FLOORS CLOSED

327
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,569
I'm sorry, bro.

328
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,613
<i>I want you to go see Nam Gi-jun.</i>

329
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,158
When you do, he'll ask where I am.

330
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,911
<i>And when he does,</i>
<i>act like he's worn you down</i>

331
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,830
<i>and lead him straight into my trap.</i>

332
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,334
You said your daughter
just started walking.

333
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,544
<i>Don't you want to see her grow up?</i>

334
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,298
<i>Come on, Mr. Kim!</i>

335
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,301
<i>Is Nam Gi-jun</i>
<i>more important than your family?</i>

336
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,512
<i>If you want to keep your family alive,</i>

337
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,849
you have to kill him.

338
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,615
OKUR

339
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,052
<i>Is that bastard dead?</i>

340
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,178
Just wait.

341
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,305
I'm coming for you.
