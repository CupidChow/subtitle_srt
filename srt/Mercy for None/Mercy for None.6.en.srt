1
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,014
Come on.

2
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,437
Hey.

3
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,199
I really like this place because…

4
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,955
it's got a nice view.
But what's the point? Damn it.

5
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,750
Yeah, but this isn't exactly
a discreet spot.

6
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,339
Sorry if this is making you uncomfortable.

7
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,262
My friend is at the Prosecutors' Office,
so I figured since I was in the area…

8
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,562
Anyway, we're finally done
with Bongsan now.

9
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,567
Chairman Lee made a tough call.

10
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,781
Now it's your turn to make a decision.

11
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,700
I need more time.

12
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,745
Your father isn't just some pushover.

13
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,290
If you keep stalling,
you'll miss your chance.

14
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,212
Well, the choice is yours.

15
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:33,468
Do you want to stay an outsider
who doesn't belong anywhere?

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,553
Or…

17
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,228
do you want to be
the new ruler of that plaza?

18
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,932
MERCY FOR NONE

19
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,280
For fuck's sake, I thought you were dead.

20
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,325
Lee Ju-woon, that fucking bastard.

21
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,745
Wait. You're not thinking clearly
because of your brother--

22
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,333
Damn it!

23
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:50,920
Fuck!

24
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,276
It's been a while.

25
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,854
See you again.

26
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,112
<i>Are you on your way now?</i>

27
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,365
We're ten minutes out.

28
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,208
Holy shit.

29
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,379
I almost fucking died
and went to the Lord.

30
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,178
Nam Gi-jun, all right.

31
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,140
That bastard is as crazy as they say,
isn't he?

32
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,817
DIRECTOR LEE JU-WOON

33
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,987
Why the hell did you do that,
you motherfucker?

34
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,324
So, you want me to find the guy
who ran off in this car?

35
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,867
Is that it?

36
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,577
This is my last request.

37
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,372
You'll never see me again.

38
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,466
Listen, Gi-jun.

39
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,179
Do you know how a loser like me
has managed to survive this long?

40
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,563
I've got a great sense for which jobs
to take and which to pass on.

41
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,774
<i>Look, this is a terrible idea!</i>

42
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,194
<i>There's no way I'm doing this.</i>
<i>You said the guy's a cop.</i>

43
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,281
You'll be in deep shit
if you mess with a cop.

44
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,243
So, messing with Gi-seok was fine?

45
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,957
PLANNING AND BUDGET DEPARTMENT
SUPERINTENDENT CHA YEONG-DO

46
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,379
Yeah.

47
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,760
- Aren't you leaving?
- I've got some work left. You go ahead.

48
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,678
See you tomorrow, sir.

49
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,138
Have a good night.

50
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,030
<i>Hey. I got to meet Nam Gi-jun,</i>
<i>thanks to you.</i>

51
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,909
<i>Well, I've got to say,</i>
<i>this isn't like you. Right?</i>

52
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,496
<i>Pulling this kind of fucking bullshit</i>
<i>behind my back.</i>

53
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,249
<i>We should meet sometime soon too.</i>

54
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,044
<i>To play the message--</i>

55
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,848
Aren't you going to work?

56
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,768
I hear you called a board meeting.

57
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,652
I'm going there now on your behalf.

58
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,281
Say that again. You're going where?

59
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,203
I don't even know where to start.

60
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,665
When I first met Mr. Kim?

61
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,002
And we said
we'd change the whole game together?

62
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,171
Or

63
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,092
the first time I decided
to take your place?

64
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,222
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

65
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,517
Do you even know
how crazy Cha Yeong-do is?

66
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,769
Why are you blaming him?

67
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,106
All of this happened
because you pushed me out.

68
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,902
You idiot. This life? This position?
It's a nightmare every single day!

69
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,072
Everything I've done, I did it for you!

70
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,367
Because I didn't want you
to live like me, you bastard!

71
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,122
But that's what you want.

72
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,208
Not what I want.

73
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,837
You know,

74
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,465
I've always wanted to be like you.

75
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,551
I've always wanted your place,

76
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,971
and I've never given up. But you…

77
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,809
You gave it away just like that.

78
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,489
NAME: LEE JU-WOON

79
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,491
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT
APPLICATION

80
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,036
You little shit!

81
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,581
You think that piece of paper can stop me?

82
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,584
You think Mr. Shin and Mr. Park
will listen to you?

83
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,960
If they won't,

84
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,923
I'll make them listen.

85
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,139
Just watch.

86
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,724
We should get going, sir.

87
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,068
I'm sorry, sir.

88
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,933
Hey, Mr. An.

89
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,227
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

90
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,897
Are you ready
to even the score with Nam Gi-jun?

91
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,235
<i>Take my car.</i>

92
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,666
<i>Then Nam Gi-jun will come find you.</i>

93
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:50,756
AUTHORIZED VEHICLES ONLY

94
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,512
Ma'am! Take a look at this.

95
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,609
<i>Hey, I found the cop.</i>

96
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,111
<i>I just texted you the address.</i>

97
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,030
Okay, I got it.

98
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,742
<i>But Gi-jun,</i>
<i>how far are you planning to take this?</i>

99
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,994
I have to end this.

100
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,622
All of it.

101
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,715
What's he doing here?

102
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,593
Where's the chairman?

103
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,510
JUWOON

104
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,428
I'm not sure.

105
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,701
Gentlemen… I look forward
to working with you from now on.

106
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,221
I see what's going on.

107
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,558
It seems like you were planning a coup
by winning over Seong-cheol.

108
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,894
Listen, young master.
You're wasting your time.

109
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,481
While you were calmly
flipping through your books,

110
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,902
we've put our lives on the line
with the chairman countless times.

111
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,447
There's not a single person here…

112
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,159
who sees you as one of us.

113
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,580
Anyone who can't accept this

114
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,500
can leave now.

115
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,053
What are you all doing? Let's go.

116
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,978
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of my way!

117
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,146
You bastards.

118
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,775
What's going on?

119
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,279
I'm not like my father.

120
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,788
He didn't want to get his hands dirty,

121
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,583
but that's not a problem for me.

122
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,960
I'm not afraid

123
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,045
to get my hands dirty

124
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,174
if that's what it takes.

125
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,139
Tae-hwan.

126
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,391
Why did you do that?

127
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,394
Eleven years ago.

128
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,981
Why didn't you just kill me then?

129
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,988
Fuck.

130
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,867
This is fucking humiliating.

131
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,780
Let's get this over with.

132
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:54,852
Pick it up.

133
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,252
Please, let's stop this.

134
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,138
Damn it.

135
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,645
See?

136
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,485
You should've killed me then.

137
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,061
Fuck.

138
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,023
Will you humiliate me until the end?

139
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,800
Gi-jun.

140
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,221
This world…

141
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,893
doesn't end

142
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,896
until everyone dies.

143
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,232
I know.

144
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,536
Go…

145
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,540
find him.

146
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,963
MR. KIM

147
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,595
Welcome.

148
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,060
I guess this is our last goodbye.

149
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,521
Looks like it.

150
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,564
So,

151
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,733
do you regret it?

152
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,486
Being in that position.

153
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,452
You know, you're such a selfish man.

154
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,705
You had so many chances,

155
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,126
but not once did you set things right,

156
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,295
even though you knew everything. Why?

157
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,465
Because it was all too sweet.

158
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,262
Because you didn't want to lose
everything you had.

159
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,767
You're going to get blood on your hands?

160
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,146
Well, this wasn't part of the plan.

161
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,482
But if you stay alive,

162
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,943
I think I'd be in danger.

163
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,654
You understand, right?

164
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,950
Don't worry about your prosecutor son.

165
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,785
I'll take good care of him.

166
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,330
You've made a huge mistake
bringing Geum-son into this.

167
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,373
Have I?

168
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,001
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

169
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,593
All right.

170
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,721
Okay, calm down.

171
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,517
You son of a bitch.

172
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
You little…

173
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,541
Sir.

174
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,341
Don't move!

175
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,239
You're under arrest
for the murder of Chairman Lee Ju-woon.

176
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,156
Ju-woon.

177
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,159
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

178
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,537
You have the right to an attorney, and--

179
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,747
You have the right to remain silent.

180
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,833
Wait outside.

181
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,127
What do we have here?

182
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,467
Why did you do it? Huh?

183
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,683
So, we meet again. That was fast.

184
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,476
Right?

185
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,188
What?

186
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,317
You think this isn't fair?

187
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,631
It's him.

188
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,290
Damn it.

189
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,586
Damn, he's strong for an old man.

190
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:06,051
See what happened?
Why did you have to do this?

191
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,386
Hey?

192
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,223
Why couldn't you just look the other way?

193
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,435
I mean,

194
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,606
you could've just
turned a blind eye. Right?

195
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,444
You've been doing that for over ten years.
Goddamn it.

196
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,074
All because of your damn kid.

197
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,160
Shit.

198
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,288
Goodbye, then.

199
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,500
Don't worry

200
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,918
<i>about your little boy.</i>

201
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,172
<i>For fuck's sake.</i>

202
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,511
<i>Our plan</i>

203
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,473
wouldn't have been
possible without you, Mr. Nam Gi-jun.

204
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,934
Both 11 years ago

205
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,145
and now.

206
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,313
Is that why you killed him?

207
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,651
Did you kill

208
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,028
Gi-seok…

209
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,615
to drag me into this?

210
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,290
In the end, that's how it turned out.

211
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,460
But even without our plan,

212
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,296
your brother would've died anyway.

213
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,213
Why?

214
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,594
Because once Lee Ju-woon picked him
as his successor,

215
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,181
he only had two choices.

216
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,265
Either die…

217
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,685
or take the throne.

218
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,402
You haven't asked me.

219
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,532
I literally just said, "our plan."

220
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,285
Don't you want to know…

221
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,623
who

222
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,667
the other person is?

223
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,722
Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

224
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,726
Here, Nam Gi-jun.

225
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,313
Our unit will take over from here.

226
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,475
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
NO ENTRY

227
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,816
They want me dead here?

228
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,660
Hey! You bastard.

229
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,453
Goddamn it, this little shit.

230
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,142
Damn you!

231
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,226
Let go!

232
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,647
Let go!

233
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,565
Hey!

234
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,478
Goddamn bastard.

235
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,940
You're so dead, you fucking shit.

236
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,881
Come on, at least act surprised.

237
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,967
How did you find me here?

238
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,722
Cha Yeong-do called
and told me to clean up this mess.

239
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,059
He said if I took care of you,
I'd get a cut or something.

240
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,602
Fuck, I don't know.

241
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,104
So,

242
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,481
why are you helping me?

243
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,738
Sim Seong-won just called.

244
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,158
Nam Gi-jun has been confirmed
dead at the scene.

245
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,078
What's the setup?

246
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,580
A car accident during the transfer.

247
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,501
I see.

248
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,628
Thank you.

249
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,974
Fucking hell.

250
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,436
It's so damn hard to make a living.

251
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,646
<i>Cha Yeong-do,</i>

252
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,651
a manager in Planning and Budget, one of
the hidden gem departments in the police.

253
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,820
What's odd is,

254
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,197
once you make manager,

255
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,367
you usually move up
or get reassigned in a few years.

256
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,704
But this guy has been
sitting there for 11 years.

257
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,374
He didn't go
to the National Police University,

258
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,711
so he figured there was a ceiling for him
and probably stayed put.

259
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,966
So, he's been covering for both
Juwoon and Bongsan Group for 11 years.

260
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,051
Yeah.

261
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,889
You still haven't answered my question.

262
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,892
Why are you helping me?

263
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,022
You could get yourself killed.

264
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,193
You're right.

265
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,029
Oh, right.

266
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,156
Here.

267
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,743
This is a burner phone for you to use.

268
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,661
And

269
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,290
this is Lee Ju-woon's pipe.

270
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,959
It means something to you, right?

271
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,462
Listen.

272
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:02,050
I'm leaving the country for a while
before this blows back on me.

273
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,011
Do you get my drift?

274
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,265
Get moving.

275
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,368
<i>Goodbye, then.</i>

276
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,663
<i>Don't worry about your little boy.</i>

277
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,966
I'll take care of it.

278
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,425
No, not yet.

279
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,642
Cha Yeong-do has confidential files
hidden away about Juwoon Group.

280
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,478
We need to secure those first.

281
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,366
SEIZE AND SEARCH WARRANT
CHA YEONG-DO

282
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,419
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

283
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,837
Let's go.

284
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,966
We're prosecutors.

285
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,725
Let's pick up the pace.
Make sure you check the floors.

286
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,226
No one can reach him.

287
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,437
He must've caught on to us.

288
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,564
Don't leave anything behind.

289
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,399
- Wait, not the safe.
- Take everything.

290
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,442
Look,

291
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,361
if Cha Yeong-do doesn't show up,
you'll be in trouble.

292
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,238
This is over the line!

293
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,032
What's going on?

294
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,825
Get moving.

295
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,456
Come on, you've got enough.

296
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,042
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

297
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,586
Hi, what's up?

298
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,422
<i>Sir, you can't come</i>
<i>into the office right now.</i>

299
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,008
<i>The prosecution's raiding us.</i>

300
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,928
<i>- Sir?</i>
- Fuck.

301
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,810
Wow, Mr. Lee.

302
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,355
<i>Stabbing me in the back, are you?</i>

303
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,149
I told you before
that I'd do what I have to.

304
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,233
What the f--

305
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,863
Listen.

306
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,492
I don't know why you're doing this,

307
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,662
but you need to stop.

308
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,581
You were doing so well. What the hell?

309
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,709
<i>Did you really think I wouldn't know?</i>

310
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,799
<i>My father</i>

311
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,386
<i>wasn't killed by Nam Gi-jun.</i>

312
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,847
<i>I needed more time,</i>
<i>but you couldn't wait for that.</i>

313
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,893
Wait, Mr. Lee.

314
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,064
There must've been a misunderstanding.

315
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,107
<i>A misunderstanding?</i>

316
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,443
But that's your style, isn't it?

317
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:11,155
<i>You create misunderstandings,</i>
<i>stir conflicts, and make people fight.</i>

318
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,033
Look, can we meet and talk in person?

319
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,243
<i>Maybe next time.</i>

320
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,953
<i>If there is a next time.</i>

321
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,422
Fuck.

322
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,267
<i>This phone is off,</i>
<i>and your call will go to voicemail.</i>

323
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,185
<i>Charges apply after the beep.</i>

324
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,108
<i>You bastard. I told you to call me back.</i>

325
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:51,195
<i>You want to get back</i>
<i>on the Interpol wanted list?</i>

326
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,948
<i>Get back to me right now.</i>

327
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,621
Is Mr. Cha furious?

328
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,458
Get to the point.

329
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,086
Meeting like this won't help either of us.

330
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,337
"Kaneyama."

331
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,715
Isn't that your real name?

332
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,010
You're a hitman from Shimane Prefecture.

333
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,179
A Korean-Japanese named Kim Gil-lok.

334
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,765
You were wanted by Interpol

335
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,060
until Cha Yeong-do cleaned your record
and made you his partner.

336
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,313
It looks like a partnership,

337
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,440
but he's just using you, isn't he?

338
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,154
I'll make sure you can live in Korea.

339
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,074
Not as Kaneyama or Shimane,

340
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,784
but as Kim Gil-lok.

341
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:39,619
Why…

342
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,539
would you do that for me?

343
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,542
I need you to kill some people,

344
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,045
Mr. Kim Gil-lok.

345
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,257
<i>I've tracked down Cha Yeong-do's men.</i>

346
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,094
<i>Follow that car, and you'll find him.</i>

347
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,387
<i>This is the last time I'm helping you.</i>

348
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,079
<i>Did you get it?</i>

349
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,248
<i>I got it. I'm on my way.</i>

350
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,083
<i>Don't let anyone follow you.</i>

351
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,584
<i>Yes, sir. I'll be there soon.</i>

352
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,553
That little shit. Unbelievable.

353
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,477
JUWOON GROUP JW GALLERY

355
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:26,642
<i>You're Chairman Lee's son.</i>
<i>How did you find me?</i>

356
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,687
<i>No. I mean, why are you here?</i>

357
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,194
The police internal affairs team
is planning an investigation into you.

358
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,114
I can make it go away.

359
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,077
You're being bold, aren't you?

360
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,371
So,

361
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,332
what do you want?

362
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,254
A position.

363
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,216
A position?

364
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,801
I want to unite Juwoon and Bongsan

365
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,970
and sit at the top.

366
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,077
What's the plan?

367
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,372
Shall we do it my way?

368
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,792
No.

369
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,836
I have a plan.

370
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,840
We'll use Gu Jun-mo

371
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,386
to get rid of Nam Gi-seok.

372
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,012
You want to kill Nam Gi-seok

373
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,057
and start a war
between Juwoon and Bongsan?

374
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,645
That sounds pretty risky, no?

375
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,899
What concerns me the most is Nam Gi-jun.

376
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,902
He'll take action.

377
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,038
There's something my father
always used to say to me.

378
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,835
He said there were things he wanted
but couldn't have,

379
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:21,507
but that I would be able
to have everything I wanted.

380
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,427
The thing is,

381
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,055
he never asked me

382
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,349
what I actually wanted.

383
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,478
I'll say this again.

384
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:41,527
I want both Juwoon and Bongsan.

385
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,187
<i>We'll use Gu Jun-mo</i>

386
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,899
<i>to get rid of Nam Gi-seok.</i>

387
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,028
<i>I'll say this again.</i>

388
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:28,908
<i>I want both Juwoon and Bongsan.</i>

389
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,793
LEE JU-WOON

390
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,169
GU BONG-SAN

391
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,340
LEE GEUM-SON

392
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,842
I hope we make a good team,

393
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,470
Mr. Prosecutor.

394
