1
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,224
For fuck's sake, nothing is going up.

2
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,939
You know why I wanted to see you, right?

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,233
Yeah, of course.

4
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,943
But sir,

5
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,988
this situation is very simple.

6
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,115
With all due respect,

7
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,827
only one person needs to accept his fate.

8
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,042
Wasn't it Jun-mo who started all this?

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,668
Eleven years ago,

10
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,130
you told Lee Ju-woon and me

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,842
that for all of us to coexist,

12
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,802
we needed our own rule.

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,845
Yeah, I did.

14
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,599
And Jun-mo was the one…
who broke that rule.

15
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,185
I'm not talking about the rule.

16
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,896
I'm talking about coexistence.

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,816
Man, this is frustrating.
It's like talking to a wall.

18
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:12,781
If you wanted to coexist,
you should've followed the rule.

19
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,657
If Jun-mo dies, so does coexistence.

20
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,369
I talked to Lee Ju-woon
and made sure he understood.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,833
Juwoon will stay out of this too.

22
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,751
Really?

23
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,216
Money really can do a lot, can't it?

24
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,885
I thought he cared a lot about Gi-seok.

25
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,137
Only one problem remains.

26
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,181
Nam Gi-jun.

27
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,935
This will all be over once he dies.

28
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:42,936
But sir,

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,938
you know as well as I do

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,066
that he won't go down so easily.

31
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,403
And that's why I need your help.

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,699
You want us to coexist more than anyone.

33
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,663
I don't care what you do. Make it happen.

34
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,791
Unless you want another bloodbath

35
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,877
just like 11 years ago.

36
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,770
Like father, like son.

37
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,845
MERCY FOR NONE

38
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,014
<i>Just wait.</i>

39
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,474
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

40
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,983
"Wait"? Fuck that.

41
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,874
You know, like a standoff before a fight.

42
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,334
Are we expecting someone?

43
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,462
Did we get any orders about this?

44
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,548
Probably some couple looking
for a place to stay. Send them away.

45
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,677
This is not that kind of place.

46
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,892
Civilians aren't allowed here.
Move your car.

47
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,018
What?

48
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,812
Damn.

49
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,649
To me, you're the civilians.

50
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,650
Is Gu inside?

51
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,276
What the hell?

52
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,290
You bastard!

53
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,960
Get out there now!

54
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,587
Come on!

55
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,800
What?

56
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,013
Are you telling me
to fight some lowlife thug?

57
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,600
Hey, big shot,
you seriously don't know who I am?

58
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,687
I'm Jeong In-seok, the champion.

59
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,105
I know.

60
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,900
You're the guy who got busted for doping
and lost his title.

61
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,947
Didn't I tell you?

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,451
Say that again, and you're dead.

63
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,619
And didn't I tell you?

64
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,457
This fight's worth a billion.

65
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,672
Look.

66
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,302
I could end up killing him.

67
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,226
Perfect.

68
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,026
<i>You fucking idiots!</i>
<i>There were so many of you!</i>

69
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,528
<i>And you still let him get away?</i>

70
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,531
The Jeong In-seok I know?

71
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,036
Answer me, for fuck's sake.

72
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,370
Yes, sir. That's him.

73
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,290
Jeong's agency.

74
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,917
Call them first.

75
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,755
Then check everywhere Mr. Gu might be.
Hotels, clubs, saunas, country clubs,

76
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,674
even places you wouldn't expect. Got it?

77
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,931
Why are you still here?

78
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,850
Move it.

79
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,574
Sir,

80
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,743
where are you?

81
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,579
<i>Nam Gi-jun is still alive.</i>

82
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,874
What?

83
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,959
<i>So I've come out to kill him myself.</i>

84
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,587
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

85
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,465
It's not the same, is it?

86
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,929
Back in the day, you'd tough it out
no matter how badly you'd been hurt.

87
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,014
I know.

88
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,143
I heard about what happened to Gi-seok.

89
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,563
No matter what I say,

90
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,566
you'll still go after
the guy who did it, won't you?

91
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,950
Fine, I won't stop you.

92
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,831
But let me patch you up first.
Then go get your revenge.

93
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,959
Before it's too late.

94
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,633
TAEGWANG CLINIC

95
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,718
Hey bro, you're holding on, right?

96
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,554
Don't let go.

97
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,488
Hello.

98
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,657
<i>I'm meeting with Ju-woon tomorrow.</i>

99
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm going to tell him
to deal with Gi-seok's death

100
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,371
<i>by the rule.</i>

101
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,957
I told you not to do anything.

102
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,167
<i>Gi-jun.</i>

103
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,751
So, promise me

104
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,547
you'll stop
once Gu's son is taken care of.

105
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,425
Gi-seok would want that too.

106
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,510
Who the hell do you think you are?

107
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,930
Let me call you back.

108
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,645
Who do you think you are,
going on about having me taken care of?

109
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,272
GI-JUN

110
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,484
Was that Nam Gi-jun on the phone?
Tell him to come.

111
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,737
The guy he's looking for is right here.

112
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,491
So, you're Gu Bong-san's son.

113
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,871
I don't care for your tone.

114
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:20,500
They say you're just like your old man
when he was young,

115
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,085
but I don't see it.

116
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,380
Look, plenty of people
want you dead besides me,

117
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,342
so do yourself a favor and walk away.

118
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,969
Why not live a little longer?

119
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,100
Did I ever…

120
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,646
ask you to spare my life?

121
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,656
Why the hell does everyone

122
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,659
talk so damn much?

123
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,202
Mr. Gu!

124
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,703
Sir!

125
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,997
Sir! Please stop!

126
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,332
What the hell?

127
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,000
Stop! Mr. Gu.

128
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,669
Just stop it!

129
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,052
Sir, I'm sorry,

130
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,721
but you've got to stop, okay?

131
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,519
Hey, Byeong-ho.

132
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,524
You're early for once.

133
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,694
That's not like you, Mr. Kim.
You're always late.

134
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,987
Hey!

135
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,952
Let me ask you something.

136
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,789
Did you rush over
because you were worried about me?

137
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,044
Or were you worried
about this asshole or Nam Gi-jun?

138
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,425
Say it.

139
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,302
You motherfucker!

140
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,095
- You bastard!
- Let go.

141
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,556
I told you to stop!

142
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,850
You should've stayed out of it,
you bastard!

143
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,184
- Let go!
- You want to know?

144
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,145
Fine. I'll tell you, asshole.

145
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,565
It's because you're fucking useless
and you screw everything up!

146
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,861
Gi-seok and Byeong-ho…
You killed them, you fucking asshole.

147
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,446
Let go.

148
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,784
You fucking loser.

149
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,046
Finally being honest, are you?

150
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,217
Fucking bastard.

151
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,935
Stop!

152
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,521
Like they say,

153
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,983
once a traitor, always a traitor.

154
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,443
Hey!

155
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,572
But you're wrong about something.

156
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,407
This guy?

157
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,495
He's dead because of you.

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,207
You asshole. It's all on you.

159
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,754
Because you couldn't
get rid of Nam Gi-jun. Get it?

160
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,714
Do you get it or not?

161
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,341
You bastard!

162
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,930
For fuck's sake, that's enough.

163
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,686
"Enough"?

164
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,111
If you're going to do it, do it properly.

165
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,325
Hey, let's go.

166
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,035
Come on, let's go.

167
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,039
GI-JUN

168
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,794
<i>Byeong-ho, I get what you're saying…</i>

169
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,045
Hi, Mr. Nam Gi-jun.

170
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,214
<i>About your friends…</i>

171
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,592
<i>They're all dead because of you.</i>

172
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,055
<i>I mean, if you were going to do it,</i>
<i>you should've done it right.</i>

173
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,726
<i>I'll send the address. Get here now.</i>

174
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,812
You can run, can't you?

175
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,644
Sim Seong-won, it's me.

176
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,453
Who the hell are you? I'm a cop!

177
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,662
Yeah, I know.

178
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,873
You're a cop.

179
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,791
Chairman Gu.

180
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,002
You've been here before, right?

181
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,007
Because of you, I had to come back here
after all these years.

182
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,972
If you don't want to end up
like the others who died here,

183
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,849
start talking.

184
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,017
Sir.

185
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,812
Why are you doing this?

186
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,151
I read Nam Gi-seok's report.
It was pretty interesting.

187
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,989
You were the first one
at the scene, weren't you?

188
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,577
I doubt that an old-timer like you
was on night patrol.

189
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,665
And nobody had reported it either.

190
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,963
You knew, didn't you?

191
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,632
That Nam Gi-seok was going to die.

192
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,681
Fucking hell.

193
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,561
- Get the guys here.
- I'm on it.

194
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,814
Yeah, this is the perfect spot.

195
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,192
Nobody's going to know
if someone dies here.

196
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,618
Why the hell is he dragging us
all the fucking way out here?

197
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,624
I think we're here. Get ready.

198
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,587
What's your problem?

199
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,255
Hey! The door's locked.

200
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,882
Just get down here.

201
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,303
What's this now?

202
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,805
Look at that mug. It's terrifying.

203
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,473
- What?
- Who are you?

204
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,475
- You're going to stab me?
- This is fun.

205
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,394
Get everyone out.

206
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,150
- What's going on?
- What the fuck?

207
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,067
What's going on?

208
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,655
Damn.

209
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,159
It looks like money talks.
All the big shots are here.

210
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,368
What the fuck?

211
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,912
It's an honor.

212
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,204
What's he saying?

213
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,291
As some of you may already know,

214
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,669
I'll be taking over the company
from my father.

215
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,715
And when that happens,
I plan to replace the entire staff

216
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,425
with new people.

217
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,303
My people, that is.

218
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,725
As for the security company,
I can help expand your business.

219
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,438
So anyway,

220
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,524
this is like a tryout.

221
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,402
A tryout for deciding Bongsan's future.

222
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,696
It's a simple task.

223
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,616
Someone's going to show up here soon.
I want you…

224
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,161
to bring him to me.

225
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,587
- What's that?
- What the fuck?

226
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,214
Go check it out.

227
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,094
What is it?

228
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,680
It's cash.

229
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,891
- Is that money?
- Hey!

230
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,102
- Stacks of cash?
- Damn, that's a lot.

231
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,145
I'll do it!

232
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,691
Yeah, that's right.

233
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,067
He's going to tell us.

234
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,987
Whoever brings him to me gets that bag.

235
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,532
You can do whatever you want with him.

236
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,909
Just don't kill him.

237
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,162
That part's mine.

238
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,913
What, are you kidding me?

239
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,583
You're betting that kind of money on him?

240
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,752
Hey, don't be so serious.

241
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,839
Just have fun. This is a game.

242
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,816
Hey, kid. Are you here alone?

243
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,318
What the fuck?

244
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,911
If you think you'll regret this…

245
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,997
walk away now.

246
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,167
Seriously? What's he saying?

247
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,002
- Out of the way.
- He's got some balls.

248
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,524
- Don't push me!
- Out of the way! Move!

249
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,235
You bastard!

250
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,866
What are you waiting for?

251
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,494
Son of a bitch!

252
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:50,963
Shit!

253
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,175
Stay back, you bastard!

254
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,427
Hey, asshole!

255
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,694
Come at me, you motherfucker!

256
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,706
Damn it.

257
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,668
Security team.

258
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,462
- Sir.
- <i>Don't bring him. Just kill him.</i>

259
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,881
<i>Just go kill him!</i>

260
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,924
Let's go. Move!

261
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,932
Son of a bitch!

262
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,988
Hey!

263
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,711
Get him!

264
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,341
Fuck, stay back!

265
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,952
Hey.

266
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,372
What, are you scared?

267
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,291
You can kill him, right?

268
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,502
Come on, you know I can.

269
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,212
Huh?

270
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,760
But I think we need to talk numbers again.

271
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,805
- Double it.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

272
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,392
Kidding?

273
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,188
Do I look like I'm kidding?

274
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,530
I recorded…

275
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,243
the whole call on my phone.

276
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,953
Go ahead and listen.

277
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,180
<i>The kids who killed Nam Gi-seok</i>
<i>will turn themselves in.</i>

278
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,225
<i>Just make sure</i>
<i>there's no trace of anyone else.</i>

279
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,436
<i>"Anyone else"?</i>

280
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,944
Hey, get that bastard.

281
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,126
Fuck!

282
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,256
Fucking bastard!

283
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:48,927
Fuck.

284
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:51,721
Hey.

285
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,599
Double it. Two billion.

286
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,911
If you're having second thoughts,
you can go too.

287
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,788
Hey.

288
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,056
What now? Having second thoughts?

289
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,351
You little…

290
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,112
Piece of shit.

291
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,377
Come on, Mr. Nam Gi-jun.

292
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,088
I'm waiting up here.

293
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,475
Damn you.

294
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,743
Damn it.

295
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,661
Shit.

296
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,038
Hey. I'm going to really kill him.

297
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,206
Do it.

298
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,123
This…

299
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:43,792
Fucking bastard.

300
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,322
Hey, Nam Gi-jun.

301
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,117
Your brother, Nam Gi-seok?

302
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,494
Yeah, I killed him.

303
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,997
Pathetic loser.

304
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,514
Fuck! My eye!

305
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,182
Shit!

306
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,940
You fucking coward.

307
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:57,949
Hey.

308
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,951
Hey!

309
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,537
Fuck!

310
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,882
Where the hell are you? Fuck!

311
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,598
Stay away from me.

312
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,875
Come on, you son of a bitch!

313
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,829
Mr. Nam Gi-jun.

314
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,624
Let's just stop here.

315
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,127
Just stop, okay?

316
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,713
Don't kill me, please.

317
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,512
Damn it!

318
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,975
Shit.

319
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,231
Hey.

320
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,612
What difference does this make?

321
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,532
Your brother's not coming back!

322
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,499
Pick up.

323
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,254
<i>The person you're trying to reach</i>
<i>is unavailable…</i>

324
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,473
Hey, Jun-mo. Are you all right?

325
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,141
Is everything okay?

326
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,311
<i>Say something.</i>

327
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,771
It's me.

328
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,607
Why is Jun-mo's…

329
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,319
Gi-jun, just hear me out first.

330
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,905
<i>It wasn't Jun-mo who did it.</i>

331
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,990
Gu Jun-mo

332
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,159
has been dealt with as the rule states.

333
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,288
What…

334
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,875
What are you saying?

335
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,295
<i>Your son</i>

336
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,964

337
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,842
No.

338
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,802
Put Jun-mo on.

339
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,345
<i>Now!</i>

340
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,180
Deal with it.

341
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,645
<i>Listen to me, Nam Gi-jun.</i>

342
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,982
<i>Damn it! You son of a bitch!</i>

343
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,511
Jun-mo…

344
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,264
Jun-mo…

345
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,438
No, it can't be.

346
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,192
My son can't be dead.

347
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,111
No.

348
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,447
No.

349
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,959
<i>I've always wondered.</i>

350
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,422
When you went to Chairman Oh
instead of me,

351
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,716
I wondered how you must've felt.

352
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,762
But now…

353
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,140
I don't need to ask.

354
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,520
And this jacket.

355
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,023
I'll give it back next time.

356
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,527
<i>We'll meet again.</i>

357
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,364
Nam Gi-jun…

358
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,118
