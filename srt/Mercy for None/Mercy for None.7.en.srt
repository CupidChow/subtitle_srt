1
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,232
We're ready for the funeral.

2
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,708
Now…

3
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,045
let's send my father off.

4
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:22,624
LEE JU-WOON (MICHAEL)

5
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,601
Hey, boss.

6
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,604
If you're running off to Russia,

7
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:49,067
shouldn't you change your name
from Danny to Alexander or Sergei?

8
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,196
You little shit. Do you think
I'm fucking running away?

9
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm setting up a trap, dumbass!

10
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,534
I have it all planned out.

11
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,702
Those fucking bastards.

12
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,705
Just wait and see who survives in the end.

13
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,334
It's been 20 minutes.
Where the hell is that damn captain?

14
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,419
This isn't the fucking time to be late.

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,755
- Hey, go check.
- Got it.

16
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,968
Get out of the car now, you bastard!

17
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:15,885
Right.

18
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,684
Hey.

19
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,436
- Where's the captain of the King Star?
- I don't know.

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,856
The King Star. Where's the captain?

21
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,858
I don't know.

22
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,700
I'll go call him.

23
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,285
I'll call the captain.

24
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,988
<i>Hey!</i>

25
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,239
Everyone, get over here.

26
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,491
We've got some new faces.
Let's get a picture.

27
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,743
Yeah, gather around.

28
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,952
It's been a while.

29
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,996
You brats, you know what the elders say?

30
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,999
In the end, only pictures stay!
Get over here.

31
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,125
All right, let's do it.

32
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,835
I'm stuffed. Did I eat too much?

33
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,922
Hey, get over here, you punks!

34
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,423
Hey, newbies, come on.

35
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,217
Stand in the middle. Come on.

36
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,595
All right, guys. Smile, okay? Smile.

37
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,096
Stand over here.

38
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,556
Come on.

39
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,601
Here we go. Move in a little closer.

40
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,645
Everyone, smile. Here we go.

41
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,813
One, two, three.

42
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,421
Who the hell are you?

43
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,716
You son of a bitch. Goddamn it!

44
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,051
Who sent you, motherfucker?

45
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,386
Who was it?

46
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,596
You fucking bastard.

47
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,517
You son of a bitch.

48
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,602
Sim Seong-won will never die, you bastard!

49
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,771
Damn it. Goddamn bastards.

50
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,986
This is just fucking great. Bastards.

51
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,742
Fucking assholes. Where's my money?

52
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,038
My money. These bastards.
I'm not going to die, you bastards.

53
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,129
You son of a bitch.

54
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,135
Sim Seong-won never dies, you bastard!
Go tell them, you son of a bitch!

55
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,270
Yang-sik!

56
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,647
Yang-sik!

57
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,149
Boss, I'm right here!

58
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,777
You're bleeding!

59
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,320
Where the fuck have you been?

60
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,530
I just got stabbed four times.

61
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,616
Go get a towel or something.

62
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,121
Fuck.

63
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,795
I'll go tell them

64
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,631
this is how you died.

65
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,509
You son of a bitch.

66
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,054
Fucking asshole.

67
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,150
Fucking hell.

68
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,778
Stubborn bastard. Damn it.

69
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,254
I got rid of Sim Seong-won.

70
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,089
Good job.

71
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,055
Sim Seong-won has been taken out.

72
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,015
Good job.

73
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,312
Well, I guess we're almost done now.

74
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,399
Yes, sir, we're here.
We're heading up now.

75
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,360
Wait.

76
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,321
Where's Cha Yeong-do?

77
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,214
So,

78
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,842
have you made your decision?

79
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,808
Nam Gi-jun.

80
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,102
Bad luck for you.

81
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,605
I was planning to kill Cha Yeong-do first.

82
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,521
You're nothing special, either.

83
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,608
Just like your brother.

84
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,988
So, it was you.

85
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,032
You killed Gi-seok.

86
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,447
<i>Look.</i>

87
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,783
I will build a new plaza.

88
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,954
Unlike my father's time
when we had to stay in the shadows,

89
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,332
I will make the plaza fully legitimate

90
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,380
so that no one dares to touch us.

91
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,760
I may not be able to do that
as Lee Geum-son, son of Lee Ju-woon.

92
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,972
But I can make it happen
as Prosecutor Lee Geum-son.

93
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,081
Fuck.

94
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,864
Don't you think

95
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,700
we're meeting too often?

96
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,037
It's not like we're fucking family.

97
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,708
Let me ask you something.

98
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,837
Did you really know?

99
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,966
You said so in the interrogation room.

100
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,971
You told me you knew
who planned it all with me.

101
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,859
LEE GEUM-SON - LEE JU-WOON

102
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,070
Those idiots.
I told them to be careful. Fuck…

103
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,448
These drives,

104
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,159
do you even know what's on them?

105
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,206
It was Lee Geum-son who said it himself,

106
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,669
"Let's start a war between Juwoon
and Bongsan to take control."

107
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,381
And all the evidence proving that

108
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,758
is on there.

109
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,560
How about this?

110
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,771
You take out Lee Geum-son

111
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,233
and become the new ruler of the plaza.

112
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,905
Lee Ju-woon and Gu Bong-san did it,
so why not you, Gi-jun?

113
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,450
Come on, I'll have your back all the way.

114
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,495
You shouldn't be making offers…

115
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,541
but asking for forgiveness.

116
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,130
This bastard won't even take it
when it's handed to him.

117
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,925
What, you think you're above it all too?

118
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,321
Fuck.

119
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,541
You son of a bitch!

120
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,943
You want to live?

121
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,032
Please don't kill me…

122
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,848
Sorry for your loss.

123
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
Is that blood?

124
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,776
Who's that guy?

125
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,527
Sir.

126
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,406
Mr. Choi.

127
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,062
Oh boy.

128
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,316
Looks like Shimane failed.

129
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,820
What about Cha Yeong-do?

130
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,448
He's dead, isn't he?

131
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,121
It's not so bad, then. At least he's dead.

132
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,872
Why did you do it?

133
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,876
And what was your reason, Nam Gi-jun?

134
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,257
My father asked you to take over Juwoon.
Why did you turn him down?

135
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,097
Everyone in the plaza
would kill for that position.

136
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,017
I'm losing my mind not having it
even when it's right there.

137
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:10,065
So why the fuck do you and your brother
act like it's not worth a damn?

138
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,024
That's it?

139
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,114
That's all it was about?

140
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,330
Have some food before you go.

141
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,501
It's probably the last warm meal
you'll have on the outside.

142
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,173
It's your last one too.

143
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,134
You're the only one left now.

144
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,432
Is the burial tomorrow?

145
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,354
Stay alive until then…

146
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,483
and send him off properly.

147
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,812
JUWOON

148
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,277
I'm sorry it took me so long.

149
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,072
THE LATE NAM GI-SEOK

150
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,908
I'll see you soon.

151
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,590
Here.

152
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,842
LEE GEUM-SON

153
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,052
What's this?

154
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,223
Just hold onto it for now. I'll call you.

155
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,730
Hae-beom.

156
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,734
You should stop now.

157
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:19,987
What?

158
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,532
Chun-seok and Byeong-ho…

159
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,576
They're gone now.

160
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,623
Somebody has to stay alive

161
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,376
and see this through.

162
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,256
<i>You must've had a hard time finding this.</i>

163
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,972
You found my overseas bank account
to blackmail me.

164
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,598
Really?

165
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,107
Go get some air.

166
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,608
Yes, sir.

167
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,951
JUWOON - BONGSAN
M&A PROPOSAL

168
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,330
So you want me to stay out
of Juwoon's merger with Bongsan?

169
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,583
No one's in charge.

170
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,753
Wouldn't it be easier if we took over?

171
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,630
"We"?

172
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,798
Juwoon Group.

173
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,848
All right. Let's say I go along with it.

174
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,934
What's in it for me?

175
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,277
You'll stay in that chair a little longer.

176
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,124
That's all, right?
Just the Bongsan merger and acquisition.

177
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:57,959
Yes.

178
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,553
JW DE'CRO

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,270

00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,258
LEE GEUM-SON

184
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,186
240407_LEE GEUM-SON REC_18:48

185
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,447
<i>We'll use Gu Jun-mo</i>

186
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,159
<i>to get rid of Nam Gi-seok.</i>

187
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,755
Prosecutor General, that's Lee Geum-son.

188
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,106
Thank you all for coming.
I'm Lee Geum-son.

189
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,444
As you all know, we're here today

190
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,823
to celebrate the merger
between Juwoon and Bongsan.

191
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:57,037
As of today, I've been appointed
as the new CEO of Juwoon.

192
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:02,000
And I'm still a prosecutor at the Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

193
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,337
It's fucking freezing.

194
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:19,684
I did what you asked,
but are you sure this is okay?

195
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,065
Oh shit.

196
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,570
If anything goes wrong,
I had nothing to do with it.

197
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:34,115
I plan to create a new system.

198
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,993
But don't worry.

199
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,497
I just want to try a different approach.

200
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,337
We'll keep all the members
and make a few tweaks to the system.

201
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,256
That'll solve all the problems.

202
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,677
I'll make sure
that every illegal benefit you had

203
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,264
will no longer be considered illegal.

204
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,225
The plaza I envision

205
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,312
is a place where the boundary
between the light and shadows

206
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,481
is torn down.

207
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,652
No one will point fingers at you…

208
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:15,407
I mean, no one will point fingers at us

209
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,910
in the new plaza I build.

210
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,597
<i>Listen, Lee.</i>

211
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,976
The prosecutor general went
to great lengths to make this look good.

212
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,186
You're exaggerating.

213
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,317
So, what can we expect?

214
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,362
Let me ask you this instead.

215
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,491
What kind of positions
are you looking for?

216
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,046
Excuse me, Prosecutor General.

217
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,297
Please take a look.

218
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,425
- What have you got there?
- Check your messages, sir.

219
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,891
LEE ORDERED THE MURDER OF NAM GI-SEOK

220
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,104
What is it?

221
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,566
I enjoyed the food.

222
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,485
We should go.

223
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,326
Very impressive.

224
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,836
<i>Here's a breaking news update.</i>

225
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,589
<i>A sitting prosecutor</i>
<i>has been implicated in a murder,</i>

226
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,299
<i>sparking major controversy.</i>

227
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:00,804
<i>The prosecutor is Lee Geum-son from</i>
<i>the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.</i>

228
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,931
<i>Let's listen to the recording.</i>

229
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,767
<i>We'll use Gu Jun-mo</i>

230
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,144
<i>to get rid of Nam Gi-seok.</i>

231
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,648
<i>I'll say this again.</i>

232
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:18,697
<i>I want both Juwoon and Bongsan.</i>

233
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,245
What the fuck

234
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,330
is this?

235
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,172
<i>The prosecution has decided to immediately</i>
<i>remove Lee from his position</i>

236
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,590
<i>and has called for a swift…</i>

237
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,717
<i>You messed up big time.</i>

238
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,139
You were all talk
about a new system and shit.

239
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,725
Is this what you wanted to show us?

240
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,437
What's the big deal?

241
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,150
Do you still not get it?

242
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,235
You're done.

243
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,987
All of this is over.

244
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,782
It's not over yet.

245
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,076
Get everyone back here.

246
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,828
Goddamn idiot.

247
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,710
Just so you know…

248
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,714
if you're trying
to drag us down, forget it.

249
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,050
It's already game over. Got it?

250
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,761
Fucking bastard.

251
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,389
What a freaking nutjob.

252
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,733
Fuck you.

253
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,249
Fuck you.

254
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,045
Stop.

255
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,964
I'll take care of this.

256
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,717
You should go.

257
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,221
Why would I leave? This is my place.
Go bring everyone back.

258
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,390
- Let go, damn it!
- Knock it off, you fucking bastard!

259
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,437
All of us put our trust in you
and came this far.

260
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,316
If you screw this up, I swear…

261
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,204
You should go, sir.

262
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,834
Sir.

263
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,254
Take the stairs.

264
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,877
Stop him.

265
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,938
You want to come to me?

266
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,734
Or should I come to you?

267
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,698
Stop!

268
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,662
Let him through.

269
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,133
Get out, all of you.

270
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,909
Gi-jun.

271
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,288
Can't you please…

272
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,334
just stop here?

273
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,505
It's been a long time

274
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,091
since you called me that.

275
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,219
As a friend…

276
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,807
and for old times' sake, I'm asking you.

277
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,643
Please stop.

278
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,900
Yeah. Thought so.

279
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,490
Let's go.

280
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,201
I'll show you the way.

281
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,665
I'm just doing my job.

282
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,709
You understand?

283
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,367
It's okay.

284
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,876
Go and finish what you started.

285
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,381
Okay.

286
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,135
I'll see you soon.

287
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,043
So how does it feel sitting in that seat?

288
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,923
You've done all of this

289
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,844
just to get
to where you're sitting, right?

290
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,471
I'm not sure.

291
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,185
It's not as great as I thought it'd be.

292
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,897
I've done all kinds of shit to get here.

293
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,232
If I had known it'd be so pointless…

294
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,904
Everyone feels that way.

295
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,032
They'll do anything to get there.

296
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,368
But when they finally do,

297
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,621
only emptiness is left.

298
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,335
Because they can only go down from there.

299
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,923
For fuck's sake. That's just your opinion.

300
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,635
Me?

301
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,596
I loved the aspect of fighting.

302
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,225
I loved the tension before a fight

303
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,103
and the rush of landing a hit.

304
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,359
But the best part was
what came after I won.

305
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,946
The way my friends looked at me.

306
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,783
My father,

307
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,328
he must've gotten it all his life.

308
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,621
I envied that so much.

309
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,875
The respect. The admiration.

310
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,714
That…

311
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,510
is neither admiration nor respect.

312
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,721
It's fear.

313
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,849
And it becomes a burden.

314
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,314
The chairman…

315
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,111
probably didn't want you
to bear that burden

316
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,530
because he knew the pain.

317
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,449
Fuck, enough talk about my dead father.

318
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:11,289
Now, I'm genuinely curious
because I really don't get it.

319
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,042
Why go this far? Seriously.

320
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,005
Why are you doing this now
after all this time?

321
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,050
You gave up everything
and just fucking ran.

322
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,679
Because I'm the reason it all started.

323
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,766
I'm the reason Gi-seok…

324
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,273
That's how it works in this business.

325
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,407
Once you're in…

326
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,328
you don't get out alive.

327
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,245
Don't do it.

328
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,497
For fuck's sake!

329
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,667
I told you not to do it!

330
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,815
Go ahead, shoot.

331
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,659
My father was right.

332
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,496
He said

333
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,791
you people live with nightmares every day.

334
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,504
Fuck, I was never cut out for this.

335
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,426
Still…

336
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,391
thank you… for hearing me out.

337
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:11,909
Fuck!

338
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,244
You

339
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,622
don't get to die like that.

340
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,560
Go…

341
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,771
beg for forgiveness.

342
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,486
Don't tell me what to do,
you fucking bastard.

343
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,276
<i>I wondered who'd come</i>
<i>to a place like this.</i>

344
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,240
<i>But it's actually nice.</i>

345
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:18,827
Gi-jun.

346
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,041
Maybe I should come work here too.
Leave it all behind.

347
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,711
Sure.

348
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,881
I'd like that. Drop everything and come.

349
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,968
Let's run this campground together.

350
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,431
What's gotten into you?

351
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,812
MERCY FOR NONE
