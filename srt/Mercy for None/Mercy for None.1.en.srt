00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,514
2010, YEOUIDO, SEOUL

2
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,765
Will it take you long?

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,851
Have I ever taken long?

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,688
I talked to Ju-woon.

5
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,191
He will accept you
if things go well today.

6
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:28,778
I'll be back.

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,613
Gi-jun.

8
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,700
Are you nervous?

9
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,767
Hey, Kiyota.

10
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,061
That's enough.

11
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,692
Well done.

12
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,696
Here he comes.

13
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,030
MERCY FOR NONE

14
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,999
Let's go!

15
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,250
What the hell?

16
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,213
Fuck, you goddamn bastards!

17
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,132
Hey.

18
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,885
Do you know who you're messing with?

19
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,720
Untie me.

20
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,639
Right now!

21
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,141
CHA
MANAGER, BONGSAN GROUP

22
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,520
Call Mr. Gu! I'll talk to him myself!

23
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,566
Okay!

24
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,029
I will double the money
you're getting from Gu Jun-mo.

25
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,239
Double!

26
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,199
Don't you know what "double" means?

27
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,250
I work for Bong-san!

28
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,803
How long has it been?

29
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,432
You've only talked about meeting up.

30
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,351
CHAIRMAN GU BONG-SAN
CHAIRMAN LEE JU-WOON

31
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,894
And it's been years.

32
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,564
Let's sit.

33
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,511
Did you hear what happened to Mr. Cha?

34
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,681
It was Jun-mo.

35
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,350
My son did it.

36
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,687
I'm sure you know

37
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,232
about his reputation in the company.

38
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,488
It seems like
Cha messed with Jun-mo's business.

39
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,409
So Jun-mo brought in some outsiders
to get back at him,

40
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,620
but they took it too far.

41
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,667
Those foreigners Jun-mo brought in…

42
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,628
Please take care of them for me.

43
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,340
Why are you asking me? It's your company.

44
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,175
It's about my family, not my company.

45
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,260
He may have his flaws, but he's my son.

46
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,763
If I humiliate him myself,

47
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,390
what will people think?

48
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,852
Again, why are you asking me?
It's your family.

49
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,525
That's why I'm offering
to help you solve your land issue.

50
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,819
I will make a deal

51
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,490
that will lose me money.

52
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,919
- Hey!
- Boys, we're moving out!

53
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:18,836
Yes, sir!

54
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,469
You handle Gu Bong-san's situation.

55
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,387
JUWOON

56
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,807
Sir, this is Bongsan Group's problem.

57
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,645
You're right.

58
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,563
But Gi-seok…

59
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,609
He said he'd resolve
our Yeouido land issue.

60
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,237
So now it's our problem.

61
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,072
NAM GI-SEOK
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, JUWOON

62
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,032
Why don't you send Choi Seong-cheol?

63
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,201
Tell me.

64
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,079
Did you mean what you said?

65
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,043
I told you. After me, you're next in line.

66
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,714
Why do you suddenly want
to leave the company?

67
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,683
Gi-seok, this is for you.

68
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,185
It will be very useful

69
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,272
when you run the company.

70
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,152
I looked into what you asked for.

71
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,863
Gu Jun-mo's reputation at Bongsan
is worse than I thought.

72
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,784
It's so bad
that he had to hire people from abroad.

73
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,953
CHEON HAE-BEOM
JUWOON

74
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:34,954
Are you okay, sir?

75
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,833
Why? Does it look like I'm not?

76
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,378
No, sir.

77
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,463
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,257
Hae-beom.

79
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,390
What do you want to do
if you quit this job?

80
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,767
Excuse me?

81
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,653
I feel so much better
now that Cha is gone.

82
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,738
DE'CRO HOTEL

83
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,828
Sir, that's Nam Gi-seok…

84
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,538
It's all right.

85
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,165
Let him in.

86
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,262
You have three days.

87
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,723
Go back to your country.

88
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,854
It seems you've caused trouble there,
but it's not any safer here.

89
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,398
So just leave.

90
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,281
Mr. Nam.

91
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,659
What is Juwoon Group doing here?

92
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,703
I'm asking you. What are you doing here?

93
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,541
Chairman Gu personally asked Chairman Lee.

94
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,544
Someone so business-savvy

95
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,129
is willing to suffer a loss

96
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,841
and swallow his pride for his son.

97
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,385
GU JUN-MO
MANAGING DIRECTOR, BONGSAN

98
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,302
Sir.

99
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,681
If you can't do it right,
don't do it at all.

100
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,227
That'll be better for you, sir.

101
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,319
"If you can't do it right,
don't do it at all"?

102
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,532
Yeah, well…

103
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,328
You have the right to say that.

104
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,791
It was your brother, wasn't it?

105
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,419
So how is…

106
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,839
his leg now?

107
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,717
What is Gi-seok doing there?

108
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,176
<i>Excuse me?</i>

109
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,469
KIM CHUN-SEOK
MANAGER, BONGSAN

110
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,762
Hey, is Gi-seok

111
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,599
with Gu right now?

112
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,143
<i>Yeah, that's what he's here for.</i>

113
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,561
Shit.

114
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,315
You shouldn't have let him in, you punks!

115
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,191
Was it ten years ago?

116
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,235
Someone made a huge mess.

117
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,947
He should've done things right,
like you said.

118
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,117
But he didn't, just like me now.

119
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,539
Anyway, my father and Chairman Lee Ju-woon
managed to clean up his mess.

120
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:29,003
But they let the guy live.
They just cut his Achilles tendon instead.

121
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,511
And his brother
is still living off Juwoon.

122
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,765
Man, this is uncomfortable.

123
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,320
Mr. Nam.

124
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,573
Whether I do things right or not…

125
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,286
what's the problem?

126
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,246
What the…

127
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,089
You.

128
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,591
You're the problem.

129
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,224
Hey.

130
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,685
Nam Gi-seok!

131
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,772
You just crossed the line!

132
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,566
It's cold.

133
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,119
It fits well.

134
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,460
Aren't you going to ask?

135
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,297
What?

136
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,260
"How have you been?"

137
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,721
"Are you seeing anyone?"
You know, the usual stuff.

138
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,974
We haven't seen each other in six years.

139
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,353
The chairman wants me…

140
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,357
to take over Juwoon after him.

141
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,652
Isn't that a good thing for you?

142
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,743
I'm not sure
if that's really a good thing.

143
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,623
Maybe I should come work here too.

144
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,883
I should get going.

145
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,862
Is everything okay?

146
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,490
I thought you'd never ask.

147
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:05,386
JUWOON GROUP
JW GALLERY

148
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,609
Come out here.

149
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,081
Why do you keep coming back?

150
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,253
Of course, you've got nowhere to go.

151
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,723
Who sent you?

152
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,601
Fuck you, you bastard!

153
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,022
Motherfucker.

154
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,447
Did Gu Jun-mo send you?

155
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,743
Or was it Chairman Gu?

156
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,832
Then again, I guess you wouldn't know.

157
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,543
Just leave.

158
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,964
Hey!

159
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,418
You bastard!

160
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,004
What are you waiting for? Jump that guy!

161
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,839
Okay. Fuck, go get him!

162
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,934
You bastard!

163
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,215
Asshole.

164
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,716
Yes.

165
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,929
JUWOON

166
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,002
Such a tragedy.

167
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,088
I still have…

168
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,968
so much to learn from him.

169
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,183
I'm sorry for your loss.

170
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,829
Treat the directors with the utmost care.

171
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,754
Do you know anything?

172
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,299
Sorry?

173
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,760
About what?

174
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,762
About Mr. Nam.

175
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,514
CHOI SEONG-CHEOL
MANAGER, JUWOON

176
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,682
Wasn't it you guys?

177
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,646
How could you even say that?

178
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,523
Mr. Choi.

179
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,900
Gi-seok was my friend.

180
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,737
He was my friend before anything else.
That includes Juwoon.

181
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,406
That's right, your friend.

182
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,410
You've got a history
of backstabbing your friends.

183
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,829
You were originally on our side.

184
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,456
Do the new kids know that?

185
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,624
Damn it, the cops…

186
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,502
They said some kids did it.

187
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,716
Don't make a movie out of this.

188
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,055
So you really are hiding something.

189
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,812
You shouldn't be

190
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,398
doing this with me right now.

191
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,070
Mr. Lee.

192
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,579
You left work earlier than usual today.

193
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,789
Where's Mr. Nam's memorial room?

194
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,377
You must be tired.
Why don't you go home and get some rest?

195
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,421
Drive him home.

196
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,966
LEE JU-WOON'S ELDEST SON
LEE GEUM-SON

197
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,177
Is attending a funeral considered work?

198
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,890
The chairman is inside.

199
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,725
So what?

200
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,859
You know what the chairman wants.

201
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,571
He doesn't want you
involved in company matters.

202
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,492
For you, it's just a quick visit,

203
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,746
but for my boys,
it doesn't end so quickly.

204
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,626
I'll talk to my father.
So please show me the way.

205
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,128
Seong-cheol.

206
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,937
This is Mr. Nam's brother.

207
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,772
Pay your respects.

208
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,408
Where is he?

209
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,285
Gi-seok.

210
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,290
Who did this?

211
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,840
Like I said, he got mixed up
with some runaway kids--

212
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,091
Seong-cheol.

213
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,721
That's it? Really?

214
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,486
So, what's your plan?

215
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,531
Nam Gi-seok is gone now.

216
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,742
Find someone else to be your successor.

217
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,999
Stop being so stubborn
and give Geum-son a chance.

218
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,377
This might be a good chance
to back your son.

219
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,088
What's so good about it?

220
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,216
Do you think
what happened to Gi-seok is a good thing?

221
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,219
Come on now.

222
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,430
That's not what I meant.

223
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,974
Gi-seok didn't deserve to die like that.

224
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,983
JUWOON

225
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,026
Gi-jun.

226
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,243
What are you doing here?

227
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,163
You told me to live like I didn't exist.

228
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,541
But today I can't do that.

229
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,211
I'm sorry.

230
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,798
All right. I understand,
considering the circumstances.

231
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,843
Of course, you should be
at your brother's funeral.

232
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,056
Do you remember the promise
we made 11 years ago?

233
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,016
Of course I remember.

234
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,936
You gave your word
that you'd stay out of our sight.

235
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,687
Not that one.

236
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,566
There was one more.

237
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,446
I promised
I wouldn't let anything happen to Gi-seok.

238
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,406
I kept my word,

239
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,410
but the two of you didn't keep yours.

240
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,502
- Gi-jun.
- Gi-seok's death…

241
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,048
Is there anything else I should know?

242
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,716
What?

243
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,512
There isn't, is there?

244
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,851
I'll take that as a no.

245
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,068
Gi-jun.

246
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,788
Sir. Gi-jun!

247
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,208
Are you leaving already?

248
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,925
Allow me to introduce myself.

249
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,262
I'm Cheon Hae-beom.
I worked under Gi-seok.

250
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,735
I'll make sure…

251
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,196
Gi-seok is honored properly.

252
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:48,208
CAMPING BUSINESS

253
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,711
GOING CAMPING

254
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,577
TO. NAM GI-JUN

255
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,787
CHEONGSIN CAMPING PARK

256
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,717
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GI-JUN
FROM GI-SEOK

257
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,506
I'm sorry.

258
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,762
The victim's family can't see him
because he is a suspect in a major crime.

259
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,097
I just need a moment.

260
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,267
That's the policy.

261
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,102
I'm really sorry.

262
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,606
You heard him.

263
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,443
I get why you're here,
but we're still investigating.

264
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,112
He's a suspect until proven guilty.

265
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,449
I get it. Just let me see him.

266
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,202
What difference would that make?

267
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,247
Anyway, it's against the rules.
And it's not like you're his family.

268
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,124
You're the victim's family.

269
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,335
Once the trial begins,

270
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,296
you'll have to see him
whether you want to or not.

271
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,881
Life must be easier

272
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,175
now that you're just a cop.

273
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,177
What?

274
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,812
Since when did you…

275
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,940
play by the rules?

276
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,569
Get in here.

277
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,619
What the hell?

278
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,414
What were you doing there?

279
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,084
Do you know me?

280
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,671
You didn't just go there for a smoke.

281
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,506
Why did you go there?

282
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,261
You think you can just come in here
and run your damn mouth?

283
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,555
Who the hell are you?

284
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,854
Who sent you to go after my brother?

285
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,819
You're his family.

286
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,364
I'm sorry.

287
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,867
I'm sorry!

288
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,261
Is that what you wanted?
You fucking asshole.

289
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,098
You want to know why I killed him?

290
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,058
Why do you think?

291
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,395
He gave me the same fucking look
you're giving me right now.

292
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,235
I'll find your buddies first,

293
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,823
every single one
who was with you that day.

294
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,409
After them…

295
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,496
I'll find your family.

296
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,541
Hold on.

297
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,837
Do me a favor.

298
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,178
When you see my fucking parents,

299
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,431
beat the shit out of them for me.

300
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,224
No, actually…

301
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,061
just kill them.

302
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,023
They ran out on me and my brother
when we were kids.

303
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,069
So make sure you find them and kill them.

304
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,529
I see.

305
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,240
You have a little brother.

306
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,131
<i>Bus number 476 will be arriving shortly.</i>

307
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:56,933
<i>Keep going!</i>

308
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,019
To the right.

309
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,605
- Shit.
- Sang-yeon.

310
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,485
First time here?
Grab a seat anywhere you want.

311
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,030
Hey, to the right.

312
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,657
- Go in.
- I'm coming, Min-su.

313
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,574
Go!

314
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,742
Damn it.

315
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,964
I told you, dickhead.

316
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,217
Time to go, guys.

317
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,386
- Hey, what did I tell you?
- Get out.

318
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,721
You've got good instincts.

319
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,431
I told you he'd show up.

320
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,016
Get out of here, assholes!

321
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,809
- Nice, Hui-cheol!
- All of you, out!

322
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,602
Your acting was so damn good!

323
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,937
Hey, lock the door.

324
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,607
- Can I go now?
- Are you scared?

325
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,193
Hey, watch and learn, kid.

326
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,528
Don't touch me.

327
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,447
- Hey.
- How freaking cute, man.

328
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,323
Hey, old man.

329
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,035
You went to see Hui-chan
and got all worked up, didn't you?

330
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,747
Come on, give us the same shit too.

331
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,956
Yeah, go ahead.

332
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,875
Do it, you bastard.

333
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,917
Is this everyone?

334
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,754
You didn't bring me here.

335
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,840
I brought you here.

336
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,218
- Fucking hell.
- So scary.

337
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,014
Talk.

338
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,350
Who put you up to it?

339
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,977
Nobody put us up to anything.

340
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,270
He's acting all tough.

341
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,646
We killed him.

342
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,276
What? You want us to kill you too?

343
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,737
Just say the word.

344
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,364
Go ahead. Say it.

345
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,159
Fuck!

346
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,633
Goddamn it!

347
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,093
What are you waiting for? Go!

348
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,349
You bastard!

349
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,352
Fucking asshole!

350
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,778
I'm sorry.

351
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,032
Hey, you go!

352
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,075
Go!

353
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,993
Go! Damn it!

354
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,955
What do we do?

355
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:26,958
Open the door.

356
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,543
Fuck, hurry up!

357
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,341
We really don't know who it was.

358
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,176
Right?

359
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,469
You wanted to do it!

360
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,930
- Fuck, that's right!
- No, it was Hui-chan!

361
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,892
Sir, it wasn't me. I swear.

362
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,061
Please, you have to believe me.

363
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,788
Sir.

364
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,832
Please…

365
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,086
