could you be quiet in the evening?

68
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,040
Are you the one who put
the note on my door?

69
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,220

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,629
She complained about the noise,
and disappeared a few days ago?

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,720
Well, I haven’t seen her in a while…

75
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,060
The man downstairs looked
about to kill me over the noise.

76

You really don’t know anything?

77
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,270
Your sister was adamant about…

78
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,769
finding the source of the noise,

79
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,150
and ran around the apartment.

80
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,699
I understood her pain, but
it’s impossible to locate.

81
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,199
Anyone can say it wasn’t them.

82
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,159
Because it’s happening in unit 604,
everyone’s being extra cautious.

83
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,790
604? What’s wrong with my home?

84
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
A few months ago…

85
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,300
Sir, could you tell me
about the basement?

86
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,940
- Oh my…
- Gosh.

87
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,570
This…

88
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,030
I always wondered
where the stench came from.

89
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,990
What are all these?

90
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,120
Unauthorized garbage
accumulated for the past 10 years.

91
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,549
I locked the door so that
no one could do it anymore,

92
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,759
but they’d do it through the
window, they got no conscience.

93
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,800
So, you didn’t do anything?

94
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,430
No one here has a nose?

95
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,929
Why didn’t you file a report
at the district office?!

96
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,849
You think we want to
let these sit here?

97
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,769
Gosh, chairwoman.

98
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,279
They refuse to clean up private
property with taxpayer money,

99
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,069
and the cleanup is estimated to
cost tens of thousands of dollars!

100
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,620
So, do we just live on
top of this trash pile?

101
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,950
You have no right to complain.

102
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,749
Who do you think did that?

103
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,960
Would homeowners do this?

104
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,000
It was renters like you!

105
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,879
Because it’s not your home.

106
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,339
Excuse me.

107
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,089
I moved here only a week ago,

108
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,100
why shouldn’t I complain?

109
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,769
And did you confirm
that renters did this

110
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,139
by catching them in the act?

111
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,390
Isn’t it obvious?

112
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,230
Jesus Christ…

113
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,359
Rather than owning a home
in this rundown shithole,

114
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,650
better off renting.

115
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,150

Why are you banging on that damn door?

178
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,269
If knocking on this door is that noisy,

179
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,060
isn’t it your ears that have a problem?

180
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,689
Whether I knock on the door
or ring the bell, why do you care?

181
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,399
Can you shut your ears?
It’s wide open like this! Look!

182
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,570
You’re about ready to swing.

183
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,449
You were home?

184
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,870
You were, were you?

185
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,869
What’s going on?

186
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,910
He’s been knocking around,
and causing ruckus here.

187
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,580
Where the hell have you been?

188
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,459
Are you deaf or something?

189
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,960
Just shut the hell up!

190
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,220
I’m really sorry.

191
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,220
No, not at all.

192
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:53,650
As her sister, I didn’t
know she had a boyfriend.

193
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,150
We haven’t dated long,
please don’t feel bad,

194
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,659
but it has been tough recently.

195
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,540
She stopped answering my calls,
I thought she was ghosting me.

196
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,209
But she didn’t answer company calls,
and with you visiting the office,

197
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,710
I wasn’t sure what’s happening with…

198
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,100
<i>Ju-hee’s last caller</i>

199
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,140
Hello?

200
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,560
<i>Why are you so curious
that you asked for a callback?</i>

201
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,690
I’m sorry, but who is this?

202
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,909
She called out of the blue,

203
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,869
and asked about her unit.

204
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,239
What did she ask?

205
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,660
She asked if…

206
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,130
The thing is…

207
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,930
She asked if a person died there.

208
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,059
I’m not sure if she
can feel the spirits,

209
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,190
or if there really is a ghost.

210
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,069
She’ll eventually
find out, so I told her.

211
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,439
- A few months ago…
- In my home?

212
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:25,030
A lady who lived in unit 604
had an unfortunate incident.

213
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,739
She would always complain
that she heard noises.

214
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,119
Then she said she saw
a ghost in the building.

215
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,540
I don’t think she was sane.

216
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,420
Then one day, we didn’t
hear anything from her.

217
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,720
I thought I could
finally get some peace,

218
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,679
but we smelled a bad
stench, it was rotting stench.

219
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
No way…

220
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,429
She…

221
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,060
hung herself.

222
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,560
Where in my home?

223
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,680
Gosh…

224
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,069
<i>I’ll kill you. Stop moaning,
I can hear you piss…</i>

225
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,159
It has to be the man from unit 504.

226
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,409
I told him it wasn’t my home.

227
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,580
He seems a bit off,
should I talk to him?

228
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,960
No, please don’t.

229
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,890
<i>Looking for My Sister</i>

230
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,490
May I use the washroom…

231
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,530
Ki-hoon!

232
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,200
Please walk softly.

233
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,370
Right, I’m sorry.

234
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,460
Yes, I unlocked her phone.

235
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,180
There isn’t anything special.

236
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,219
Must a person die
before you investigate?

237
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,180
<i>You know that’s not what I’m saying.</i>

238
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,099
The man in unit 504 is suspicious.

239
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,899
He’s been posting threatening notes on
my door, knowing that I’m her sister.

240
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,280
He said he’d rip my mouth out.

241
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,949
<i>Did you see him posting them yourself?</i>

242
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,990
<i>We questioned them and
checked the security cams.</i>

243
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,530
Security cams?

244
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,409
Then did you see her leave?

245
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,709
<i>It’s an old apartment, so,
there’s only one at the entrance.</i>

246
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,799
<i>She wasn’t in it, or on
the roadside cams nearby,</i>

247
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,549
<i>she wasn’t captured on the
day of her disappearance.</i>

248
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,839
<i>She left her wallet and cell phone too.</i>

249
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,920
<i>There aren’t any traces of
her leaving the apartment.</i>

250
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,810
She could have used another exit!

251
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,059
All the more reasons
to look into unit 504!

252
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,310
<i>Shall I?</i>

253
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,689
<i>“Did you write threatening
notes?” Should I ask him that?</i>

254
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,359
That’s not what I meant!

255
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,439
<i>I understand what you’re going through.</i>

256
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,700
<i>But you can’t demand
things beyond logic.</i>

257
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,250
<i>Looking for My Sister</i>

258
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,339
Thank you for today.

259
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,750
Not at all.

260
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,980
He’s the unit 504 tenant.

261
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,650
I’ll talk to him.

262
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,910
What is it this late?
You’re being rude.

263
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,300
Two people.

264
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,550
I’ll say this for the final time,

265
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,730
please be quiet at
night, I’m begging you.

266
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,210
So? How was he?

267
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,290
Weird, right?

268
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,840
Don’t ever open the door next time.

269
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,140
I think he was hiding
something in his hand.

270
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,849
What are you doing?

271
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,480
Is something there?

272
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,980
Kiddo, are you okay?

273
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,180
What are you doing there?

274
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,560
I’m sorry, I didn’t
mean to startle you.

275
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,789
If any of my family
disappeared, I’d post flyers too,

276
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,209
but the resident association’s
chairwoman will not stay put.

277
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,670
There’s a rally for reconstruction
resolution in 2 days.

278
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,170
What’s that got to do
with finding my sister?

279
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,760
Well…

280
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,640
Ms. Seo,

281
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,140
would you live in a place where
people died or went missing?

282
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,319
It’d be tough to get approval
for reconstruction with rumors.

283
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,949
Even if new apartments are built,

284
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,239
it’ll be a failure if no
one pre-buys them.

285
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,870
It’s no wonder she’ll
stop you at all costs.

286
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,830
When your sister caused a scene
looking for the source of noise,

287
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,960
they got into fights.

288
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,389
Be careful.

289
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,930
If the reconstruction
proposal is rejected,

290
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,640
someone could end up dead.

291
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,630
Ju-young…

292
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,010
I finally see you back home.

293
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,890
Ju-hee…

294
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,229
Are you okay? What happened?

295
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,649
Stop it, you’re not even
remotely interested in me.

296
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,570
You’re wondering why the
girl you hate came back, right?

297
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,420
I actually really missed you,

298
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,090
and I was so scared.

299
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,200
Ju-hee.

300
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,889
Ju-hee!

301
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,759
Wait, no!

302
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,310
Ju-hee!

303
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,270
No… Please…

Be quiet… please.

311
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,549
Please be quiet, I
asked you many times.

Please be quiet, okay?!

313
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,240
Sons of bitches…

314
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,290
Why’re you doing this to me?!

315
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,800
Who’s there?

316
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,680
Who is it?!

317
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,270
I can’t live like this.

318
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,070
Why would a resident from
the 5th floor jump out of 7th?

319
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,700
You can’t go in there.

320
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,790
Ms. Seo?

321
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,920
Are you okay?

322
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:50,549
Detective, that’s him. Unit 504.

323
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,180
He’s the one who threatened me.

324
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,720
Ju-hee could be in his
home, we must look for her!

325
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,639
Are you inside the unit 504?

326
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,600
Find anyone inside?

327
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,979
<i>No one, sir.</i>

328
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,150
Copy.

329
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,739
It could be a simple accident.

330
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,859
We can’t make any
conclusions right now, so…

331
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,239
Does that look like an accident?

332
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,950
I understand you’re having a hard time,

333
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,289
but you can’t make false
accusations based on suspicion,

334
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,829
that’s not how this works.

335
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:25,960
I heard her calling for me
through the sewage pipe!

336
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,710
Look at her talking crazy.

337
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,760
What did you say?

338
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,719
Hearing voices through pipes?
That doesn’t sound crazy to you?

339
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,810
Kidnapping?

340
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,059
604, are you desperate
to screw everyone over?

341
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,109
Why are you so hell-bent
on getting in everyone’s way?

342
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:55,150
You’re the one who
shouldn’t get in my way.

343
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,409
It’s not like you’ll help.

344
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,829
- Look at this girl talk back!
- She must be crazy.

345
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,289
Maybe unit 604 is really cursed.

346
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:05,459
Everyone who lived there are all weird.

347
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,619
I know!

348
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,090
The man from before, and
the crazy bitch upstairs…

349
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,170
This girl and her sister…

350
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,720
The man and the crazy bitch?

351
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,050
Who are you talking about?!

352
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,350
Did something else happen in my unit?

353
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,400
If you stir up trouble
again, I won’t let it slide.

354
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,400
Got that?

355
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,369
Who is it?

356
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:46,870
I’m from unit 604, could I
speak to you for a moment?

357
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,180
Make yourself at home.

358
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,810
Thank you.

359
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,290
It’s my daughter.

360
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,209
Sorry for poking around.

361
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,130
She’s adorable.

362
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,509
What did you want to talk about?

363
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:46,639
The chairwoman…

364
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,310
Shh, she lives next door.

365
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,400
You have to be careful,
everyone can hear each other.

366
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,450
She mentioned 'a man in unit 604
and a crazy bitch'.

367
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:10,080
I guess they’re previous tenants,
do you know who they are?

368
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,470
<i>Resident Association
2022 General Assembly</i>

369
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,849
The former chairwoman.

370
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:30,390
She lived in unit 704 a year ago.

371
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,059
How many times do I have to tell you?!

372
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,190
Didn’t I tell you to be careful?!

373
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,899
If you continue to be noisy,

374
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,110
I’ll make sure that you won’t
be able to renew your lease!

375
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,359
I’m sorry…

376
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:48,039
<i>She was so sensitive to noise,
and came up frequently</i>

377
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,830
<i>to complain about my child’s footsteps.</i>

378
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,470
Shut the hell up!

379
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,890
You’re driving me crazy!

380
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,989
It’s not my fault, I was quiet.

381
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,240
I’ll shut you up…

382
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,880
It’s noisy for you too, right?

383
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,590
I told you I won’t stay put…

384
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:46,340
Shut up!

385
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,310
Who the hell are you?!

386
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:53,979
Too loud!

387
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,599
Keep quiet, I said!

388
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,149
<i>He lived below her unit,</i>

389
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,650
<i>and suffered from the noise,</i>

390
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,240
<i>and killed her for it.</i>

391
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,719
- Please be quiet!
- Goddammit!

392
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,639
<i>She tapped the wall and
floor until she died for help,</i>

393
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,859
<i>but residents ignored it,
thinking it was just a noise.</i>

394
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,489
<i>All the residents agreed
to keep silent about it,</i>

395
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:47,240
<i>fearing it would affect the
reconstruction approval.</i>

396
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,620
What happened to him?

397
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,240
He disappeared.

398
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,120
No one could find him afterward.

399
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,290
So, he’s still not caught?

400
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,010
Ju-young, that unit 504 man,

401
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,390
why do you think he died?

402
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,849
Someone said they saw the
killer around the apartment,

403
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:21,480
while others said he could’ve
been killed by another tenant.

404
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,570
This place is like a
spider web of grudges.

405
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:32,029
So, who lives above me in unit 704?

406
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,120
It’s noisy every night
with strange noises.

407
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:39,620
Unit 704 is vacant right now.

408
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,710
Vacant?

409
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,800
<i>Ki-hoon,</i>

410
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,890
<i>I heard there was a murder in
unit 704, could you look into it?</i>

411
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,970
<i>Seo Ju-young</i>

412
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:58,120
Residents of Samil Apartments,
it’s truly unfortunate!

413
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,329
With poor materials,
creaking facilities,

414
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:08,500
we’re slowly withering away
enduring daily noise between floors.

415
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,880
We’ve done nothing wrong!

416
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,599
Due to this aging and
ailing apartment facility,

417
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:21,430
Mr. Park Geun-bae from unit 504
in Building 5 has passed away.

418
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:29,650
This isn’t an accident, it’s murder
by the city, ignoring reconstruction!

419
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:37,740
Everything happening right now
is so tragic and heartbreaking.

420
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,790
Especially at times like this,
we need to unite even more!

421
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,330
Unite with one goal!

422
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,719
What is she doing?!

423
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,800
What’s wrong with her?!

424
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:00,390
You’re not feeling anything
about my missing sister?

425
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,770
You all know she disappeared!

426
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,229
Are you out of your mind?
This is an important rally!

427
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:10,230
Wanna see what crazy looks like?

428
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:15,319
Screw your reconstruction,
should I let the world know

429
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,989
how people have been dying?

430
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,320
Did you really go mad?!

431
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,829
You’ve gone crazy
over the reconstruction,

432
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:24,830
you don’t even care if
people die or disappear!

433
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,340
My sister!

434
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,170
I’m sure that killer took her!

435
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,509
She is somewhere inside this apartment!

436
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:40,509
I heard her voice!

437
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,680
Ju-young!

438
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,969
- Please calm down!
- Let go of me!

439
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,180
What’s with you?

440
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,769
Please calm down!

441
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,150
No! Let go!

442
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,900
Calm down, Ju-young!

443
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,070
One moment, please.

444
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,530
Let’s go, Ju-young.

445
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:18,719
The killer that you
mentioned yesterday,

446
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,050
he could still be inside the apartment.

447
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,890
I looked into the unit 704 murder,

448
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:31,189
they issued a search warrant
but still couldn’t find him.

449
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:34,859
The security cams were installed
in front of the elevator and entrance.

450
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,779
This is the last time he was captured.

451
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,650
<i>Murder Suspect Wanted</i>

452
00:57:37,651 --> 00:57:39,489
He was never captured on

453
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,030
outside security cams.

454
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,159
It means he disappeared within
the confines of this apartment.

455
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,620
No traces of leaving the apartment,

456
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,620
just like Ju-hee.

457
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,379
What if there is a space
here that we haven’t searched,

458
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,220
and tucked away from people…

459
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,479
You’ll go inside now? We
should inform the police…

460
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,940
You heard our phone conversation.

461
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,149
Even though I get death threats,

462
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,909
even I heard her voice
through the pipes,

463
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,290
they have nothing to investigate.

464
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:30,830
Look.

465
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,170
No one gives a damn.

466
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,130
I’m the only one

467
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,930
who can find her.

468
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,710
Look, Ju-young.

469
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,420
There’s a door here too.

470
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,550
There are two paths.

471
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,470
I think we should split up.

472
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,720
We need to hurry, it’ll be night soon.

01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,160

I think there’s more space over here.

481
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:35,640
I think we should take a look inside.

483
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,479

484
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,809
It’s not my fault, I was quiet.

485
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:51,650

01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,370
What’s wrong?

489
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,860
Ju-young! Ju-young!

490
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,480
Hey there, are you alone here?

491
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,740
Can you hear me?

492
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:54,000
Do you hear me?

493
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,129
Congenital hearing loss.

494
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:03,640
The hearing aid must be
uncomfy, he’d take them off.

495
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,760
Yeon-woo, where did you
hide the hearing aid?

496
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,769
Honey, the hearing aid.

497
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:11,060
Excuse me…

498
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,980
What happened?

499
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:20,239
You were babbling on about
finding someone in the basement,

500
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,360
so I called the police,
and they’re searching it.

501
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,910
Get some rest, your
body must be in shock.

502
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:33,080
But why on earth were you in there?

503
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,960
Thank god I was there to save you.

504
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,290
Thank you.

505
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:53,980
The only kids I saw here are
your boy and unit 804’s daughter.

506
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:58,360
804 said she has a daughter?

507
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,280
Yes, why?

508
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:06,949
Her daughter died on the spot
when a delivery van hit her.

509
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,239
A few years ago.

510
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,160
That lunatic, she’s still at it…

511
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:18,380
Where is it? Why does he
keep taking the hearing aid off?

512
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,490
<i>It’s because you heard something
you shouldn’t have.</i>

513
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,320
<i>If you hear it more…</i>

514
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,530
<i>you’ll die.</i>

515
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,870
<i>Did you also hear
something in the basement?</i>

516
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,840
<i>I’m looking for someone.</i>

517
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,380
<i>Don’t go there.</i>

This camcorder can save files

523
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,309
Though the camcorder is damaged,
the phone is unlocked,

524
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:38,889
so we can check the saved videos,
despite some corrupted footage.

525

Ms. Seo.

526
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:45,360
So, the two of you went to the
basement to look for your sister,

527
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:49,859
and got split up, and
someone started chasing you?

528
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,240
And you don’t remember
anything afterward?

529
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:53,950
Yes.

530
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,079
Which means, someone else was there.

531
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,160
There was a steel door inside,

532
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,540
and another space beyond that.

533
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,079
I need to check that space out…

534
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,169
Ms. Seo, there is no steel door.

535
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:09,089
We went there and checked every corner.

536
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:11,420
I am telling you I saw it.

537
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:15,299
If I don’t go and find Ju-hee…

538
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,470
You saw what happened,
stop saying irresponsible things!

539
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,139
You may end up on the
suspect list if you keep this up!

540
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:24,190
You said you live…

541
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,360
It’s your fault.

542
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,600
Where is it?!

543
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:36,490
<i>I’m gonna record evidence
this time for sure.</i>

544
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,530
<i>Is it here?</i>

545
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,410
<i>What are all these?</i>

546
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,590
<i>Don’t worry.</i>

547
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:42,300
<i>No one will hurt you or mommy now.</i>

548
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:48,720
<i>Mommy will live here forever with you.</i>

549
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,560
<i>Hm?</i>

550
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,400
<i>What is it?</i>

551
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,950
<i>The lady next door keeps bothering you?</i>

552
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,030
<i>It’s okay.</i>

553
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:11,460
<i>I can kill her
like the lady downstairs.</i>

554
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,650
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

555
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,650
<i>What were you doing alone?</i>

556
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,540
<i>You did more than just listen.</i>

557
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,220
Ju-young…

558
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:10,280
Ju-hee…

559
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,370
Ju-hee?

560
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,420
Ju-hee!

561
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,040
Ju-hee?!

562
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:22,630
Ju-hee!

563
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:26,130
Ju-hee! Please!

564
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:34,100
Are you okay?

565
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,520
It’s okay, everything’s okay.

566
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:44,480
Let’s get out of here.

567
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:53,200
Let’s go.

568
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:18,430
Found you.

569
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,250
Ju-young?

570
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,040
Ju-young!

571
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:46,460
Open this door.

572
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,470
<i>Hide in here.</i>

573
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:57,140
<i>I’ll lure her deeper inside,
so escape through that door.</i>

574
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,930
Open this door!

575
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,190
<i>It’s dangerous here,
you have to get out.</i>

576
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,670
That woman was still alive, wasn’t she?

577
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:33,550
I heard what you said at home.

578
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,640
I destroyed this, how
did you watch that?

579
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:45,150
You said she tapped the wall for help,

580
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:47,229
you saw that with your eyes.

581
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:49,110
That’s how you know.

582
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:52,360
She kept…

583
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:55,660
trying to separate me and my daughter.

584
01:19:57,910 --> 01:20:02,040
I really had no choice.

585
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:13,470
I couldn’t let her live.

586
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:20,100
Are you insane? Your daughter is dead.

587
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:36,860
Who said my daughter’s dead?

588
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:42,160
You saw her when you came to my home.

589
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,830
You’re just like me.

590
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:27,430
<i>Speech recognition mode…</i>

591
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,950
<i>hahahahahahahaha</i>

592
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:11,660
Because of people complained
about running at home,

593
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:14,540
I let Ye-na play outside…

594
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,840
I should’ve protected her,

595
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,050
when she went outside…

596
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,180
she was run over by a truck.

597
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,150
It’s all your fault.

598
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,900
She died because of the
noise made by all of you!

599
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:55,370
Why, what did I do wrong?

600
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:03,629
Why did that bitch and
your sister mess with us?

601
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:05,509
Crazy bastards…

602
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:07,299
I’m sorry!

603
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,140
I didn’t want to kill them!

604
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,140
What are you saying?

605
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,270
My sister is alive.

606
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,950
What’s with you?

607
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:29,800
Help me, please!

608
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:31,180
Help!

609
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:34,470
Help!

610
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:35,810
Please help!

611
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:37,350
Help!

612
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,430
Ju-hee…

613
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:27,980
Ju-hee?

614
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,500
Ju-hee…

615
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,470
Don’t listen.

616
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:03,890
It’s nothing at all, it’s okay.

617
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:06,360
Don’t listen.

618
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,250
Please…

619
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,840
Help…

620
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:38,800
Help…

621
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:03,039
Good afternoon.

622
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,079
I moved in above you a few days ago.

623
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,000
Hello there.

624
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:09,710
Do you live alone?

625
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:11,590
With my sister.

626
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:29,520
Please enjoy these.

627
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,899
<i>I’ll be a good neighbor</i>

628
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,649
I’ll try to be quiet
as much as possible,

629
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:38,450
but if you hear any noise,
feel free to let me know.

630
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:42,660
I think the unit above me
was really noisy at night.

631
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:45,659
I don’t know how people
can be so noisy day and…

632
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,040
Shh…

633
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,960
You have to be careful,
everyone can hear each other.
