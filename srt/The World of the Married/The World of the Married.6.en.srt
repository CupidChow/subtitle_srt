(Episode 6)

4
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,300
Joonyoung.

5
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,101
Divorce isn't necessarily a bad thing.

6
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,901
Noeul also had a hard
time accepting it at first...

7
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:16,034
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

8
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:24,634
Joonyoung.

9
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,033
Joonyoung.

10
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:30,235
Did my mom ask you...

11
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,869
...to convince me since she's
going to get a divorce?

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
No.

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,834
I'm just worried about you. That's all.

14
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,634
I just feel bad.

15
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:45,901
Why?

16
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,267
Why do you feel bad?

17
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,033
Do you know something?

18
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:01,634
Things will never be the same again.

19
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:03,534
Our marriage!

20
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:05,001
Our son!

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,300
You're the one who ruined everything!

22
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,934
Do you finally get what you've done?

23
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:20,867
What did I do?

24
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:22,700
No.

25
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:28,367
Your viciousness is what ruined us.

26
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:33,734
You know how sad it is
to grow up without a dad.

27
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,201
How could you say...

28
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:40,067
...you'd do the same to
Joonyoung in front of me?

29
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:44,369
You have no right.

30
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,700
You have no right to take
his dad from Joonyoung.

31
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,868
No.

32
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,067
You're already done.

33
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:12,168
Joonyoung saw everything.

34
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,567
He saw what you...

35
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,302
...and Dakyung were doing.

36
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:48,934
Sunwoo...

37
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,034
...really is something.

38
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,401
I knew for a while now...

39
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,801
...that you were having an affair.

40
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,367
No.

41
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:02,634
They never lasted more than a
night, so it wasn't an affair.

42
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,201
I guess it's more of an addiction.

43
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:12,968
Why are you acting this
way if you knew already?

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,300
Because it's Sunwoo.

45
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,634
Why is that different?

46
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:25,067
Did you sleep with her?

47
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,101
It was just physical pleasure.
I never had feelings for her.

48
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,868
In that way,

49
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:33,368
Sunwoo is no different from other women.

50
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:37,668
Don't tell me you think I love her.

51
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:44,202
Are you proud of yourself because
you didn't have feelings for her?

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,267
Do you...

53
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:55,335
...hate me that much?

54
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,768
It's not that I hate you.

55
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,534
"I hate boredom" is a
better way to put it.

56
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,667
What did you do while I was bored?

57
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,001
Shouldn't a couple fix each
other's inadequacies...

58
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:17,034
...and have fun together?

59
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,867
I can't seem to do that.

60
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,502
There's nothing left to talk about then.

61
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:30,400
Fine, the problem is with me.

62
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,168
I admit I'm not normal.

63
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,133
Are you...

64
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,567
...even sorry?

65
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:35,968
Why are you here like this?

66
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,166
Sorry.

67
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,502
I'm really sorry.

68
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:54,168
Did you really date me
just for my dad's money?

69
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:57,334
If even you believe
what that psycho said,

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,834
nothing I say now will matter.

71
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,867
The chairman invested in my work.

72
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:09,368
He decided based purely
on my passion and work.

73
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:29,500
Put the cigarette out.

74
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,035
Put it out.

75
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:36,935
It's bad for the baby.

76
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:51,667
I can...

77
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,501
...give up everything.

78
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,234
My mom,

79
00:07:58,501 --> 00:07:59,601
my dad,

80
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,101
and everything I enjoyed
thanks to my dad.

81
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:07,534
Dakyung.

82
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:12,768
The choice is yours now.

83
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,001
Thank you.

84
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:38,735
Thank you so much.

85
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,001
Did you see him?

86
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,535
Why are you doing this to me?

87
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,934
I said...

88
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,634
...I would tell you everything...

89
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:44,068
...if a situation arises which
you need to know about.

90
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:58,301
You are so sickening.

91
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:00,968
You think you're so great?

92
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,335
You probably reckon others think the
same, but get over yourself.

93
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:08,434
You are a garbage. That's what you are.

94
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,168
What about you,

95
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,335
who went on a trip with
my husband's mistress?

96
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:17,700
You're a garbage just like me.

97
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,067
So?

98
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:23,135
Did you want to get revenge on me?

99
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,834
Is that why you slept with my husband?

100
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:31,535
Yes.

101
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,834
You must have wanted...

102
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:44,601
...to ruin our marriage because
yours was already ruined.

103
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:46,968
You failed.

104
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,735
You couldn't save your marriage,

105
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,701
but I will save mine.

106
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:56,001
This won't ruin our marriage at all.

107
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:59,268
I don't care at all...

108
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:03,769
...whether or not you get divorced.
I simply...

109
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:07,235
...wanted to tell you the truth.

110
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,168
Because that's how I felt.

111
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:13,268
It made me unbearably
sad because even you,

112
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:20,836
whom I considered as a
friend, deceived me.

113
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,901
You're totally fake.

114
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:28,168
I have never...

115
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,802
...considered you as a friend.

116
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:37,434
Is that right?

117
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,734
If I have known that was how you felt,

118
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:46,534
I would've been less sad.

119
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:23,901
You're home.

120
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:27,067
Where's Joonyoung?

121
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:39,501
My daughter and I will leave now.

122
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:44,668
Bye.

123
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:47,167
Miyun.

124
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:51,534
Thank you.

125
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,334
Where's dad?

126
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,267
He won't be coming home.

127
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:26,834
Until when?

128
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:05,100
We won't break up anymore, right?

129
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:08,602
Of course not.

130
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,534
We'll sleep in the same bed together,

131
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:13,934
and wake up together too.

132
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:19,068
We can stay together all day long, right?

133
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,901
I'll stay by your side all day long.

134
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,600
With our baby too.

135
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,134
I'll be a good wife.

136
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,166
Your film...

137
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,201
...is going to be a huge success.

138
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:50,801
Yes.

139
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:56,934
Is there a problem?

140
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,601
I have a feeling the
production might not happen.

141
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,901
What do you mean?

142
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,734
As you already know,

143
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,902
your father is really upset.

144
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:18,802
His investment will be pulled out,

145
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,702
so unless I find a new investor...

146
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,101
Are you saying...

147
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,434
...you don't have any other investors?

148
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:30,601
The thing is,

149
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,367
making a film isn't that easy.

150
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,166
I see.

151
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:06,567
(Speed Quick)

152
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,435
Hello, are you Lee Taeoh?

153
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:12,001
Yes.

154
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,934
Could you sign here please?

155
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:20,135
Here are your documents.

156
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:23,100
Thank you.

157

(Application for Uncontested Divorce)

158
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,101
(Wife: Ji Sunwoo)

159
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,467
-Who was that?
-What is this?

160
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:39,567
This is ridiculous.

161
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,202
Don't waste time and
take care of it quickly.

162
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,534
No fool would agree to give up
on all the money and his kid.

163
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,867
You lived off the money
I earned until now.

164
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:49,568
There was never a thing you owned.

165
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,001
Who raised Joonyoung
while you were in training?

166
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,402
Don't you remember?

167
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:57,668
I played a part in helping
you get your license.

168
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,234
Fine.

169
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:01,901
If you want to play it that way,

170
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:04,300
I won't go easy on you.

171
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,168
What are you going to do about it?

172
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:09,601
You founded a company with my money,

173
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:12,035
then you pocketed a slush fund.

174
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,034
I'll charge you for embezzlement.

175
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:19,267
-How are you going to do that?
-Don't worry.

176
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,834
The employees who didn't
get their paychecks...

177
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:23,968
...thanks to their incompetent
boss decided to help me.

178
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,001
(Application for Uncontested Divorce)

179
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:45,368
How does she know my address?

180
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:48,801
Did you tell her?

181
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:50,934
No.

182
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,535
Since when did she...

183
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:56,401
To what extent does she know about us?

184
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,867
She gives me goosebumps.

185
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:11,166
Welcome.

186
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:29,101
Where's Min Hyunseo?

187
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:30,867
She quit.

188
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,400
Don't lie.

189
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:36,234
I mean it. She quit a few days ago.

190
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:51,234
Where did she run off to?

191
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:01,668
Where's Hyunseo?

192
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,201
Where did you hide her?

193
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,067
Why are you asking me?

194
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,101
I thought you two were together.

195
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,501
Why aren't you sending me the money?
Hurry up and send it.

196
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,634
I don't have any money.

197
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:18,267
If you want to report it, go ahead.
I don't care.

198
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,668
Are you pushing your luck?

199
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:24,702
You already have a criminal
record for assault and fraud.

200
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:27,568
If you want to add another charge
for blackmailing, I won't stop you.

201
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,501
Do whatever you want.

202
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,168
I won't just sit and watch.

203
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,400
Hello.

204
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:06,402
-Hello, Dr. Ji.
-Hello.

205
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,467
Good morning.

206
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:20,034
Did something happen?
Something seems strange.

207
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:22,935
Hurry up and take a look
at the hospital's website.

208
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:25,434
Our website?

209
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,402
It started late last night.

210
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,767
Nurse Kim first noticed it and
requested it to be deleted.

211
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,735
But the more they deleted
it, the worse it became.

212
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,701
It's spreading in community blogs
and personal social media accounts.

213
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:45,134
It spread so quickly and
got out of control.

214
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,634
I only found out a while ago.

215
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:51,301
I don't know who it is,

216
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:54,034
but they definitely want
to give you a hard time.

217
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,367
Do you have anyone in mind?

218
00:20:57,868 --> 00:20:59,402
Who could it be?

219
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:03,967
Could it be Mr. Ha Dongshik?

220
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,234
Or is it someone else?

221
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:11,034
Hey, who was that man who
came to see you before?

222
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,002
He didn't look like a patient.

223
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:16,735
Could it be him?

224
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,667
My goodness.

225
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,600
What's the point of finding
out who wrote it?

226
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,402
It's fine as long as it's not you.

227
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:27,101
You tend to be too sensitive these days.

228
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,401
I only said it out of concern.

229
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,233
It's normal for patients
to make complaints.

230
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:37,768
It will quiet down in time.

231
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,235
You should go back to work.

232
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:42,669
If it started during the night,

233
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:45,368
it could be your husband too.

234
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,101
Why would he do such a thing?

235
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,567
If your reputation is ruined,

236
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:54,001
it will put your husband
in a favourable position.

237
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:57,634
You said he doesn't want to
give up on your son's custody.

238
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,934
So who do you want to live with?

239
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:23,367
Haven't you decided yet?

240
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,134
Stop being so annoying.

241
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,434
I need to go to the office.

242
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:40,701
I'll talk to my dad and convince
him to invest in your company.

243
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:43,835
This isn't the right time
to talk to him about that.

244
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,200
He might not even approve
of our relationship.

245
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,634
Let me take care of what's urgent first.

246
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:54,801
Please hurry up and get a divorce.

247
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:59,835
I should get myself a lawyer so
we can rewrite the agreement.

248
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:01,968
I'm not going to let her
have everything she wants.

249
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,166
Why can't you...

250
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,367
...give up on your son?

251
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,500
-Because he's my son.
-Then what?

252
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,134
What do you plan to do with him?

253
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:21,400
-He'll live with me. Then...
-What about our baby?

254
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,168
How do you expect me to bear with that?

255
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:25,701
I'll take care of it, okay?

256
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:27,402
Hey, you two!

257
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:31,401
Where is Min Hyunseo?

258
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,268
Why are you asking me?

259
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,367
I don't know where she is.

260
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,734
You guys used to talk
to each other all night.

261
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:44,702
And now, you're acting
like you don't know her?

262
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,266
Listen!

263
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:48,668
Why are you trying to start
a fight with a stranger?

264
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,701
How is she supposed to know
where her neighbour is?

265
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,133
"A stranger"?

266
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:05,534
Do you know your wife
used my girlfriend...

267
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:07,101
...to keep a tail on you?

268
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:34,534
What do you want?

269
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:36,901
Do you want to get a divorce?

270
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:08,535
Just tell me. I'll get a
divorce if that's what you want.

271
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:11,934
I'm not getting a divorce.

272
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,868
I don't have a job or any kids.

273
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,901
If I don't even get my dad's
money, I'd be left with nothing.

274
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:27,834
You're going to forgive me...

275
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:29,967
...because you won't be able
to get his inheritance...

276
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:33,334
...if you get a divorce?

277
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:36,834
Not getting a divorce doesn't
mean I'm going to forgive you.

278
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:38,868
Get changed.

279
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,367
Then what do you want?

280
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:44,668
I don't care how you feel.

281
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:48,502
Just do your best as my husband.

282
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:51,468
And I want you to work with me
so we can have a baby.

283
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:02,568
Okay, fine.

284
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:05,035
I'll stop seeing other women.

285
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,068
Instead,

286
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,968
I'm not going to have a baby.

287
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:23,068
Who's my next patient?

288
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:28,602
There aren't any more patients, Dr. Ji.

289
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:33,034
The other patients cancelled
their appointments.

290
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,934
What should we do, Dr. Ji?

291
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,333
Should we call the police?

292
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:50,402
If he's here to get treated,
you can send him in.

293
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,901
Then I'll be there, too.

294
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,134
The police...

295
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,601
...told me you refused
to press any charges,

296
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:13,367
and that I don't even need to
compensate for the broken computer.

297
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:15,767
Is that true?

298
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:18,934
You came here to check on that?

299
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:23,101
No, I came to apologize.

300
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,267
I'm sorry.

301
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:28,235
I decided...

302
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:31,034
...to take your advice
and see a psychiatrist.

303
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:40,701
That's great.

304
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,268
I wish you all the best
with your treatment.

305
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:45,301
Okay.

306
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,634
You're a great doctor.

307
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,067
I came here to tell you that.

308
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:12,867
What do you think?

309
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,867
Not too bad for my first time, right?

310
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,600
Did you tell him to
compliment me like that?

311
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,101
Not at all.

312
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:28,834
Ji Sunwoo speaking.

313
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,034
Come in.

314
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,868
You asked for me?

315
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:56,135
I told you everything I have to say,

316
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,768
so I'll be off now.

317
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:05,901
You should have given me the
money when I asked for it.

318
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,734
-Sir.
-Is it true...

319
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:21,135
...that you assaulted and threatened
that man to have him placed...

320
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:22,867
...in a mental institution
against his will?

321
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,134
He assaulted my patient.

322
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:27,335
-It was an act of self-defence.
-Then...

323
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:29,769
...what about the fact that
you asked your patient...

324
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,068
...to tail your husband?

325
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,868
I know we had problems,
but how could you...

326
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,101
...ask your patient to tail me?

327
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:37,968
You're a doctor.

328
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,168
Why are you here?

329
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:41,901
I'll be honest.

330
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:45,135
I'm really worried about my wife.

331
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:48,035
Did you see all those posts
on the hospital website?

332
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,867
Firstly, why don't we check
who uploaded them, sir?

333
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:54,235
Someone's obviously trying to frame me.

334
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,334
You're the one who's trying to frame me.

335
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,300
How long have you been
planning to get a divorce?

336
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,700
Dr. Ji, are you getting a divorce?

337
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,035
It's my personal life, sir.

338
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,734
Well, you've obviously crossed the line.

339
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,967
What you did is not only
against medical ethics,

340
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:11,267
and it's even bad enough to
warrant a criminal punishment.

341
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,035
If people find out that you used
your patient for personal purposes,

342
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,667
it'll inflict huge
damage to the hospital!

343
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:18,435
I'll receive whatever punishment...

344
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,335
...that I deserve. But can we please...

345
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:28,968
...talk about this without my husband?
He doesn't even work here.

346
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,500
Okay, fine.

347
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,767
I know I made a mistake
by cheating on you.

348
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,801
But you sent someone to tail-gate me,
even assaulted and threatened someone.

349
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,335
None of that is normal.

350
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,068
How do you expect me to
trust you with Joonyoung...

351
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:47,634
...when you're not completely sane?

352
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,701
Is this about Joonyoung?

353
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:56,168
You want to make me seem insane,

354
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:58,368
so you could take him away from me?

355
00:30:58,434 --> 00:30:59,868
You're obviously not normal.

356
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:01,501
What are you talking about?

357
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:04,433
Does Dr. Kong know that
both your parents died...

358
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:06,934
...due to an unexpected accident?

359
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,134
Did you tell him that the
accident was suspicious?

360
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:13,034
-Shut it.
-You told me yourself...

361
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:15,001
...that your mom was
acting strange that day.

362
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,333
That she, who was driving,

363
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:19,767
may have done it on purpose.

364
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:22,701
That she was having a really tough time...

365
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,133
...after finding out your
dad was cheating, and...

366
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:38,601
Are you...

367
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,502
...confident you won't
end up like your mom?

368
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,400
Doctor!

369
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:54,367
May I request a psychiatric
evaluation on Dr. Ji Sunwoo?

370
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:58,469
I think I'll need it
in our custody hearing.

371
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,467
You scumbag.

372
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,402
You won't get your way.

373
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,434
Dr. Ji!

374
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,434
Sunwoo! Sunwoo!

375
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,801
What are you doing?

376
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:43,101

379
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,667
Get up.

380
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:14,501
-Ma'am.
-Mr. Lee.

381
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:15,967
Where's Joonyoung?

382
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:19,735
His mother just picked him up.

383
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,235
Is something wrong?

384
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:25,901
I'm sorry, but I'm in a rush.

385
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,001
Okay.

386
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:45,634

00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:40,235
Give it back.

Give it back. Give me my phone!

-Give it to me!

00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:07,934
I'll buy you a new one, so sit still.

403
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:11,834
Where are we going? Answer me!

404
00:39:11,901 --> 00:39:13,402
I'll explain later.

405
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:16,334
I'm calling Dad.

406
00:39:17,434 --> 00:39:18,434
Give me that.

407
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,567
Give it to me!

408
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,401
You're not in your right mind!

409
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:25,767
Joonyoung.

(Sunwoo)

411
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:33,168
Hello? Where are you?

412
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:35,102
-Dad! Dad!
-Joonyoung.

413
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,268
Lee Joonyoung!

414
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,534
Mom. Look ahead. Look.

415
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:41,934
Careful!

416
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:49,200
What happened?

417
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,234
Joonyoung, are you okay?

418
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:52,901

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,433

-Are you with mom?

423
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:08,135

424
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,200
Hello?

425
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:14,400
Hello?

426
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,835
The phone is turned off.

427
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:42,602
My son is missing.

428
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:46,268
I can't get through.

429
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,735
How many times must I tell you?

430
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:51,901
His mom took him out of class.

431
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,334
I can't reach her either, that's why!

432
00:40:58,868 --> 00:41:00,736
I think they were in an accident.

433
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,801
I'm asking you to check.
That's why I called.

434
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,500
What do you mean,
call after the accident happens?

435
00:41:12,868 --> 00:41:13,968
Hello?

436
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:16,901
Hello?

437
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:22,068
Get out.

438
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,267
Joonyoung.

439
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,267
I'm...

440
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:07,834
...very angry right now.

441
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:18,634
I apologize...

442
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:22,168
...for yelling at you and for
throwing out your phone.

443
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:28,534
I'm also sorry for bringing you here...

444
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,167
...against your will.

445
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:36,901
You know...

446
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:40,034
...why I'm acting like this?

447
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:42,534
It's because dad has
another woman, right?

448
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:47,668
So what? What about it?

449
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:52,268
He betrayed us.

450
00:44:54,801 --> 00:44:55,934
You know everything, don't you?

451
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,434
He betrayed you,

452
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,400
not me.

453
00:45:06,868 --> 00:45:08,569
That woman's pregnant.

454
00:45:09,734 --> 00:45:11,867
Dad doesn't need us anymore, Joonyoung.

455
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,233
So?

456
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,467
Did he say he'll live with her?

457
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:22,435
Does he love that baby
more than he loves me?

458
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,200
It's okay.

459
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:34,567
We can live happily on our own.

460
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,768
It won't be a problem even without him.

461
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,901
No. I don't want to live just with you.

462
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:48,901
Do you not want to?

463
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:51,701
Don't get a divorce.

464
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:55,368
You can forgive him this time.

465
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:57,535
Just forgive him.

466
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,533
I can't.

467
00:46:03,534 --> 00:46:06,035
Dad decided to live with that woman.

468
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,634
How can we live without dad?

469
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:09,301
You're always busy.

470
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,400
You care more about work than me.

471
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:17,467
It was dad who stayed with me.

472
00:46:19,467 --> 00:46:21,068
You were never around.

473
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:25,634
Don't you know why I lived that way?

474
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:30,301
I did it for you.

475
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:35,367
I did it so I could give
you everything you need.

476
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:41,967
You're the most precious thing to me.

477
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:46,235
You're all I have.

478
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:50,301
-Don't you see that?
-Don't lie to me.

479
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,367
I will go to dad.

480
00:46:53,534 --> 00:46:54,801
Where is he right now?

481
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,201
If you go to him, I'll die.

482
00:47:02,234 --> 00:47:03,701
Will you still go to him?

483
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:06,634
Don't you care if I die?

484
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:13,601
Answer me.

485
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,335
Tell me you'll live with me.

486
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:21,467
Answer me!

487
00:47:21,534 --> 00:47:22,701
Let me go.

488
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,667
I'm scared.

489
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:28,334
Answer me!

490
00:47:41,534 --> 00:47:42,834
Is this your son's?

491
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:46,267
Yes, it is.

492
00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:49,134
It's Joonyoung's.

493
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,267
We checked where he last had a
signal, and it was here.

494
00:47:53,767 --> 00:47:55,601
This is as much as we can do.

495
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:57,968
Were there any reported accidents?

496
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,835
No, none.

497
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,534
He seems to be with his mom.
You should wait at home.

498
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:05,700
Let's go. Get in.

00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:20,601
-Where are you?
-Come home.

501
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:23,501
We'll talk in person.

502
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:00,934
Where's Joonyoung?

503
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:03,233
Where is he?

504
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,367
Joonyoung!

505
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:16,600
Joonyoung!

506
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,667
Where's Joonyoung?

507
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:39,567
Are you sure you want to live with him?

508
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:42,168
Did that woman agree?

509
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:45,835
Are you going to tell Joonyoung
to call that woman...

510
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,168
...you cheated with as his stepmom?

511
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,067
You make me sick.

512
00:49:52,734 --> 00:49:54,501
Didn't I apologize enough?

513
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:56,402
How much more should I beg?

514
00:49:56,501 --> 00:49:57,701
You don't realize it, do you?

515
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:02,568
You never apologized.

516
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,367
It's over now.

517
00:50:17,734 --> 00:50:19,635
You can't see Joonyoung anymore.

518
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,034
What's that supposed to mean?

519
00:50:29,968 --> 00:50:32,101
You shouldn't have talked about my mom.

520
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:38,334
I barely managed to forget about it.

521
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:44,734
But you made me remember
everything again.

522
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,568
Cut the nonsense and just tell me...

523
00:50:46,634 --> 00:50:48,168
...where Joonyoung is!

524
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:56,367
What did you do...

525
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,501
...to Joonyoung?

526
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,300
You're the one who destroyed our family.

527
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:10,166
But he took your side.

528
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:15,768
Stop being crazy if you
don't want me to kill you.

529
00:51:15,901 --> 00:51:18,502
Why don't you just go ahead and kill me?

530
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:20,901
I don't want to live anymore!

531
00:51:21,033 --> 00:51:22,066
What?

532
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:25,700
No way.

533
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:28,200
Tell me I'm wrong.

534
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,701
There's no way you would've done that.

535
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,234
Tell me I'm wrong!

536
00:51:41,133 --> 00:51:43,266
I can do anything...

537
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:47,901
...to make you suffer.

538
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,400
How do you feel to have lost your child?

539
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:04,035
You're the one who made me do this.

540
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:06,534
Do you understand?

541
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:11,634
You crazy witch.

542
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:17,334
Die!

543
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:21,700
Die!

544
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:22,300
You darn psycho.

545
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:51,634
Joonyoung.

546
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,968
Thank goodness.

547
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,267
Joonyoung.

548
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:15,535
No, it's not what you think. Joonyoung.

549
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:18,734
-Listen to me, Joonyoung.
-Don't call my name.

550
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,867
I'm not your son anymore.

551
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:46,368
Sunwoo! Sunwoo!

552
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,934
Sunwoo! Sunwoo!

553
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,367
Mom!

554
00:56:31,634 --> 00:56:32,667
Mom!

555
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,101
-Mom!
-Hello? 911?

556
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:38,767
-We need an ambulance. Hurry.
-Mom!

557
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,734
Someone is severely injured.

558
00:56:57,868 --> 00:57:00,802
He agreed to all your terms.

559
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:05,001
(Divorce settlement agreement)

560
00:57:06,334 --> 00:57:09,434
The court also issued a
temporary restraining order.

561
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:28,600
(Lee Taeoh, Ji Sunwoo)

562
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:30,634
You finally got what you want.

563
00:57:31,734 --> 00:57:32,834
Congratulations.

564
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:26,502
(From The National Health Insurance
Corporation, To Lee Taeoh)

565
00:58:32,434 --> 00:58:35,467
(Writ of Garnishment)

566
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:46,867
My wife was really shocked that day.

567
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:49,667
So she wrote some stuff on
the online notice board...

568
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,233
...of the hospital website out of anger.

569
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:57,600
Please let me apologize on her behalf.

570
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:03,469
This is a small town,
and your reputation matters.

571
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:05,367
What she did...

572
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,300
...was very disrespectful to you.

573
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:10,968
And I know...

574
00:59:12,968 --> 00:59:16,602
...that it will only
remain as a civil case.

575
00:59:18,868 --> 00:59:21,635
But can you please not sue Dakyung
for having destroyed your marriage?

576
00:59:25,534 --> 00:59:26,701
What...

577
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:28,968
...do you need me to do?

578
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:34,067
Are you proposing a deal?

579
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:41,368
My goodness, look at her. She's so brazen.

580
00:59:41,801 --> 00:59:42,834
She's unbelievable.

581
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:45,802
I know. I can't believe
she still lives here.

582
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:49,235
She's ruining the reputation
of our neighbourhood.

583
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,667
She's shopping for groceries
after having destroyed a family?

584
00:59:51,734 --> 00:59:53,301
She's got some nerve.

585
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:55,834
My gosh.

586
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,434
Will you look at her?
What is she even doing here?

587
01:00:07,434 --> 01:00:08,968
This card was declined.

588
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:14,401
That can't be. Please try again.

589
01:00:16,634 --> 01:00:17,602
(Swipe card)

590
01:00:17,734 --> 01:00:19,335
(Transaction denied. Please try again.)

591
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,300
It was rejected.

592
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:26,967
How can you suddenly
freeze my credit cards?

593
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,801
You said to stay out of it.

594
01:00:29,801 --> 01:00:31,735
Doesn't that jerk give
you money for expenses?

595
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,901
Must you go this far?

596
01:00:43,467 --> 01:00:44,634
Dad.

597
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:48,302
Can't you help Taeoh? He's talented.

598
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:50,735
He'll succeed if you support him.

599
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:54,135
Is that why he bled his
wife dry all these years?

600
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:57,934
Dakyung! Why are you such
a poor judge of people?

601
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:00,068
Shut it and get out!

602
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:02,700
I'll pretend I don't have a daughter.

603
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:10,934
Dad.

604
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:16,334
Please.

605
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,400
Please, Dad.

606
01:01:22,734 --> 01:01:23,901
Dakyung.

607
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,801
It's not too late.

608
01:01:29,934 --> 01:01:31,268
Break up with him.

609
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:35,735
If you do, I will take care of you...

610
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:37,901
...and the baby.

611
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:40,068
Listen to me.

612
01:01:42,334 --> 01:01:43,073
Okay?

613
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,535
I love him.

614
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:50,801
I can't leave him.

615
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,333
He hit his wife in front of his child...

616
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,433
...and was arrested for assault.

617
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,701
But what? Love?

618
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:04,700
-Have you lost your mind?
-It's not like that!

619
01:02:07,868 --> 01:02:10,335
That woman set him up.

620
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:14,068
Dad.

621
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,233
Fine.

622
01:02:24,234 --> 01:02:25,901
Pretend you don't have
a daughter anymore.

623
01:02:28,901 --> 01:02:30,135
I won't come back.

624
01:03:07,968 --> 01:03:09,202
I reported...

625
01:03:10,434 --> 01:03:12,035
...Inkyu for assault.

626
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:16,235
The lawyer says he won't get
out easily because he has...

627
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,767
...several priors convictions.

628
01:03:19,968 --> 01:03:21,135
That's good.

629
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,301
It's thanks to you.

630
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:27,168
I didn't do anything.

631
01:03:28,834 --> 01:03:30,134
It was all you.

632
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:32,669
You showed me by example...

633
01:03:34,701 --> 01:03:36,268
...how to get out of it.

634
01:03:41,033 --> 01:03:43,166
I used your situation.

635
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:47,435
I'm the one who said to use
it as much as you wanted.

636
01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:49,734
Why did you do it?

637
01:03:51,968 --> 01:03:53,302
What about you?

638
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,234
You were the first person to help me...

639
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:05,335
...when I was being hit.

640
01:04:08,434 --> 01:04:11,268
Why did you get so
involved and go so far...

641
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:16,634
...to save me?

642
01:04:44,734 --> 01:04:46,001
Did you go out?

643
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:51,369
I think the hospital
director made a big blunder.

644
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,368
Psychiatry is going to be
a big minus in our profits.

645
01:04:58,234 --> 01:05:02,168
Should I go out and market
myself if I want to stay on?

646
01:05:11,634 --> 01:05:14,834
Divorce is like a war, right?

647
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,734
There's no winner or loser.

648
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,701
I know from experience.

649
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:32,301
Albeit it was unconventional,

650
01:05:33,968 --> 01:05:36,936
I found out the source of your trauma,

651
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,534
so why don't you try
receiving treatment for it?

652
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:42,068
I'm pretty well-respected in Seoul.

653
01:05:43,467 --> 01:05:44,734
I'm fine.

654
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,100
Do you have experience
treating alcoholics?

655
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:50,402
I would like to make a referral.

656
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:52,068
Who?

657
01:05:54,934 --> 01:05:58,568
(Doctor Ji Sunwoo)

658
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,867
How's your injury?

659
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,667
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

660
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,600
It's all better.

661
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:15,668
Joonyoung was shocked too, wasn't he?

662
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,867
That psycho jerk.

663
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,367
How dare he beat you up?

664
01:06:21,734 --> 01:06:22,934
Good job.

665
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:27,202
You can live with a cheater,
but not with someone who's violent.

666
01:06:29,467 --> 01:06:30,867

Don't be. I'm the one who's sorry.

ways, Sunwoo.

Taeoh is leaving Gosan.

672
01:06:49,901 --> 01:06:52,335
The rumours have spread
everywhere in this tiny city.

673
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,067
How could he stick around?

674
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:58,034
He's ashamed of himself. He's
moving somewhere no one knows him.

675

687
01:09:24,567 --> 01:09:28,535
What was the point of attacking
each other so cruelly?

688
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:53,068
Because we loved...

689
01:10:54,701 --> 01:10:55,968
Because we hated each other...

690
01:10:58,601 --> 01:10:59,734
