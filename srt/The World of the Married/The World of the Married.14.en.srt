3
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:52,434
Yes.

4
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,468
When you came by my place,

5
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,134
did you see...

6
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:12,534
...your dad there?

7
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:18,100
That night,

8
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:21,934
we were just discussing about something.

9
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,333
There are many things to
organize and prepare...

10
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:27,901
...before she leaves.

11
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:29,936
Do you think I don't know anything?

12
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:35,834
How long do you think your lies will work?

13
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,434
Stop using me as an excuse!

14
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:41,135
I feel like losing my mind
every time I hear your excuse.

15
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,168
Just stop it already!

16
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:09,534
What do we do?

17
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,867
Find Joonyoung and take him home now.

18
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:20,868
Sunwoo.

19
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:24,767
Please look after him...

20
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:28,335
...so he doesn't get hurt anymore.

21
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,934
That's all I want.

22
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,934
What's the problem?

23
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,667
-I took care of everything.
-Don't argue with me.

24
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,234
Send him back to Ji Sunwoo.

25
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:55,801
Send him back to his mom.

26
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,768
You can't handle him!

27
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,335
He's Taeoh's son.

28
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,868
I won't send him to that woman.

29
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:02,902
He's my responsibility
since I brought him here.

30
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:06,768
You did as much as you could.
Enough is enough!

31
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:08,835
You said he has sticky fingers.

32
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,869
What if he hurts Jenny?

33
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,402
He made a mistake because
he lost his temper.

34
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,569
We just have to be understanding.

35
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,768
I can take care of him.

36
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,033
Gosh.

37
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:24,868
What is wrong with her!

38
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,501
Did Dakyung do something?
What's the matter?

39
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:31,001
Why would she want to take
care of someone else's child?

40
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,801
She's driving me crazy!

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,500

Lee Joonyoung.

44
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,835
There's not much to think about.

45
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,801
Your mom will leave soon.

46
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,234
Where have you been?

47
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,368
Honey, can I have a word with Joonyoung?

48
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,867
Remember what I said when you moved in?

49
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:42,700
I want you to feel at home here.

50
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:46,968
You need to be happy for
your dad to be happy.

51
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:52,135
The adults made mistakes,
and that hurt you.

52
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,901
I'm responsible for half of that.

53
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:58,100
I sorted it out for you this time,

54
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,901
but if you do something like that again,

55
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,201
I won't be able to cover it up for you.

56
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:05,734
Don't do that again.

57
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,901
Or it will get troublesome for everyone.

58
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,334
It's for your own good.

59
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:18,001
Can you promise me?

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

61
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:31,867
Thank you.

62
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,034
I want you to get my
permission when you go out.

63
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:45,768
Aren't you going to answer me?

64
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:48,901
Okay.

65
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:05,568
What did you talk about?

66
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,234
I told him to get my permission...

67
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:09,268
...if he wants to go out.

68
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,035
Honey.

69
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,068
Do you know the friends he hangs out with?

70
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:18,267
Not really.

71
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:21,901
We need to check his circle of
friends and where he hangs out.

72
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,101
We need to pay attention.

73
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:27,267
Okay.

74
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,367
I'll talk to him.

78

Just the other day he
wouldn't leave me alone.

79
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:33,901
But today he won't even call.

80
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,234
He's may be a good-for-nothing chump...

81
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,635
Too bad he's not here.

82

Yerim.

83
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,795
Are you very sick? Have you eaten?

84
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,101
What the heck? How did you know?

85
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:07,001
Myungsook told me you
were at the hospital.

86
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,801
And that you were given
a lot of painkillers.

87
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,067
She just can't keep secrets.

88
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:13,935
You should've told me sooner.

89
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:17,135
Do I have to hear about your
sickness from someone else?

90
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,068
I will get sick and grow old
alone for the rest of my life.

91
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,901
I should start getting used to it.

92
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:30,734
What's this?

93
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,700
Oh, this?

94
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,834
It's tiramisu.

95
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:45,201
I remembered you eating
this when you got sick.

96
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,235
To be honest,

97
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,834
it didn't come to me right away.

98
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:52,235
At first, I wasn't sure if it was...

99
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:55,368
...chocolate or tiramisu.

100
00:09:58,534 --> 00:09:59,534
Try it.

101
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,101
Aren't you sick of doing this?

102
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:03,767
No.

103
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,434
I'm happy.

104
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,467
When I thought about
what I can do for you...

105
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:13,102
And the entire time I was
coming here with this...

106
00:10:14,234 --> 00:10:15,401
I felt happy.

107
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,668
I was happy that I could
do something for you.

108
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,200
Good morning.

109
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,035
-Good morning.
- Hello.

110
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,801
Is Dr. Ji in?

111
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:21,235
She's not in yet.

112
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,968
Okay. Have a nice day.

113
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,901
Help!

114
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,133
Please come quickly!

115
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:38,702
My daughter needs urgent treatment.

116
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:41,301
-What's her name?
- Park Hyejin.

117
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:45,001
She was treated by Dr. Ji Sunwoo.

118
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:47,634
She's scheduled to see other patients.

119
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,302
You'll have to wait about 10 minutes.

120
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,367
Her condition got worse after
taking the medicine...

121
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:52,834
...prescribed by Dr.Ji.

122
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:54,735
Can't you treat her first?

123
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,834
It's still before office hours.

124
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,302
-Let me see the chart.
- Okay.

125
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:04,402
-What about Dr. Kim, the physician?
-He has a patient too.

126
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:06,601
Hyejin!

127
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:10,201
Come on, do something! She's in pain!

128
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:12,801
-Send her to my office.
- Yes, ma'am.

129
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:13,769
Escort the patient.

130
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,901
Okay.

131
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:18,668
Come this way.

132
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,001
-What's going on?
- It's Dr. Ji's patient.

133
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:29,035
Her abdominal pain got
worse all of a sudden.

134
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,001
Damn it.

135
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:43,135
Irritable bowel syndrome?

136
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,667
Yes.

137
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:53,900
Dr. Ji.

138
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:00,534
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

139
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,468
You should go to Dr. Seol's office.

140
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:04,901
Your patient was taken to her office.

141
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:13,268
It's Ms. Park Hyejin from yesterday.

142
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:15,768
Her abdominal pain got
worse all of a sudden.

143
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,201
Please excuse me, sir.

144
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:23,001
We'll give you some painkiller.
Please relax.

145
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,968
When did the pain start?

146
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,401
From dawn...

147
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,967
The pain started from dawn.

148
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:37,367
The ultrasound imaging indicates
an internal hemorrhage.

149
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,734
Let's take an abdominal CT scan first.

150
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:40,869
-Nurse Joo?
- Yes?

151
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:42,535
-Take her to the CT lab.
- Yes, Doctor.

152
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,234
-Nurse Ha?
- Yes?

153
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:44,934
-Get a wheelchair.
- Okay.

154
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:01,735
What happened to you?

155
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,434
Why didn't you do an ultrasound test?

156
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:05,801
Is it that bad?

157
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:07,668
Don't do anything for now.

158
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:09,068
I'll sort things out.

159
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:23,267
Look here.

160
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,135
You said it's irritable bowel syndrome!

161
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,267
Your misdiagnosis almost killed her!

162
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,533
What are you going to do about it?

163
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:32,135
Sir, please calm down.

164
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,001
She's not even married yet.

165
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,901
What if she becomes sterile?

166
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,434
Then what?

167
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:39,602
Will you take responsibility for it?

168
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,668
-Close the door.
- Okay.

169
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:47,667
The pain was caused by a ruptured cyst.

170
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,001
We should wait and see,

171
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:51,901
but there's no problem in
her ovary at this moment.

172
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,802
-She won't get sterile.
-It's still her fault!

173
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,867
Her misdiagnosis led to this.

174
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:00,234
Am I wrong?

175
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,068
I'm sorry.

176
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:06,795
We can't be sure if it was a misdiagnosis!

177
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:08,901
If it wasn't a misdiagnosis,
then what is it?

178
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,434
You said she's hemorrhaging
from a cyst burst.

179
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:15,068
According to the chart, she was
advised to see a gynecologist.

180
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:16,968
Didn't your daughter mention that?

181
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:19,267
No.

182
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:22,135
She didn't tell me.

183
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Then check with your daughter again.

184
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,769
Damn it.

185
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:30,234
We were in panic this morning.

186
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:34,535
If she ends up getting
surgery, I won't let it slide.

187
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,967
I prescribed some painkillers
and antibiotics for her.

188
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,834
You can take her home
when she feels better.

189
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:41,869
I'll schedule an appointment
three days from now.

190
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:44,502
If she feels dizzy or sick before then,

191
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,767
come to the hospital at once, okay?

192
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:49,435
If anything happens to my daughter,

193
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:53,401
I'll sue that doctor and the hospital.

194
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:54,667
Got that?

195
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,201
Don't apologize when it's not your fault.

196
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:04,068
It makes you look guilty.

197
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:09,535
I didn't run an ultrasound test.
That's my fault.

198
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,961
Whether you missed the ultrasound
or made a misdiagnosis,

199
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,734
it doesn't matter to them!

200
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:15,602
Apologizing will only
make you look guilty.

201
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,001
Just stay out of it.

202
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,901
I'll take care of the rest.

203
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,800
Dr. Ji.

204
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:29,901
What’s gotten into you lately?

205
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:33,302
I didn't complain when you took
a day off to see your son.

206
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:36,901
But how could you miss something so basic?

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,968
You used to catch unknown,
underlying diseases.

208
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,167
That's why you were the
face of our hospital.

209
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,301
But now you're constantly late
to work, and leave early...

210
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:45,868
...and now misdiagnosis?

211
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,101
What’s with you?

212
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:50,102
Don't you think you have a problem?

213
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:54,801
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,601
I was careless.

215
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,335
I'll resign.

216
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,501
I was talking to you as the director.

217
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,001
Don't take it personally.

218
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,333
Every time I say something,
you say you'll resign.

219
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:12,935
Should I put a lock on my mouth?

220
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,601
Okay.

222
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,068
How long do you need?

223
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,168
Two days? Three?

224
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:25,335
Okay. I'll give you a week.

225
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,501
Would that be enough?

226
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,767
I'm sorry.

You should've told me sooner.

236
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:20,901
Taeoh is an upright man.

237
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,801
He doesn't like to ask for
favors from his family.

238
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:25,567
I'll ask my dad.

239
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:28,868
Gosh, that would be great. Thank you.

240
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,168
Are you okay with that, Mom?

241
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:37,435
Of course. You know your
father can't turn you down.

242
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:42,902
We will invite your husband
and your son to our house.

243
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,834
So we can discuss about
sponsoring Councilor Cha,

244
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,234
Also, Haekang and Joonyoung...

245
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,901
...will get to reconcile properly.

246
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,867
That's a good idea.

247
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,901
You're working really hard to take care...

248
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:00,502
...of your husband's ex-wife's son.

249
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:03,834
After seeing her coming
to Joonyoung's defense,

250
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:06,901
I have a whole new respect for Dakyung.

251
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,635
You are remarkable.

252
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:15,835
She's such a sweet, naive girl.

253
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:20,568
She said she had to step in
because the kid's not at fault.

254
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:24,735
He's Taeoh's son. That makes him my son.

255
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,201
No parent would give up on their child...

256
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,168
...just because he made a mistake.

257
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,400
Raising a child...

258
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:34,001
...is like creating the world.

259
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,068
If you think of him as
your husband's accessory,

260
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:38,834
it'll be challenging for you.

261
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,434
How far can you be responsible...

262
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:45,469
...for that boy's life?

263
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:49,735
I will do my best.

264
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:52,868
Just like I do for Jenny.

265
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:57,801
I can't dictate his future, but...

266
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,469
I'm confident enough to
silence those who judge us...

267
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:04,067
...for being a blended family.

268
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:07,967
That's right.

269
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:12,535
A woman should keep her family together.

270
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:16,734
You have a big heart, Dakyung.

271
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:19,335
I guess I was wrong about you.

272
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,402
I'm sorry to be late.

273
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:25,834
-Welcome.
- Welcome. Have a seat.

274
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:27,702
Let's eat something.

275
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,568
I have big news.

276
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,267
Dr. Ji...

277
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,034
...submitted her resignation.

278
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:34,901
Not only that,

279
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,333
rumor has it that she's leaving Gosan.

280
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:43,435
This definitely calls for
celebration, right Dakyung?

281
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,901
Congratulations, Madam.

282
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,434
Well...

283
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,868
It's not like I wanted that to happen...

284
00:22:51,901 --> 00:22:54,668
But I wouldn't say it's a bad news.

285
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:27,968
What did you do today?

286
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,068
I stayed home all day long.

287
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:32,500
What about cram school?

288
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:33,934
She'll get me a private tutor.

289
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:35,834
So I can't go outside.

290
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:42,600
I'm grounded, aren't I?

291
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,167
Okay.

292
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:47,835
I'll try talking to her.

293
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:15,868
You're home.

294
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:18,468
The gathering ended late.
Where's Joonyoung?

295
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,834
He just finished eating and went upstairs.

296
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:21,901
Okay.

297
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:26,082
He's on vacation now. Shall
we go on a family trip?

298
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,733
All four of us including Jenny.

299
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:28,901
Let's go somewhere nearby.

300
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,734
Sounds good.

301
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:34,066
By the way...

302
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:37,767
-About Joonyoung being grounded...
-Oh right.

303
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:41,800
I made an appointment for
Joonyoung's counseling.

304
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,234
-Counseling?
- Yes.

305
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,967
A juvenile psychology expert...

306
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:49,868
...known for treating behavior problems.

307
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:51,535
I had a hard time making an appointment.

308
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,901
Does he really need psychotherapy?

309
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,334
Kleptomania should be treated.

310
00:24:57,701 --> 00:25:00,368
-If it's left untreated...
- Are you saying he'll become a thief?

311
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:07,400
I meant we should be careful about it.

312
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:08,534
Can't we just...

313
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,735
...give him some time?

314
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:14,168
Give him some space to breathe.

315
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:17,235
We should trust him and wait.

316
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,834
What's so bad about getting
professional help?

317
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:24,835
I worked really hard to
find help for Joonyoung.

318
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:28,001
-I know that. But...
- Then support my decision.

319
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:32,634
Now is not the time to
get on your soapbox.

320
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:34,669
We should do what's best for Joonyoung.

321
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:38,901
Okay?

322
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:08,267
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:12,567
And thank you.

324
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:16,867
Do you want me...

325
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,168
...to take Joonyoung to
his counseling sessions?

326
00:26:27,901 --> 00:26:30,835
If Jenny causes trouble when she grows up,

327
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,201
I'll do the same thing.

328
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:41,901
One by one,

329
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,869
all the pieces are falling into place.

330
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:47,901
From now on we will be perfect.

331
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:05,934
Can I trust you?

332
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:25,934
Your brother's leaving.

333
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:28,402
Bye-bye.

334
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:31,702
Good girl.

335
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:59,502
Joonyoung, how was your week?

336
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,634
Have you felt angry or sad?

337
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:13,501
Yes.

338
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,102
What made you feel like that?

339
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,701
Can you tell me?

340
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:25,334
Yes?

341
00:28:27,701 --> 00:28:28,701
You're here.

342
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:19,567
Myungsook.

343
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:20,934
Hey.

344
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:24,268
(Ji Sunwoo)

345
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:25,901
You're here.

346
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:27,734
You got something here.

347
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,268
-Shall we?
- Okay.

348
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Thank you.

349
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:47,667
Eating spicy food really
blows off the steam.

350
00:30:50,534 --> 00:30:53,201
Where did she go? She won't
even answer my calls.

351
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:56,301
She probably went somewhere
to get some fresh air.

352
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:00,335
Maybe she feels anxious after
resigning all of a sudden.

353
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,867
Anxious about what?

354
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,068
She already had plans to leave.

355
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,901
I bet that guy's anxious.

356
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:10,734
Who?

357
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:13,367
You mean Lee Taeoh?

358
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:14,667
Yes.

359
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,634
That's how it looked like to me.

360
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,167
But it's all over between them.

361
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:22,901
You don't know men.

362
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:26,701
Even if they're taken, they can't
help but check out other women.

363
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,834
And they can't help but
think about their exes.

364
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:31,534
That's what men do.

365
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:42,834
But I'm not like that.

366
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,435
Not me.

367
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:47,801
Taeoh's like that.

368
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,901
That jerk.

369
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:03,901
Have you heard from your mom?

370
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,033
No.

371
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:08,101
Did you ignore her calls?

372
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:11,068
No.

373
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:34,200
Hello.

374
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:32,302
I've never heard from you after
I told you about a job opening.

375
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:33,835
What brings you here out of the blue?

376
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:37,901
To get some fresh air.

377
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:41,202
I resigned from the hospital.

378
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:44,668
Are you going to Busan?

379
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,335
Did you take their offer?

380
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,267
No.

381
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:55,502
I need to relax for a while.

382
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,768
Why did you come to me?

383
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:01,869
You had a decent psychiatrist near you.

384
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,200
It's time to make my round.

385
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:08,267
What do you want to do?

386
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:09,701
Go see your patients.

387
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:11,501
-I'm not leaving anytime soon.
- Okay.

388
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,734
We'll talk more later.

389
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:17,569
But no drinking, okay?

390
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,901
Did you really quit?

391
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Of course.

392
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:28,434
Go ahead.

393
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:29,501
Yes, Doctor.

394
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,201
That is spooky.

395
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:41,068
How did you know she'd come here?

396
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:42,901
That's good to know.

397
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:44,801
How is she?

398
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:47,068
She looks miserable, of course.

399
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,233
I think she wants to rest.

400
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,501
If you're so worried, you can come here.

401
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:55,168
I think she wants to be left alone.

402
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:58,201
I shouldn't disturb her.

403
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:00,667
Okay.

404
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,435
I'll give you a call if anything happens.

405
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:03,834
Pardon?

406
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:05,367
You want me...

407
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:07,068
...to be assistant director?

408
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,834
Why leave it vacant?

409
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,534
The chairman and I have made a decision.

410
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,901
Why? Are you not up to it?

411
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:18,078
If you're not up to it, I'll take it back.

412
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,001
Of course I'm up to it.

413
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:23,435
I can do this better than anyone.

414
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:27,168
Thank you...

415
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:29,568
...for your confidence, sir.

416
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:34,102
I convinced the chairman myself.

417
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:36,667
If you cause any problem,

418
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:38,769
I will go down too.

419
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:40,834
-Remember that.
- That will never happen.

420
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,101
I will do my best, sir.

421
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:44,901
By the way...

422
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,367
What about Dr. Ji?

423
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:53,166
What can I do? She resigned.

424
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,168
She's the face of our hospital.

425
00:36:55,267 --> 00:36:57,168
We can't post a job opening so soon.

426
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,568
Even the chairman was vexed.

427
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:02,068
He said there's no one better than her.

428
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:06,834
Let's wait a few days.

429
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:10,934
Your call cannot be reached.
Please leave a message after….

430
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,167
(Ji Sunwoo)

431
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:26,135
Father.

432
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:28,600
What brings you here?

433
00:37:28,701 --> 00:37:30,901
I was just passing by,
so I decided to visit.

434
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:33,968
About Family Love Hospital...

435
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:36,066
We're going to write the
donation agreement.

436
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,434
I want you to meet with Dr. Gong...

437
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,101
...and close the deal.

438
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:43,567
Yes, sir.

439
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:47,035
I thought it would take some time,

440
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,834
but it ended sooner than I thought.

441
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:53,668
Good job.

442
00:37:56,934 --> 00:37:59,067
No, you don't have to see me out.
Do your thing.

443
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Sunwoo?

444
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:11,402
She handed in her
resignation a few days ago.

445
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:13,534
So...

446
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,901
Where is she now?

447
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,901
I don't know.

448
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:22,668
Why do you want to know?

449
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,601
Hello?

450
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,433
Hello?

451
00:38:57,934 --> 00:38:59,001
What are you doing?

452
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,634
Is Sunwoo...

453
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,134
...not at home?

454
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:09,101
-Why do you ask?
- Do you know where she went?

455
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,101
Haven't you done enough?

456
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:13,335
You tormented her all those times.

457
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,567
And now you have Joonyoung too.

458
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:17,402
What more do you want?

459
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:19,301
You need to...

460
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,368
...let her go now.

461
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:36,701
Taeoh.

462
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,367
Did you hear what I said?

463
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:50,267
What?

464
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:53,966
We're having dinner with
Councilor Cha's family tomorrow.

465
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:55,567
My parents are coming too.

466
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,800
Oh right. You did.

467
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:02,535
My dad hates political patronage,

468
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,767
but he decided to do it
for you and Joonyoung.

469
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,033
So be nice to Councilor Cha.

470
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:09,901
I will.

471
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:12,668
I'll wash up.

472
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:14,234
Okay.

473
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,901
(You have 23 missed calls from Lee Taeoh)

474
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:27,568
(You have 23 missed calls from Lee Taeoh)

475
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:37,535
(Power Off)

476
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:48,802
How did I end up ruin everything
I worked so hard on?

477
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,267
My family...

478
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:55,702
My husband, son and everything else...

479
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,767
Everything I tried to protect...

480
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:05,368
...slipped through my fingers.

481
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
What does protect mean to you?

482
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:12,535
Obsession is toxic.

483
00:42:13,234 --> 00:42:15,601
Same thing applies to a
parent-child relationship.

484
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:20,668
I let go of my greed of wanting
to keep him by my side.

485
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:24,369
I've accepted the fact that he
wants to live with his dad.

486
00:42:28,434 --> 00:42:30,467
What I can't stand is...

487
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:35,068
...that my son hates me.

488
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:40,133
If only I can change the way he feels...

489
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,201
I would do anything.

490
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:50,202
There's no way, right?

491
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:54,901
Are you expecting him to
understand when you hurt him?

492
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,333
Don't you think you're being too greedy?

493
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,400
Whether it's hatred or resentment,

494
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:03,901
you should respect Joonyoung's feelings.

495
00:43:05,701 --> 00:43:06,901
After that,

496
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:10,235
time will fix things.

497
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:18,068
Did time solve things for you?

498
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,901
Pain is still pain even after time passes.

499
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,901
You know it yourself.

500
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:34,834
Life isn't always so sweet.

501
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:37,901
We just live to see another day.

502
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,935
Then one day, the sun will shine.

503
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,967
That is how time passes.

504
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,767
But I can't take it anymore.

505
00:43:51,901 --> 00:43:53,568
If I'm gone...

506
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:57,635
It'll make things easier for everyone.

507
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:02,968
For me and Joonyoung...

508
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:07,900
And Lee Taeoh.

509
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:49,134
I already apologized.

510
00:44:49,267 --> 00:44:51,768
Why do I have to be pals with him?

511
00:44:51,968 --> 00:44:53,836
This sucks.

512
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:56,086
You don't have to buddy up with him.

513
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:59,001
But you'll be seeing him at
school for another year.

514
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:03,635
Being on good terms wouldn't hurt.

515
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:13,101
It's just for today.

516
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:15,668
Try to be nice.

517
00:45:16,734 --> 00:45:19,134
Dakyung went out of her way
to arrange this for you.

518
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:51,835
We used samples of past forms,

519
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:54,668
and drew a draft version.

520

(Medical Information System
Sponsorship Agreement)

521
00:45:56,901 --> 00:46:02,235
At first, I thought you
were asking too much.

522
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:06,702
It turns out you were one
step ahead all along.

523
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:10,734
Dr. Ji has had a lot of problems lately.

524
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:13,901
If she was still associate director,

525
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,901
the hospital would be in trouble.

526
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
What about the agreement ceremony?

527
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,035
I'm sure you have it all planned out.

528
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,200
I'm not sure.

529
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:26,701
I don't have a plan yet.

530
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:29,735
We're just a small community hospital,

531
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:33,001
but T.O Pictures is recognized nationwide.

532
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:35,634
You need to pay attention
to the publicity articles.

533
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,168
If you make a cool video and send
it to a local broadcasting station,

534
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:43,368
it will benefit both sides.

535
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:44,834
I'll leave that...

536
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:47,768
...to the PR team.

537
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:49,367
I'm sure you're busy.

538
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:51,433
I'll get going now.

539
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:54,001
Sure. You should go.

540
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,467
(Doctor Ji Sunwoo)

541
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:44,067
Sunwoo...

542
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:46,467
Where are you right now?

543
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:49,734
Are you okay?

544
00:47:52,801 --> 00:47:54,001
The lady guest from yesterday?

545
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:55,869
That's strange.

546
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:57,535
She paid upfront for a few nights stay.

547
00:47:57,601 --> 00:47:58,835
But she left at dawn.

548
00:47:58,901 --> 00:47:59,901
At dawn?

549
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:02,235
-What time?
- I'm not sure.

550
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:04,101
Around 6:00 AM?

551
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:06,435
Maybe she went to see the sunrise.

552
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:08,767
What's the matter?

553
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,734
Is something wrong?

554
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:12,001
Nothing.

555
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:13,467
Thank you.

556
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,934
Your call cannot be reached.
Please leave….

557
00:48:30,901 --> 00:48:33,101
But I can't take it anymore.

558
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:36,335
lf I'm gone...

559
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,535
lt'll make things easier for everyone.

560
00:48:53,067 --> 00:48:54,067
How's Sunwoo?

561
00:48:55,067 --> 00:48:56,134
Is she doing okay?

562
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:59,634
Your tone is very odd.

563
00:49:00,434 --> 00:49:01,434
What is it?

564
00:49:01,534 --> 00:49:04,534
Do you feel bad now that she's left?

565
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:07,834
Do you know where she is right now?

566
00:49:09,901 --> 00:49:12,402
I have a general idea.

567
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:14,267
Why?

568
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:16,468
-Do you want to know?
- No.

569
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:18,868
I just wanted to know if she's okay.

570
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,701
Is there something going
on between you two?

571
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,234
She looked troubled after
what happened with Joonyoung.

572
00:49:29,601 --> 00:49:31,001
She did say she was going to leave town,

573
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:34,068
but now that she resigned and
disappeared all of a sudden...

574
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:36,168
I'm starting to get worried.

575
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I was wondering...

576
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:41,968
...if something happened to her.

577
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,301
Maybe I'm overthinking.

578
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,001
Dr. Ji disappeared?

579
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:58,901
I hope I'm mistaken.

580
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:02,168
But she was showing some strange signs.

581
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:03,868
Maybe something happened to her.

582
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,434
I have a bad feeling about this.

583
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:07,868
What should I do, Dr. Kim?

584
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:24,901
Please cancel the remaining appointments.

585
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,901
-Pardon?
- I'm sorry. It's urgent.

586
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:29,001
Please explain everything to the patients.

587
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,667
Let them know that I'll call them later.

588
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,167
What is it, Dr. Kim?

589
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:36,567
I just got of the phone with Dr. Ma.
He said Dr. Ji...

590
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,901
Did something happen to Sunwoo?

591
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:51,234
Where is she right now?

592
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:04,934
Where is she?

593
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:08,502
-Taeoh.
- Where's Sunwoo?

594
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,200
(Dr. Ma)

595
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,734
I don't see her.

596
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:49,502
I don't know if that's a good thing.

597
00:52:49,868 --> 00:52:51,535
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

598
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:54,701
I'll keep searching.

599
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,300
Dr. Ji!

600
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:41,435
Dr. Ji!

601
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:49,734
Sunwoo!

602
00:56:57,601 --> 00:56:59,768
Sunwoo!

603
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,668
Goodness, how could they
leave their child behind?

604
00:57:20,901 --> 00:57:23,535
lt's so tragic.

605
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:27,034
That little girl is all alone now.
Because of the accident.

606
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:31,500
Their family turned upside down
when her husband had an affair.

607
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:32,900
lt wasn't an accident.

608
00:57:33,234 --> 00:57:34,868
I'm telling you, it was suicide.

609
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:37,168
She committed suicide because
her husband cheated on her?

610
00:57:37,234 --> 00:57:38,835
I understand how she felt,
but that's not right.

611
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:42,001
That's why she took him with her.

612
00:57:42,901 --> 00:57:44,402
Unbelievable.

613
00:57:44,734 --> 00:57:46,834
Still, how could she abandon
her child like that?

614
00:57:46,901 --> 00:57:51,068
How could a parent leave
her child behind like this?

615
00:58:39,901 --> 00:58:40,934
Sunwoo.

616
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:02,567
Sunwoo.

617
01:00:08,267 --> 01:00:09,400
Sunwoo!

618
01:00:09,901 --> 01:00:11,435
Wake up!

619
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:12,901
Sunwoo!

620
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,101
Wake up!

621
01:00:17,901 --> 01:00:18,901
Sunwoo...!

622
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:20,567
Are you okay?

623
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:22,834
Okay.

624
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,133
You're okay.

625
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:34,501
Are you okay?

626
01:00:44,234 --> 01:00:45,234
Just cry.

627
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:46,767
Cry all you want.

628
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:20,034
Just let it all out.

629
01:02:05,901 --> 01:02:09,901
Taeoh's son started seeing a psychiatrist.

630
01:02:10,434 --> 01:02:13,968
But I don't know if therapy would work.

631
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,233
Dakyung is doing what she can.

632
01:02:16,367 --> 01:02:18,268
We should show our support.

633
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,034
Right. We should.

634
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:24,701
At first, I couldn't understand
why she insisted to raise him.

635
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:27,335
But seeing how that made
Ji Sunwoo stand down,

636
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,835
maybe Dakyung did the right thing.

637
01:02:29,901 --> 01:02:34,769
When I see her struggling to
raise the ex-wife's son...

638
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,801
I feel like screaming.

639
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:42,201
I'm not sure if this is a good thing...

640
01:02:42,701 --> 01:02:44,602
...or a bad thing.

641
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:46,600
We're going to be late.

642
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:48,901
Let's go.

643
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:10,768
Is everything ready?

644
01:03:10,901 --> 01:03:11,901
Yes, ma'am.

645
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:33,701
Hey, you're here on time.

646
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:38,135
We still have time, right?

647
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:41,467
I'm going to wash up.

648
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,968
I picked out your outfit for tonight.
Put them on.

649
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:09,402
Are you ready, Joonyoung?

650
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:16,968
My parents are very nice.

651
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:18,968
Don't be so nervous.

652
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:24,335
Be polite in front of the adults, okay?

653
01:04:28,901 --> 01:04:29,901
Joonyoung.

654
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,968
We're a real family now.

655
01:04:34,734 --> 01:04:36,368
Do you get what I mean?

656
01:05:14,901 --> 01:05:16,702
-Help yourselves.
- Thank you.

657
01:05:16,901 --> 01:05:19,968
Did you prepare all this, Dakyung?

658
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:21,300
It was nothing.

659
01:05:23,267 --> 01:05:25,467
Lee Joonyoung, Cha Haekang.

660
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:29,634
You know the saying, fighting
is a part of growing up?

661
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:31,034
That's a lie.

662
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:34,300
You have to heal the rift after you fight.

663
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,600
Only then, you'll grow
tall like your dads.

664
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:39,834
Right you are, sir.

665
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:44,335
Boys become better friends
after they had a fight.

666
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,134
Thank you for your wise words, Mr. Yeo.

667
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:51,667
Thank you for treating us with
this wonderful food, Mr. Yeo.

668
01:05:51,734 --> 01:05:52,767
Thank you, sir.

669
01:05:52,834 --> 01:05:55,568
Then, let's drink to
these boys' friendship.

670
01:05:55,634 --> 01:05:57,634
-Let's raise our glasses.
- Sure.

671
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:01,701
Here's to Lee Joonyoung and
Cha Haekang's friendship.

672
01:06:01,868 --> 01:06:03,836
-Cheers.
- Cheers.

673
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:09,668
Madam, the wine is delicious.

674
01:06:09,734 --> 01:06:10,734
Isn't it nice?

675
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:15,635
Speaking of wines, a new wine bar
opened in the new shopping center.

676
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,402
-Really?
- Yes, there is.

677
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:20,868
My friend Sanghyun is the chairman
of the Merchant Association.

678
01:06:20,901 --> 01:06:24,568
He opened a wine bar.
I'll take you there sometime.

679
01:06:28,334 --> 01:06:33,202
I'm not sure if I should thank
my friend or my son for this.

680
01:06:33,267 --> 01:06:37,667
It is an honor to have the
lead sponsor of Gosan, sir.

681
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:42,335
You can thank both your
friend and your son.

682
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:45,001
Now that I got your back,

683
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,368
you'd better win the
election, Councilor Cha.

684
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:49,768
Thank you.

685
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:52,801
I'll do my best!

686
01:06:53,367 --> 01:06:54,901
Thank you.

687
01:06:59,701 --> 01:07:01,569
How's the ground breaking
ceremony coming up?

688
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:02,834
It's going well.

689
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:05,602
That's the construction crew's job.

690
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:07,067
When's your next movie coming out?

691
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:09,434
You need to make another box office hit.

692
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:10,800
I'm working on it.

693
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:17,134
That's strange.

694
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,901
The maid is supposed to look after her.

695
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,035
Excuse me.

696
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,567
Are you okay?

697
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:54,101
What have you done?

698
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,968
I'm sorry, ma'am.

699
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:08,801
-I left the room for a minute.
- Take her.

700
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:14,869
Did you do something to Jenny?

701
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,801
I didn't do anything.

702
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:19,700
-She was playing alone...
-Did you hit her?

703
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:32,367
I've done everything for you.

704
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:36,901
I gave you all of this.
What more do you want?

705
01:08:37,634 --> 01:08:40,201
Why couldn't you behave just for one day?

706
01:08:40,434 --> 01:08:43,901
-What is your problem?
- What did I do?

707
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:46,801
-Joonyoung, stop it.
-I didn't do anything.

708
01:08:46,901 --> 01:08:48,835
She fell down by herself.
What was I supposed to do?

709
01:08:48,901 --> 01:08:50,735
Why are you blaming me?

710
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,601
We have guests in the house. Stop it.

711
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:56,101
Until when do I have to
tolerate your behavior?

712
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,867
When will you have had enough?

713
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,901
I never asked you for anything!

714
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:03,901
Taeoh...

715
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:13,634
Please...

716
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,168
Look after him.

717
01:09:17,234 --> 01:09:18,868
So he doesn't...

718
01:09:20,067 --> 01:09:21,534
...get hurt anymore.

719
01:09:23,767 --> 01:09:24,934
That's all...

720
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:27,034
...I want.

721
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,567
You punk.

722
01:09:34,534 --> 01:09:35,901
Get your act together.

723
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:39,735
Why do you make it difficult for everyone?

724
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,934
How much do we have to suffer?

725
01:09:54,834 --> 01:09:55,901
What's going on...?

726
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:00,901
Please...

727
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:03,134
...enjoy your meals.

728
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,100
Taeoh.

729
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:28,167
Mom...

730
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:36,900
Mom...

731
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,901
(Mom)

732
01:12:25,934 --> 01:12:27,001
Joonyoung.

733
01:12:30,701 --> 01:12:31,834
It's me.

734
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:40,101
Are you there?

735
01:12:50,067 --> 01:12:51,467
What's wrong?

736
01:12:56,734 --> 01:12:57,734
Mom...

737
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:04,735
I'm really sorry, but...

738
01:13:07,367 --> 01:13:09,268
Can you come pick me up?

739
01:13:28,267 --> 01:13:29,267
Dr. Ji.

740
01:13:35,334 --> 01:13:38,035
I told you so.

741
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,934
You can't just accept
someone else's child.

742
01:13:43,033 --> 01:13:45,700
Why waste all that effort and time?

743
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:49,901
Dakyung.

744
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:53,901
What are you so...

745
01:13:55,601 --> 01:13:57,135
...nervous about?

746
01:14:50,901 --> 01:14:51,901
Madam.

747
01:14:58,734 --> 01:14:59,734
Dear lord.

748
01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:02,868
Is this woman crazy?
How dare she show up here.

749
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,934
Wait, didn't she leave Gosan?

750
01:15:17,734 --> 01:15:18,801
No.

751
01:15:18,868 --> 01:15:20,868
Don't talk to her. Just make her leave.

752
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:27,901
(Call)

753
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:29,835
What do you want?

754
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,801
I'm here to pick up Joonyoung.

755
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,600
Why so suddenly?

756
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:39,734
I didn't hear anything from Taeoh.

757
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:53,168
Joonyoung, come on out.

758
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:08,734
Lee Joonyoung.

759
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:10,901
Stop right there, Lee Joonyoung!

760
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:15,702
Go to your room right now.

761
01:16:18,501 --> 01:16:20,202
Go to your room!

762
01:16:29,767 --> 01:16:30,900
Dakyung, don't.

763
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:32,834
Let go of me.

764
01:16:32,901 --> 01:16:34,402
Let the kid go!

765
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:37,402
Dad, you can't let him leave.

766
01:16:37,501 --> 01:16:38,966
I have to stop that crazy woman.

767
01:16:39,033 --> 01:16:41,800
-Let him go!
- Let go of me!

768
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:45,868
I did everything I could!

769
01:16:46,534 --> 01:16:48,268
Do you know how hard I've tried?

770
01:16:49,634 --> 01:16:51,801
-You know it too.
- I do.

771
01:16:53,834 --> 01:16:55,001
I was so close.

772
01:16:55,701 --> 01:16:57,734
I can't let that woman ruin it!

773
01:16:57,834 --> 01:16:58,901
Yeo Dakyung!

774
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,200
I'm sorry.

775
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:24,568
I'm late, aren't I?

776
01:17:25,501 --> 01:17:27,534
Mom, let's get out of here.

777
01:17:27,734 --> 01:17:28,901
Okay, let's go.

778
01:17:32,067 --> 01:17:33,834
Don't you move!

779
01:17:36,067 --> 01:17:37,534
Get in the car.

780
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:53,634
What's the problem?

781
01:17:55,067 --> 01:17:56,901
Isn't it better for you if Joonyoung...

782
01:17:57,167 --> 01:17:58,768
...stays with me?

783
01:17:58,901 --> 01:18:00,602
Does Taeoh know about this?

784
01:18:00,701 --> 01:18:02,268
I can take Joonyoung back anytime...

785
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:04,302
...if he wants to.

786
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:07,168
We already agreed on that.

787
01:18:07,501 --> 01:18:09,302
It's your obsession!

788
01:18:12,267 --> 01:18:14,901
It's destroying Joonyoung.

789
01:18:18,701 --> 01:18:23,335
Stop confusing him. He was
starting to show improvement!

790
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,134
Instead of staying with his
insecure, obsessive mom,

791
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,835
it's better for him to
stay with a normal family.

792
01:18:30,901 --> 01:18:33,201
Can't you think it through rationally?

793
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,901
Why are you so obsessed with Joonyoung?

794
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,533
It's for his own sake.

795
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:52,567
Even I'm tired of watching
you two fight over him.

796
01:18:55,067 --> 01:18:56,901
Imagine how Joonyoung feels.

797
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,534
Not only that,

798
01:19:01,267 --> 01:19:02,968
you're not normal.

799
01:19:04,767 --> 01:19:06,800
Are you sure you can provide
a stable environment?

800
01:19:06,901 --> 01:19:09,235
I'm the one who stopped
the committee hearing.

801
01:19:10,901 --> 01:19:11,901
Am I wrong?

802
01:19:15,868 --> 01:19:17,402
Let's be honest here.

803
01:19:19,501 --> 01:19:20,968
It wasn't for Joonyoung's sake.

804
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,234
You were trying to protect
your marriage and family.

805
01:19:25,234 --> 01:19:27,601
Taeoh looked like he was
having second thoughts.

806
01:19:28,901 --> 01:19:30,335
That made you nervous.

807
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,134
I know you want to protect your
marriage by any means necessary.

808
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:40,835
I was like that once.

809
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:46,068
But you know what?

810
01:19:47,601 --> 01:19:50,901
Feeling desperate and anxious...

811
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,901
It's pointless.

812
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:59,535
That's what being a married
couple is all about.

813
01:20:03,334 --> 01:20:05,634
It can be shaken, flipped over...

814
01:20:06,901 --> 01:20:09,901
...or fall apart over
something so trivial.

815
01:20:11,901 --> 01:20:12,901
Not me.

816
01:20:16,601 --> 01:20:18,068
My marriage is different.

817
01:20:21,267 --> 01:20:22,901
You know it better than I do.

818
01:20:23,601 --> 01:20:24,901
You were the other woman once.

819
01:20:27,534 --> 01:20:28,868
What are you talking about?

820
01:20:29,901 --> 01:20:30,901
Lee Taeoh...

821
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:34,667
He slept with me.

822
01:21:24,434 --> 01:21:26,935
(The World of the Married)

823
01:21:27,534 --> 01:21:28,934
Can we just leave...

824
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,801
...to a place where no one will know?

825
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:33,901
Taeoh won't forget Sunwoo that easily.

826
01:21:33,934 --> 01:21:35,967
What do you mean?

827
01:21:36,067 --> 01:21:37,901
Think carefully.

828
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:40,067
This could be your last chance...

829
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:41,835
...to get away from him.

830
01:21:41,901 --> 01:21:44,702
You said we should forget about it!
Are you still hung up on me?

831
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:48,601
Look at all the things you've
done before you blame others!

832
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:50,468
I wanted only one thing from you.

833
01:21:50,567 --> 01:21:52,967
