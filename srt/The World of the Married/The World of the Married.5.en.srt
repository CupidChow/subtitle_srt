3
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,168
I, Lee Taeoh,

4
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:03,569
swear to love and respect Ji Sunwoo...

5
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:05,735
...for the rest of my life.

6
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:19,735
I will be truthful whatever
the circumstances.

7
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:23,301
I will be truthful whatever
the circumstances.

8
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,501
Sunwoo,

9
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,101
you're the only woman in my life.

10
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:30,634
Don't you know that?

11
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:34,434
Please don't lie to me.

12
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,767
And I will forever be truthful to you.

13
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:42,168
And I will forever be truthful to you.

14
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:46,801
I swear.

15
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:49,901
I swear.

16
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:57,101
Forever.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
Eternity.

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,567
All those words were meaningless.

19
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,934
Dakyung, please pick up the call.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,901
Is this really the way
we are going to end?

21
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:19,435
Can we please meet up and talk?

22
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,634
Pledge.

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,533
Respect.

24
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:28,334
Love.

25
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,434
Whatever we were trying to protect,

26
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:35,667
there's...

27
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:39,701
...absolutely nothing left...

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,267
...between us now.

00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:56,567
(From: Buzzhill Hotel,
To: Sinwon-ro, Nam-gu, Gosan City)

31
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:19,934
What time you got home?

32
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,334
At dawn.

33
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:24,667
We hadn't met in a long time,

34
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:26,634
so we had a lot to talk about.

35
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,034
Was there a place that
was opened until late night?

36
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,035
After the seminar,

37
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,035
we got a hotel room and drank there.

38
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,101
Joonyoung, let's go.

39
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,935
I'll drive you to school today.

40
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,434
Is this Buzzhill Hotel?

41
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:26,967
(Episode 5)

42
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,267
We look forward to working with you.

43
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,934
I look forward to the same.

44
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,068
I heard you're very competent.

45
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:36,267
We opened a new department,
and we're very excited about it.

46
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:45,834
There she is.

47
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,168
She's our Assistant Director.

48
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:52,134
I told you about him last time.

49
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,801
He's our newest psychiatrist.

50
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,602
I'm Kim Yoonki.
I've heard a lot about you.

51
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,602
I'm Ji Sunwoo. Welcome to our hospital.

52
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:12,135
Tomorrow is his first day at work.

53
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,500
He'll be using Dr. Ma's old office.

54
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:16,935
Oh, I see.

55
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,667
Dr. Kim, let's have some
tea before you leave.

56
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:20,867
-Sure.
-Okay.

57
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,635
What do you think of Dr. Kim Yoonki?

58
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,967
Isn't he handsome?

59
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,001
He's divorced and single, with no kids.

60
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,968
If you like him so much,
why don't you give it a shot?

61
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,167
Should I?

62
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,967
Are you still mad at me?

63
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,601
Why would I be?

64
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:15,735
Hey, what's up?

65
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:18,901
Is Sunwoo at work?

66
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,767
Of course, she is.

67
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:23,001
Have you noticed...

68
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,001
...something strange or
different about her lately?

69
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,135
What happened now?

70
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:35,468
Didn't you reconcile after you
sent her that flower basket?

71
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:39,734
Flower basket?

72
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,033
Me?

73
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:50,235
I don't understand any of this,

74
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,068
so explain it to me in simple terms.

75
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,267
Simply put,

76
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:57,335
T.O Entertainment is just a name.

77
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,268
They're behind several months on rent.

78
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,601
He didn't even pay the
workers last month.

79
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,834
How could there be no income?

80
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,335
They've been busy with event planning.

81
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,801
What's the point, when expenses
are higher than revenues?

82
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Lee Taeoh...

83
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,068
...can't even calculate
simple profit and loss.

84
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:20,968
They're about to go bankrupt.

85
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:23,701
He said he had an investor.

86
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,001
He met with a Chinese buyer too.

87
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,334
Was that all a lie?

88
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:34,202
The Chinese buyer fell through long ago.

89
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,201
He seems to be talking
to a potential investor,

90
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,800
but it hasn't been confirmed.

91
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,868
He's pretty much waiting for a miracle.

92
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:49,968
What about Lee Taeoh's personal account?

93
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:52,334
Did you check?

94
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,368
Does he not have one?

95
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:05,602
This is the most I can do legally.

96
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,334
I can't access his personal
accounts without proper cause.

97
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,301
Even the bank president
wouldn't be able to.

98
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:23,068
So?

99
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:25,834
You couldn't find out?

100
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:27,801
If you'd give me some time...

101
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,035
However,

102
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,335
as the risk is high, so is the return.

103
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:39,001
This needs to be a two-way street.

104
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:54,101
Forget it.

105
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,368
I assume,

106
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,901
this is your limit.

107
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,035
Do you really not need me?

108
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,533
Tomorrow night.

109
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:19,967
I'll wait at the same place.

110
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:10,800
Do you want a drink?

111
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:15,568
Was someone here?

112
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,235
A close client.

113
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,035
What's up? You didn't
say you were coming.

114
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,900
You said you were doing
another all-nighter,

115
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,501
so I brought you a clean
underwear and a shirt...

116
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,968
I thought you were very busy.

117
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:36,834
I was taking a break.

118
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:40,200
It's been a while since you came.

119
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:41,634
Let's have dinner together.

120
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,534
What's wrong?

121
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,368
I went to the hospital this afternoon.

122
00:14:57,868 --> 00:15:00,135
-Are you sick?
-I went to see the gynae.

123
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,268
I'm fine.

124
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:03,869
You made me worried.

125
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,102
Did you go for a checkup?

126
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:08,301
I want to have kids.

127
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,901
-If you're bored, just raise a dog.
-Cooperate with me.

128
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,002
You didn't want kids, so I obliged.

129
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:20,600
It's your turn to work with me.

130
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,034
We finished discussing that already.

131
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:30,934
Are we really a husband and wife?

132
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:39,935
Think it over.

133
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:42,901
I'm not just saying things
for the sake of it.

134
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:46,534
(Incorrect password)

135
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:44,834
Sorry.

136
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,201
I looked at your phone.

137
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,567
Why?

138
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:54,435
I was thinking of getting a new phone.

139
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:11,534
Do you want to see it?

140
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,068
No.

141
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:17,535
I wanted to see how heavy
it was, that's all.

142
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,268
(Messages)

143
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,735
I have obtained what you asked for.

144
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:01,668
(Dakyung, please pick up.
Is it really over? Let's meet.)

145
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:16,601
(Dakyung, please pick up.
Is it really over? Let's meet.)

146
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:53,768
-Good morning.
-Hello.

147
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:59,835
Did you not get enough sleep?
Your eyebags are visible.

148
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,133
I'm a working mom which means it's
impossible to get enough sleep.

149
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,734
Being a superwoman can be dangerous.

150
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,667
You need to stop being a
perfectionist to be happy.

151
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,033
Dr. Kim!

152
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,268
Dr. Ji.

153
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,800
There's something I promised
Dr. Kong when I transferred here.

154
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,467
I promised him I'll be in charge
of his staff's mental health.

155
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,667
I'll provide free consultation...

156
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,801
...whether it's stress from
work or from daily life.

157
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:50,302
That's why I spoke to you like that.

158
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:52,168
If it offended you, please forgive me.

159
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,001
I see. I understand.

160
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:05,568
Hello.

161
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,167
Hello.

162
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,401
(Go Yerim)

163
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:47,467
Actually,

164
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:50,501
I really want a baby.

165
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:55,334
But Jehyuk's strongly against it...

166
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:58,101
...and I don't know what to do.

167
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,267
If it's about that,

168
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,268
you should talk to Dr. Sul.

169
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:12,967
I don't think...

170
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,901
...she'll understand me
since she's not married.

171
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,434
It's a sensitive matter
for married couples.

172
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:22,701
I...

173
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:27,601
don't have anyone else
to talk about this...

174
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,067
...aside from you.

175
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:37,835
I'm thankful you think of me that way,

176
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:40,402
but...

177
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,768
...I wonder why Jehyuk is so against it.

178
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,468
How is his relationship with his parents?

179
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:52,535
His parents are ordinary people.

180
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,934
They don't really meddle in our business.

181
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:57,602
Why don't you get a
couple's consultation?

182
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,501
Our hospital recently
got a new psychiatrist.

183
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,101
He'll be against that for sure.

184
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,067
He won't listen to me.

185
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:11,402
It's not something that can be forced.

186
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:15,700
I hope you two can find a middle ground.

187
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,368
I'm sorry. I'm not really helpful.

188
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:26,135
How are things with you?

189
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,335
Are things good between you and Lee Taeoh?

190
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:40,502
Every couple has problems.

191
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,301
We're not any different.

192
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,834
That's the way it is with most couples.

193
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Right.

194
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,168
Didn't you see me yesterday?

195
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:01,767
I went to Jehyuk's office.

196
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:05,902
I think I saw you while leaving.

197
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,534
I did. I saw you too.

198
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:16,334
Aren't you curious why I went there?

199
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:24,367
Jehyuk...

200
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,268
...is a great financial advisor.

201
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:37,567
Sorry, I took too much of
your time when you're busy.

202
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,601
If anything happens which
you should know about,

203
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,700
I'll tell you everything.

204
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:51,701
I have to go now.

205
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:13,935
Let's meet at 8pm. I'll wait for you.

206
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,567
Gosh.

207
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:21,869
Get out! Get out right now!

208
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:26,834
Hyunseo.

209
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:31,001
You promised to stop taking these pills.

210
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:35,001
Don't you know who made me take it?

211
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,435
I had stopped taking them.

212
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:41,567
I don't need these if you're not here!

213
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,600
It's because of the pills, isn't it?

214
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,934
I was wondering how that
doctor convinced you.

215
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,500
It was these pills.

216
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:14,235
You're crazy.

217
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:18,601
What are you thinking?

218
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:22,367
Wait.

219
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,200
No.

220
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,568
It's not like that.

221
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:35,134
I didn't say anything.

222
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:56,200
(Messages)

223
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,901
Let's meet at 8pm. I'll wait for you.

224
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,300
Darn it.

225
00:29:13,734 --> 00:29:14,901
Yes, I know.

226
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:18,467
My goodness, Dr. Ji.

227
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:22,068
-I'll see you girls next time.
-Okay, bye.

228
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:25,901
-Hello.
-Hi.

229
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,168
What brings you here?

230
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:29,634
I came to meet my friends from school,

231
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,435
and we had a lot to catch up on.

232
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:32,801
What about you?

233
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:35,569
Well, I'm also here to meet someone.

234
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:37,968
My goodness, what a coincidence.

235
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,268
You and I must have a
really strong connection.

236
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:43,669
We ran into each other
before at the restaurant.

237
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:45,534
And we meet again in Seoul.

238
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,268
I know, right?

239
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:50,401
-I need to go now.
-Okay, go ahead.

240
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:51,600
Dr. Ji.

241
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:56,001
I'd like to invite you
over to our house one day.

242
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,368
-Sorry?
-You let us join you for dinner,

243
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,434
and I'd like to return the favor,

244
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,501
so you should come over with your husband.

245
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:06,934
Does that sound good?

246
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,302
Yes.

247
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:11,769
I'll see you soon. Goodbye then.

248
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:27,602
My husband seems a little suspicious.

249
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:32,367
Do you think he knows that
you're preparing for divorce?

250
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:35,135
He keeps trying to unlock my cell phone.

251
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:36,535
I'm worried...

252
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,302
...that he might be onto something.

253
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:47,402
Try to buy some more time.
Maybe 2 to 3 weeks.

254
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,001
-2 to 3 weeks?
-Yes.

255
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,468
Before you proceed with
the division of property,

256
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:55,567
you can file for provisional
disposition and seizure.

257
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:58,168
That's going to take about 2
to 3 weeks for the court...

258
00:30:58,701 --> 00:31:00,001
...to revise and approve.

259
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:03,868
The notice will go to your
husband after 2 to 3 months.

260
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:08,434
I'll try my best.

261
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,867
Although I'm not sure
how much money he has.

262
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,868
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to...

263
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:48,469
You're home.

264
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:54,201
You're late.

265
00:31:57,934 --> 00:31:58,802
Yes.

266
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,634
Jehyuk, what are you doing here?

267
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:08,067
I came to talk to Lee Taeoh.

268
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:13,635
Just a second.

269
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:15,769
Hello?

270
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:18,468
Hey.

271
00:32:19,634 --> 00:32:20,568
Yes.

272
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:44,768
What are you doing?

273
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:47,001
Why didn't you show up? I waited for you.

274
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,867
I never said I'll be there.

275
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:56,068
Lee Taeoh doesn't know...

276
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:58,434
...that you're getting ready to
file for divorce, does he?

277
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,534
Or maybe he noticed something.

278
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:04,901
Do you want me to ask?

279
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:08,501
Don't worry.

280
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:10,967
I haven't told him anything yet.

281
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,400
Do you really think you
can blackmail me with that?

282
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:27,268
I don't want to define
it as blackmailing.

283
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,901
We had a lot of fun that night.

284
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:34,067
Don't you agree?

285
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,034
220 million won.

286
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:48,635
Lee Taeoh wired some money
to his slush fund account.

287
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:53,201
And he also received 100 million won...

288
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:56,235
...for his mother's death benefit.

289
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,268
In total, he has 320 million won.

290
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:00,702
What do you think?

291
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,735
Isn't this a pretty good deal?

292
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,201
I'll deal with it with my lawyer.

293
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:13,735
You can stay out of it.

294
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,234
Doesn't that take a few months?

295
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,800
And you'll even have to
divide that money with him.

296
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,967
I can easily help you
get every single penny.

297
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:26,767
But I also have the
ability to ruin everything.

298
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:46,834
I'll leave you guys to talk.

299
00:34:56,968 --> 00:34:58,968
-Would you like some beer?
-Sounds good.

300
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,202
In total, he has 320 million won.

301
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,434
I can easily help you
get every single penny.

302
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:28,301
But I also have the
ability to ruin everything.

303
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,134
What do you want?

304
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:55,802
Aren't you going to bed?

305
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:00,734
Has Jehyuk left?

306
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:02,834
Yes, just now.

307
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:05,168
What did you guys talk about?

308
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:08,634
Just...

309
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,334
About life.

310
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:23,568
You should go to bed without me.
I still have some work to do.

311
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:27,202
You're always late these days.
Are you busy?

312
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:29,068
I have a lot of work.

313
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,535
Why were you late today?

314
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:37,268
Do I need to tell you everything?

315
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:42,868
Just act like the usual.

316
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:46,502
You never really cared about my work.

317
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:50,667
Please be more attentive to Joonyoung.

318
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:04,834
Be honest with me.

319
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:09,467
You want to kill your husband, don't you?

320
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,901
It'd be boring to just get a divorce.

321
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,467
You should get your revenge first.

322
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:22,767
Don't you agree?

323
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:29,101
Mr. Ha Dongshik.

324
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,567
Just give me the word.

325
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,767
I'm more than willing to help.

326
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,734
Thank you for what you did.

327
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,134
But you can take your mind off it now.

328
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,034
This is regarding my family,
I'll take care of it on my own.

329
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,300
-So please just...
-Why would you ignore my goodwill?

330
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,101
No, I'm not ignoring your goodwill.

331
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:03,667
-I'm just trying to draw a line.
-Why?

332
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:05,835
Why would you ignore me?

333
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:10,001
I helped you.

334
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:12,435
I can take care of it for you.

335
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:13,867
Mr. Ha Dongshik!

336
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:16,601
Calm down.

337
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:22,335
This is so upsetting!

338
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,267
This is between us.

339
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,268
It's between us.

340
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:36,901
It's between you and me, okay?

341
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:44,736
Let me go! Who are you?

342
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,600
Let me go!

343
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:54,101
Let go!

344
00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:56,601
You can't do this to me.

345
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,300
You'll regret doing this to me!

346
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:01,034
Let go!

347
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,500
Are you hurt?

348
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,101
Dr. Ji? Careful.

349
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,001
Be careful. Are you okay?

350
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:15,301
I'm not just a patient!

351
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,300
We're more than that!

352
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:20,400
We're on the same side!

353
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,367
Don't do this.

354
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,101
Dr. Ji? Get it together.

355
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:39,068
Dr. Ji.

356
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,234
He saw...

357
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,600
...internal medicine doctors and
dermatologists in the area,

358
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:54,068
and started coming to
me about a year ago.

359
00:39:57,934 --> 00:39:59,868
He seemed to have
obsessive-compulsive disorder,

360
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,201
so I recommended him
to see a psychiatrist.

361
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,001
He won't listen, right?

362
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,467
He thinks you're the only
person who understands him.

363
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,967
It seemed it was progressing well.

364
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:21,200
Did you not notice at all?

365
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,767
It's the first time he got violent.

366
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:29,367
I'm shocked.

367
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,201
It's not impossible for
patients to become hostile...

368
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:41,868
...toward a doctor, but...

369
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,801
..did something happen that
could have triggered it?

370
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:51,634
It's not unprecedented.

371
00:40:58,234 --> 00:41:00,334
You're being too presumptuous.

372
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:04,034
I'm always strictly
professional with my patients.

373
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:09,134
Please watch what you say. You
don't know anything about me.

374
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,634
Thank you for the tea.

375
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:14,600
Did you hyperventilate in the past too?

376
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:19,901
Have you ever hurt yourself?

377
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,501
That's absurd.

378
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:31,467
Did you ever suffer...

379
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:35,968
...from post-traumatic stress
disorder that you never got treated?

380
00:42:53,234 --> 00:42:55,735
So? Shall we talk here?

381
00:42:56,934 --> 00:42:59,334
We can go somewhere else too.

382
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:18,835
I'm a bit impatient.

383
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:21,701
Either throw away what you have...

384
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,802
...or give it to someone else.
I don't care.

385
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:26,601
Don't bother me again.

386
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:29,934
I'll report you for blackmail.

387
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,234
Goodness.

388
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,867
You must love the law.

389
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:40,001
Fine. I'll just follow the law too.

390
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:45,367
You prescribed meds for Hyunseo
and made her follow your husband.

391
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:48,133
Can a doctor do that?

392
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,434
If they find out you threatened
to send a healthy person...

393
00:43:53,534 --> 00:43:55,001
...to a mental hospital on top of that,

394
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,167
what will happen to you?

395
00:43:58,667 --> 00:43:59,700
Dr. Ji Sunwoo.

396
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:05,235
What happened to the gutsy doctor...

397
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,402
...who bragged about her connections...

398
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:08,934
...and threatened to forge
my psych evaluation?

399
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:11,769
What?

400
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,068
Are you scared now?

401
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:18,935
It was to save my patient...

402
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:22,067
...from her assaulter.

403
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,567
Don't give me that garbage.

404
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:28,067
You still want to act like a
doctor, is that it?

405
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:29,934
You're not qualified. You know it.

406
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:36,500
So?

407
00:44:38,868 --> 00:44:40,202
What do you plan to do?

408
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:44,334
I have plenty of people
I can report you to.

409
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:48,767
Your hospital. Doctors' association.
TV studios.

410
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:02,467
Get it for me quickly.

411
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,035
You're running out of time.

412
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,634
30 million won is cheap...

413
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:12,867
...for keeping your medical
license, isn't it?

414
00:45:15,868 --> 00:45:16,901
Call me.

415
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:23,634
It's 30 million won. Don't forget.

416
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,567
-She's not picking up?
-It's off.

417
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:08,800
What should I do? Should I go by myself?

418
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,501
No, no. Wait.

419
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:12,467
I'll be right over.

420
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:21,769
(Sunwoo)

421
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:26,101
The person you have reached is
unavailable. Please leave...

422
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,634
How could she forget
he's waiting for her?

423
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:33,468
Seriously. Where is she?

424
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:55,934
Do you not know where Mom went either?

425
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,234
She must be attending
to an urgent patient.

426
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:01,567
Eat up.

427
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:48,400
I can't stand her.

428
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:52,501
-What?
-I hate people who look like her.

429
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:11,634
Why aren't you eating?

430
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:16,534
-Dad.
-What?

431
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,300
I need to go to the men's room.

432
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:50,968
(Good bye, Gosan-si)

433
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,101
Are you two still fighting?

434
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,767
It's not like that.

435
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,334
Just tell me what time she left work.

436
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:07,868
Gosh.

437
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:10,501
You didn't break up with
Dakyung yet, did you?

438
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:11,734
It's not that.

439
00:50:17,734 --> 00:50:19,702
I told you, it's completely
over with Dakyung.

440
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:25,334
But Sunwoo has been acting
really strange these days.

441
00:50:25,701 --> 00:50:27,268
She gets cranky whenever I talk to her.

442
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:29,135
She also stayed out all night...

443
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:32,667
What? She stayed out all night?

444
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:34,369
No, forget it.

445
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,233
I said, forget it.

446
00:50:40,734 --> 00:50:43,001
Anyway, we can talk later.

447
00:50:57,267 --> 00:50:58,467
Mom's mad...

448
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,567
...because you did
something wrong, right?

449
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,434
No, it's not like that.

450
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,534
I didn't do anything wrong,

451
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:13,534
and Mom...

452
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,467
I'll take care...

453
00:51:21,334 --> 00:51:22,601
I'll take care of it.

454
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:26,402
Don't worry about anything, okay?

455
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,167
I'm innocent.

456
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:47,401
-Why are you telling me to go home?
-Do something about this punk.

457
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:49,101
How many days has it been?

458
00:51:49,267 --> 00:51:51,501
-It's over for him.
-Come on.

459
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,867
How about some fruits?

460
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:56,066
-Bring it.
-The owner is not here.

461
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:57,266
Gosh.

462
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,834
-You do it.
-Are you sleeping?

463
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,367
Hey, is it supposed to rain today?

464
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:05,168
They didn't say that in the forecast.

465
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:13,534
I'm sorry.

466
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:15,736
You'll have to pay next time.

467
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:17,601
(10,000 won)

468
00:52:24,534 --> 00:52:25,801
Come on.

469
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:29,834
I'm a great drinker.

470
00:52:29,901 --> 00:52:31,101
Just look at my heavyweight frame.

471
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:29,868
You should've called the police.

472
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:33,335
Why did you do such a crazy thing?

473
00:54:33,868 --> 00:54:37,102
What if he really reports what happened?

474
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:40,168
You must be feeling great.

475
00:54:42,534 --> 00:54:44,868
You wanted to see me crumble.

476
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:48,968
You were once boastful,

477
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:51,301
but look at you now.

478
00:54:55,434 --> 00:54:57,467
I ran to him with a pair
of scissors in my hands...

479
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:00,934
...because I wanted to
kill Lee Taeoh.

480
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:07,668
Of course, I wasn't
able to follow through.

481
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,801
You should leave with Joonyoung
and start a new life.

482
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:15,834
Gosan is Lee Taeoh's hometown.

483
00:55:17,534 --> 00:55:20,435
You know very well I don't
have anywhere else to go.

484
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:27,001
I lost both of my parents at once...

485
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:33,667
...and became a pitiful
girl who was left alone.

486
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:37,534
Do you know how long it took
me to get rid of that feeling?

487
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,668
What I have now were all built up here.

488
00:55:43,334 --> 00:55:44,768
This is my son's hometown,

489
00:55:47,634 --> 00:55:49,268
and now it's also my hometown.

490
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:55,868
I realized it when I heard
the man threatening me...

491
00:55:55,934 --> 00:55:57,067
...to reveal about Lee Taeoh.

492
00:55:59,934 --> 00:56:01,835
Now I know what I feared the most.

493
00:56:04,467 --> 00:56:05,834
Once we get a divorce,

494
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:10,935
I'll once again become a pitiful woman.

495
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:15,602
It'll be the same for Joonyoung too.

496
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:20,001
Who cares what other people
think whether it's pitiful or not?

497
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:24,034
Are you sure you can refrain
from feeling sorry for yourself?

498
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:27,267
Wake up.

499
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,233
You must resent him as
much as you loved him,

500
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:32,701
but it'd be dangerous to
go any further than this.

501
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:34,768
One wrong move...

502
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,834
...and you could ruin your life like me.

503
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,068
I'm off to work now.

504
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:20,034
I cooked breakfast,
so don't forget to eat.

505
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,501
Have fun at school.

506
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:22,667
Hyunseo.

507
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,267
Make sure...

508
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,033
...that lady doesn't do anything fishy.

509
01:00:34,534 --> 01:00:36,868
And keep in mind that it's
the only way you'll live.

510
01:00:56,701 --> 01:00:57,901
Are you going somewhere?

511
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,834
I'm going to stay with
my parents for a while.

512
01:01:03,934 --> 01:01:05,168
I'm going to move soon.

513
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:08,801
Did something happen?

514
01:01:12,634 --> 01:01:14,135
I broke up with him.

515
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:19,201
You should also do the same.
Stop letting him control you.

516
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:21,701
Or just call the police.

517
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:34,002
I'll see you. Stay well.

518
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:47,501
I'm sorry.

519
01:01:48,734 --> 01:01:50,867
I should've hidden the sleeping pills.

520
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:58,368
Here are the medical certificates...

521
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:01,635
...regarding all the injuries
I've inspected on you.

522
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:03,635
(Family Love Hospital)

523
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:09,968
I'm done helping you, right?

524
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:15,768
Now, give me the money you promised.

525
01:02:20,367 --> 01:02:22,500
Do you have a plan?

526
01:02:27,033 --> 01:02:28,433
Don't worry about me.

527
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,434
You probably wouldn't
want to see me again.

528
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,400
Dakyung told me...

529
01:02:40,534 --> 01:02:42,235
...that she broke up with your husband.

530
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,634
She packed up and left today.

531
01:02:53,801 --> 01:02:55,101
What do you plan to do now?

532
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:09,901
Dakyung.

533
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:12,166
Please open the door
if you're not sleeping.

534
01:03:13,067 --> 01:03:14,467
Are you really not going to eat?

535
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:18,867
I'm glad you decided to go on a diet.

536
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:20,601
But who starves to lose
weight these days?

537
01:03:21,934 --> 01:03:25,101
Come for dinner a bit later.
I'll make you a Cobb salad.

538
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:39,767
Miss!

539
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:43,535
Miss! You can clean up the dining table.

540
01:03:43,734 --> 01:03:45,301
Okay, ma'am.

541
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,001
Why? Isn't she having dinner?

542
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:53,034
No.

543
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:56,467
Why is she still depressed when
she came back on her own will?

544
01:03:59,634 --> 01:04:02,468
You should talk to her later
and make her feel better.

545
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:04,701
And ask her why she quit work.

546
01:04:04,767 --> 01:04:07,934
I'm just happy that she's back.
Just let her be.

547
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:10,834
Once she finds something she wants to do,

548
01:04:10,901 --> 01:04:13,034
I'll support her as much as I can.

549
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:15,067
Yes, I know that.

550
01:04:15,934 --> 01:04:17,435
But I just can't seem to...

551
01:04:17,601 --> 01:04:19,469
...tell what's on her mind.

552
01:04:19,934 --> 01:04:22,034
And why does she look so tired?

553
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,300
It's so upsetting.

554
01:04:24,634 --> 01:04:25,801
Do you think she's sick?

555
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:27,734
Lee Taeoh, it's me.

556
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:41,168
Why are we going so far away to eat?

557
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:42,568
We can go somewhere nearby.

558
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:45,834
No, we can't do that.
Someone invited us to dinner.

559
01:05:47,133 --> 01:05:49,367
And she asked me to bring you.

560
01:05:50,901 --> 01:05:53,235
-Who?
-You'll find out once we get there.

561
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:55,801
I'm sure you'll like it.

562
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:04,101
Who sent you the flowers?

563
01:06:06,434 --> 01:06:07,501
Was it a patient?

564
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,800
Didn't Jehyuk tell you?

565
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,067
He told me it was for
client appreciation.

566
01:06:12,534 --> 01:06:13,634
That punk said that?

567
01:06:14,701 --> 01:06:16,468
What a crazy jerk.

568
01:06:17,367 --> 01:06:19,601
Why would he send flowers
to someone else's wife?

569
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:21,133
I know, right?

570
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,300
(Ji Sunwoo)

571
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:35,834
(Ji Sunwoo)

572
01:06:42,567 --> 01:06:44,134
I'll see you tonight at the same place.

573
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,367
(Son Jehyuk Accounting Firm)

574
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:54,868
Should I tell you something
interesting in advance?

575
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:04,968
The person who decided to
invest in Lee Taeoh's business...

576
01:07:06,334 --> 01:07:07,734
...is Chairman Yeo Byunggyu.

577
01:07:14,434 --> 01:07:15,634
Aren't you coming?

578
01:07:16,734 --> 01:07:18,235
Sunwoo, what are we...

579
01:07:23,701 --> 01:07:26,402
The chairman's wife invited us to dinner.
Isn't that great?

580
01:07:27,968 --> 01:07:30,569
You always wanted to become
close with Chairman Yeo.

581
01:07:33,901 --> 01:07:35,135
You'd better thank me for it.

582
01:07:48,267 --> 01:07:49,267
Sunwoo!

583
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:53,868
Hold on.

584
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:00,435
Fix your shirt.

585
01:08:01,033 --> 01:08:02,133
Okay.

586
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,400
Oh my gosh, Dr. Ji.

587
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:18,166
Hello.

588
01:08:18,868 --> 01:08:20,035
We came.

589
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:23,435
What brings you here?

590
01:08:23,501 --> 01:08:25,235
Is someone here?

591
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:29,233
Dr. Ji, hello.

592
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,201
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

593
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:33,135
You invited us over.

594
01:08:33,534 --> 01:08:34,768
That's why we came.

595
01:08:36,234 --> 01:08:37,901
Did I say it was today?

596
01:08:39,901 --> 01:08:42,668
That's what I thought. Was I wrong?

597
01:08:43,901 --> 01:08:45,001
Oh, no.

598
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:48,235
What? Did you forget an
important engagement like this?

599
01:08:48,901 --> 01:08:51,135
No, I...

600
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:54,801
I... I'm so sorry.

601
01:08:55,067 --> 01:08:57,001
-How did this slip from my mind?
-It's fine.

602
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,367
-We can just leave.
-No, no.

603
01:09:00,033 --> 01:09:01,834
I'm the one who brought it up.

604
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:03,668
I can't let you just leave.

605
01:09:03,734 --> 01:09:05,401
Please come inside.

606
01:09:05,467 --> 01:09:08,168
-Please come in, Dr. Ji.
-Yes, come in.

607
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:14,767
Come in.

608
01:09:15,033 --> 01:09:17,033
We can just eat what we have.

609
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:32,835
What a great house.

610
01:09:33,634 --> 01:09:36,001
I really like it.

611
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:37,735
Thank you.

612
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:39,868
Here.

613
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:42,501
Thank you.

614
01:09:43,234 --> 01:09:45,267
He designed it himself.

615
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,801
You have a great taste.

616
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:49,901
My wife did the interior decorating.

617
01:09:51,033 --> 01:09:54,367
I thought I saw her artistic style.

618
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,101
Take your time and look around.

619
01:09:58,167 --> 01:09:59,534
I'll get lunch ready.

620
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:00,702
Give me that.

621
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:02,501
-Thank you.
-I'll keep it safe.

622
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:04,801
Come this way.

623
01:10:07,634 --> 01:10:09,301
Your house in Jeju,

624
01:10:09,834 --> 01:10:11,234
you designed it yourself as well?

625
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,734
How did you know?

626
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:16,967
I heard the rumors.

627
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:21,101
It must have a similar vibe as this house.

628
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:25,168
Sure, many people from Gosan visited.

629
01:10:25,534 --> 01:10:26,934
That's the second floor.

630
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,601
May I take a look around
the second floor too?

631
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,100
Sure.

632
01:10:31,934 --> 01:10:33,067
Honey, that's rude...

633
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,767
Not at all.

634
01:10:34,834 --> 01:10:37,168
Why don't you look around
too since you're here?

635
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:04,634
Sunwoo.

636
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:06,934
You're being rude.

637
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,500
What? The chairman said to look around.

638
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:28,700
You shouldn't touch their things.

639
01:11:33,534 --> 01:11:34,934
It looks pretty expensive,

640
01:11:36,701 --> 01:11:37,834
doesn't it?

641
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,100
Sunwoo.

642
01:12:13,901 --> 01:12:15,068
Oh. no.

643
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:17,668
It slipped and broke.

644
01:12:20,033 --> 01:12:22,734
That's why you shouldn't touch...

645
01:12:23,901 --> 01:12:25,502
...other people's things.

646
01:12:31,634 --> 01:12:34,701
What are you doing after barging
into someone else's house?

647
01:12:41,868 --> 01:12:43,569
What do you mean, "barging into"?

648
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,767
You're quite rude.

649
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,567
We are your mother's invited guests.

650
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,167
How about some wine while we wait...

651
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,233
What happened...

652
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,134
I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

653
01:13:19,601 --> 01:13:20,634
Wow.

654
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,201
It has great aroma.

655
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:33,501
Dr. Ji brought over a
great bottle of wine.

656
01:13:33,567 --> 01:13:35,700
I put in a lot of thought
in picking it out.

657
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:40,068
There's a wine my wife and I had recently.

658
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:43,634
It was a Chateau Louvelet Mar...

659
01:13:43,701 --> 01:13:46,335
-Marton.
-Yes, that's the wine.

660
01:13:47,033 --> 01:13:50,100
It has the same aroma as that wine.

661
01:13:50,534 --> 01:13:53,534
But I think this one that
Dr. Ji brought is nicer.

662
01:13:57,167 --> 01:14:00,434
Okay. What should we toast to?

663
01:14:02,634 --> 01:14:04,767
The happiness of the two families.

664
01:14:04,834 --> 01:14:06,535
-That's nice.
-Okay.

665
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,769
-Okay.
-How about this?

666
01:14:10,634 --> 01:14:12,568
To Lee Taeoh's investor,

667
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,233
Chairman Yeo.

668
01:14:22,467 --> 01:14:23,667
How did you know?

669
01:14:25,567 --> 01:14:27,600
Does that matter right now?

670
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,601
Won't you toast with us?

671
01:14:34,634 --> 01:14:35,834
I don't want to.

672
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:41,967
Sure, then.

673
01:14:50,234 --> 01:14:51,768
The wine is really nice.

674
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:06,701
Dr. Ji, you're acting a bit strange today.

675
01:15:07,868 --> 01:15:10,402
Are you having a tough
time with something?

676
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:15,568
I guess so. It is tough.

677
01:15:15,634 --> 01:15:19,068
Oh no. What could it be?

678
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,433
You have such a happy family.

679
01:15:22,334 --> 01:15:23,835
Right?

680
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:28,701
Is this fun for you?

681
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,800
She's under a lot of stress. I apologize.

682
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:43,800
Stop drinking.

683
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:51,433
It's because of my husband.

684
01:15:53,567 --> 01:15:55,068
He cheated on me.

685
01:16:08,033 --> 01:16:09,667
Stop it. Let's go.

686
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:10,967
I'm sorry.

687
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,101
We'll excuse ourselves.

688
01:16:14,133 --> 01:16:17,734
-Sure.
-That will probably be best.

689
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:21,267
I guess your parents don't know
yet that you're pregnant, Dakyung.

690
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:33,068
What...

691
01:16:35,067 --> 01:16:38,200
...did you just say?

692
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,734
Pregnant?

693
01:16:41,467 --> 01:16:43,534
-Who?
-Your daughter...

694
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:46,734
...had an affair with my
husband and got pregnant.

695
01:16:48,534 --> 01:16:50,534
You weren't aware of that...

696
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,801
...and made a huge investment.

697
01:16:58,434 --> 01:17:00,734
It's a misunderstanding, sir.

698
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:04,702
I'll explain it somehow.

699
01:17:07,734 --> 01:17:08,801
Dakyung.

700
01:17:12,067 --> 01:17:13,100
Dakyung!

701
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,467
See?

702
01:17:30,968 --> 01:17:32,836
He's running away like a coward.

703
01:17:32,901 --> 01:17:34,835
That's what Lee Taeoh is like.

704
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:38,934
The one you were head over
heels for is not more than that.

705
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,334
Watch the way...

706
01:17:43,434 --> 01:17:44,935
-...you talk to my daughter.
-You should've...

707
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,601
taught your daughter to be more careful.

708
01:17:47,868 --> 01:17:50,302
She shouldn't have touched
someone else's husband.

709
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:54,768
She shouldn't make moves
on a man with a kid.

710
01:17:55,234 --> 01:17:56,901
No matter how bad you are,

711
01:17:57,734 --> 01:17:59,568
only terrible people...

712
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,133
...break up someone else's family.

713
01:18:03,968 --> 01:18:05,001
Are you crazy?

714
01:18:07,367 --> 01:18:08,968
You're really crazy!

715
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:10,200
Stop that right now!

716
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,433
I'm going to ask you...

717
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:39,534
...to leave right now.

718
01:18:41,734 --> 01:18:43,168
-Chairman Yeo...
-Shut your mouth!

719
01:19:09,934 --> 01:19:11,568
Thank you for the meal, ma'am.

720
01:21:10,601 --> 01:21:11,601
Ji Sunwoo!

721
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:20,100
Did you...

722
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:23,867
...have to do this?

723
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:28,767
Did you have to come here
and make a scene like this?

724
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:33,401
That's why I gave you several
chances to come clean.

725
01:21:35,267 --> 01:21:37,201
It was you who ran away every time.

726
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,067
Are you blaming me now?

727
01:21:41,367 --> 01:21:43,434
Were you always this low?

728
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:47,267
Are you happy to have
made all this chaos?

729
01:21:47,701 --> 01:21:49,669
Does it make you happy to
have ruined everything?

730
01:21:52,701 --> 01:21:54,602
This is only the beginning.

731
01:21:57,033 --> 01:21:58,567
We still have things to do.

732
01:21:58,634 --> 01:22:00,335
What else can you do here?

733
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:06,367
Divorce.

734
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:14,034
Don't even think about
seeing Joonyoung again.

735
01:22:16,133 --> 01:22:17,233
He's my son!

736
01:22:27,434 --> 01:22:29,668
How dare you say that?

737
01:22:30,334 --> 01:22:32,268
If you decided to have
fun with another woman,

738
01:22:33,968 --> 01:22:36,702
you should've been sure enough
to never see your son again.

739
01:22:37,634 --> 01:22:38,667
Sure.

740
01:22:39,267 --> 01:22:42,601
I admit I made a mistake.
I couldn't help it.

741
01:22:44,467 --> 01:22:46,801
But I never intended on leaving my family.

742
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:52,200
It's not a crime to fall in love!

743
01:22:59,067 --> 01:23:00,067
What?

744
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:07,435
-Love?
-Everything was already settled!

745
01:23:08,968 --> 01:23:11,101
If you hadn't done what you did,

746
01:23:11,701 --> 01:23:13,101
the investment and Dakyung...

747
01:23:14,701 --> 01:23:16,801
...would have been settled well.

748
01:23:26,934 --> 01:23:27,934
I...

749
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:36,868
...slept with Jehyuk.

750
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,033
What?

751
01:24:12,868 --> 01:24:14,635
I said, I slept with Jehyuk.

752
01:24:18,801 --> 01:24:20,402
Did you want to get back at me?

753
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,334
Is that why?

754
01:24:30,534 --> 01:24:31,534
Yes.

755
01:24:37,701 --> 01:24:39,602
At first, I wanted to get my revenge.

756
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,233
But...

757
01:24:47,467 --> 01:24:49,634
...it was a thrill once we started.

758
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,634
It didn't feel that way...

759
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,934
...when I was with you.

760
01:25:03,834 --> 01:25:07,034
How can you do this to me?

761
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:09,601
Are you out of your mind?

762
01:25:10,734 --> 01:25:12,301
Jehyuk is my friend!

763
01:25:16,434 --> 01:25:19,501
How could you sleep with another man?

764
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,601
What's the matter?

765
01:25:23,133 --> 01:25:24,233
Does it make you mad?

766
01:25:31,767 --> 01:25:32,834
Does it disgust you?

767
01:25:34,534 --> 01:25:36,601
Is the feeling of betrayal
driving you crazy?

768
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,367
Whatever it is you're feeling right now,

769
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,667
make sure you don't forget it.

770
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:57,068
Because that's what I felt.

771
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,601
(The World Of The Married)

772
01:27:00,934 --> 01:27:02,601
Joonyoung saw everything.

773
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:05,769
He knows about your
relationship with Yeo Dakyung.

774
01:27:05,834 --> 01:27:08,134
Why can't you give up on your son?

775
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,267
What kind of lunatic would agree
to give up his money and child?

776
01:27:11,467 --> 01:27:13,500
Did you sleep with her?

777
01:27:13,567 --> 01:27:14,901
You already knew everything.

778
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,267
Why do you sound so startled?

779
01:27:16,334 --> 01:27:18,135
I don't care how you feel.

780
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,067
Just do your best as my husband.

781
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,201
We checked the place where
the last phone call was made.

782
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:23,300
And that's where we found it.

783
01:27:23,367 --> 01:27:24,968
How does she know where we live?

784
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,634
Did you tell her?

785
01:27:26,767 --> 01:27:29,001
Do you really want to
live with Joonyoung?

786
01:27:29,067 --> 01:27:30,834
I know I made a mistake
by cheating on you.

787
01:27:30,968 --> 01:27:32,602
But how do you expect me to
trust you with Joonyoung...

788
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:34,234
...when you're not completely sane?

789
01:27:34,367 --> 01:27:35,734
Do whatever you want.

790
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:38,634
But I won't just sit back and do nothing.
