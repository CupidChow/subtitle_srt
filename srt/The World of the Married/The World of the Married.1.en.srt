Everything in my life was perfect.

9
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,834
How was your day?

10
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,567
I missed you.

11
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,335
I'm so late.

12
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:18,034
Come here.

13
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,501
We have to send our kid to school.

14
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,167
Get up. I'll make some coffee.

15
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,035
I bought it in case
it gets dry in the plane.

16
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,135
But still, cherry flavor is too much.

17
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:02,434
You know I can't speak Chinese.

18
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,468
I'll shower first.

19
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:50,368
Dad. Mom wants me to take math lessons.

20
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,534
English, piano and now math?

21
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,334
- Do you have the time?
- It's so annoying.

22
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,235
Can you talk her out of it?

23
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:01,135
You have to master math
before you start middle school.

24
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,767
It will only get harder for you later on.

25
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:07,836
- You heard her.
- Dad!

26
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,268
Does he have to take lessons
because everyone else does?

27
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:12,568
Math may not be his best subject,

28
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,800
but he's creative like his dad.

29
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:15,934
That's true.

30
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,401
He does have creativity.

31
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:23,102
But how will he express his creativity
without basic knowledge?

32
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:26,700
The world still revolves around
educational background.

33
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,634
Goodness.

34
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:36,533
Work on your math instead of
trying to butter up your dad.

Joonyoung.

36
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,234
Sorry.

37
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,968
I'm off to work.

38
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:57,001
Do I look old?

39
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,301
It's photo-shopped so well.

40
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,234
Right.

41
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,300
You get prettier as you age.

42
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,101
Yeah right. Geez.

43
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,400
Hold on.

44
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,233
Put this on.

45
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,834
It's a little cold outside
after the rain last night.

46
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,268
What about you?

47
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,634
I only care about your well-being.

48
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,834
How's the birthday party plan
for your husband going?

49
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,902
I decided not to go with the banners
because Taeoh didn't want them.

50
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,567
Just some floral decoration.

51
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:15,868
I prepared wine and craft beer for drinks.

52
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,101
Whom did you invite?

53
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:21,335
The same people who came
to your husband's birthday,

54
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:24,901
plus the head of the association,
Congressman Cha...

55
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,867
...and Taeoh's employees.

56
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:30,367
Nicely done. You are a perfectionist.

57
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,767
How was Jeju Island?

58
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:35,135
Was the weather nice?

59
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:38,434
Did you get some quality time
with Jehyuk?

60
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:40,634
It was nice.

61
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,168
It felt like a honeymoon.

62
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:04,101
Hi.

63
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,834

-Hello.

69

Why is there a police car
in front of the building?

70
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,867
There's been an incident.

71
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,983
Incident?

72
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,534
Dr. Ma strangled someone at a bar.

73
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:53,935
- Hello, Dr. Ji.
- Hello.

74
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,800
Dr. Ji, you're here.

75
00:12:56,834 --> 00:13:00,368
Dr. Ji here is in charge
of external affairs.

76
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:09,082
Can you tell me what happened?

77
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:13,068
A passed out at a bar last night
and is currently unconscious.

78
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,202
According to the witnesses,
Mr. Ma Kangseok...

79
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,034
...got into the ambulance
and strangled him.

80
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,168
Was he providing first aid?

81
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,768
That's what he said.

82
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:28,769
But the patient's family
is making accusations...

83
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,634
...that he was on a drunken rage.

84
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:34,601
If a mentally unfit person
was hired as a doctor,

85
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,701
they will hold the hospital
responsible as well.

86
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:38,402
That is absurd!

87
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:40,901
The hospital shouldn't
be held accountable!

88
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,901
Can I see the paramedic's record?

89
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,233
He couldn't feel the pulse
despite performing CPR.

90
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,934
So he tried tracheal intubation.

91
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:04,934
Is that why you applied
pressure to the cricoid cartilage?

92
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,168
Cricoid what?

93
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,667
It's a technique used to...

94
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,268
...secure the airway before
inserting the tracheal tube.

95
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:22,168
It could look like strangling
to the untrained eyes.

96
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,101
I see.

97
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,567
He was applying pressure.

98
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:36,602
Please get another statement from
the paramedics regarding the situation.

99
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:40,235
You can issue a summons
if you still have problems afterwards.

100
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,569
The patient suffered
a sudden cardiac arrest.

101
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,734
If you want to hold the doctor
responsible...

102
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,467
...for providing the right medical aid,

103
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,235
we will back him up no matter what.

104
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,634
All right, back to your stations everyone.

105
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:55,535
It's time to work.

106
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,301
- Come on, let's go.
- What are you doing?

107
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:04,767
This place falls apart
unless I hold down the fort.

108
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:13,868
Dr. Ma.

109
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,901
How much did you drink?

110
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,067
You still reek of alcohol.

111
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,235
Why don't you take the day off?

112
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,669
Gosh, Director Gong...

113
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,802
Once again you saved his ass.

114
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,834
And he calls himself a director?

115
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:49,668
We need a plan for Dr. Ma.

116
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Or he might get involved
in a bigger trouble.

117
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,402
You look lively.

118
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,668
Is your husband home?

119
00:15:58,367 --> 00:15:59,567
How did you know?

120
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,801
Judging from your high
level of oxytocin...

121
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,501
You still have an active sex life.

122
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,134
Dr. Seol!

123
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:08,935
Give me a break.
I haven't gotten laid in a while.

124

(Assistant Director Ji Sunwoo)

125
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,734
I feel like I'm going to lose it.

126
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,034
I want to sleep, but...

127
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,501
Are you listening to me?

128
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,834
When did you start having insomnia?

129
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,467
It's been about three months now.

130
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,300
Young women these days
seem to look for alternatives...

131
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:44,769
...to anorexic drugs.

132
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:47,235
I don't care about losing weight.

133
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,601
I just need some sleeping pills.

134
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,067
Then more the reason for you
to see a neuropsychiatrist.

135
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,801
Like I don't know that?

136
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,267
I came here because I didn't
want to leave a record there.

137
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,668
I know a family physician
can give prescription.

138
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,934
I've done my research.

139
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:05,900
I can, but...

140
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:11,968
I have a policy against carelessly
providing tranquillizers.

141
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:15,668
Especially to a patient who refuses
to see a neuropsychiatrist.

142
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:18,934
I can't allow that in good conscience.

143
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,634
You have to promise to come.

144
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,567
Well...

145
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:42,835
I appreciate the gesture,

146
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:45,567
but I'm not sure if I'll have time.

147
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,834
You said menopause must be overcome
by restoring self-esteem...

148
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:53,868
...so I should look for something
that I can be passionate about.

149
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,101
That's how I got into painting.

150
00:18:57,334 --> 00:19:00,734
That's why you have to be there.

151
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,634
Your style...

152
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:09,968
...has changed a little.

153
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,834
Nothing like some love from a man
if you want to stay young.

154
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:19,601
Thanks to my new looks,

155
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:22,234
I've been getting some action these days.

156
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:32,183
You have improved a lot.

157
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:34,701
You won't have to come
for another check-up.

158
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:35,602
Okay.

159
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:36,934
Then...

160
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,434
I hope to see you at the exhibition.

161
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:40,601
Have a good day.

162
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:28,502
Mom.

163

Joonyoung.

164
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,435
Mom, we'll be sleeping outdoors
on our field trip.

165
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:36,567
In a tent!

166
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:39,401
Are you sure Dad can go?

167
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:42,834
Of course he will.
He said he cleared his schedule.

168
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,067
But last year, he canceled last minute
because something came up.

169
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,001
What if he cancels again?

170
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:49,834
I don't trust Dad.

171
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,902
Dad will definitely go
this year no matter what.

172
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,300
Don't worry.

173
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Mrs. Ji.

174
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:02,168
How have you been?

175
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,435
Don't you remember me?

176
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,601
I'm Jang Miyeon.

177
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:15,835
I used to be Mr. Lee's
assistant director.

178
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:24,669
Right.

179
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:27,417
We met at the opening ceremony
of his company.

180
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:28,901
I remember you.

181
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:33,001
You had short hair back then.

182
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:36,735
I used hair extensions.
Looks real, doesn't it?

183
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:41,834
What brings you to this neighborhood?

184
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:45,001
I guess Mr. Lee didn't tell you.

185
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:48,101
I've been working as his
secretary for over a year.

186
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,400
Secretary?

187
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,535
Raising a child alone,

188
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:55,301
it's hard to keep my job
in the film industry.

189
00:22:55,868 --> 00:22:58,302
I got a divorce.

190
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:03,968
Mr. Lee saw me in a tough spot
so he hired me his a secretary.

191
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,067
I am most grateful to him.

192
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,801
Since I finish work at 5:00 PM,

193
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,735
I can pick up my daughter on time.

194
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:13,500
5:00 PM?

195
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:17,302
He always leaves the office
at 5:00 PM sharp.

196
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,268
Mom?

197
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:42,768
Yeah?

198
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:44,702
Oh...

199
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:46,967
Are you done drawing?

200
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:52,350
(Happy Birthday!)

201
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:53,402
Look.

202
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:54,801
Which one do you like the most?

203
00:23:58,367 --> 00:23:59,500
You don't like them?

204
00:24:03,135 --> 00:24:04,834
This one.

205
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:06,301
I knew it.

206
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:08,283
I like that one too.

207
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:11,801
(Happy Birthday!
From Sunwoo and Joonyeong)

208
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:18,734
Your dad will be very happy
to hear that you made them.

209
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:23,835
Dad's home.

210
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,200
Joonyoung.

211
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,667
I heard some good stuff came in,
so I bought one on the way.

212
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,035
It's a limited edition.

213
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:40,735
You're late.

214
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,934
I wouldn't say it's that late.

215
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,335
I always come home around this time.

216
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:48,302
Right.

217
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:51,834
Did I do something wrong?

218
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:57,834
Joonyoung, can you go upstairs
and do your homework?

219
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,901
Why? It's time for dinner.

220
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,767
I need to let the ribs rest.

221
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,700
I'll call you when it's done.

222
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,634
Wow, braised ribs.

223
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:16,934
I ran into Miyeon on the way home.

224
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:18,235
Who?

225
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:20,468
Why didn't you tell me?

226
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:23,335
I didn't tell you?

227
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:26,335
I thought I did... Ouch, that's hot.

228
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,500
Do you take her to business trips?

229
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,068
Of course.

230
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,300
She has experience as an assistant
director and she's pretty good.

231
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,601
You have no idea how stiff
the investors were.

232
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:55,268
It was nothing but briefing
in a hotel room for days.

233
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:04,468
This is to die for.

234
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:09,068
I suppose you had a few drinks?

235
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:18,035
To lighten up the mood.

236
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,467
With Miyeon?

237
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:20,702
Yeah.

238
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:23,468
- Should I open this bottle of wine?
- Will you please...

239
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:25,801
Go wash your hands first.

240
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:30,168
Okay.

241
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:31,934
Sorry.

242
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:56,867
Sunwoo.

243
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,334
It's braised ribs.

244
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:03,368
I figured you'd be tired to cook
since you just came back from your trip.

245
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,968
You are the best.

246
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:08,168
Let's go inside.

247
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:20,468
It's perfectly seasoned.

248
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,333
Is there anything you're not good at?

249
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,868
Where's Jehyuk?

250
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:29,035
He has a lot of work to catch up on,
so he'll be late.

251
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:30,701
Would you like some tea?

252
00:27:30,801 --> 00:27:32,402
No. I should get going.

253
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:38,601
I guess that hair color is
in style these days.

254
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,333
I see it everywhere.

255
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:44,467
You know Eom Hyojung, right?

256
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:50,668
She's famous in the neighborhood
for being a former Miss Korea.

257
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:54,034
After she dyed her hair,

258
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:56,234
it became a trend among the women.

259
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,368
It looked pretty
so I jumped on the bandwagon.

260
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:02,934
How fun would it be...

261
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:06,302
...to live like a celebrity for
being a former Miss Korea?

262
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:10,368
A woman's beauty is a source of power.

263
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,135
Is everything okay...

264
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:25,034
...with Taeoh?

265
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:27,202
Okay?

266
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:29,767
What do you mean?

267
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,967
It seems like he has a lot
on his mind lately.

268
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:38,800
With the business trip and the investors.

269
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:42,701
I was wondering if Jehyuk
said something about it.

270
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:46,569
No.

271
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:48,034
He didn't.

272
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,134
I see.

273
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:56,468
Oh my.

274
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:04,768
You're home earlier than I expected.

275
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:07,434
- Yeah.
- Sunwoo is here.

276
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,934
Hello, Sunwoo.

277
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:18,767
You're late. You must be tired.

278
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:20,302
I have to work my butt off.

279
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:23,335
My wife's not very capable
unlike you-know-who.

280
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:28,168
She brought some braised ribs.

281
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,567
Wow, that's awesome.

282
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:34,767
Cooking on top of being
a big-time assistant director?

283
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:40,135
Lee Taeoh, that lucky son of a gun.

284
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,533
He's a gentleman to the ladies.

285
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:44,434
Right, Sunwoo?

286
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:52,101
Oh, that's right.

287
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,967
Your wedding photos are ready, right?

288
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:55,701
I'll go to your house to check it out.

289
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:58,668
Aren't you sick of those photo-shoots?

290
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:01,234
Why would she be sick of it?

291
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:02,968
It's to celebrate their marriage.

292
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:07,268
She couldn't wear a wedding dress
because she was carrying Joonyoung.

293
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:09,967
It's Taeoh's way to show that he cares.

294
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:11,533
Don't you think it's sweet?

295
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:13,868
I guess.

296
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:16,834
He's a certified ladies' man.

297
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:23,968
Get some rest. I'll get going.

298
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:25,267
You're leaving?

299
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:26,534
I'll show myself out.

300
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:31,934
- Bye Sunwoo.
- Bye.

301
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:05,934
Dish washing is done.

302
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,068
Thanks for dinner.

303
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:10,934
Sure.

304
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:31,601
Was Jehyuk home?

305
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:32,834
Yes.

306
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:39,701
I'll shower first.

307
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:40,901
All right.

308

(From Heewon : We hope to see you
again some other night, Mr. Lee)

314
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:55,501
(Heewon)

315
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,168
So...

316
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:09,235
You went there at dawn?

317
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:13,101
You went through his clothes and phone
because of a strand of hair?

318
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:15,968
He hired a secretary over a year ago,
and didn't tell me about it.

319
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:18,734
Isn't that weird?

320
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:20,802
I don't think he's
keeping secrets from you.

321
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:22,836
Maybe he didn't feel the need to tell you.

322
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:26,067
Or you weren't paying attention
when he told you.

323
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,735
The fact that she's a divorcée bothers me.

324
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:35,767
Do all divorcées have affairs
with married men?

325
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:37,968
All this time, he got
off work at 5:00 PM.

326
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,834
But he told me it's 7:00 PM.

327
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:42,501
What on earth could he have
been up to for two hours...

328
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:44,035
...that he had to lie about it?

329
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,200
Then it can't be the secretary.

330
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:49,867
You said she picks her kid up at 5:00 PM.

331
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,567
And I feel like Yerim is hiding something.

332
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,302
Geez...

333
00:34:56,133 --> 00:35:00,034
You're even suspicious of
Jehyuk's wife of all people?

334
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,834
It's also strange that he didn't
set a lock screen on his phone.

335
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:06,735
And it was right there for me to look.

336
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,167
- Does he know that I'm suspicious?
- Gosh.

337
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:14,467
You're not acting normal.
You know that, right?

338
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:19,234
- Really?
- Did you get some sleep?

339
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:21,900
I think you're being oversensitive.

340
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:27,001
I wish it was oversensitivity.

341
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,068
More sleep, less work.

342
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:32,202
I'm really worried about you.

343
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,467
Having a good-looking husband
isn't so easy after all.

344
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:43,801
We're in our 40s now,
but he looks as if he's in his 30s.

345
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,133
I lost one kilogram.

346
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,635
And I've been losing hair.

347
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:09,433
And my dry skin got worse.

348
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:22,635
Have you been taking the medicine
that I prescribed for you?

349
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,034
How can I take medicine
when I can't even eat well?

350
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:31,735
Why haven't you been eating well?

351
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,535
Goodness...

352
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:38,734
Who knows what lurks
inside of the things we eat?

353
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,433
You need to eat properly
and take your med.

354
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:48,601
You can come again
if that doesn't work.

355
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,734
He always leaves the office
at 5:00 PM sharp.

356
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:04,334
Hold on.

357
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,701
Are you refusing a patient?

358
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:12,601
No.

359
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,701
I'm not feeling well today.

360
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,201
Do you feel itchy?

361
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:24,735
Doctor.

362
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:27,534
Does your heart start pounding
all of a sudden,

363
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,268
and you feel bloated inside?

364
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:35,068
You have the same symptoms that I have.

365
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:44,935
I need a little break.

366
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:47,567
But...

367
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:03,268
Any remaining patients?

368
00:38:03,868 --> 00:38:06,802
No. But there are documents
that need your approval.

369
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:08,034
I'll do it at home.

370
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:09,034
Please inform Director Gong...

371
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,266
...that I'm leaving early
to take care of something urgent.

372
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:13,669
-Okay.
-Bye.

373
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:17,635
Where are you going?

374
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:20,934
(Seol Myungsook, Gynecologist)

375
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:27,433
Sorry, Yerim.

376
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:29,435
I'm still at work.

377
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:32,867
Can you take care of Joonyeong
after his piano lesson?

378
00:38:36,868 --> 00:38:39,135
Sure, I can do that.

379
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,601
Don't worry about it.

380
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:43,367
Thank you. I'll see you later.

381
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:31,334
- I'm sure about this one!
- I don't have any!

382
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:32,601
Just give me whatever you got on you.

383
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:35,468
I don't have any!

384
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,867
Keep your mouth shut.

385
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:52,968
- What's gotten into you?
- Let me go!

386
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:55,035
- Let's go.
- Let me go!

387
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:56,301
Okay.

388
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:05,900
Help me.

389
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:09,901
- Please help!
- I'm sorry. She's drunk.

390
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:12,667
Why did you drink so much?

391
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:24,367
-I have to make a bet now!
-I don't have any!

392
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:26,068
Give me whatever you got.

393
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:30,867
Come over here!

394
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:37,500
- I don't have any!
- It'll be the last time!

395
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:44,801
Come on, help me out. Please!

396
00:40:45,601 --> 00:40:47,068
One last time.

397
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:49,467
We don't have time for this!

398
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:52,035
-Forget it!
-Come on.

(Family Love Nursing Home)

400
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:07,567
(Nurses), (Reception)

401
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,101
Hello.

402
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:41,501
Hello, Mother.

403
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,767
He didn't say you were coming.

404
00:43:44,868 --> 00:43:46,068
What brings you here?

405
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:50,634
It's been a long time since my last visit.

406
00:43:50,734 --> 00:43:53,968
It seems like you found some free time
despite your hectic schedule.

407
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:56,567
How are you feeling now?

408
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,368
Same old, same old.

409
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:01,701
I could bite the dust tomorrow.

410
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:03,934
Gosh, don't say that.

411
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:08,868
Are these flowers from you?

412
00:44:09,968 --> 00:44:10,836
Yes.

413
00:44:10,934 --> 00:44:12,435
Why bring flowers?

414
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:14,001
It's a waste of money.

415
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:17,634
I'll get a vase for these.

416
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,101
Sunwoo.

417
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:43,569
Thank you.

418
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,634
Mom's so happy to see you.

419
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:49,001
I haven't been paying much
attention to her.

420
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:52,068
You should've asked me to come with you.

421
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,500
I didn't want to burden you
when you're so busy.

422
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:57,935
I've been visiting her alone
for a while now.

423
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:00,300
Her condition is getting worse by the day.

424
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:03,401
What?

425
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:08,368
It seems like I misunderstood.

426
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:11,735
Miyeon said you get off work at 5:00 PM.

427
00:45:13,534 --> 00:45:15,402
But you told me it's 7:00 PM.

428
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:18,668
Did you think I was up to something
else for those two hours?

429
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:24,734
Wait... Is that why you came here?

430
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,201
I'm sorry.

431
00:45:29,968 --> 00:45:31,869
I must've lost my head for a second.

432
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:34,535
- Sunwoo...
- Please forget what I said.

433
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:36,601
It's so embarrassing.

434
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:44,335
Don't get all anxious over nothing.

435
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,767
I'm okay now.

436
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,767
It's all good.

437
00:45:56,634 --> 00:45:57,568
Really?

438
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:03,101
You should go to your mom.

439
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:13,202
- Thank you for the vase.
- You're welcome.

440
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,034
We should thank you for the cake.

441
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:16,934
Sure.

442
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:19,568
Is she sleeping okay?

443
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:23,469
She's been struggling to sleep,
so we increased the painkiller dose.

444
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:27,267
She's been dying to see her son.

445
00:46:28,868 --> 00:46:31,135
It's his first visit
since Lunar New Year.

446
00:46:31,234 --> 00:46:33,102
He only called occasionally
to check on her.

447
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,567
I've been visiting her alone
for a while now.

448
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,800
Her condition is getting worse by the day.

449
00:47:38,534 --> 00:47:39,734
Is there something going on?

450
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:41,901
Between you two?

451
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,068
No. Everything's fine.

452
00:49:29,868 --> 00:49:31,802
- Good night, son.
- Mom.

453
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:34,302
Yoon Noeul told me...

454
00:49:34,634 --> 00:49:36,767
...that her mom has a boyfriend.

455
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,233
Yoon Noeul?

456
00:49:39,801 --> 00:49:40,635
Who's that?

457
00:49:40,734 --> 00:49:42,001
You saw her the other day.

458
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,467
She's the daughter of Dad's secretary.

459
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:47,235
Her mom has a boyfriend?

460
00:49:50,033 --> 00:49:51,233
What is he like?

461
00:49:51,334 --> 00:49:53,101
I don't know about that.

462
00:49:53,634 --> 00:49:56,201
All I know is that her mom
got a boyfriend after the divorce.

463
00:50:00,968 --> 00:50:03,068
But Noeul is cool with it.

464
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,368
I'd feel angry and betrayed
if I was in her shoes.

465
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:10,335
I think she's trying to act tough.

466
00:50:10,534 --> 00:50:11,468
Right, Mom?

467
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,701
Go to sleep.

468
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:48,668
Where's Joonyeong?

469
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:49,834
Is he sleeping?

470
00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:51,168
Yes, he's asleep.

471
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:55,001
Going somewhere?

472
00:50:55,634 --> 00:50:56,535
Yes.

473
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:01,534
I need to attend this event
held by the alumni president.

474
00:51:01,801 --> 00:51:03,001
He's a big shot around here.

475
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,367
Apparently, his wife...

476
00:51:04,801 --> 00:51:06,602
...was a former Miss Korea.

477
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:10,801
She's holding an exhibition.
so I'm going to swing by.

478
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,033
Is her name...

479
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:14,968
...Eom Hyojung?

480
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,834
You know her?

481
00:51:21,367 --> 00:51:22,268
Yes.

482
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:25,302
I was invited too.

483
00:51:26,701 --> 00:51:27,801
How?

484
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:32,534
She was a patient.

485
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:37,868
I see.

486
00:51:39,434 --> 00:51:40,534
This is great.

487
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:42,367
Let's go together.

488
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:46,501
All I have to do is change clothes.

489
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:49,268
All right.

490
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:15,868
Please don't mess things up
with the alumni president.

491
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,335
I mean...

492
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:21,133
He controls all the money in this town.

493
00:52:22,534 --> 00:52:24,667
You know how important
this project is for me.

494
00:52:24,968 --> 00:52:26,669
I have to make it work.

495
00:52:27,734 --> 00:52:29,934
I might need some help from him.

496
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,934
Why are you so stiff?

497
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:35,035
What?

498
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,201
Because I feel bad about everything.

499
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:43,201
Making you worry about my mother...

500
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:46,468
I got to start my own company
thanks to your support.

501
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,834
And yet, I've never
brought much money home...

502
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:51,568
...because the business is still unstable.

503
00:52:53,534 --> 00:52:55,035
I feel bad about everything.

504
00:52:58,167 --> 00:52:59,135
Really?

505
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:01,767
I'll make this project work...

506
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,434
...no matter what.

507
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,934
I want to pay you back for
everything you've done.

508
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:17,068
- You're a busy man.
- You're very passionate...

509
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:18,934
...about this exhibition.

510
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:20,567
Look at you all fired up.

511
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:23,001
I'm a passionate woman.

512
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,001
- It's a wonderful project.
- Really?

513
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,767
"Passion" is the keyword!

514
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:49,335
Negative spaces?
It's not a landscape painting.

515
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,402
- Honey!
- They need to know.

516
00:53:51,968 --> 00:53:55,135
- Shall we have a toast?
- I should give it a shake first.

517
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:57,601
-Cheers!
-Thank you for coming.

518
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,134
Hello, Mr. Yeo.

519
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:02,768
Mr. Yeo?

520
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:04,834
Hello.

521
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:08,934
I'm a graduate of Gosan High School.
My name is Lee Taeoh.

522
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:11,734
Congratulations on your wife's exhibition.

523
00:54:12,634 --> 00:54:14,034
Thank you.

524
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:16,401
-By the way, Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

525
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:18,800
When will I get that dinner
for beating you in golf?

526
00:54:19,701 --> 00:54:21,435
Of course!

527
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:24,534
I know this sushi place in Wakayama.

528
00:54:24,634 --> 00:54:29,934
The chef told me that
a high-quality tuna came in.

529
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:30,867
What do you think?

530
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:34,266
Shall we go to Japan for a tuna party?

531
00:54:35,133 --> 00:54:38,667
No. We only eat seafood from Gosan
to support the local economy.

532
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:41,569
Come on, it's tuna!

533
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:42,934
Are you...?

534
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:43,901
Yes sir.

535
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:46,634
Are you Lee Sangdeuk's son?

536
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,001
Yes... I am.

537
00:54:53,434 --> 00:54:54,335
Who?

538
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,667
You know, he used to run a tailor's shop.

539
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,333
It’s a living.

540
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:06,334
I've been having...

541
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:09,034
...some shoulder pain lately.

542
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:10,600
I can't move them around.

543
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,433
Hello!

544
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:14,601
When did you get here?

545
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:17,502
Thank you for coming all the way.

546
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:22,801
Congratulations.

547
00:55:22,868 --> 00:55:24,402
Oh my. Honey, excuse me.

548
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:26,002
Hello Doctor!

549
00:55:27,968 --> 00:55:32,836
This is Dr. Ji Sunwoo
from Family Love Hospital.

550
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:37,467
I told you about her, remember?
She's been a great help to me.

551
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,901
I've heard so much about you.

552
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:43,268
She says you're an excellent doctor.

553
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:45,834
This is my husband.

554
00:55:45,934 --> 00:55:47,168
-Hello.
-Oh my.

555
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:50,268
You are?

556
00:55:50,801 --> 00:55:51,402
Yes.

557
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:57,668
He owns an event management company
called "T.O Entertainment."

558
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,634
He makes movies too.

559
00:56:01,334 --> 00:56:03,534
For the development of our community,

560
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:06,700
I hope you take interest
in my husband's business.

561
00:56:08,767 --> 00:56:11,368
Which batch were you in? The 20th?

562
00:56:11,467 --> 00:56:13,201
The 28th batch, sir.

563
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,433
Wait, Councilor Cha was in 28th...

564
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:17,667
Yes, Docheol and I were
in the same year.

565
00:56:17,767 --> 00:56:19,167
I see.

566
00:56:19,267 --> 00:56:21,434
- You make movies, right?
- Yes sir.

567
00:56:21,534 --> 00:56:24,402
Show Mr. Choi some of your projects.
He'll make some investment.

568
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:25,402
-Come on!
-Invest?

569
00:56:25,501 --> 00:56:26,935
He's rich.

570
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:28,500
I want to be in the movie.

571
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:36,567
I've been getting a lot of support
from my husband.

572
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:38,701
-He is dedicated.
-She's giving me too much credit.

573
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:39,702
Come on!

574
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:42,368
Don't be so modest.

575
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:43,501
It's fine.

576
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:52,734
Congratulations, Mrs. Eom.

577
00:56:52,801 --> 00:56:55,001
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

578
00:56:56,968 --> 00:56:58,435
Dr. Ji.

579
00:56:58,534 --> 00:57:00,801
Not only you have a successful career,

580
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,634
but also a handsome, younger husband.

581
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,268
You're a go-getter.

582
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:09,768
We are of the same age.

583
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,267
Is that so?

584
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:17,335
Your husband looks really young.
I bet you hear that all the time.

585
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:20,034
Yes.

586
00:57:26,434 --> 00:57:28,935
-Mom.
-Hey! Did you bring your friends?

587
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,534
- Yes.
- Oh, right.

588
00:57:30,934 --> 00:57:31,701
Dr. Ji?

589
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,634
This is my daughter, Dakyung.

590
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:35,302
Hello.

591
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:37,735
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

592
00:57:40,701 --> 00:57:44,868
I've always wanted to
get to know you better.

593
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:47,701
How about...

594
00:57:47,901 --> 00:57:49,934
...we keep continuing our relationship?

595
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,401
Would you like that?

596
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:56,701
If you and your husband are free tomorrow,

597
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,534
would you like to join us?

598
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,135
Tomorrow?

599
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,467
It's my husband's birthday.

600
00:58:02,934 --> 00:58:05,601
It's just a casual gathering
with our friends and colleagues.

601
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,301
If you two can come,

602
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:10,901
everyone would be delighted.

603
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,967
Of course we should go.

604
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:17,168
What does Mr. Lee like?

605
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:19,768
I'll get something nice for him.

606
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:21,834
Cheers.

607
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:09,067
Are you okay?

608
00:59:14,367 --> 00:59:15,934
I'm sorry about the other day.

609
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:18,600
Something urgent happened.

610
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,667
It's not like you had another choice.

611
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:23,101
It was none of your business.

612
00:59:23,701 --> 00:59:26,968
You wouldn't have been
much of help anyway.

613
00:59:28,367 --> 00:59:29,834
Who was he?

614
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:34,168
My boyfriend.

615
00:59:35,801 --> 00:59:37,568
He ran out of money.

616
00:59:38,334 --> 00:59:39,868
He's not always like that.

617
00:59:43,534 --> 00:59:45,468
I watched what happened.

618
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,634
Do you really want to
make excuses for him?

619
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:53,668
It must be nice being you.

620
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:57,834
All your problems go away just like that.

621
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:02,001
Everything must be so easy for you.

622
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:04,501
What do you mean?

623
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,234
Normally, people just sit
on their problems.

624
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:12,567
-Because they don't have the courage.
-That's a lame excuse.

625
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:14,901
You know that, right?

626
01:00:14,968 --> 01:00:17,902
You can only take a step forward
from where you broke down,

627
01:00:18,534 --> 01:00:20,934
if you're rich enough.

628
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:25,468
Someone like you would never understand.

629
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:29,934
My situation's not that different.

630
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,767
Does your husband hit you?

631
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:34,735
Then what?

632
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,533
Does he take away your money?

633
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:49,202
I think he has another woman.

634
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:56,001
I'm scared it might be true.

635
01:00:56,367 --> 01:00:57,901
What's so scary about that?

636
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,367
Find some evidence and kick him out.

637
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:04,201
I thought everything is easy...

638
01:01:05,033 --> 01:01:06,433
...for successful women.

639
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:15,135
Marriage is not that simple.

640
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:17,368
It's not some game...

641
01:01:19,267 --> 01:01:22,034
..that you can forfeit
just because you lost money.

642
01:01:24,033 --> 01:01:25,200
It's about my life.

643
01:01:26,567 --> 01:01:29,234
And my son's life.

644
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,068
It could be devastating for all of us.

645
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:37,068
I'm disappointed.

646
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:42,367
Even a successful woman like you...

647
01:01:43,968 --> 01:01:46,202
...is no different from me.

648
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:16,067
I'm disappointed.

649
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,367
Even a successful woman like you...

650
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:23,267
...is no different from me.

01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:33,401
First...

662
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:38,202
Tell me why you're collecting
pills from different doctors.

663
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,300
It's not for weight loss or suicide.

664
01:04:45,701 --> 01:04:47,235
You don't have to worry.

665
01:04:55,634 --> 01:04:56,667
Actually...

666
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:04,434
I need you to do me a favor.

667
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,934
Get well soon.

668
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:51,667
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

669
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,133
- See you in two weeks.
- Okay.

670
01:06:39,968 --> 01:06:42,268
(Your cake is ready!
Congratulations on your happy day!)

671
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,934
I'm at Starlight Village Townhouse.

672
01:07:14,033 --> 01:07:15,200
Haneul?

673
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:48,901
He just went inside the building.

674
01:08:09,234 --> 01:08:11,768
He hasn't come out for three hours.

675
01:08:17,501 --> 01:08:18,835
Bye Doctor.

676
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,667
Goodbye.

678
01:09:32,767 --> 01:09:33,767
Hello?

679
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:41,901
It's a woman.

680
01:09:55,968 --> 01:09:57,168
Can you see her face?

681
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:03,601
What's she like?

682
01:10:07,534 --> 01:10:10,368
Take a photo or a video.

683
01:10:12,534 --> 01:10:13,734
Can you do that?

684
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,767
I can't get an angle from here.

685
01:10:19,501 --> 01:10:20,568
Give me a minute.

686

692
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:10,168
I couldn't get a photo of them together.

693
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:12,001
Did you get a look at her face?

694
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,968
I caught a glimpse of her back.

695
01:11:14,634 --> 01:11:16,301
She had long brown hair...

696
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:18,801
...and she was about your height.

697
01:11:21,834 --> 01:11:24,234
Mrs. Ji, come have a look.

698

699
01:11:38,868 --> 01:11:41,968
Oh dear... I guess you don't like it.

700
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:44,968
No.

701
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:47,901
It came out great.

702
01:11:49,834 --> 01:11:51,034
It's so pretty.

703
01:11:54,434 --> 01:11:55,402
The drawing...

704
01:11:57,934 --> 01:12:00,201
...was done by my son.

705
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,734
How cute.

706
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,567
I wish I had a son like him.

707
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:07,202
(Happy Birthday!
From Sunwoo and Joonyeong)

708
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,967
He spent days to draw this...

709
01:12:09,634 --> 01:12:11,634
...for his dad's birthday.

710
01:12:20,267 --> 01:12:21,235
Joonyeong!

711
01:12:29,501 --> 01:12:32,002
Why is your mom being all goofy?

712
01:12:47,601 --> 01:12:48,835
How was school?

713
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,067
Get in.

714
01:13:07,767 --> 01:13:11,934
Speed limit ahead. Please slow down.

715
01:13:12,367 --> 01:13:14,500
Noeul said she's coming.
Did you know?

716
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:25,800
Mom.

717
01:13:26,534 --> 01:13:27,235
Mom?

718
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,267
You're driving too fast.

719
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,767
I thought we're going to see Dad.

720
01:13:56,868 --> 01:13:58,268
Stay in the car.

721
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,768
What are you going to do?

722
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:28,168
I need more solid evidence.

723
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:33,467
You're husband's car...

724
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:36,402
Check the trunk.

725
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,168
He seems to have hid something in there.

726
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:04,268
Happy birthday, Taeoh!

727

Dad.

738
01:15:32,167 --> 01:15:33,901
Hey. Where's your mom?

739
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,067
In the car.

741

Why are you so late?

742
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:06,167
I thought you were in an
accident or something.

743
01:17:07,534 --> 01:17:09,101
Can I have your car keys?

744
01:17:09,901 --> 01:17:11,668
I can't find the camera.

745
01:17:11,767 --> 01:17:13,268
I think it's in your car.

746
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,301
I'm sure it's left here somewhere.

747
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,601
Let's go inside first. People are waiting.

748
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:18,201
It's a special day.

749
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,801
I want to leave some good pictures.

750
01:17:24,133 --> 01:17:26,166
Why not use your phone?

751
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,268
The quality is different.

752
01:17:29,567 --> 01:17:30,667
Go on inside.

753
01:18:23,701 --> 01:18:25,402

Did you bring your friends?

01:21:48,167 --> 01:21:49,734
- Yes.

Sunwoo left in a hurry
while consulting a patient.

763
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:27,767
I think she's going to you.

764
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,968
Be careful.

765
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:39,202
You should be careful for the time being.

766

I think Sunwoo is onto you.

771
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,868
