3
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:54,701
Was it just...

4
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:57,701
...a familiar habit?

5
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:02,035
Or was it a gesture of reconciliation...

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,968
...induced by sympathy?

7
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,168
Was it an apology for
tearing each other apart?

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,268
Was it repentance for all
the wrong choices we made?

9
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:26,968
Or...

10
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,068
Did I just succumb to the lust...

11
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:35,868
...because I was lonely?

(Episode 13)

13
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:07,501
You should get going now.

14
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:42,868
You don't have to...

15
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,534
...leave this place in a hurry.

16
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,668
What I mean is….

17
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,534
...think carefully before you decide.

18
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,234
Find a good offer...

19
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,501
...that commensurates with
your experience.

20
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:02,035
Don't rush yourself into a bad deal.

21
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,634
You didn't sleep yet?

22
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:21,601
Jenny got a fever.

23
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,001
Jenny.

24
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,268
How bad is it?

25
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,367
I gave her medicine,
but her fever won't go down.

26
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,234
Why didn't you answer your phone?

27
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:31,934
Where have you been?

28
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,235
I was having drink with Jehyuk.

29
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,433
Sorry. I didn't know you called.

30
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,166
Let's take her to the doctor
first thing in the morning.

31
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:43,602
I'll go get a wet towel.

32
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,767
I'm sorry, Jenny.

33
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:01,901
Daddy's sorry.

34
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,834
Let's pretend...

35
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,467
...this never happened.

36
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,135
Forget about it.

37
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,634
I'll do the same.

38
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:16,701
We both made a mistake.

39
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,200
This must not happen again.

40
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,867
I know.

41
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:29,401
I agree.

42
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:35,268
I'm sorry to trouble you
with such a request, Dr. Ma.

43
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,534
You don't have to be sorry.

44
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,201
But I wasn't expecting this.

45
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,834
Can you tell me why?

46
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,101
Dr. Ji.

47
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
Is there something wrong?

48
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:49,601
I'm just sick of Gosan, that's all.

49
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,301
So? Can you find a position for me?

50
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,535
I'm sure a lot of places
would want to have you.

51
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,134
Give me some time. I'll ask around.

52
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:01,201
Do you have any place in mind?

53
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,500
I don't care where it is
as long as it isn't Gosan.

54
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:07,501
Yes, Dr. Ma.

55
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,467
I'll wait for your call.

56
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,834
Joonyoung...

57
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,101
I told you not to accept minors at night.

58
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,300
- I'm sorry.
- Are you trying to get me in trouble?

59
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:01,168
What if the police come for an inspection?

60
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:06,968
I'm sorry. I'll kick him out now.

61
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,801
What?

62
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:09,335
Hey.

63
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:37,400
Aren't you going to work?

64
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:39,601
What?

65
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,868
Jenny needs to go to the hospital,

66
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:43,835
and Joonyoung needs to go to school.

67
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:44,735
Yes.

68
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:46,634
That's right.

69
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,101
Are you all set?

70
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,035
Yeah.

71
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,200
What about Joonyoung?

72
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:57,235
Joonyoung, are you ready for school?

73
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:00,001
I'll give you a ride today.

74
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,001
Have you seen Joonyoung?

75
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:08,834
He's not in his room?

76
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:09,769
No.

77
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,135
Where have you been, Joonyoung?

78
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:19,868
I stepped out for a minute.

79
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,868
You're going to be late for school.

80
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,667
Hurry up. I'll give you a ride today.

81
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,368
Joonyoung.

82
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,300
Have you been smoking?

83
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:48,034
No.

84
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:50,635
Okay.

85
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,834
I'm glad you don't.

86
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,834
I trust you.

87
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,068
What was that about?

88
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,467
He smelled of cigarettes.

89
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:10,968
Didn't you smell it?

90
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,767
Did you have to ask
when he's about to go to school?

91
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,901
I'm his guardian too.

92
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:19,400
He wouldn't even tell us
where he went this morning.

93
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:22,335
I had to ask since I could smell it.

94
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,333
Let me take a look at your ear.

95
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,001
Good girl.

96
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,734
Yes, that's it.

97
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:38,168
- When did she take the fever medicine?
- Two hours ago.

98
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,300
Her fever went up to
38 degrees last night.

99
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,533
Oh dear.

100
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:46,234
Open wide. That's it. Good girl.

101
00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:48,902
Okay, done.

102
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,200
Make sure it doesn't turn into pneumonia.

103
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:55,301
Make sure the air doesn't
get dry in your house.

104
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,201
Yes, Doctor.

105
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,501
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

106
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:18,501
Joonyoung.

107
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,435
A flu is going around these days.

108
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,302
Be careful not to catch it.

109

Winter break starts soon, right?

110
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,335
Will you give me visit some time?

111
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:29,234
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

112
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:34,468
Hey.

113
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:36,934
- What's up?
- Hey.

114
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,934
-It's nothing.
- Let's go to the snack bar.

118
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,835
Did you get to work okay?

119
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,567
You called me to ask that?

120
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,500
No.

121
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,702
I was just wondering if Joonyoung...

122
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,934
He doesn't smoke, does he?

123
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,767
What are you talking about?
He's still a kid.

124
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,668
If he does, then I would know.

125
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:57,602
Right.

126
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,701
I'm sure he doesn't.

127
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:00,800
I just...

128
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:03,368
...wanted to be sure.

129
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,035
Don't mind what I said.

130
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:09,968
Okay. You should go back to work.

131

You need to approve this by today.

132

You don't have any more
patients for today, Dr. Ji.

Thank you, Nurse Ahn.

No, I mean...

141

Isn't Busan too far?

142

It's not a bad offer.

143

I want you to bring Joonyoung
to meet me.

144

He should have time tomorrow
since it's the school holidays.

145

He won't answer my calls nor return them.

146
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:52,234
Okay.

147
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,268
I'll talk to him.

148

We'll see you tomorrow then.

149
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,001
Okay.

If Joonyoung's not okay with it,

00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:07,469
will you reconsider?

154

I'm talking about you leaving the city.

155
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,167
Of course.

156
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,601

171
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,268
Joonyoung doesn't smoke.

172
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,868
I think you were mistaken.

173
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:12,967
He may be grumpy,

174
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,201
but he's not a bad kid.

175
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,068
I believed him when he said no.

176
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,300
Even if he is smoking,
we can just reason with him.

177
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,168
He's an adolescent.

178
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,168
Thank you.

179
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,100
You should show him some support.

180
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,800
We need to make dinner now.

181
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay.

182
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:44,968
Hey Jenny.

183
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:48,868
Were you sick a lot?

184
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,367
To the front.

185
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:52,901
-This pisses me off.
-Take out the guy in the front!

186
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:54,335
Come on, run.

187
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,800
Hey!

188
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:57,701
What are you doing?

189
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,134
-You need to practice.
-No I don't.

190
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,367
To the front.

191
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,235
- There it is!
- I don't think so.

192
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,367
-Go back!
-Go to the middle.

193
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:07,567
Raise your gun first.

194
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:10,202
Shoot first.

195
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,134
Okay, that's it.

196
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:13,534
- Come on, get inside.
- Hurry up.

197
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,734
Gosh, will you listen to me?

198
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:19,335
Just throw it!

199
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,301
Let me show you.

200
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:25,600
You're late.

201
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,334
I was just...

202
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,501
...hanging out with my friends.

203
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,368
School holidays start tomorrow, right?

204
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:37,468
Let's go see your mom in the evening.

205
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,334
Your mom has something to tell you.

206
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:42,101
About what?

207
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,302
She wants to leave town.

208
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:47,968
She wants to discuss it over with you.

209
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:58,867
I'll bring Joonyoung over tomorrow.

210
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:31,767
What's wrong?

211
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:32,968
Does it taste bad?

212
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,067
I copied the recipe just as it is.

213
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,368
No.

214
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:37,901
It tastes okay.

215
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,168
Did you buy that shirt recently?

216
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:42,634
It's pretty.

217
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,734
Money well spent.

218
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,801
That color always suited you.

219
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,601
It's too late.

220
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,635
It's over between us.

221
00:21:02,234 --> 00:21:04,035
I bought this three years ago.

222
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:08,068
I'm not falling for it again.

223
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
I won't make a fool out of myself.

224
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,635
Enough with the game, okay?

225
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,468
I know it's too late.

226
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:29,702
I missed a lot of things in the past.

227
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:30,936
But...

228
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,301
I don't want it to end like this.

229
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,201
We got married, went through divorce...

230
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,134
...but we never dated.

231
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,868
Our marriage was arranged by our parents.

232
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,934
So we skipped the dating part...

233
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:51,335
...and decided to go along with it.

234
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:53,802
That's where it all went wrong.

235
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,100
Although the order got mixed up,

236
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,601
I want to do all the things
we never got to do together.

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,934
We can call it quits
after we give it a try.

238
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:04,468
Okay?

239
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,967
I didn't know you were
a clingy type of guy.

240
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:14,601
- Am I putting you off?
- You're not going to win this one.

241
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,534
All this time I thought...

242
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:20,735
...making money for you was enough.

243
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:23,367
I never cleaned...

244
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:26,334
...or cooked for you.

245
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:28,634
I didn't know before,

246
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,068
but now I do.

247
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,033
You've always been a supportive wife...

248
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:38,502
...who did everything to take care of me.

249
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,434
That's how you sustained our marriage.

250
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:48,368
It's not about winning.

251
00:22:50,434 --> 00:22:51,801
I neglected you all those time...

252
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:54,068
...because I was an idiot.

253
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:56,469
So I want to do everything...

254
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,767
...that I never got to do for you.

255
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:04,101
You don't have to give anything in return.

256
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:07,801
Think of it as getting back...

257
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,034
...all the mileage you've earned.

258
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:18,502
Why are you hesitating?

259
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:20,402
What have you got to lose?

260
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,867
Done.

261
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:24,301
Why?

262
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:26,634
You don't want to?

263
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,534
I don't know.

264
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,100
All of a sudden, he's a different man.

265
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,567
It's scaring me a bit.

266
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:36,601
Holding onto a broken
relationship seems like...

267
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,168
...a waste of time.

268
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:40,434
I can tell you're still hung up on him.

269
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:42,168
But I know how it will end.

270
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:45,901
You have to try everything you want
before you die.

271
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,502
So there will be no regret.

272
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,268
Give him a chance.

273
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:54,101
I think he's matured now.

274
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:58,967
How's my health?

275
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:04,233
My test results last year were fine.

276
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:07,135
You said you have severe cramps, right?

277
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:11,868
I think it's adenomyosis.

278
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,335
A biopsy wouldn't be necessary.

279
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:20,202
It's not serious.

280
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,600
It's common at our age.

281
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,834
I thought it was due to stress.

282
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,834
I'm not that healthy after all.

283
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,402
I feel depressed because
I feel like I'm getting old.

284
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:34,002
Everyone gets old.

285
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,368
Let's see how it goes
as you take your medicine.

286
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,901
We can just leave it
unless it gets bigger.

287
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:46,001
It's almost time for lunch, right?

288
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:49,402
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

289
00:24:57,934 --> 00:24:59,001
Sunwoo.

290
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,901
What brings you here?

291
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,768
She's here to see you.

292
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,134
Is your morning shift over?

293
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,534
Let's have lunch together.

294
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:08,135
I want to talk to you about something.

295
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:09,501
You seem to be in a good mood.

296
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:11,768
It must be good news.

297
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,300
Perfect timing.

298
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,101
I just happened to have something...

299
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:18,835
...to tell you guys.

300
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:21,367
Have you decided?

301
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:23,467
I guess.

302
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:27,101
Is there something I don't know about?

303
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:28,502
Did you...

304
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,001
...get a boyfriend too?

305
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,434
Are you dating?

306
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:33,235
Don't be silly.

307
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,635
Let's go.

308
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,235
I'll tell you at lunch.

309
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,834
Shall we?

310
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:41,735
(Joonyoung's Teacher)

311
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,500
Hello?

312
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:45,568
Hello, how have you been?

313
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,533
Joonyoung did what?

314
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,735
Okay.

315
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,567
I'll be on my way.

316
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,501
I'm sorry. Let's talk next time.

317
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,867
That's not important. Go now.

318
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:13,535
Wait.

319
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:15,368
I can't inform Dr. Gong
because he's not here.

320
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,534
- Can you tell him?
- Okay, I'll tell him.

321
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,401
Don't worry. Go take care of Joonyoung.

322
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,734
Although we parted,

323
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,667
we're called in at the same time
when it's regarding our child.

324
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,201
What are we?

325
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,001
The conjugal tie we once had...

326
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,202
When will it end?

327
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,634
I heard you two are divorced.

328
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:42,934
Which one of you is living with him?

329
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:47,267
I'm sorry if my question
made you uncomfortable,

330
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:52,134
But I want to take an objective
view on Joonyoung's situation.

331
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,068
He's staying with me at the moment.

332
00:27:57,601 --> 00:27:58,402
I heard...

333
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:01,867
...he fought with Haekang.

334
00:28:02,968 --> 00:28:04,335
Is he hurt  badly?

335
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:07,135
Joonyoung only got some minor scrapes,

336
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:10,367
but Haekang looked much worse.

337
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:12,935
His parents took him home earlier.

338
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,433
I believe...

339
00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:16,934
...Joonyoung gave him...

340
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,967
...a one-sided beating.

341
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,402
One-sided?

342
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:26,201
-Are you sure?
-I'd like to hear...

343
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:27,667
...Joonyoung's side of the story first.

344
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:31,635
The other kids said Joonyoung
threw the first punch.

345
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:35,134
Since it happened at the
basketball court after school...

346
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:37,568
...a lot of kids saw what happened
as they were leaving school.

347
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,667
There's even a video taken by the kids.

348
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,634
Can I please see Joonyoung?

349
00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:48,001
It's true.

350
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:49,601
I threw the first punch.

351
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,235
Why did you do that?

352
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:01,934
You must've had a reason.

353
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,167
Aren't you going to tell me?

354
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,934
You have to tell us, Joonyoung.

355
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,001
Taeoh...

356
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,535
Did Haekang talk about your mom again?

357
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Is that why you hit him?

358
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:20,135
Tell me.

359
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,901
What did he say?

360
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:25,168
I stole a bag of chips.

361
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:27,101
At the Internet cafe.

362
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,634
Haekang saw me.

363
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,367
He said he was going to
tell the other kids.

364
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,001
So I told him to have it his way.

365
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:38,400
What are you, trash?

366
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:40,268
You need to grow up.

367
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,400
What did you say?

368
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:43,834
What the heck?

369
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:45,702
Hey stop!

370
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,200
Stop it!

371
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,734
-What are you guys doing?
-Stop it.

372
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:17,634
He acts like he's better than me.
It's so annoying.

373
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:25,268
I must've heard it wrong.

374
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:29,433
You stole what?

375
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:33,535
So that explains why you hit Haekang.

376
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,401
You were angry.

377
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,600
But why did you steal?

378
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,101
Why would you do something like that?

379
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:41,901
I made a mistake.

380
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:45,668
You guys make mistakes, too.

381
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,968
Right?

382
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:53,068
Whether it was intentional or not,
what you did was wrong.

383
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,467
You have to rectify your mistake
before it's too late.

384
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,534
How do you rectify a mistake?

385
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:01,235
Isn't it too late for that?

386
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:04,402
You have to sincerely apologize...

387
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:06,968
...to Haekang and
the Internet cafe owner.

388
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:08,001
Let's stay calm,

389
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:13,001
and take care of things one by one.

390
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,367
According to the principal,

391
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,267
they want to take this
to the school violence committee.

392
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
We should give a visit
to Haekang's parents first.

393
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:22,302
You two make it sound so easy.

394
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:25,468
Does everything go away if you apologize?

395
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,834
Is that how it is for grown-ups?

396
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:32,667
Lee Joonyoung.

397
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:33,568
What are you talking about?

398
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,201
We have to stop the
violence committee.

399
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,600
Let them be.

400
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,701
- I don't care.
- Lee Joonyoung!

401
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:40,502
I'm not going to school.

402
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:42,335
I'll just drop out!

403
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:16,702
What's with that attitude?

404
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,869
How could you say you'll drop out?

405
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:26,334
I'm not saying that you should
apologize unconditionally.

406
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:29,468
First, I need to know
why you did it...

407
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,802
...and what you're going to do about it.

408
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,467
Let's talk it over first, okay?

409
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:37,368
Let's go to your mom's place...

410
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:38,868
...to talk.

411
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:41,768
Why would I go there?

412
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:44,201
You can go if that's what you want.

413
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:48,134
You don't want to go to my house?

414
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:49,935
No.

415
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,535
I have nothing to say to you.

416
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:12,467
What was that talk about him smoking?

417
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:15,168
I wasn't paying attention
when you told me.

418
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:16,901
Did something happen?

419
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:20,235
Actually, Dakyung...

420
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,101
She said Joonyoung smelled
of cigarettes.

421
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:26,734
It must be the Internet cafe.

422
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:29,569
The smell clings to you
if you stay there too long.

423
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,267
Maybe he feels uncomfortable
in that house.

424
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,001
He wasn't like this when he was with me.

425
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:41,301
The worst he did was
skipping cram school.

426
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,001
Now he's acting like a different person.

427
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,233
Are you saying that it's my fault?

428
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:50,667
Is there something I don't know?

429
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,735
How would I know when he won't talk?

430
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:00,534
Damn...

431
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:07,800
What is it?

432
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:10,968
It's Docheol.

433
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:14,602
Haekang's been hospitalized.

434
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:16,101
They will get a medical certificate...

435
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,569
...and take this matter to the
school violence committee.

436
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:26,768
What do we do?

437
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,568
Of course I should know.

438
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:50,468
How's Haekang?

439
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:54,901
I can only imagine your shock.

440
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,567
Thank you for calling me, madam.

441
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,901
Yes.

442
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,935
Okay, bye.

443
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
(Councilor Cha's Wife)

444
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:19,233
You're late.

445
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,701
He got into a fight so I scolded him.

446
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,134
I heard he hit Haekang.

447
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:35,968
I have to talk it out with his parents.

448
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,200
Don't worry.

449
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:38,434
I'll sort it out.

450
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:43,701
You can try to reconcile,
but that won't solve the problem.

451
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,301
It's not going to end even if
he avoids committee hearing.

452
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,967
What about him stealing stuffs?

453
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,634
Is he even sorry for what he did?

454
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:52,868
So?

455
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,534
What do you want to do?

456
00:35:54,634 --> 00:35:55,968
Do you want to punish him?

457
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:57,768
It's going to hurt,

458
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:01,901
but maybe it's better for Joonyoung
to receive proper punishment.

459
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:04,202
- Don't you agree?
- He's an adolescent.

460
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,367
Boys at his age make mistakes.
It's not like he committed...

461
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:08,934
...a serious crime.

462
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,168
I'm trying to make him understand.

463
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,867
He regrets what he did.

464
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:20,935
Do you think what he did was
a troubled adolescent acting out?

465
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,434
I'll make sure this doesn't
happen again, okay?

466
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:06,535
How's Haekang?

467
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,767
Can I go in there and...

468
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:10,202
...see how serious his injury is?

469
00:37:10,267 --> 00:37:12,135
For what?

470
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,967
I want to apologize to Haekang first.

471
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,401
And to you, madam.

472
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:21,068
I'm so sorry.

473
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:27,368
Do you think it was just
a little fight between the kids...

474
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:30,767
...that the adults can
come to terms about?

475
00:37:30,968 --> 00:37:33,968
I'll bring Joonyoung here soon
so he can apologize.

476
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:38,268
I thought I should do what's right
and apologize.

477
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:40,502
I'm so sorry.

478
00:37:40,868 --> 00:37:41,901
Hey.

479
00:37:43,634 --> 00:37:48,001
Do you think I'm using the kids
for a personal vendetta?

480
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:49,801
What do you take me for?

481
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,635
I didn't mean it like that.

482
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,368
What my son did was unforgivable.

483
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:01,101
No compensation will be enough
when your son got hurt.

484
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,335
But it's only right that I...

485
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:08,234
...take care of the medical bills and
give you all the compensation you want.

486
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:12,167
Do I look like a beggar? How annoying.

487
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:16,767
They've been friends
since they were little.

488
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,702
What happened between them...

489
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,268
...really breaks my heart.

490
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,001
Madam.

491
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:29,202
Please forgive Joonyoung just this once.

492
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:31,634
I give you my word that
this won’t happen again.

493
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:34,302
Joonyoung's not a bad kid.

494
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,934
You know that.

495
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:41,333
"He's not a bad kid"?

496
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Well...

497
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:47,634
Some parents are in delusion that they
know everything about their kids.

498
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:51,635
Did he tell you why he hit him?

499
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,467
My son...

500
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:59,200
...got hit for giving your son an advice.

501
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:00,302
Yes.

502
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:02,567
I heard.

503
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,568
I've taught him wrong.

504
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,534
Some things just can't be taught.

505
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:14,600
You don't think that was
the first time he stole, do you?

506
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:19,635
Do you know that some stuffs
went missing in their classroom lately?

507
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,767
You're a doctor, so you should know.

508
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:24,769
Kleptomania requires treatment.

509
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,534
Maybe you should take him to the hospital.

510
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,400
Do you have proof?

511
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:34,768
The whole class think Joonyoung did it.

512
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,067
They're almost convinced that he did it.

513
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,968
It's so sad how you don't
know a thing about your son.

514
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,467
I apologize for him hitting your son,

515
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:48,133
but don't frame him
for the things he didn't do.

516
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:51,101
We're not going to take that from you.

517
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,267
And if you don't?

518
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:54,368
If you don't, then what?

519
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:56,335
What are you going to do?

520
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:59,034
You're threatening me
when you came here to apologize?

521
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:00,567
We will not settle.

522
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,334
Don't even dream about it.

523
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,235
We will let the committee handle it.

524
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:07,435
You and your son...

525
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,834
...better brace yourselves.

526
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:01,769
You don't think this was
the first time he stole, do you?

527
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:05,368
It's so sad how you don't
know a thing about your son.

528
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:08,200
Are you sick?

529
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:13,400
You can just take
English and math, okay?

530
00:42:15,234 --> 00:42:16,835
Good night, son.

531
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,368
What about me?

532
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:24,133
Why do I have to live like this?

533
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:30,235
It wasn't my fault.

534
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:43,901
Pardon?

535
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,600
Can you say that again?

536
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:48,501
Well...

537
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,601
It's not like that bag of chips
is worth a fortune.

538
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,867
You don't have to give me compensation.

539
00:42:54,968 --> 00:42:59,101
Just make sure your boy
doesn't sleep out.

540
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,267
I know you have to make money,

541
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:04,335
but I'm a parent too.

542
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:08,068
I let all the minors out after 10:00 PM,

543
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:11,001
but my staff must've forgotten that day.

544
00:43:11,634 --> 00:43:13,801
Your son rushed out in the morning.

545
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:16,335
Kid.

546
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:20,334
See how your father is apologizing?

547
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:21,734
Behave yourself, okay?

548
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:26,101
And don't forget we have
surveillance camera here, okay?

549
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,433
Goodness.

550
00:43:29,467 --> 00:43:30,867
I'm sorry.

551
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:33,801
Was it that day?

552
00:43:34,234 --> 00:43:35,202
So, you didn't...

553
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:38,201
...went out to get some air that morning.

554
00:43:38,734 --> 00:43:40,635
Did you spend the night there?

555
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:42,500
I fell asleep.

556
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:45,201
It wasn't on purpose.

557
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,767
Why did you go out at night
without telling me?

558
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,634
I heard you two talk...

559
00:43:58,234 --> 00:43:59,801
...about sending me abroad to study.

560
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:02,335
I went out because
I didn't want to hear it.

561
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:04,734
I didn't want to be in that house.

562
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,433
We won't sent you against your will.

563
00:44:09,934 --> 00:44:11,902
I don't want to send you away either.

564
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,467
It's not like Dakyung...

565
00:44:14,033 --> 00:44:15,800
...had an ulterior motive either.

566
00:44:15,901 --> 00:44:19,034
She was just looking out for you.
Don't get upset.

567
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:19,901
Okay?

568
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:23,501
Let's not...

569
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:27,734
...tell your mom about this.

570
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:28,934
She will worry.

571
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:33,435
Are you worried...

572
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,068
...that Mom would worry?

573
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:38,001
That day...

574
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,434
Why did you hit her?

575
00:44:43,234 --> 00:44:45,135
It's over between you two.

576
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:47,735
You put each other through hell.

577
00:44:48,968 --> 00:44:50,802
So why are you seeing her again?

578
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,634
Why is your life so complicated?

579
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:55,934
You two have nothing
to do with each other.

580
00:44:57,868 --> 00:44:59,335
Even though we're divorced,

581
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:03,335
you're still our son.

582
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:07,535
A couple can give up on marriage,
but not their children.

583
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,334
I know we put you through a lot,

584
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:16,767
but we're the ones who love you the most.

585
00:45:17,934 --> 00:45:19,234
You're using me as an excuse again?

586
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:23,235
Don't you think that's cowardly?

587
00:45:29,734 --> 00:45:32,535
The first thing I saw in
Joonyoung was hatred.

588
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,367
He was scratching Chairman Yeo's car.

589
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,568
So the cause to all his problems is...

590
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:45,834
...the divorce?

591
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:49,502
You won't find an answer from the past.

592
00:45:49,968 --> 00:45:51,402
If you want a solution,

593
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:53,568
you should focus on the present.

594
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:04,135
The committee hearing
date has been set.

595
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,300
It's better if you settle before then.

596
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:10,402
Have you met with Haekang's family?

597
00:47:46,634 --> 00:47:48,834
We're going to see Haekang at
the hospital tomorrow. Don't be late.

598
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,100
Hello, madam.

599
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,135
It's Yeo Dakyung.

600
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,001
How's Haekang?

601
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:33,334
That's great.

602
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:35,867
Yes.

603
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:38,634
I wanted to talk to you about that.

604
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:56,567
Maybe it's better if you stay outside.

605
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,735
You're not in good terms
with Haekang's mother.

606
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:03,166
That's why I should mend fences with her.

607
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:13,435
Don't worry, Joonyoung.

608
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,634
I'll take care of this, okay?

609
00:49:38,234 --> 00:49:39,835
We're here, madam.

610
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:49,302
Thank you so much for your time.

611
00:49:56,934 --> 00:49:58,168
I'm sorry, Docheol.

612
00:49:59,334 --> 00:50:01,367
It's my fault for not
teaching my son properly.

613
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,801
You know how boys are.
They fight all the time.

614
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:07,934
Honey.

615
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:11,335
Is that all you can say after
the doctor told us...

616
00:50:11,434 --> 00:50:13,834
...that Haekang could've suffered
a fractured facial bone?

617
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:15,435
I'm sorry.

618
00:50:17,968 --> 00:50:20,502
I'll discipline Joonyoung...

619
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,968
...so he doesn't do something
like this again.

620
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:26,535
You should.

621
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:31,034
I'm so worried about him
as a parent myself.

622
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:33,934
If discipline actually works,

623
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:35,768
then why would we need judges...

624
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:38,802
...and the police?

625
00:50:52,267 --> 00:50:54,101
I'm sorry, madam.

626
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,433
Joonyoung.

627
00:50:57,234 --> 00:50:59,601
We'd like to hear your side of the story.

628
00:51:13,801 --> 00:51:15,035
I'm sorry.

629
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:17,433
I won't hit you again.

630
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:19,802
Whatever.

631
00:51:20,634 --> 00:51:22,801
You should apologize for
treating me like a nut-job.

632
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:26,335
You were always kind of stuck-up,

633
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,234
but you were never reckless.

634
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:31,268
Sleeping outside and stealing stuffs?

635
00:51:31,868 --> 00:51:33,435
That's not like you.

636
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:54,535
I told you to get your act together
because I was worried about you.

637
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,667
But you called me a liar...

638
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,767
...and denied everything.

639
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,034
You treated me like an idiot.

640
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:14,368
Say you're sorry.

641
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:24,035
I guess he's not ready to apologize.

642
00:52:25,067 --> 00:52:26,334
Please leave.

643
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:45,668
I'm sorry, Haekang.

644
00:52:48,534 --> 00:52:50,135
Can you please forgive him
just this once...

645
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,769
...for my sake?

646
00:52:56,968 --> 00:52:58,869
Councilor Cha, Madam...

647
00:52:59,501 --> 00:53:01,235
I'm so sorry.

648
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:04,434
What are you doing?
You're making us uncomfortable.

649
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:07,368
- You should get up now.
- I'll make sure...

650
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:10,568
...Joonyoung doesn't act out again.

651
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:16,168
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

652
00:53:55,434 --> 00:53:57,035
Hello, madam.

653
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,368
Hello, Councilor Cha.

654
00:53:59,434 --> 00:54:01,567
My goodness. Hello, Dakyung.

655
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:12,233
Haekang seemed to enjoy this last time.

656
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:15,768
You didn't have to come all the way here.

657
00:54:15,968 --> 00:54:17,769
You really didn't have to.

658
00:54:18,033 --> 00:54:20,700
It's nothing compared to
the pain you've felt.

659
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:25,534
Haekang.

660
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:29,868
Have you talked with Joonyoung?

661
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:34,401
I'm so sorry.

662
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:52,267
Ms. Ji?

663
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:54,667
Would you please leave?

664
00:54:56,267 --> 00:54:58,667
You're making everyone uncomfortable.

665
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:03,868
People might think we're
pulling a power trip on you.

666
00:55:05,834 --> 00:55:07,601
Please just go.

667
00:55:56,934 --> 00:55:58,802
When someone feels really sorry,

668
00:55:59,601 --> 00:56:02,302
they're at a loss for words.

669
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:05,367
Joonyoung feels really bad
about what he did to you.

670
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:08,001
Isn't that right, Joonyoung?

671
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,368
What happened is mostly my fault.

672
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,367
I thought it would be a good idea
if we send Joonyoung abroad to study.

673
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:21,635
I guess that upset him a lot.

674
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:24,968
Joonyoung had a hard time
because of my carelessness.

675
00:56:25,067 --> 00:56:27,100
And if he goes to the committee hearing
because of what happened...

676
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:31,101
...I'd feel to guilty to see him again.

677
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:34,434
And to Taeoh.

678
00:56:36,868 --> 00:56:39,802
Please forgive Joonyoung for my sake.

679
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:43,867
Taeoh and I will teach him properly
so he doesn't do this again.

680
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:48,001
It's not something you
should apologize for.

681
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:51,001
My parents also feel bad
about what Joonyoung did.

682
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:52,500
Also,

683
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,502
they're concerned about...

684
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,501
...you and your husband.

685
00:57:01,968 --> 00:57:03,702
I don't think this is all necessary...

686
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:05,868
...over a fight between kids.

687
00:57:05,934 --> 00:57:06,934
You and I go way back.

688
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:51,768
Thank you.

689
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,867
It all went well thanks to you.

690
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,435
Joonyoung.

691
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:04,001
I'm a pretty good listener.

692
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:07,535
You can always talk to me
if you're upset about something.

693
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,333
Like a friend.

694
00:58:10,968 --> 00:58:15,635
You need to be happy for us to be happy.

695
00:58:31,234 --> 00:58:33,768
The results will be out in a few days.

696
00:58:33,834 --> 00:58:35,368
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

697
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:37,135
Take care.

698
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:39,234
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

699
00:58:45,434 --> 00:58:46,968
How many more patients do we have left?

700
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,634
We have two more.

701
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:53,001
It must be exhausting to treat
patients after such a long time.

702
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,867
I'm not tired.

703
00:58:54,968 --> 00:58:58,335
I have an appointment,
but this place is falling apart.

704
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:00,268
I'm stumped.

705
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:02,601
- Is it golf?
- A meeting between hospital directors.

706
00:59:02,701 --> 00:59:03,935
You mean golf.

707
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:08,101
Did Dr. Ji say how long she'll be out?

708
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:10,467
Just for today.

709
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:13,234
Give her a break.
It's about her son's future.

710
00:59:13,334 --> 00:59:15,068
I didn't say anything.

711
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:17,801
- Send in the next patient.
- Yes, Dr. Gong.

712
00:59:20,901 --> 00:59:23,001
I thought you took the day off.

713
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,367
Why are you here?

714
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:28,834
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Dr. Gong.

715
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:31,701
I'll take all the patient appointments
for this afternoon.

716
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:33,135
All right then.

717
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,200
Go ahead.

718
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:42,467
Don't worry. I explained
everything to Dr. Gong.

719
00:59:42,934 --> 00:59:43,902
Thank you.

720
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:46,001
I heard Dakyung sorted things out.

721
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
You know how Councilor Cha's wife
can't shut her mouth.

722
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,068
The word got around.

723
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,433
Dr. Ji.

724
00:59:56,033 --> 00:59:58,534
Can you take a patient right away?

725
00:59:59,067 --> 01:00:00,768
Okay.

726
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,500
Let's talk later.

727
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,467
How does it look, Doctor?

728
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:15,900
When did you start getting stomachaches?

729
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:20,500
It started a while ago,
but it seems to be getting worse.

730
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:23,934
And you feel gassy, right?

731
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,700
Yes. Actually, I was diagnosed with
irritable bowel syndrome before.

732
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:32,468
Do you think it relapsed?

733
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:34,768
You get constipation and
diarrhea frequently.

734
01:00:35,434 --> 01:00:37,534
It does look like
irritable bowel syndrome.

735
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,101
Take the medicines I prescribed for you,

736
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,168
and come see me again
if it doesn't improve.

737
01:00:42,734 --> 01:00:44,602
Is there any chance that you're pregnant?

738
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:45,667
No.

739
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:48,934
I do have an irregular cycle though.

740
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:52,001
That would be all. Take your prescription.

741
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,400
Thank you.

742
01:00:56,367 --> 01:00:58,201
Do something about your
menstrual irregularity.

743
01:00:58,267 --> 01:01:00,434
I suggest you go see the gynecologist.

744
01:01:00,634 --> 01:01:03,235
Yes Doctor. Thank you.

745
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:08,100
Doctor.

746
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,268
We have quite a number
of patients lined up.

747
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:12,767
Can you work overtime today?

748
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:15,168
We can reschedule them tomorrow
if you're too tired.

749
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,034
All right. I need to make up
for the time I missed.

750
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,568
But give me 10 minutes.

751
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:21,700
Yes, Dr. Ji.

752
01:01:33,801 --> 01:01:34,769
Are you sure?

753
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:38,267
You could be mistaken.

754
01:01:38,434 --> 01:01:39,467
I'm sure.

755
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,834
Ji Sunwoo probably knows too.

756
01:01:43,234 --> 01:01:46,735
That's why she got on her knees
in front of Councilor Cha's wife.

757
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,001
I talked to Haekang's family and they
agreed not to bring it up again.

758
01:01:52,868 --> 01:01:53,769
But...

759
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:57,034
We need to keep an eye on Joonyoung.

760
01:02:00,701 --> 01:02:01,535
I feel...

761
01:02:03,334 --> 01:02:05,168
...so ashamed.

762
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:08,168
I would feel bad too if something
happens to Joonyoung.

763
01:02:08,534 --> 01:02:10,468
I feel responsible too.

764
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:14,801
I can only hold my head up
by raising Joonyoung well.

765
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:16,734
Right?

766
01:02:20,567 --> 01:02:21,634
Thanks.

767
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:23,601
But Dakyung...

768
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:27,234
I'll bear the guilt alone.

769
01:02:27,334 --> 01:02:28,768
I don't want you to feel guilty.

770
01:02:29,334 --> 01:02:30,068
Then...

771
01:02:31,734 --> 01:02:33,201
...I would feel bad.

772
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,200
I prepared myself when
we brought him here.

773
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:39,734
So...

774
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:43,035
Let me handle Joonyoung's
problems from now on.

775
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:47,568
Okay.

776
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:50,435
Thank you.

777
01:03:40,434 --> 01:03:42,068
- Here.
- Yes, Doctor.

778
01:04:00,801 --> 01:04:02,968
I'm sick of complications and troubles.

779
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,233
Things would be much simpler if you leave.

780
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,068
And that would be best for Dad too.

781
01:04:11,868 --> 01:04:13,168
You should leave now.

782
01:04:16,067 --> 01:04:17,434
Go wherever you want.

783
01:04:18,133 --> 01:04:19,400
I'll be fine.

784
01:04:41,267 --> 01:04:44,701
(Ji Sunwoo)

785
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:04,701
Aren't you going?

786
01:05:08,234 --> 01:05:09,668
Yes, I should.

787
01:05:13,767 --> 01:05:17,401
It seems like Yerim and Jehyuk
are getting back together.

788
01:05:17,934 --> 01:05:19,802
He's pretty serious this time.

789
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:21,901
He's a different man now.

790
01:05:22,801 --> 01:05:24,602
I thought as much.

791
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,167
That's great.

792
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:30,400
We should be happy for them, right?

793
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:31,335
What about you?

794
01:05:33,734 --> 01:05:34,602
What about me?

795
01:05:34,868 --> 01:05:37,168
You said you wanted to
tell us something.

796
01:05:37,868 --> 01:05:40,802
Yerim seemed to have an idea.

797
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,067
What is it?

798
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:45,001
I'm...

799
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,601
...thinking to leave Gosan.

800
01:05:50,634 --> 01:05:51,468
What?

801
01:05:54,834 --> 01:05:58,568
I will tell Dr. Gong
when the time is right.

802
01:05:58,634 --> 01:06:00,667
I'll make sure the
transition goes smoothly,

803
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:03,101
so the hospital won't be affected.

804
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,367
That's not what I'm worried about.

805
01:06:06,434 --> 01:06:07,768
What about you?

806
01:06:09,234 --> 01:06:11,267
Are you sure you can
live apart from Joonyoung?

807
01:06:18,968 --> 01:06:20,836
Joonyoung wants me to leave.

808
01:06:21,934 --> 01:06:23,234
Goodness...

809
01:06:23,934 --> 01:06:25,168
Why?

810
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:30,501
I don't know why he's pushing me away.

811
01:06:32,434 --> 01:06:35,035
What was it like for you
after your parents got divorced?

812
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:42,934
I don't know.

813
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:46,035
I was angry at both of them.

814
01:06:46,634 --> 01:06:49,502
I wondered what the deal
was with grown-ups.

815
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,167
I didn't understand what was going on.

816
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,400
You know what's funny?

817
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:58,268
I would get angry if they
didn't keep in touch,

818
01:06:58,534 --> 01:07:02,468
and when they did get in touch,
that made me angry too.

819
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:07,300
You were angry at both of them...

820
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:11,934
...because it was confusing
and complicated.

821
01:07:16,534 --> 01:07:17,335
Okay.

822
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:20,734
If that's the case,

823
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:28,168
I should be out of his life.

824
01:07:31,834 --> 01:07:32,702
Sorry.

825
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,767
I'll get going now.

826
01:07:45,801 --> 01:07:47,968
(Lee Taeoh)

827
01:07:57,801 --> 01:07:59,702
(Ji Sunwoo)

828
01:08:02,534 --> 01:08:03,601
Hey.

829
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:05,634
Let's meet right now.

830
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,434
I need to talk to you.

831
01:08:38,634 --> 01:08:39,901
Before I leave...

832
01:08:41,267 --> 01:08:43,201
...I need to tell you something.

833
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,234
I already know.

834
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,734
That wasn't the first time...

835
01:08:50,234 --> 01:08:51,801
...Joonyoung stole something.

836
01:08:52,868 --> 01:08:53,769
You know?

837
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:56,767
How?

838
01:08:56,901 --> 01:08:58,568
Dakyung told me.

839
01:08:59,033 --> 01:09:00,934
She had a talk with Councilor Cha's wife.

840
01:09:02,534 --> 01:09:03,701
Don't worry.

841
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:06,567
I'll take care of it.

842
01:09:06,667 --> 01:09:08,168
How will you take care of it?

843
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:10,302
I'll reason with him.

844
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:14,901
After everything we put him through,

845
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:18,835
we should try to be understanding.

846
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:19,901
Kleptomania...

847
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,934
...is not that simple.

848
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,601
I know what you're nervous about.

849
01:09:28,501 --> 01:09:29,901
But you can count on me.

850
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:31,502
I'll do my best...

851
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,634
...to raise him.

852
01:09:34,601 --> 01:09:36,435
So he becomes a strong, responsible man.

853
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:40,001
I'll raise him to be...

854
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:43,401
...a happy young man.

855
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:47,367
Are you sure you can raise
him without me around?

856
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:51,434
Yes.

857
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:03,767
What was that about
Joonyoung spending the night out?

858
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:06,001
Is it true what Haekang said?

859
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,968
It was that day.

860
01:10:12,734 --> 01:10:14,235
The day when I was with you.

861
01:10:22,234 --> 01:10:24,102
You two make it sound so easy.

862
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:27,268
Does everything go away if you apologize?

863
01:10:28,234 --> 01:10:29,401
Is that how it is for grown-ups?

864
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:31,168
It's over between you two.

865
01:10:31,367 --> 01:10:33,767
You put each other through hell.

866
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,901
So why are you seeing her again?

867
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,701
Why is your life so complicated?

868
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,435
You two have nothing
to do with each other.

869
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:41,801
You're using me as an excuse again?

870
01:10:43,934 --> 01:10:45,802
Don't you think that's cowardly?

871
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:50,801
Do you think...?

872
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:55,135
Could he...

873
01:10:56,734 --> 01:10:58,602
No. No way.

874
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:11,567
Where's Joonyoung right now?

875
01:12:14,133 --> 01:12:14,967
Go ahead.

876
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:16,768
What do you want to talk about?

877
01:12:23,133 --> 01:12:24,001
When you...

878
01:12:25,734 --> 01:12:27,767
...slept over at the Internet cafe...

879
01:12:28,901 --> 01:12:29,934
What about it?

880
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:33,501
By any chance,

881
01:12:38,534 --> 01:12:40,368
did you come to my place that day?

882
01:12:49,767 --> 01:12:50,401
Did you?

883
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:02,402
Yes.

884
01:14:17,734 --> 01:14:20,535
(The World of the Married)

885
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:22,368
Dr. Ji Sunwoo disappeared?

886
01:14:22,467 --> 01:14:25,534
You had a hard time due to
the wrongdoings of the adults.

887
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:27,901
I'm responsible for half of that.

888
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,801
Can we give him some time...

889
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:31,435
...so he can breathe?

890
01:14:31,501 --> 01:14:33,302
Let's trust him and wait.

891
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:34,868
Aren't you sick of this?

892
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:35,868
No.

893
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:37,434
I'm happy.

894
01:14:37,534 --> 01:14:39,435
We're a real family now.

895
01:14:39,667 --> 01:14:41,201
Do you get what I mean?

896
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,268
What's making you so nervous?

897
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,368
What I can't stand...

898
01:14:46,701 --> 01:14:48,834
...is that my son hates me.

899
01:14:48,934 --> 01:14:51,001
Whether it's hate or resentment,

900
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,100
you should respect Joonyoung's feelings.

901
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:55,001
Did something happen to Sunwoo?

902
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,834
Where's Sunwoo?
