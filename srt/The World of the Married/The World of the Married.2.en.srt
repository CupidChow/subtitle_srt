1
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,467
(The World of the Married)

2
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:12,400
Sunwoo.

3
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,801
You are in big trouble now.

4
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,402
Why?

5
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:19,701
You will be the only woman I will love...

6
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:22,234
...from now on.

7
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:29,501
Forever.

8
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:34,668
Liar.

9
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:46,101
Sunwoo!

10
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,167
Sunwoo.

11
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:10,001
Sunwoo!

12
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:18,102
So cute!

13
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,901
I love you.

14
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:51,468
Forever.

15
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:55,367
Liar.

16
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,401
Everything you said was a lie.

17
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,500
Mom.

18
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,035
Mom.

19
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Mom!

20
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:19,568
Did you find the camera?

21
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,667
Give it to me. I'll take the pictures.

22
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:33,335
Taeoh.

23
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,068
Hey!

24
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,435
You can just rip it open.

25
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,834
You are so impatient.

26
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,168
(Happy Birthday!
From Sunwoo and Joonyoung)

27
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,867
The cake got cracked.

28
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,535
Oh dear.

29
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,668
It's just rice cake.

30
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,734
(Episode 2)

31
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,133
Happy birthday!

32
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:27,534
You rock!

33
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:28,901
Happy birthday!

34
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:31,135
You flatter me.

35
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,068
I'm just using my birthday...

36
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,567
...as an excuse to have dinner
with my friends.

37
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,735
We're gathered here
for friendship and support.

38
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,667
Of course...

39
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,035
This wonderful idea...

40
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,034
...wasn't mine.

41
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,768
For three years, I've been running...

42
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:55,968
...an event company here
solely because it's my hometown.

43
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:00,535
If it weren't for our alumni,
my business would've gone under.

44
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,101
Dochul, the councilman.

45
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:07,734
Sanghyun, chairman of the
merchants association.

46
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,768
Where's Jehyuk?

47
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,101
Jehyuk, who kept the books.

48
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,800
Thank you.

49
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,135
Hey.

50
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,400
Enough with the nonsense.

51
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:22,435
Say thank you to the one
whom you're truly thankful to.

52
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,201
Sunwoo.

53
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,101
Thank you.

54
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:47,300
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

55
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,668
You've always supported my silly dreams...

56
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:02,068
...and embraced my uneasy soul.

57
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,001
Sunwoo...

58
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:06,934
I love you.

59
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,533
That's more like it.

60
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,669
I love you beyond words can describe.

61
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:19,801
Oh my!

62
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:24,901
He said he loves you.

63
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,001
You should say something in return.

64
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,634
Right!

65
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:32,668
Let's hear it!

66
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,201
-Speech!
-Speech!

67
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,901
-Speech!
-Speech!

68
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,701
Stop it!

69
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:40,502
-Speech!
-Speech!

70
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:43,001
-Speech!
-Speech!

71
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,667
-Speech!
-Speech!

72
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,900
-Say something!
-Come on!

73
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:47,869
Goodness.

74
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:25,867
I can't watch!

75
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,768
Oh my!

76
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:34,668
They're going at it.

77
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,469
You're the star of the day.

78
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,600
Enjoy every moment of it.

79
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:45,535
Thank you.

80
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,467
Bravo! Cheers everyone.

81
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,502
How pitiful I am...

82
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,701
...to conceal my devastated heart
with hypocrisy and deception.

83
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,534
So this is what purgatory is like.

84
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,034
-Hey, you're here.
-Hello, Taeoh.

85
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:31,667
-I heard you got married.
-Yes, I did.

86
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:32,967
Sorry for not being there.

87
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,501
It's okay.

88
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,467
How do I put you through
the same hell...

89
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,101
...that I'm going through?

90
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,433
In the most...

91
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,333
Fair...

92
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,501
...and perfect situation?

93
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:03,601
I'm telling you. Why would I lie?

94
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:07,235
-How do you like the party?
-I love it.

95
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,934
You two seem to keep
the spark going.

96
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,135
Maybe you'll have another baby soon.

97
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,434
What about you, Miss?

98
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:21,501
It's fun.

99
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:26,568
You're surrounded by
a bunch of middle-aged people.

100
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,468
What's so fun about that I wonder?

101
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:37,802
Let's drink until we drop dead.

102
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,867
You're drinking a lot today, Jehyuk.

103
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:42,801
This is nothing.

104
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:46,768
Dakyung teaches at the
Pilates studio I go to.

105
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,635
Is she?

106
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,068
You should join us sometime.

107
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:55,401
Women need to maintain
their shape as they age.

108
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:59,201
You'll put on weight and get saggy skin
before you know it.

109
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,201
I'll help you get in shape
without straining your joints.

110
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,301
Maybe I should.

111
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,601
-I'll be right back.
-All right.

112
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,934
-Drink up.
-Getting anxious?

113
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:24,035
-What?
-What did this guy say before?

114
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:27,435
"Embraced my uneasy soul"?

115
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:33,001
He's drunk. Guys, clean this up.

116
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,601
What have you got to be anxious about?

117
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:37,435
What's your problem?

118
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,434
Am I wrong? You don't have
to worry about losing your job.

119
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,968
Does your wife nag you
for not bringing money home?

120
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,167
Your perfect wife got you covered.

121
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:47,534
What have you got to worry about?

122
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:51,268
-What do you know?
-Gosh, cut it out!

123
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:55,235
-Not this again!
-Seriously, what's your secret?

124
00:11:55,334 --> 00:12:00,401
How did that perfect woman
fall head over heels for you?

125
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,135
Tell us your secret.

126
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,168
-Aren't you guys curious?
-Hey.

127
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,135
You're drunk. Stop it.

128
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:08,468
-We were having a good time.
-Stop it.

129
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,268
-Hey, hey.
-On this happy day?

130
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:11,835
Tell me more.

131
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,434
How does she embrace your anxiety?

132
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,668
By doing her best...

133
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,100
...day and night?

134
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:22,501
-Jehyuk...
-Hey!

135
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:26,435
-Hey! Stop it!
-Don't!

136
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,001
-Hey!
-Calm down.

137
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,533
You should take this off.

138
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,735
What a jerk.

139
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,167
What did he say?

140
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:52,101
You don't have to know.

141
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:00,600
Who were you talking to earlier?

142
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,535
Who?

143
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:06,634
Yeo Dakyung?

144
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,134
Who is she?

145
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:14,835
Mr. Yeo Byunggyu's daughter.

146
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,634
-You don't know her?
-Oh...

147
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,867
They brought their daughter?

148
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:21,769
I was wondering who that was.

149
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,200
I meant what I said earlier.

150
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,234
You know that, right?

151
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:35,834
What?

152
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,235
That I love you.

153
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:46,401
What's wrong?

154
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,001
It looks like you've had too much.

155
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,502
I'll go home now.

156
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,634
You're leaving?

157
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,334
I feel sick.

158
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:04,968
Will you be okay by yourself?

159
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:14,868
Joonyoung.

160
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:16,635
Joonyoung!

161
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,468
He's having fun with his friends.
Leave him here.

162
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,301
I'll take care of him.

163
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:33,068
Want me to walk with you
to the parking lot?

164
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,400
It's like a mask.
That's what marriage is.

165
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,834
That's ridiculous.

166
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:39,001
The best thing that ever
happened to you?

167
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,934
You love her beyond words can describe?

168
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,835
You're too young to understand.

169
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,868
Don't treat me like a child.

170
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:48,334
Now I know you were just
fooling around with me.

171
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:50,434
-Here's to our city, Gosan!
-To Gosan!

172
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,235
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

173
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,334
Do you think I'm fooling around
when I've took it this far?

174
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:03,035
Look me in the eyes and say it.

175
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,635
Do you think my love is a joke?

176
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:48,935
Everything you say is a lie.

177
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:52,035
Do you have any idea how
miserable I am right now?

178
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,767
My marriage is just an empty shell.

179
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:55,735
I love you with all my heart.

180
00:16:58,634 --> 00:16:59,535
Fine.

181
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:01,501
If you don't believe me,

182
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,635
I'll go to Mr. Yeo right now
and tell him about us.

183
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,534
Are you crazy?

184
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,501
Sort it out with your wife first.

185
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,702
All right. If you just...

186
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:19,568
-If you can just wait...
-By tomorrow.

187
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,700
"Empty-shell marriage" is so cliche.

188
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,635
A monogamous marriage...

189
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:03,368
...is bound to end up as an empty-shell.

190
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:07,035
How can you sleep with one person
for the rest of your life?

191
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,001
Wow, so progressive.

192
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,667
Don't you think so, Mr. Yeo?

193
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,767
I'm not sure.

194
00:19:13,868 --> 00:19:16,569
My wife's such a fickle woman.

195
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:19,135
-Goodness, honey.
-I don't know about that.

196
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,268
There are many loving couples like us.

197
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:26,302
Dr. Seol, I hope you find
a good partner soon.

198
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,034
What about you two?

199
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:32,936
Us?

200
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:35,233
Is your marriage happy
or an empty-shell?

201
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,734
Why don't you tell them?

202
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,001
What's our marriage like?

203
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:44,834
Why do you think we didn't have any kids?

204
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,535
Your relationship is over
the moment you have a child.

205
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:52,568
We decided to keep the passion
going between us until we die.

206
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:56,435
Is that why you remain a childless couple?

207
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:59,202
Don't you agree, Mr. Yeo?

208
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,934
It seems like you don't understand.

209
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,935
A child can actually help
a couple to stay intimate.

210
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,066
Trust me.

211
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,467
(Ovulation day)

212
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:20,968
Joonyoung!

213
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,001
Joonyoung!

214
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,335
Where are you going?

215
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,434
I'm going home.

216
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,767
Did you have a fight with your friend?

217
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,067
I just...

218
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,901
...want to go home.

219
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,567
Where's your dad?

220
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,801
What happened?

221
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,768
We got an email from China.

222
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:58,502
It seems like...

223
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:00,768
What's it about?

224
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:05,634
They decided not
to invest in our project.

225
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,201
You should call them
first thing tomorrow morning.

226
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,901
(To Sunwoo, Happy Anniversary.
Love, Taeoh)

227
00:22:08,434 --> 00:22:09,467
Joonyoung.

228
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:13,834
What happened?

229
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,668
You came home by yourself?

230
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,635
I brought him.

231
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:21,935
I thought he had a fight with his friends.

232
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:24,267
I asked him on our way here,

233
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,600
but he wouldn't tell me.

234
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,101
(October 16th to 18th:
Baseball camp with Dad!)

235
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:06,801
Would you like a glass?

236
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:09,301
Sure. I'd love to.

237
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:34,034
Didn't you leave early because
you weren't feeling well?

238
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:35,901
Why are you drinking alone?

239
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:38,201
I thought I should leave...

240
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,967
...so Taeoh can have a good time.

241
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:45,735
By the way...

242
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:47,901
What's that bag for?

243
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:49,935
I'm throwing it away.

244
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:54,301
Even the photos?

245
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,068
Yeah.

246
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:00,001
I don't like it.

247
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,101
It looked silly on the wall.

248
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:06,836
It was fun while it lasted.

249
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,401
Why do you look nervous?

250
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,601
Do you have something to say to me?

251
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,701
No, why would I?

252
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:32,701
About Taeoh...

253
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:33,967
Yeah?

254
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:36,301
Why did he fight with Jehyuk?

255
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:41,634
It's what they always do.

256
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,301
According to the other guys,

257
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:46,435
Jehyuk got on his nerves by saying...

258
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:52,135
...how Taeoh has the perfect wife
who does everything for him.

259
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,901
I just don't get that guy.

260
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:57,768
Is it some sort of inferiority complex?

261
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:03,934
Then again, after you gave birth
to Joonyoung and moved to Gosan,

262
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,467
he's been bitter about it.

263
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:10,234
You're his ideal type of woman.

264
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,133
Maybe...

265
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,734
He wants something more from you?

266
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,634
What do you mean?

267
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,334
While we were drinking, he said...

268
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:31,034
..."How can you sleep with one person
for the rest of your life"?"

269
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:33,134
Goodness.

270
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:37,468
You should've seen the
look on Yerim's face.

271
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:40,901
Do you think it's funny?

272
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:47,601
No...

273
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:51,435
What he said was completely ridiculous.

274
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,201
I couldn't believe he would
say such a thing...

275
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:57,568
...when his wife was sitting
right next to him.

276
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,901
You don't give a damn about
how others feel, do you?

277
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,300
You don't care if others are miserable.

278
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:14,001
You just get a kick out of
watching them suffer.

279
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,634
Get a kick out of it?

280
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,335
How could you say such a thing?

281
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:22,168
Were you having fun when you told me...

282
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:23,601
...that I was being oversensitive?

283
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:27,201
"Having a good-looking husband
isn't so easy"?

284
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:37,368
Do...

285
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:38,802
Do you...

286
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:41,600
You know?

287
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:46,667
Yes.

288
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:58,335
I also know...

289
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:03,268
...that you texted Taeoh
to warn him about me tailing him.

290
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:10,168
It's not like that!

291
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:12,168
What happened was...

292
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:13,634
Just hear me out.

293
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,135
He said he will break it off soon.

294
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:19,001
He asked me to keep
it a secret until then.

295
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,200
I didn't have a choice.

296
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:25,368
I was furious with that jerk too.

297
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:29,801
When was that?

298
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:33,568
About a month ago...

299
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,001
He asked me...

300
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:39,502
...to have a drink with him
out of the blue.

301
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,534
Something didn't feel right.

302
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:45,468
I asked him indirectly and
he spilled everything.

303
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:49,535
I'm so sorry I couldn't tell you.

304
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:52,634
But I didn't deceive you on purpose.

305
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,601
It was hard for me too.

306
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,367
You guys must be really good friends.

307
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,567
You even share the deepest secrets?

308
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:07,901
That jerk is not my friend,
you are.

309
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:10,001
Am I?

310
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,934
-Are you really my friend?
-Of course.

311
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:19,301
Then do the right thing from now on!

312
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:42,768
What?

313
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:45,001
Did you drop Joonyoung at home?

314
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:48,068
Took you long enough to ask.

315
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,167
How is Sunwoo?

316
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:51,534
Are you serious...

317
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:54,834
I don't know.

318
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,535
This is between you two.
Sort it out yourselves.

319
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:02,968

00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,802
Yesterday, actually.

337
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:07,101
Be happy!

338
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:10,401
Be happy!

339
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:14,602
Stay healthy!

340
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,367
Honey?

341
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:20,835
I want honey water.

342
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:14,634
(October 16th to 18th:
Baseball camp with Dad!)

343
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,635
Are you sure Dad can go?

344
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:28,467
Last year, he canceled last minute
because something came up.

345
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:30,068
What if he cancels again?

346
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:31,834
I don't trust Dad.

347
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:34,934
Dad will definitely go
this year no matter what.

348
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:36,100
Don't worry.

349
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,600
(October 16th to 18th:
Baseball camp with Dad!)

350
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:37,736
I've had way too much last night.

351
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,501
What time did I come home?

352
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,468
Good morning. Have some breakfast.

353
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:05,768
How are you feeling?

354
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,668
I feel much better now.

355
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:12,467
That's a relief.

356
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:16,868
You need to sober up.
Today's a busy day.

357
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:19,435
What?

358
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:25,068
Did you forget?

359
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:31,634
Of course I remember.

360
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:37,168
Have fun.

361
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:38,201
Okay.

362
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:44,835
I want one.

363
00:36:50,901 --> 00:36:53,001
Did I make any mistake last night?

364
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,834
When you stood up and took a pee?

365
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:04,669
Sorry.

366
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,634
I don't think I drank that much.

367
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:09,168
I must have blacked out.

368
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:10,701
And I have a bad hangover.

369
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:14,266
That's what happens
when you party too much.

370
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,501
I'm off to work.

371
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,367
Hello?

372
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:39,734
I called them back, but...

373
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,301
What did they say?

374
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:44,934
They will withdraw the investment.

375
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,334
What should I do?

376
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,767
Okay, I got it.

377
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,133
(Message: Keep your promise)

378
00:37:58,701 --> 00:37:59,901
Keep your promise.

379
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:07,735
(Delete Message)

380
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,567
Hurry up and get ready.

381
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:18,569
Coach said not to be late.

382
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:21,201
Oh, yes.

383
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:22,934
Okay.

384
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:28,035
The chairman is furious
for giving him a free pass.

385
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:30,268
I can't make excuses for him anymore.

386
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:33,168
He went AWOL for two weeks this month.

387
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:36,400
Did the board of directors
say anything else?

388
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:40,168
They will leave the decision
to the disciplinary committee.

389
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,234
Now that everyone's here,

390
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,335
shall we begin?

391
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:09,301
Since the board appointed me
as chairperson of this committee,

392
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,967
I will be leading the hearing.

393
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:15,534
Let's hear what Dr. Ma has to say.

394
00:39:17,434 --> 00:39:20,701
You're going to discipline me?
On what grounds?

395
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:25,702
I've been a doctor for 25 years
and I never made a wrong diagnosis.

396
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:28,667
Do you know how many patients
I've treated in Gosan?

397
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,934
-Dr. Ma Kangseok...
-I...!

398
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:34,867
I built this hospital with
that smug chairman.

399
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:36,634
When he refused to promote you
because you're a woman,

400
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,801
I convinced him to put
you in that position!

401
00:39:39,634 --> 00:39:41,701
After everything I've done for you?

402
00:39:42,901 --> 00:39:44,201
You're going to discipline me?

403
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,500
Dr. Ma.

404
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:47,701
Please calm down.

405
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:51,268
Those money-grabbing executives
might be fond of you,

406
00:39:51,634 --> 00:39:55,101
but I'm the one who has
what it takes to be a great doctor!

407
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,500
Dr. Ma, are you intoxicated?

408
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:02,534
-What?
-I asked if you had a drink.

409
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,100
What's that got to do with anything?

410
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:09,668
I'm not here to treat patients today.

411
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,034
Dr. Ma Kangseok, you are dismissed
from your duty as of today.

412
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:20,802
Due to your poor attendance
for two months and your alcoholism,

413
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:26,001
this hospital cannot allow you
to treat patients anymore.

414
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,068
Hey.

415
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:32,267
Ji Sunwoo.

416
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,834
We gave you chances after chances.

417
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:38,867
No hospital will accept
an alcoholic doctor.

418
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:43,867
I lost my family.

419
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,867
Do you think that will
never happen to you?

420
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:50,634
No matter how hard it was,

421
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:53,634
you shouldn't have run away
from your duties.

422
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,968
You cold-blooded girl.

423
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:04,168
Are you that sure of yourself?

424
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:08,067
Let's wait and see.

425
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,101
One day, it will happen to you.

426
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,968
How dare he.

427
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:34,901
Will it be okay?

428
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:05,133
What was that about?

429
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:08,235
I said no to her abortion.

430
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:13,601
The father cut all contacts
as soon as he heard about it.

431
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,534
You didn't have a choice.

432
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:19,501
We have to follow the rules.

433
00:42:23,267 --> 00:42:25,634
Have you talked to Taeoh?

434
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:31,401
I thought you were dumping him.

435
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:33,935
You already packed everything.

436
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,268
I haven't told him yet.

437
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:40,635
You're going to keep pretending
like you don't know?

438
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:42,367
Until when?

439
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:43,467
I should...

440
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:46,168
...send my kid to camp first.

441
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:48,800
That's not important.

442
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:51,102
He's been waiting two months for it.

443
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:54,567
I can't punish him
for what his dad did.

444
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:56,535
Are you sure it's not because
you need more time?

445
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:01,134
Well, it is a big decision.

446
00:43:01,234 --> 00:43:04,001
You should think about it carefully.

447
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:39,734
Send in the next patient.

448
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:40,635
Yes, ma'am.

449
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:45,034
Ms. Yeo Dakyung?

450
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:51,235
Go to room number one please.

451
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:11,601
My mom kept recommending me
to seek treatment from you.

452
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:21,800
Let's go inside.

453
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:34,135
What the hell is going on?

454
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,401
What seems to be the problem?

455
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:57,801
I'm aching all over,
and I'm not getting better.

456
00:45:10,634 --> 00:45:11,734
When did it start?

457
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:13,835
About two, three weeks ago?

458
00:45:14,334 --> 00:45:15,768
I think.

459
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:25,934
I need to pull up your top.

460
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:46,335
Any coughs or phlegm?

461
00:45:48,634 --> 00:45:49,602
No.

462
00:46:00,501 --> 00:46:01,835
Do you drink or smoke?

463
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:03,601
I don't smoke.

464
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:05,601
I drink occasionally.

465
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:07,435
But I haven't had one recently.

466
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,634
What about your sex life?

467
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:17,534
Do I have to tell you about that?

468
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:21,135
It's a basic question.
I need you to be honest.

469
00:46:21,234 --> 00:46:23,267
Are you seeing anyone regularly?

470
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:24,867
Or...

471
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,569
Several?

472
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:30,667
I'm seeing one.

473
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:34,735
I can't see him everyday.

474
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,300
Maybe two or three times a week.

475
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:40,634
He's married.

476
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:47,202
Does his wife know?

477
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,167
She has no clue.

478
00:46:56,634 --> 00:46:57,468
Really?

479
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:58,767
Are you sure?

480
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:03,202
He says his marriage is like a mask.

481
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,834
He says he's unhappy.

482
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:09,535
It's just an empty-shell
of a marriage.

483
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,367
If he's unhappy...

484
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:22,368
Then why won't he divorce his wife?

485
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:23,734
I guess it's complicated.

486
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:26,301
He has a kid.

487
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,734
And there are some financial issues too.

488
00:47:32,901 --> 00:47:34,468
That's why marriage...

489
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:37,201
...is so troublesome.

490
00:48:06,234 --> 00:48:07,501
I need to draw your blood.

491
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:10,934
I thought nurses do this kind of work.

492
00:48:11,868 --> 00:48:13,202
I do it from time to time.

493
00:49:01,534 --> 00:49:03,701
The result will come out
in about two hours.

494
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,101
What are you testing?

495
00:49:07,734 --> 00:49:09,435
Since you have a mild fever,

496
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:12,934
we need to check for bacteria,
viruses, flu, allergies,..

497
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:16,168
...and STDs.

498
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:23,868
Are we done?

499
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,767
I need a urine sample.

500
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,700
Don't you use protection?

501
00:52:01,434 --> 00:52:02,567
What do you mean?

502
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:10,767
You're pregnant.

503
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,901
Since you're seeing one guy...

504
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:29,901
It must be him.

505
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,067
You must be torn right now
since he's married.

506
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:41,601
That's why marriage is so troublesome.

507
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:52,701
I'll go see a gynecologist.

508
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:54,869
Okay.

What are you going to do with her?

511
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:42,301
Did she go to you?

512
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:45,569
What did she say?

513
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,500
First, she told me...

514
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:50,402
...not to tell anyone.

515
00:53:55,834 --> 00:53:57,768
-Not even Taeoh?
-No.

516
00:53:58,067 --> 00:53:59,701
She told me not to tell him.

517
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:01,335
Why not?

518
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:05,368
She wants an abortion.

519
00:54:08,033 --> 00:54:09,233
What should I do?

520
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:15,134
You should tell her no.

521
00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:17,368
That's our policy.

522
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:19,500
What if she gives birth?

523
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,467
Are you...

524
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,101
...really going to split up
with Taeoh like this?

525
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,501
Are you going to divorce him?

526
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:35,101
What are you thinking?

527
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:43,767
Why did she go to you?

528
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,167
If she doesn't want Taeoh to know,
why would she tell you?

529
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
She probably came to me
instead of another doctor...

530
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,500
...since I already knew
what's going on.

531
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,001
If she wants an abortion...

532
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:10,001
Does that mean she wants
to break things off?

533
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:12,434
They've been seeing each
other for only three months.

534
00:55:12,634 --> 00:55:14,435
She's only 24 years old.

535
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:15,801
Why would she want a baby?

536
00:55:15,901 --> 00:55:16,835
Not to mention,

537
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:19,934
she got pregnant by a married man.

538
00:55:23,334 --> 00:55:24,268
Let's do the abortion.

539
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:25,735
I'll operate on her myself.

540
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:29,101
-It's what she wants.
-Dr. Seol!

541

Do you want your license revoked?

The girl who's been sleeping with
your husband got pregnant!

544

Still, we can't do the abortion
in this hospital.

545
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,135
We have to follow the rules.

546

Seriously...

547
00:55:50,033 --> 00:55:52,367
You're thinking about rules
even in a moment like this?

548
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,768
You are relentless.

Are you having fun?

00:58:31,033 --> 00:58:32,867
I made a base hit!

What kind of bullshit is that?

01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:48,001
There are plenty of disorders
to label a scumbag like you...

...who constantly beats his girlfriend.

618
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,700
She deserves to get beat.

You don't know anything.

Don't stick your nose
in my business, lady!

You still don't get it, do you?

622
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:07,569
Take this opportunity to learn.

623
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:12,101
People with mental illness
who hurt themselves or others...

624
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:15,034
can be involuntarily admitted...

...to a psychiatric hospital
with the governor's approval.

626

So what?

627
01:04:20,634 --> 01:04:22,301
You're going to accuse me
of being crazy...

628
01:04:22,601 --> 01:04:24,469
...and put me in a mental institution?

629
01:04:27,133 --> 01:04:29,467
How dare you threaten me?

630
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:31,735
I'm not some crazy old lady.

631
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:35,434
I'm the assistant director
at Family Love Hospital.

632
01:04:37,701 --> 01:04:39,935
I can have the local hospital committee
take action.

633
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:43,334
Or use one of my connections
in the local government.

634
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:46,402
All I need is Hyunseo's injury report...

635

and a psychiatric assessment
on your mental illness...

01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:55,035
I got frustrated so I went
to your bar for a drink.

639
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,667
I was told you weren't feeling so well.

640
01:06:05,234 --> 01:06:06,835
So I decided to give you a visit.

641
01:06:09,534 --> 01:06:10,667
By the way...

642
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,734
Did you find out who the other woman is?

643
01:06:25,534 --> 01:06:27,168
She's pregnant.

644
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,300
She's pregnant?

645
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:35,834
That is so messed up.

646
01:06:38,767 --> 01:06:40,501
She wants an abortion though.

647
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,401
At least that's good news.

648
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:45,467
It means they're not that serious.

649
01:06:46,934 --> 01:06:48,468
Really?

650
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:51,001
It's just a fling.

651
01:06:51,934 --> 01:06:55,868
It's just animal attraction
towards a younger woman.

652
01:06:58,434 --> 01:07:00,501
That's just how men are.

653
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,201
What will you do from now on?

654
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:18,001
I did leave in the heat of the moment...

655
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:25,268
I guess I'll sleep in a sauna house
for a few days....

656
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,200
...and then go back.

657
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:34,068
You want to stay with that punk?

658
01:07:36,601 --> 01:07:38,035
Do you really want to...

659
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,901
...waste away your life like that?

660
01:07:44,133 --> 01:07:46,667
What if his life depends on me?

661
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:50,601
He has...

662
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:53,768
...no one to rely on except me.

663
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,801
He's just venting out his anger
because his life got screwed.

664
01:07:59,634 --> 01:08:01,368
But he's not a bad guy.

665
01:08:03,234 --> 01:08:04,068
I will...

666
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,600
...make a decent guy out of him.

667
01:08:25,567 --> 01:08:27,834
People don't change that easily.

668
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:37,735
Did it ever occur to you
that you could've died?

669
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,300
I love him.

670
01:08:55,133 --> 01:08:56,300
Here you go.

671
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,167
Be careful of wound infection
until we take the stitches out.

672
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,867
You can stay here for a few days...

673
01:09:11,968 --> 01:09:13,836
...until I find a place for you.

674
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:16,801
Don't ever think about going back.

675
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:20,235
What about you, Doctor?

676
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,567
What about you?

677
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:26,601
What are you going to do?

678
01:09:33,367 --> 01:09:34,567
Great job guys!

679
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:36,101
-Goodbye, Coach.
-Bye.

680
01:09:37,334 --> 01:09:38,835
I could've hit a home run.

681
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:40,735
-Yeah right!
-I totally can!

682
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:44,435
-You would've struck out.
-Hey! I'm your dad.

683
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:46,534
-Come here.
-That hurts.

684
01:09:47,067 --> 01:09:49,701
-Tap out!
-Okay, okay.

685
01:09:50,834 --> 01:09:51,668
Mom!

686
01:10:03,968 --> 01:10:06,168
Judging from that smile on your face,
you must've had fun.

687
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:07,101
Yes.

688
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:09,600
How have you been?

689
01:10:10,434 --> 01:10:11,601
Did you miss us?

690
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:14,968
You must be tired.

691
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:18,168
You were faster.

692
01:10:18,534 --> 01:10:20,435
I do run pretty fast.

693
01:10:20,501 --> 01:10:21,634
Yeah, right.

694
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:23,467
But still...

695
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:27,502
-It's here.
-The steak is here!

696
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:29,734
Let's dig in.

697
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:31,568
Thank you for the food.

698
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,734
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

699
01:10:34,834 --> 01:10:36,435
Cheers to your health.

700
01:10:43,267 --> 01:10:47,400
-I was playing catch...
-Right.

701
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:51,701
I threw it at full speed.

702
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:54,568
-But the ball hit him.
-Where?

703
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,469
There?

704
01:10:59,434 --> 01:11:02,701
Oh boy, I shouldn't laugh.

705
01:11:03,534 --> 01:11:06,201
So that's why he looked
funny when he ran.

706
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,667
-Right?
-His running was so clumsy.

707
01:11:09,267 --> 01:11:10,934
He says his marriage is like a mask.

708
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,468
He says he's unhappy.

709
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,034
It's just an empty-shell
of a marriage.

710
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:21,568
Let's play that baseball video game.

711
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:23,335
Can we...

712
01:11:24,334 --> 01:11:27,701
...play baseball games just
for two hours after dinner?

713
01:11:27,801 --> 01:11:29,168
-No, one hour.
-Just one hour.

714
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:30,434
Can't we play for one hour?

715
01:11:30,534 --> 01:11:31,801
-One hour.
-We promise.

716
01:11:31,868 --> 01:11:33,235
Just one hour, please?

717
01:11:35,567 --> 01:11:37,034
Goodness...

718
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,334
-Okay! Yes!
-Okay!

719
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:42,135
-Let's finish this quickly.
-Okay.

720
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,567
Eat up.

721
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:49,601
This is really good.

722
01:11:52,701 --> 01:11:56,001
I love him.

723
01:12:52,367 --> 01:12:53,434
Where did Joonyoung go?

724
01:12:55,601 --> 01:12:59,035
He left early to go to school
with his friend.

725
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:19,801
How's work?

726
01:13:20,534 --> 01:13:21,901
The investor...

727
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:24,834
...asked me to make some
changes to the script.

728
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:25,768
So...

729
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:28,568
Other than that, it's all right.

730
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:46,735
You're seeing...

731
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,400
...another woman, aren't you?

732
01:13:57,634 --> 01:13:59,001
What did you just say?

733
01:14:00,467 --> 01:14:02,901
Tell me the truth.

734
01:14:05,334 --> 01:14:07,634
We talked about this
when we got married.

735
01:14:08,267 --> 01:14:11,734
We could get attracted to
other people at some point.

736
01:14:11,834 --> 01:14:13,934
We promised to be honest about it.

737
01:14:19,434 --> 01:14:20,467
Remember?

738
01:14:22,434 --> 01:14:24,068
If you come clean...

739
01:14:24,801 --> 01:14:26,769
...right now,

740
01:14:29,801 --> 01:14:31,435
and get her out of your life,

741
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:34,068
then I might be able to forgive you.

742
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,400
It was just...

743
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,133
a moment of...

744
01:14:44,834 --> 01:14:46,501
...physical attraction.

745
01:14:47,334 --> 01:14:48,268
Right?

746
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,667
It's so hard for me to bear
even if you were having a fling.

747
01:15:03,534 --> 01:15:06,834
But one day I'll be fine.
We still have many years ahead of us.

748
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:09,767
But I won't forgive you if you lie.

749
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:13,568
That would be real betrayal.

750
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:19,601
So be honest with me.

751
01:15:28,968 --> 01:15:29,902
Are you...

752
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:34,634
...having an affair?

753
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:40,834
Are you serious?

754
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:45,068
You think I'm having an affair?

755
01:15:46,434 --> 01:15:47,868
Yes you are!

756
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:54,001
We talked about this the other day.
What's wrong with you?

757
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,201
-I'm not cheating with anybody.
-Don't lie to me.

758
01:15:57,334 --> 01:15:59,701
-Please.
-What do you take me for?

759
01:16:00,734 --> 01:16:03,867
-What happened to the trust between us?
-Stop lying to me!

760
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:06,834
-Don't disappoint me!
-I'm the one who's disappointed!

761
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:09,868
This conversation is pointless.

762
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:14,235
I don't have time to waste like this.
I'm a busy man!

763
01:16:16,467 --> 01:16:17,567
Don't cry.

765

You're still...

766
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:28,935
You're the only woman I love.

767
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:30,001
Don't you know that?

768
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,767
It's because you're swamped at work.

769
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:42,868
All that stress...

770
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,767
It seems like you're
emotionally distressed.

771
01:17:03,734 --> 01:17:04,635
Okay.

772
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,367
Maybe you're right.

773
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,467
Are you all right?

774
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,067
You said...

775
01:17:29,834 --> 01:17:31,568
...that I'm the only woman you love.

776
01:17:32,067 --> 01:17:32,935
That's right.

777
01:17:37,267 --> 01:17:38,267
All right.

778
01:17:39,934 --> 01:17:40,934
Okay then.

779
01:17:42,501 --> 01:17:44,735
That's clear enough for me.

780
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,867
You son of a bitch.

I told you to keep your promise.
Why aren't you responding?

I told you not to contact

You want to break up? Why?
