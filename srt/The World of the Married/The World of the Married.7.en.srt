It's the best location in town.

8

Everything was made
with top-quality materials.

9

We only have a few houses left.

Why don't you make
a deposit first?

11
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:07,601
I'll think about it
until the weekend.

- I'm not late, am I?
- You barely made it on time.

18
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,935
- Where were you?
- I had something to do.

19

Hello.

27

I owe it to the people of Gosan.

28

Hey.

29
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,467
I bought that yesterday!

31
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,133
Have you watched "Good Life"?

32
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,601
I liked it.

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,168
No.

34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,634
Why haven't you watched?
You said your dad made it.

35
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,034
- Liar.
- For real.

36
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,934
Joonyoung's dad produced that movie.

37
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,534
-His dad is a friend of my dad.
-That's awesome.

Hey, can you get some
free tickets from your dad?

39

Hey.

40
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:07,568
Joonyoung doesn't live with his dad.

41
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,067
Don't they keep in touch?

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,268
Dude, buy your own ticket.
You're not some bum.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,801
What's his problem?

44
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,667
Fine! I don't want it anyway!

Joonyoung.

46
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,568
Your dad's here.

47
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,200
- Who's that?
- Joonyoung's dad.

48
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,701
He's the producer of "Good Life."

49
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,068
- Really?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:49,968
- Did you know?
- No.

51
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:52,635
Get in.

52
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,668
I envy you.

53
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:00,201
I heard your son-in-law's
movie is that good.

54
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,767
I saw it and it was really good.

55
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,102
No wonder it attracted more
than ten million audience.

56

That's right.

57
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:10,301
My husband said if he had
realized Taeoh's talent,

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,201
he would've supported him sooner.

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,767
Now he's praising Taeoh to the sky.

60
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,635
He should.

61
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,335
I agree. He is indeed talented.

62
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,934
So I'll see you ladies then.

63
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,166
-Yes.
-Of course.

64
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:25,235
Excuse me.

65
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:26,668
Madam! Excuse me.

66
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,601
Madam!

67
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,068
This way.

68
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,235
Weren't you and Dr. Ji close?

69
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:41,200
Our husbands were friends.

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,767
It didn't seem necessary for
us to meet after her divorce.

71
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,701
And I felt kind of awkward.

72
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:48,868
Of course it's awkward.
I feel the same way.

73
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,500
Have you opened it?

74
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,767
Pretty.

75
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,401
She must've spent a lot on this.

76
00:04:58,534 --> 00:04:59,701
Goodness.

77
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:07,901
What is she doing?

78
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:11,401
- Is she inviting her?
- No way!

79
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:31,634
Hello.

80
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,068
Have you watched my movie?

81
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:42,769
Not yet.

82
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,301
Did you know that I made it?

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,868
Why didn't you direct
instead of producing?

84
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:51,901
It's the producer's job...

85
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,201
...to oversee everything.

86
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,501
Haekang said he enjoyed it.

87
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,233
Didn't you...

88
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,102
...miss me?

89
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,567
You know, I...

90
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,101
I missed you a lot.

91
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:23,034
I haven't heard from you all this time.

92
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,133
I don't know if I can buy that.

93
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,634
I...

94
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,867
I made myself look like an awful person.

95
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:37,701
And I disappointed you.

96
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,700
I wanted to change.

97
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,201
I wanted to become a better dad...

98
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,234
...and come back with my head held high.

99
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,168
So that you...

100
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,635
...don't have to be embarrassed of me.

101
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,967
I needed some time for that.

102
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,234
I hope you understand.

103
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:12,835
It's for you. Open it.

104
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,333
You still play baseball, right?

105
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,702
I quit a long time ago.

106
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,335
Did your mom...

107
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,500
...make you quit because it
hinders your studies?

108
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,500

You were his fan.

111
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,567
I'll introduce you to him.

112
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,500
- Really?
- Sure.

113
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,767
He's coming to my house that day.

114

We're not really on friendly terms.

Think about how confusing
this can be for him.

Why would he be confused
about seeing his dad?

Isn't that wrong?

We're going to see the doctor tomorrow.

170
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,767
- Don't be late.
-I've already cleared my schedule.

171
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,367
After one more assignment,

172
00:14:01,868 --> 00:14:03,736
this semester will be over.

173
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,668
Dad said he sent me an invitation card.

174
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,600
I threw it away.

175
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:16,967
Are you upset?

176
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:18,668
No.

177
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:20,868
I'm not going anyway.

178
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,068
By the way,

179
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,968
you haven't registered
for your baseball camp.

180
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:33,934
I can go with you this time.

181
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,301
I can take about two days off.

182
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,500
It's fine.

183
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,368
You don't know much about baseball anyway.

184
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:42,668
You sure you don't want to go?

185
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,802
Then what will you do this vacation?

186
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,101
Would you like to go on a trip with me?

187
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,334
I'll just attend a cram school.

188
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:55,535
The one with the prep course
you talked about.

189
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,534
That one would do.

190
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:02,135
You sound like you're cutting me a slack.

191
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:06,068
I didn't suggest prep course
for my benefit, you know.

192
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:08,401
I'm going to sleep now.

193
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,300
You can just take
English and math, okay?

194
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,567
I'll register you online tonight.

195
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,634
Good night, Joonyoung.

196
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,901
Bring your bat when you come
to my house.

197
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,834
I'll get an autograph from Kang.

198

Joonyoung.

199
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,800
You're visiting your dad's house.

200
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,869
Don't mind about your mom.

201
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:41,802
Did you hear the news?

202
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:43,735
Dr. Ji's ex-husband is coming back.

203
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:44,901
Hello.

204
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,534
It's the talk of the town.
Everyone knows about it.

205
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,200
It's no surprise why.

206
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,934
Her ex-husband who cheated on her
is moving in next door.

207
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,800
-Good morning.
-Hello.

208
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:57,435
Not to mention he made it big time.

209
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,734
I'd go crazy if I were in her place.

210
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:02,835
Give it to me. I'll do it.

211
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,734
How can she be so casual about it?

212
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,068
She's got some nerves.

213
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:14,235
Does it look like she's being casual?

214
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,435
She's only pretending because
there are eyes everywhere.

215
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:19,967
Right.

216
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,034
Her makeup and fashion are
over the top these days.

217
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:24,736
Who?

218
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:29,501
We were just...

219
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,300
...talking about a celebrity.

220
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:35,334
Do I have some free time in my schedule?

221
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,567
Yes, you don't have any appointments.

222
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,368
See? She's wearing full makeup today.

223
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,501
I feel bad for her.

224
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:14,702
Thank you.

225
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,767
-Thank you.
-Take care.

226
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,367
Yes?

227
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,166
Do you have any patients?

228
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,801
Can I have a cup of coffee?

229
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:35,534
Come in.

230
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:45,901
I didn't know you were consulting them.

231
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,634
I heard he came back.

232
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,601
I guess it's fun for everyone.

233
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,234
I've been hearing that all morning.

234
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,035
Are you okay with that?

235
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:14,567
Do I look okay?

236
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:19,235
I'm not sure. Maybe you are,
maybe you're not.

237
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:23,901
It seems like I've succeeded.

238
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,134
How do you actually feel on the inside?

239
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,367
I'm thinking to myself,
"That son of a bitch."

240
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,901
I don't understand why he came back.

241
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,734
He said he came back for Joonyoung.

242
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,201
But I don't think he sees...

243
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:46,702
...how it affects Joonyoung.

244
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,767
But he could've actually
come back for Joonyoung.

245
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,335
What other reason would he have?

246
00:20:58,234 --> 00:20:59,401
I should go.

247
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:01,335
Thank you for the coffee.

248
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,001
You can come anytime
if it comes to mind.

249
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:07,067
You mean him?

250
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:09,934
I meant coffee.

You don't have to bring us gifts.

The guests coming from Seoul are enough.

285

Why do you think I put all that money
and effort to build the Ladies Society?

286
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,801
I certainly didn't do it
to show those Seoulite.

287
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:45,869
Those people called me
a husband-stealing bitch behind my back.

288
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:47,768
I don't care if they don't come.

289
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:51,469
Steal what? Their marriage ended
because they were unhappy!

290
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:55,368
When I think about what
that woman did...

291
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,901
I can't sleep at night.

to be ashamed of!

Hi honey. Where are you?

298

Make sure we have
all the champagne and flowers.

299
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:46,501
Okay.

Will I see you tonight?

304
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:17,467
I was going to find an excuse
to stay away.

305
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:19,834
But she's got tenacity.

306
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:22,835
She invited you over phone call.

307
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,201
It's hard to turn that one down.

308
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:31,735
They're trying to announce their marriage
to the people of Gosan.

309
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:36,201
But everybody knows that their
relationship started from adultery.

310
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:39,434
Do they actually believe that
they can wipe the slate clean?

311
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:43,801
I can imagine how much money
they spend to prepare it.

312
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,433
I think she's trying to initiate
Dakyung into the Ladies Society.

313
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:49,734
What should I do?

314
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:51,234
What do you mean?

315
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:54,034
You're good at pretending
to be indifferent.

316
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:58,334
Are they out of their minds?

317
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:00,735
They were driven out
for their disgraceful act.

318
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:02,568
Why couldn't they just
live their own lives?

319
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,700
Why on earth did they sneak back in?

320
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,033
And they have the cheeks
to invite everyone in Gosan.

321
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:12,001
Just go and have some fun.

322
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,834
Why would I go there?

323
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:17,135
Even the ones invited
think it's ridiculous...

324
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,334
...because those adulterers have no shame.

325
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:24,201
I bet only a handful of people will go.

326
00:26:24,634 --> 00:26:27,502
Would you like to go out for dinner?

327
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,834
Joonyoung will be late.

328
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,934
He's doing an assignment
at his friend's house.

329
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,300
Oh dear.

330
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,635
I already have plans
with a friend tonight.

331
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:38,734
We planned this over a month ago.
I can't blow her off now.

332
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:40,568
-What should I do?
-What do you mean?

333
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,201
You should stick to your promise.

334
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:43,968
You should go.

335
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,968
You need to tell me in advance
if you want to eat with me.

336
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:49,402
I'm a busy woman, you know.

337
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,835
All right.

338
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:09,300
Dr. Ji, are you leaving now?

339
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,734
I have an alumni meeting today.

340
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,502
- I see.
- Yes.

341
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,668
I'm late. I should get going.

342
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,268
- Dr. Gong!
- Yes, get in.

343
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,867
(My son)

344
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:47,402
Hey Mom.

345
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,034
I'm at Haekang's house.

346
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,500
When will you be done?

347
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:53,201
Do you want me to pick you up later?

348
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,234
No.

349
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:55,335
I can go home by myself.

350
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:57,735
The guys are calling me. Bye.

351
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:59,201
What about dinner?

352
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:06,435
(Haekang's mother)

353
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:18,934
(Ji Sunwoo)

354
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,800
Thank you for doing this.

355
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,702
The kids can hang out
at my place next time.

356
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:25,934
What is it?

357
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:29,468
Oh, it's nothing.

358
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:37,501
What's going on?

359
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,500
A slight jam, sir.

360
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:41,802
(Sundae Soup, Hangover Soup)

361
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:43,101
Welcome.

362
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:45,368
One soup and rice please.

363
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,368
Sure.

364
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:16,268
Thank you.

365
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:26,734
(Sundae Soup, Hangover Soup)

366
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,767
- For the food.
- Thank you.

367
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:43,168
Goodbye.

368
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:56,468
Excuse me.

369
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,934
One bottle of soju please.

370
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:01,068
Sure.

371
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,334
- Welcome. Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

372
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:18,135
- Glad you're here.
- Goodness, hello.

373
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,768
Hello!

374
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,134
- Come say hello.
- You're here.

375
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:27,101
Congratulations.

376
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:30,167
- Congratulations.
- Good for you.

377
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:33,634
- Ten million audience? That's amazing.
- Thank you.

378
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:36,901
- You're the pride of Gosan.
- Thank you for coming.

379
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,901
Congratulations.

380
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,601
Thank you. This way.

381
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:43,801
- Hello. Thank you for the invitation.
- Oh, you're here.

382
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:46,468
This way.

383
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:48,801
- Hey!
- Hello dear!

384
00:31:48,901 --> 00:31:50,368
-Hey.
-What's up.

385
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:52,268
-Congratulations.
-You look great.

386
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:55,235
Glad you can make it
despite your busy schedule.

387
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,333
This way.

388
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,701
- Ma'am.
- This way.

389
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:04,402
Welcome, Yerim.

390
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:05,767
Just a moment.

391
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,235
Dakyung.

392
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:09,367
Dakyung!

393
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:15,567
Congratulations.

394
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,834
Is Jehyuk coming?

395
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:19,968
He's busy with work.

396
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:21,835
He sends his congratulations.

397
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:25,301
Bummer. I haven't seen him
in a long time.

398
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:27,401
How have you been?

399
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:28,601
We're...

400
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,501
We're doing fine.

401
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:33,334
That's good to hear.

402
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:35,934
I was worried.

403
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,367
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

404
00:32:55,968 --> 00:32:58,869
Long time no see. Thank you for coming.

405
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:03,201
She looks so much like you.

406
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:04,567
No.

407
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:06,568
Everyone says she looks
just like her dad.

408
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:11,836
Dakyung.

409
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:14,068
Hey, you're here!

410
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,901
This way.

411
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:18,367
-Have fun with your uncles and aunts.
-Okay.

412
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,301
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

413
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,268
-Thank you.
-Congratulations, Dakyung.

414
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:30,234
Hey!

415
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,701
- It's been a long time.
- Congratulations.

416
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:35,535
-Hello!
-Hi!

417
00:33:35,634 --> 00:33:37,834
-Hi there.
-Hello.

418
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,168
Yerim!

419
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,201
-Over here.
-Okay.

420
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:46,001
- Welcome.
- Hello.

421
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,767
Welcome.

422
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:48,935
- Have a seat.
- You're all here early.

423
00:33:52,868 --> 00:33:55,369
To peace in Gosan.

424
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,068
- A toast for the grandfather.
- Cheers.

425
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:23,102
- Welcome.
- Hello.

426
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,467
- One soup and rice please.
- Sure.

427
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:28,066
Good to see you here
on a snowy night.

428
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:32,634
I wanted to drink.

429
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,534
One bottle of soju please.

430
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:41,667
-Sure.
-And a glass please.

431
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,001
It's Friday.

432
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:51,501
Shouldn't you be on a date?

433
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,868
Says the woman drinking by herself.

434
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:56,435
You got me.

435
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,667
I thought my life was full of passion.

436
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,635
But I'm drinking alone on a day like this.

437
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,767
What do you mean, "on a day like this"?

438
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,667
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

439
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:20,202
It's been two years.

440
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,767
What do you think?

441
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,501
Isn't two years too short...

442
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,268
...to forgive someone?

443
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:42,867
I wanted him to live in
guilt at the very least.

444
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,468
How could he think of coming back?

445
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:49,001
I just don't get it.

446
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,768
Time is relative to different people.

447
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,400
He probably believes that
the past should stay in the past.

448
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:58,967
Our marriage...

449
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:02,101
...ended a long time ago.

450
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:07,868
But to me,

451
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,101
divorce is still ongoing.

452
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,467
(Lee Taeoh)

453
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:29,934
Joonyoung's having a good time.

454
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,734
(To Joonyoung)

455
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,634
(Kang...)

456
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,001
Good luck, kid.

457
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:54,534
Thank you.

458
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:56,634
Lucky you.

459
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,800
Must be nice having such a cool dad.

460
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:02,769
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Don't mention it.

461
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,001
Nice place you got here.

462
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,268
Congratulations on your
new house, Mr. CEO.

463
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:09,801
I'll treat you to dinner some time.

464
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:10,802
Call me.

465
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,367
Hey. Joonyoung, come here.

466
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:23,068
Congratulations. I enjoyed it.

467
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,234
Where are you going?

468
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:37,267
I have to pick up my son.

469
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,433
He went to his dad's house.
Is that such a big deal?

470
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:42,201
Of course. This is foul play.

471
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:46,335
I told him he can't see Joonyoung
without my permission.

472
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:49,368
Look! He took Joonyoung
without my consent.

473
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,268
Maybe Joonyoung wanted to go.

474
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,201
I know my son.

475
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:58,101
He loathes his dad.

476
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,500
What do you think?
It's pretty big, isn't it?

477
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:15,968
It gets a lot of sunlight too.

478
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,300
Whose room is this?

479
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:19,567
It's your room.

480
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:23,402
A dad should prepare a room for his son.

481
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:27,934
I'll make the room so you
can come and stay anytime.

482
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:30,567
You're part of this family too.

483
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:36,701
We can put a bed here
and a desk here.

484
00:38:36,801 --> 00:38:38,235
What else do we need?

485
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:42,368
We should get a computer and
download all sorts of games.

486
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,967
Taeoh, I need to talk to you.

487
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:00,235
Wait a second.

488
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:17,967
Joonyoung's room?

489
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,901
I don't remember you
discussing that with me.

490
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,601
It's an empty room, so why not?

491
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,801
You should've discussed with me first.

492
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:29,034
You can't just tell him right away.

493
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,567
You don't like it?

494
00:39:32,434 --> 00:39:34,868
We agreed that I can see
Joonyoung anytime,

495
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:36,435
when we moved back here.

496
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:40,267
But having his room in my house
is a different story.

497
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,367
I hope you don't make another
decision without discussing it with me.

498
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,001
Dakyung!

499
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:49,834
Dakyung!

500
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,734
(Mom)

501
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,033
The number you have
dialed is not available.

502
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:13,333
Please leave a message after the beep.

503
00:40:16,434 --> 00:40:18,868
(Sorry. We couldn't find a taxi.)

504
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,801
It's hard to get a taxi in this weather.

505
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:37,769
Get in.

506
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,500
I didn't even drink.

507
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:42,568
Get in.

508
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:45,867
Thank you.

509
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,434
- I'm telling you.
- Really?

510
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:05,235
Yes.

511
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,168
All right, ladies!

512
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,534
-Ta-da!
-The woman of the hour.

513
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,135
Congratulations, Dakyung.

514
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
Thank you.

515
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:15,368
- Sit.
- My goodness.

516
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:16,967
Dakyung.

517
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,068
You're still in great shape
even after giving birth.

518
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:26,568
After all those hard times
your husband made it big.

519
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,134
You must be very proud.

520
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,767
Don't ever break your mom's heart again.

521
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,801
I never had any doubt.

522
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:37,968
Both of my parents...

523
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:40,701
...supported my decision in the end.

524
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:47,268
If I was scared of strangers
slandering and criticizing me,

525
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:50,467
both Jenny and Taeoh's movie...

526
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:53,235
...wouldn't be in my life right now.

527
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:57,468
All right.

528
00:41:57,534 --> 00:42:01,268
Are we all ready to accept
Dakyung into our group?

529
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:04,902
Well...

530
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:08,300
Of course.

531
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:13,234
Let us raise our glass.

532
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:16,234
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

533
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,667
Congratulations on joining
the Ladies Society.

534
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:20,001
- Thank you.
- Cheers!

535
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

536
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:34,268
I'll be right back.
You ladies keep talking.

537
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:35,668
-Excuse me.
-Let's go.

538
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:36,901
Let's go.

539
00:42:38,734 --> 00:42:40,401
Look how confident she is.

540
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:44,501
No longer the little girl
who left Gosan in tears.

541
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,734
She's always been daring.

542
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,133
- That's true.
- She was shrewed.

543
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:55,235
Which is why she stole a married man.

544
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,701
Oh my.

545
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:37,167
This is a lot of guests for a house party.

546
00:43:38,968 --> 00:43:41,335
They probably invited all
the powerful people ...

547
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:44,101
...in the city.

548
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:46,901
Oh jeez!

549
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:50,068
Sunwoo! What are you doing here?

550
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,201
You're here too, Dr. Kim.

551
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:56,335
- Have you seen Joonyoung?
- What? Joonyoung?

552
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,335
I'm not sure if Joonyoung's here...

553
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,334
I think I saw him.

554
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:05,001
Where did he go?

555
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,101
I don't see him right now.

556
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:13,034
What are you doing here?

557
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:56,667
You should've resisted your curiosity.

558
00:44:57,434 --> 00:44:59,768
Didn't you want to show me?

559
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:04,034
That's why you sent the picture.

560
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,268
Or maybe you're using Joonyoung
as an excuse to visit my house.

561
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:09,701
Okay then.

562
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:11,901
Let's just say you're right.

563
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:17,335
Don't even think about ruining my party.

564
00:45:17,901 --> 00:45:19,802
I'll drop Joonyoung off later.

565
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:22,535
I don't think so.

566
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:49,601
Dakyung.

567
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,434
- We should go.
- No.

568
00:45:57,868 --> 00:45:59,602
I'm not leaving without Joonyoung.

569
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:00,934
Are you serious?

570
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:12,868
Hello.

571
00:46:14,534 --> 00:46:16,567
I knew you were a piece of work,

572
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:19,402
but I didn't expect this much.

573
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,100
How did you think of coming here
of all places?

574
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,967
I can ask you the same question.

575
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,567
How did you two...

576
00:46:29,234 --> 00:46:31,468
...even think about coming back here?

577
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:35,433
It's up to us to decide where we live.

578
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:40,168
Your existence had nothing
to do with our decision.

579
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:41,868
So don't worry.

580
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,601
Can you please leave?

581
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:47,834
This party...

582
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,234
...is invitation-only.

583
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:58,168
This.

584
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:01,700
Weren't you the one who sent me this?

585
00:47:02,634 --> 00:47:03,468
Then...

586
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:06,801
I wonder who sent it.

587
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:17,835
I'm not here to see how you are doing.

588
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,867
I have zero interest in your lives
so get over yourself.

589
00:47:22,734 --> 00:47:23,501
I'm just here...

590
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:26,669
...to take my son and leave.

591
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,133
Joonyoung.

592
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,400
Joonyoung!

593
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,368
Dakyung.

594
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:15,468
You okay?

595
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,968
You need to kick that woman out first!

596
00:48:19,234 --> 00:48:20,634
Right now.

597
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,034
Joonyoung.

598
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:01,101
It's upstairs.

599
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Is it okay to snoop around
in someone else's house?

600
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:08,035
That's the highlight of
a housewarming party.

601
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:12,101
Yes, this way.

602
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:15,033
Ta-da!

603
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:20,135
It's so bright and neat
like a honeymoon suite!

604
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:25,101
There's no question the
couple is deeply in love.

605
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:29,068
Isn't this from Italy?

606
00:50:29,634 --> 00:50:33,301
Goodness. It must be really expensive.

607
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,867
It took six months for
the furniture to be ready.

608
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:38,735
It's custom-made.

609
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,700
I knew it.

610
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,735
If it's made by an Italian artisan...

611
00:50:43,801 --> 00:50:47,368
Then it's art, not a furniture.

612
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:52,301
Goodness. Look at this color!

613
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:54,901
Imagine if Dr. Ji saw this.

614
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:56,967
She'd be so jealous.

615
00:50:59,133 --> 00:51:01,533
Even if your marriage falls apart,

616
00:51:01,634 --> 00:51:05,101
it's not so pleasing to see
your ex doing so well.

617
00:51:16,734 --> 00:51:19,834
I put a lot of effort in this room
since it's for newlyweds.

618
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:24,734
Since we've seen the bedroom,
let's move on.

619
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:25,901
- This way.
- Okay.

620
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,767
It's connected to the study room.

621
00:51:31,901 --> 00:51:35,468
My goodness! Isn't it nice?

622
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:11,402
Are you crazy?

623
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:13,301
What are you doing in our bedroom?

624
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:16,268
Why did you come back?

625
00:53:17,234 --> 00:53:18,568
You made it big.

626
00:53:18,968 --> 00:53:20,535
Why not just live in Seoul?

627
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:23,267
Why did you come back?

628
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,400
My wife wanted to stay
close to her parents.

629
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:27,901
So this is about what they want?

630
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,434
When you threw me out,
they took me in.

631
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:34,235
It's only normal to come back
if your family wants it.

632
00:53:38,434 --> 00:53:39,868
You're still not over me?

633
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:49,934
Sounds like you've been
really lonely, Sunwoo.

634
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:33,202
I have a very happy life with Dakyung.

635
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:37,468
I don't even remember
the time we were together.

636
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:40,001
Do you mean that?

637
00:54:40,901 --> 00:54:42,901
Do you not believe your own eyes?

638
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:44,367
To me,

639
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,267
you're nothing.

640
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:47,734
You're just a thing of the past.

641
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,967
The only woman in my life right now...

642
00:54:51,801 --> 00:54:53,302
...is Dakyung.

643
00:54:57,133 --> 00:55:00,500
You came to my house
using Joonyoung as an excuse.

644
00:55:01,133 --> 00:55:03,101
Not to mention, you sent
me an invitation...

645
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:04,901
...and that photo.

646
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,068
I know you did that to mess with my head.

647
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,467
Because of me.

648
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:11,868
Just so you can see me.

649
00:55:15,868 --> 00:55:16,802
Am I wrong?

650
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:18,801
Yes.

651
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,602
You're wrong.

652
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:28,669
You need to get out of my house.

653
00:55:31,267 --> 00:55:32,934
Before you embarrass yourself even more.

654
00:57:31,734 --> 00:57:32,635
All right.

655
00:57:32,734 --> 00:57:37,134
Let's hear it from our hosts,
Lee Taeoh and his wife!

656
00:57:37,234 --> 00:57:38,135
Give them a hand!

657
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,968
It would've been a shame
if I didn't let Councilor Cha...

658
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:48,834
...do the introduction.

659
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:54,702
You know how he loves to stand out.

660
00:57:54,834 --> 00:57:55,768
Later on,

661
00:57:56,634 --> 00:57:58,001
I'll make him sing a song.

662
00:58:03,434 --> 00:58:06,834
You all came here to congratulate
my family's fresh start.

663
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:08,935
Thank you so much for that.

664
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:12,068
Due to circumstances beyond our control,

665
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:23,201
we were forced to leave.

666
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:28,067
But I always missed my hometown.

667
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,400
I will never,

668
00:58:32,234 --> 00:58:33,234
ever...

669
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:37,301
...leave this place again.

670
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,400
For my wife Dakyung, who stuck
by me when I was down and out.

671
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:49,934
And...

672
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:54,735
For my one and only daughter and princess.

673
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:56,333
My Jenny.

674
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,901
I will give them a long,
happy life here in Gosan.

675
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:01,135
Thank you.

676
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,801
Give me a kiss.

677
00:59:11,701 --> 00:59:13,801
Good job.

678
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:35,433
You're just a thing of the past.

679
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,901
The only woman in my life right now...

680
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:40,501
...is Dakyung.

681
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:46,268
You need to get out of my house.

682
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:50,568
Before you embarrass yourself even more.

683
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,234
Ms. Ji Sunwoo?

684
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:19,468
Thank you so much for coming.

685
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:26,701
You came here to give us
your blessing, right?

686
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,600
We'll bump into each other
every now and then.

687
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,967
It's time for us to bury the hatchet.

688
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
We should wish each other the best....

689
01:00:38,734 --> 01:00:40,468
...and try to live in peace.

690
01:00:48,567 --> 01:00:49,834
You can do that, right?

691
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:15,501
Okay, how about a toast?

692
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:17,668
Raise your glasses.

693
01:01:20,234 --> 01:01:22,501
Let's toast to "Good Life".

694
01:01:26,033 --> 01:01:28,400
Your dad must've made a lot of money.

695
01:01:28,968 --> 01:01:30,135
Lucky you.

696
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:31,567
It's cold.

697
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,201
Are we not going back in?

698
01:01:33,267 --> 01:01:34,467
Be honest.

699
01:01:34,934 --> 01:01:36,334
You want to live here too, don't you?

700
01:01:36,434 --> 01:01:39,201
It's way nicer than your mom's place.

701
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:41,300
And your step-mom is hot too.

702
01:01:42,901 --> 01:01:44,101
Shut up.

703
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,101
What the hell?

704
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,701
- Do you want to slap me?
- Cha Haekang.

705
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:50,900
- Are you insane?
- You just don't know when to shut up.

706
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:54,168
Stop it!

707
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,234
Lee Joonyoung!

708
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,233
Get over here!

709
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:46,001
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

710
01:03:34,133 --> 01:03:37,067
Why do you get to be the angry one?

711
01:03:37,434 --> 01:03:40,168
Why did you come? It's embarrassing!

712
01:03:52,901 --> 01:03:54,068
He came with you?

713
01:04:00,067 --> 01:04:01,234
Get in the car.

714
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,868
What are you talking about?

715
01:04:40,934 --> 01:04:43,835
- It was you.
- It wasn't me.

716
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,368
Honey.

717
01:04:53,834 --> 01:04:57,268
Come on Taeoh. We should
have a drink as family.

718
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,834
- Here.
- To our family's happiness.

719
01:04:59,901 --> 01:05:01,901
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

720
01:05:01,968 --> 01:05:03,268
- Good job.
- Thank you.

721
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:21,635
Get out.

722
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,301
Don't be so tough on him.

723
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:29,534
Stay out of it.

724
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:48,201
You're embarrassed of me?

725
01:05:51,634 --> 01:05:53,001
Weren't you embarrassed?

726
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:55,435
What will those people think?

727
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:58,834
Forget about other people.
Tell me what you think!

728
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:01,201
Are you embarrassed of me?

729
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:15,302
I would've let you go
if you were honest with me.

730
01:06:15,634 --> 01:06:17,701
I wouldn't have gone
there to look for you!

731
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:20,534
Don't lie to me. I know
you wouldn't have let me go.

732
01:06:22,033 --> 01:06:23,600
You said you didn't want to go.

733
01:06:24,133 --> 01:06:26,200
That's what you said.

734
01:06:27,501 --> 01:06:28,168
What?

735
01:06:28,801 --> 01:06:30,702
You were doing your assignment?

736
01:06:31,133 --> 01:06:34,533
Did you have to lie to me
to go to that party?

737
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,068
Lee Joonyoung.

738
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:42,735
- Answer me!
- Yes, I wanted to go!

739
01:06:43,734 --> 01:06:46,368
Dad knows about my interests
better than you do.

740
01:07:20,634 --> 01:07:24,667
For my one and only daughter and princess.

741
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,700
My Jenny.

742
01:07:27,567 --> 01:07:30,168
I will give them a long,
happy life here in Gosan.

743
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:31,468
Thank you.

744
01:07:33,968 --> 01:07:35,435
Give me a kiss.

745
01:08:32,767 --> 01:08:33,767
Thank you.

746
01:08:35,501 --> 01:08:36,935
For marrying me.

747
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,233
That woman...

748
01:08:46,801 --> 01:08:49,068
...walked out of our bedroom earlier.

749
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:52,434
What happened?

750
01:08:54,634 --> 01:08:57,401
I did not see that coming.

751
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,469
I guess she was shocked by our return.

752
01:09:03,133 --> 01:09:04,533
That woman...

753
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:07,168
...is someone from the past
whom I don't want to see again.

754
01:09:08,234 --> 01:09:09,135
But thanks to that,

755
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:12,468
I realized again just how much I love you.

756
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,268
You are my present.

757
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,934
The only thing that matters to me now...

758
01:09:20,434 --> 01:09:21,434
...is you.

759
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,634
About Joonyoung's room...

760
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,234
I'll give it up if you don't want it.

761
01:11:13,567 --> 01:11:14,801
That crazy bastard...

762
01:11:26,767 --> 01:11:29,101
What's the night duty
schedule for this month?

763
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:30,467
Here you go.

764
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:32,101
-The schedule's already out?
- Yes.

765
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:34,534
What about the equipment list for the ER?

766
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:37,202
I think these should do.

767
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,133
That's great then.

768
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:41,834
Dr. Ji.

769
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,235
Give it to me. I'll let you know later.

770
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,034
Yes ma'am.

771
01:11:53,801 --> 01:11:55,001
Do you have something to say?

772
01:11:56,033 --> 01:11:57,634
About yesterday...

773
01:11:58,834 --> 01:12:01,668
- I didn't want to go, but...
- By the way,

774
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,667
About the list of medicine
you sent the other day...

775
01:12:06,734 --> 01:12:09,535
The data from last quarter had an error.

776
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:11,302
Really?

777
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,100
Can you submit it again
after you double check?

778
01:12:14,367 --> 01:12:15,400
Sunwoo...

779
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:18,201
Are you angry?

780
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,967
- Miss An.
- Yes ma'am.

781
01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:28,134
Can you clear one hour
from my out-clinic schedule?

782
01:12:28,234 --> 01:12:29,501
I have a lot of documents to check.

783
01:12:29,567 --> 01:12:31,734
- Yes, Dr. Ji.
- Thank you.

784
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:48,568
Are you stressed about something?

785
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,500
No, I'm not stressed.

786
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,501
I'm just tired.

787
01:12:58,701 --> 01:13:00,035
Yesterday...

788
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,400
How did you end up coming with her?

789
01:13:02,601 --> 01:13:04,068
We were having dinner,

790
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:06,901
then Dr. Ji said she had to go.

791
01:13:08,067 --> 01:13:10,467
I was worried about her going alone.

792
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:12,602
That's all there is.

793
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:14,601
So...

794
01:13:15,234 --> 01:13:16,968
Did you drop her off and leave?

795
01:13:17,033 --> 01:13:19,467
- No, I waited outside.
- For Sunwoo?

796
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:21,268
Really?

797
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:23,568
Yes. I was worried.

798
01:13:37,033 --> 01:13:38,500
What in the world?

799
01:13:38,801 --> 01:13:40,435
Are they in that kind of relationship?

800
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,168
Dang it.

801
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:48,101
(Lee Taeoh)

802
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,401
Hey.

803
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:53,001
Don't ever invite me to your party again.

804
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:55,434
I'm in a tight spot because of you!

805
01:13:56,567 --> 01:13:57,268
Whatever.

806
01:13:57,334 --> 01:13:59,768
I'm meeting your director for dinner.
You should come.

807
01:13:59,834 --> 01:14:01,735
So what if you're meeting the director?

808
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,901
Why do you need me?

809
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:11,235
I have good news.

810
01:14:11,968 --> 01:14:13,035
See you later.

811
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:18,800
(Send Message)

812
01:15:59,701 --> 01:16:00,801
Joonyoung.

813
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:08,134
Joonyoung?

814
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:10,934
Joonyoung?

815
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,233
Joonyoung!

816
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:20,468
Joonyoung...

817
01:16:33,634 --> 01:16:35,634
A donation?

818
01:16:37,501 --> 01:16:39,369
I'm interested as well.

819
01:16:39,701 --> 01:16:40,602
But most of all,

820
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:44,569
my father-in-law is determined
to contribute to the community.

821
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:48,568
Everyone in Gosan knows that
Mr. Yeo is a respectable man.

822
01:16:48,634 --> 01:16:50,135
You can use it for the elderly,

823
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:52,202
or help out children
raised by a single parent.

824
01:16:52,267 --> 01:16:54,634
We won't nitpick how
you use the donation money.

825
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:56,568
Despite going through
all those hard times,

826
01:16:56,634 --> 01:16:59,634
I can't believe you wish
to help underprivileged.

827
01:16:59,734 --> 01:17:01,734
You are remarkable, Mr. Lee.

828
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:02,901
Before we move on,

829
01:17:04,534 --> 01:17:06,235
I'm concerned about something.

830
01:17:06,934 --> 01:17:10,902
My father-in-law is a dignified man
who doesn't care about such things,

831
01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:12,434
but as you know,

832
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:16,101
I can't help but feel ashamed.

833
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:23,402
I'm talking about Ji Sunwoo.

834
01:17:33,067 --> 01:17:34,568
Does she have to be...

835
01:17:35,334 --> 01:17:37,035
...the assistant director?

836
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:46,268
So you're saying...

837
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,767
It's...

838
01:17:48,601 --> 01:17:50,035
You want her to be removed...

839
01:17:50,701 --> 01:17:53,268
...from her position in
return for the donation?

840
01:17:53,767 --> 01:17:54,668
Is that what you mean?

841
01:17:56,834 --> 01:17:57,501
Yes.

842
01:18:01,234 --> 01:18:04,634
Why do you think I came back to Gosan?

843
01:18:35,133 --> 01:18:36,034
Joonyoung.

844
01:18:50,901 --> 01:18:52,869
When you owe a debt to someone,

845
01:18:53,734 --> 01:18:55,468
it's only right to pay them back.

846
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,201
Joonyoung.

847
01:19:01,634 --> 01:19:02,568
Are you okay?

848
01:19:42,901 --> 01:19:45,535
(The World of the Married)

849
01:19:45,634 --> 01:19:46,801
Isn't it strange?

850
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:50,066
Right after Taeoh moved in,
that happened.

851
01:19:50,133 --> 01:19:52,467
Call me if you need my help.

852
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:55,068
This house isn't safe.

853
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:58,200
I don't hate Joonyoung.

854
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,834
The housewarming party was enough
to announce your comeback.

855
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:02,201
This is too much.

856
01:20:02,267 --> 01:20:06,701
It's a girl thing. You don't have to know.

857
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:08,502
Are you sure you can take care of it?

858
01:20:08,701 --> 01:20:11,335
I won't go on with this plan
if you don't approve.

859
01:20:11,434 --> 01:20:12,434
Be careful.

860
01:20:12,501 --> 01:20:14,435
They won't go down that easily.

861
01:20:14,767 --> 01:20:16,967
If you break into my house,
lay your hands on my things,

862
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,233
and attack me...

863
01:20:19,534 --> 01:20:22,335
Did you think I was going
to run away in fear?
