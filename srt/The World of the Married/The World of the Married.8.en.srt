(A World of Married Couple)

3
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:58,435
A window broke.

4
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:01,102
We should replace it as soon as possible.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,267
Aren't you coming?

6
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:03,435
Yes.

7
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,934
I think there's something going on.

8
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:30,435
There's no security camera in the back.

9
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,734
It’s hard to say what
caused the accident.

10
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,101
We've reset the security settings.

11
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,600
We will be patrolling the area
for the time being. Don't worry.

12
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,669
Okay.

13
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:39,501
Did you hear that?

14
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,001
It wasn't a big deal. Don't worry.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,968
I've submitted a report
to the headquarters.

16
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:48,167
Our staff will be here early tomorrow
morning to replace the window.

17
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:49,101
Okay.

18
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:50,168
Good night, ma'am.

19
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:53,067
Thank you.

20
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,534
Isn't it strange?

21
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:08,702
What?

22
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:12,101
That happened right after Taeoh moved in.

23
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,201
You and your imagination.

24
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,567
I'll shower first.

25
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,434
Who is it?

26
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:27,934
It's me.

27
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:33,235
What are you doing here at this hour?

28
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:35,435
Open the door.

29
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,402
I called him.

30
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:19,502
Are you okay?

31
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,367
Did you get hurt?

32
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,167
I'm fine.

33
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:25,868
I'm not hurt.

34
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:37,668
(Episode 8)

35
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,301
This should be enough...

36
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,100
...to keep out the cold wind.

37
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,834
I could've done this too, Joonyoung.

38
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,202
You don't have to feel bad.

39
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:11,400
You can call me anytime
if you need my help.

40
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,734
You need a man for this kind of thing.

41
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:16,401
Enough with your nonsense.
I don't need your help.

42
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,767
We've been doing fine without you.

43
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,133
Don't be like that.

44
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:23,034
Why not have Joonyoung...

45
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:25,535
...stay at my house for a while?

46
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,834
This place has poor security.
It's dangerous.

47
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,567
Who knows what else is going to happen?

48
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:38,935
It won't happen again.

49
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,301
You don't have to worry, Joonyoung.

50
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:44,135
Okay.

51
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,301
If you're done here, then leave.

52
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:54,934
Oh yeah.

53
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,367
Hold on to your bat.

54
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:02,869
I'm leaving.

55
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,333
Make sure you lock the door.

56
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,601
He has a sore ear.

57
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,302
His ear?

58
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:31,801
Done.

59
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:37,102
Why are you so late?

60
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:38,368
Sorry.

61
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,133
Why are you still up?

62
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,268
Jenny has a little fever.

63
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:44,268
She's a bit whiny.

64
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:47,335
Is my princess sick?

65
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,035
Why didn't you answer your phone?

66
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,135
Are you coming back from a meeting?

67
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,535
I went to see Joonyoung.

68
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:59,601
Their window broke, so I fixed it.

69
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,500
Lee Taeoh.

70
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,535
You are a good friend after all.

71
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:12,468
That's why I need you to play your part.

72
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,702
I want to return all the favors...

73
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,268
...that I owe you.

74
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,801
Don't you worry.

75
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,734
Dr. Gong is a greedy man.

76
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:23,567
But...

77
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:27,001
are you really determined
to take Sunwoo down?

78
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,034
Are you sure about it?

79
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,368
Come on. I'm not that shallow.

80
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:36,868
I just want to do something good.

81
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,501
You're good at this.

82
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,235
I practiced beforehand.

83
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:29,234
If I start something,
I have to do it right.

84
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,133
She wants to be perfect in everything
because she takes after me.

85
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,601
Who's next?

86
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,834
Me.

87
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,402
This is really good.

88
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:01,168
I heard the land value around
the T.O Pictures movie set...

89
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,367
...is skyrocketing.

90
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:04,701
It's not just the land price.

91
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:08,435
The premium value of the business
in the area has doubled up.

92
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,768
According to my husband,

93
00:09:09,868 --> 00:09:13,901
...the mayor will be attending
the opening ceremony.

94
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:17,200
The movie set will have a positive
impact on the local economy.

95
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,168
Of course the mayor's interested.

96
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:23,334
Lunch is on me today, ladies.

97
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,368
It should be my treat.

98
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,335
It's my first day as a member.

99
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:36,068
Mr. Lee Taeoh already
took care of the bill.

100
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,334
Oh my.

101
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,302
- My husband?
- Yes.

102
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,535
What are all these?

103
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:50,868
Gifts from Mr. Lee.

104
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:54,467
He ordered these in advance
for each of you to take.

105
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,567
Oh my.

106
00:09:56,934 --> 00:10:01,268
Isn't my son-in-law the best?
All he cares about is Dakyung.

107
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,902
Mr. Lee is such a thoughtful man.

108
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:08,268
Tell him I said thank you, Dakyung.

109
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,667
Sure.

110
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,401
Your housewarming party was enough.

111
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,268
I don't feel comfortable
about taking this.

112
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,334
This is a casual social gathering.

113
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:26,101
A husband going out of his way
to take care of our bills...

114
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:30,134
...doesn't really fit the
purpose of this gathering.

115
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,368
Did that make you uncomfortable?

116
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,101
Excuse me, Yerim.

117
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,068
A person shouldn't be
so stern all the time.

118
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,934
It's not right to turn down
someone's good will.

119
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,769
But Yerim is right in some aspect.

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,667
She does have a point.

121
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:00,668
From now on,

122
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,168
let's not use money from
our husband's pockets.

123
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,300
Does that sound okay?

124
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,001
Your thoughts are good enough for me.

125
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,702
Thank you for lunch, Dakyung.

126
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,802
I'll enjoy this, Dakyung. Thank you.

127
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
Madam!

128
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,434
Here.

129
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,168
No. It's okay.

130
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:55,934
I told her I wanted to drink it.
Just take it.

131
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,534
Very well then.

132
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:02,868
What is this?

133
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:05,868
I went to Seoul yesterday.

134
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:08,068
I thought this would look good on you.

135
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,401
No. I can't take this.

136
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:13,268
My husband will be furious.

137
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:18,500
This is between us girls.
Dr. Gong doesn't have to know.

138
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:23,734
Someone like you should
be assistant director.

139
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,433
I hope you can help me out.

140
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,834
I'll arrange something
with Madam Choi soon.

141
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,535
That inferior wench seems to
have forgotten her place.

142
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:44,101
Who does she think she is?

143
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:48,601
Taeoh must have spent a lot.
Give him a pat on the back.

144
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,602
You weren't so fond of him before.

145
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,302
How nice would it be
if he didn't have another kid?

146
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,167
Then what do you suggest we should do?

147
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:58,867
He should cut ties with them.

148
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:01,168
Gosh, my head hurts.

149
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,268
Where did I put it?

150
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:17,402
Are you sure you lost it in the classroom?

151
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,634
I don't know. I couldn't
find it when I went to cram school.

152
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,667
Maybe someone stole it?

153
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,335
Just tell the teacher.

154
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,700
Like he would help me find it?

155
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:28,934
He'd put the blame on me for bringing
something I shouldn't have.

156
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:33,268
Damn it. My mom would kill me
if she found out.

157
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:34,567
Maybe it fell out on the streets.

158
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,001
No way.

159
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,367
Have you checked your locker?

160
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,834
I looked everywhere.

161
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,334
How was the gathering?

162
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,066
Did you have fun?

163
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,035
Yes.

164
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,233
I thought hanging out with old
ladies would be boring,

165
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:02,035
but it turned out to be fun.

166
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:06,235
Mom said you did good.

167
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:07,834
She told me to compliment you.

168
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,768
It was nothing.

169
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,135
Thank you.

170
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:20,168
You made me look good
in front of everyone.

171
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,167
Are you going to the office?

172
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:27,567
Yes. I'll try not to be late.

173
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:34,101
About Joonyoung...

174
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,468
It's not that I don't like him.

175
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:42,235
It takes time to get close, you know.

176
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:46,934
I know.

177
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:49,901
Don't worry about it.

178
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:51,701
Joonyoung is my responsibility.

179
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,968
We should invite him to dinner some time.

180
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,434
Thank you, Dakyung.

181
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,734
(Chairman Yeo)

182
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,967
I heard you're giving donation
to the hospital.

183
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:31,868
Is it true?

184
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:35,368
I was going to tell you
once it was decided.

185
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:38,467
I'm sorry, sir.

186
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:40,168
When I made you CEO,

187
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:43,068
I clearly told you not to make
free use of the company money.

188
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,501
So?

189
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,700
Where will you get the money
for the donation?

190
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,634
I was going to discuss that with you, sir.

191
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,800
I won't move on with the plan
without your approval.

192
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:06,635
Are you sure you can
get rid of the problem?

193
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,934
Make sure you succeed.

194
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:19,068
Yes, sir.

195
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,534
I will.

196
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,567
How do you do?

197
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:02,901
If you crumble down at this stage,

198
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:04,801
it won't be fun for me.

199
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:12,635
Not everything is as it seems.

200
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:17,235
I owe you a favor.

201
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:18,702
You know that, right?

202
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,433
Be careful.

203
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,667
You can't beat them that easily.

204
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,868
(Get out of this city, Ji Sunwoo!)

205
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,700
Hello?

206
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,500
Hello, Dr. Ji.

207
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:39,768
You left some documents
that need to be reviewed.

208
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,634
Should I bring them over to you?

209
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:43,734
Did I leave them there?

210
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:47,569
No.

211
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:50,068
I'll go.

212
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,867
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable...

213
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:06,868
You're here, Dr. Ji.

214
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:09,368
Have you seen Joonyoung?

215
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:36,800
(Specialist Kim Yoonki)

216
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:40,735
(Specialist Kim Yoonki)

217
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:52,001
I thought this was your day off, Dr. Ji.

218
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,267
Joonyoung.

219
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:57,934
What are you doing here?

220
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:06,135
Why won't you answer me?

221
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,634
Why did you come here without me?

222
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,368
I can ask you the same thing.

223
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,734
Are you following me now?

224
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,468
Are you...

225
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,201
...hiding something from me?

226
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,767
Calm down, Dr. Ji.

227
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:24,502
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

228
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:26,902
Is there something wrong with Joonyoung?

229
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,934
- Stop it.
- He's a minor!

230
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:30,767
Why are you seeing him without a guardian?

231
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:33,001
Mom, cut it out!

232
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:36,968
Every time you do this,
it suffocates me!

233
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:38,235
Do you know that?

234
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,233
Lee Joonyoung!

235
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,234
What is it? What's going on?

236
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:48,402
- Wait.
- Let go of me!

237
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,402
Give him some alone time.

238
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:55,200
Going after him won't solve anything.

239
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,333
Why didn't you tell me?

240
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,368
If you had known about this,

241
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:04,768
Joonyoung wouldn't have
come here for counseling.

242
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:16,634
Joonyoung.

243
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,734
Open the door.

244
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,667
Come out for dinner.

245
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:28,635
You need to eat at least.

246
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:32,868
You don't want to come out?

247
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:34,435
Should I bring it to your room instead?

248
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:39,967
Okay.

249
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:42,502
I'll be in my room.

250
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,667
Let me know if you're hungry.

251
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:38,701
(Dad)

252
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:25,166
I'm having dinner at Dad's place tomorrow.

253
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,034
I've been counseling him
for about six months now.

254
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:38,401
He feels guilty about your divorce.
He thinks it's his fault.

255
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,600
That's ridiculous.

256
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:46,801
He knows we got divorced
because of his dad's wrongdoings.

257
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:49,800
Why would he feel guilty?

258
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:54,401
Guilty feelings are common among
children from divorced families.

259
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:55,901
But in Joonyoung's case...

260
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:58,868
There is a specific reason.

261
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:05,735
He found a memory card in your room.
The one he threw away.

262
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:09,435
It had a video of your husband
having an affair.

263
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:15,202
He thinks...

264
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:18,168
...that's how you found out
about his affair.

265
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:24,968
What should I do?

266
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,167
What do I have to do?

267
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:34,367
I told him constantly
that it wasn't his fault.

268
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,201
And he has improved a lot.

269
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,702
I wasted all that time feeling
sorry for myself...

270
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:46,601
...that I didn't even know
what he was going through.

271
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:53,834
It's my fault.

272
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:58,268
I should've controlled myself
in front of him.

273
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,801
You need to trust him.
He will pull through.

274
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,302
He's a sensitive, smart young man.

275
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,133
Let him see his dad for the time being.

276
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,735
It'll help him to deal
with the emptiness.

277
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,101
Although it'll be hard
for you to watch.

278
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,001
Shall we go to Jeju Island for Christmas?

279
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,400
Is it because you want to play golf there?

280
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,834
We can do something else
if you don't like the cold weather.

281
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:03,435
Golf sounds good to me.

282
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,734
All right.

283
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:14,834
I'll look for a hotel.

284
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:23,101
Now that you've mentioned it,
you need new golf shirts.

285
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,201
Yours are out of fashion.

286
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:26,602
Why not?

287
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:47,668
Did you enjoy your food?

288
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:50,335
My wife loved it.

289
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:00,534
Signature please.

290
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:10,335
Do you need the receipt?

291
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:11,201
Yes.

292
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:26,634
Thank you.

293
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,768
- Are you done?
- Yes.

294
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:37,535
Let's go.

295
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:39,401
- Thank you. Come again.
- Sure.

296
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
The food was nice.

297
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,434
Are you listening to me?

298
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:53,936
I'm sorry.

299
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,334
What were you talking about?

300
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:57,202
Joonyoung's house.

301
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,967
I think someone's
snooping around.

302
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:01,234
Don't mind about them.

303
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:05,135
The real sinners are living
a happy life with their kid,

304
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:07,301
and yet Sunwoo is going
through all that by herself.

305
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:09,368
What an unfair world we live in.

306
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,301
I'm worried that something...

307
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:13,534
...might happen to them.

308
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,701
I'm more worried about you.

309
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:21,134
Make sure you lock the door
when you're alone at home.

310
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:23,567
Okay.

311
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,034
I will.

312
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:31,601
So...

313
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:34,334
Have you thought it over?

314
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,533
You know it too.

315
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,967
I shouldn't make the decision so lightly.

316
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:42,034
First...

317
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:45,335
I think you should tell the chairperson.

318
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:51,501
Have you thought about potential
candidates for assistant director?

319
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,268
Don't say anything to Dr. Ji.

320
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,368
Of course.

321
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:11,434
Dr. Ji!

322
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:20,434
Enjoy your coffee.

323
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:28,868
Is Joonyoung okay?

324
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:31,601
Yes.

325
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:37,335
If you need any help, just let me know.

326
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:39,467
Why would I need you?

327
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:42,835
Well...

328
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,568
-I'm just...
-Just what?

329
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:47,569
What makes you think I need your help?

330
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:53,635
Okay.

331
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:55,634
Forget it.

332
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:15,168
Dr. Seol.

333
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,067
You came to the wrong person.

334
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,701
The chairperson and I are
just good companions.

335
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,034
We don't discuss about important matters.

336
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,134
Chairman Choi's been a donator
of our hospital for years.

337
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:33,302
I think you're being too modest.

338
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,134
Have you met up with the chairperson?

339
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:38,266
The thing is...

340
00:32:38,934 --> 00:32:40,868
The chairperson had no idea about it.

341
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:47,567
Being the careful man that my husband is,

342
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,668
I guess he hasn't reported
to the chairperson.

343
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,500
What are you talking about?

344
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:55,168
Dr. Gong is...

345
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,634
...the most calculating person I know.

346
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:01,934
Dr. Ji Sunwoo is very
good at her job though.

347
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:06,001
I heard she gets the most
patients at the hospital.

348
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:10,801
Thank you.

349
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:16,701
What do we do?

350
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,067
I'll bring it up...

351
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,634
And I'll back you up.

352
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:27,902
When T.O Company's
movie set is completed,

353
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:32,401
at least 100 staffs will come
to our city for a single shoot.

354
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:34,435
He's my friend and all,

355
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:38,534
but I never thought he had it in him.

356
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:41,401
Everyone thought he was no good at first.

357
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:43,534
Who knew he was a lottery ticket
that wasn't scratched?

358
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:44,968
I know, right?

359
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:47,501
We'll have to see about that.

360
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,534
All that money he made, and yet...

361
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:54,402
...he's spending them to
take down his ex-wife.

362
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,534
He must be boiling inside.

363
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:01,435
That can't be true.

364
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:04,402
Mr. Lee's motives are pure.

365
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:08,335
He's just embarrassed to
face his father-in-law,

366
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,834
so he doesn't want
any loose ends.

367
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:11,468
Of course.

368
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:14,568
Making donations when his
ex-wife is assistant director...

369
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,767
...could lead to terrible
misunderstandings.

370
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:20,469
I do feel bad when I think
about Dr. Ji Sunwoo.

371
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:22,767
She worked hard as
the face of the hospital.

372
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:25,201
but it's all about to go in vain
because of her family affairs.

373
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,268
But nothing can be done for her.

374
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:31,135
Dr. Seol...

375
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:34,534
You're more ambitious than I thought.

376
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:37,168
You can stop now.

377
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,601
Why don't you get more massage?

378
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
No.

379
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:45,168
I'll get going.

380
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:51,034
It's okay.

381
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,967
Don't worry and wait.

382
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:58,033
My husband will carefully weigh
the benefit of keeping Sunwoo...

383
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:59,901
...or accepting the donation.

384
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:04,602
Thank you, ma'am.

385
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:53,601
Get in.

386
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,535
Let's go.

387
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:03,868
I think Jenny likes you.

388
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:09,001
I don't think she can talk yet.

389
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,200
Jenny doesn't eat well
if there's someone she dislikes.

390
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,667
Look. She's eating so well today.

391
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:21,335
Honey.

392
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:23,467
Can you go get Jenny's diaper and wipe?

393
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:25,635
Okay.

394
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,034
You still feel uncomfortable
with me, right?

395
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:42,734
To be honest,

396
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,667
I feel the same way.

397
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:53,068
But I hope we start getting along.

398
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:57,902
I feel really bad about what
happened between the adults.

399
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,034
But I'm in love with your dad.

400
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,234
And your dad cares about you.

401
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,901
I hope you feel comfortable here.

402
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:12,335
You need to be happy...

403
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:14,402
...for your dad to be happy.

404
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,235
The divorce took away something he loved.

405
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:02,102
He hates his dad but
misses him at the same time.

406
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,334
You need to understand that.

407
00:39:18,968 --> 00:39:20,135
Oh no.

408
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:23,602
Jenny might like her brother
more than she likes her dad.

409
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,201
- Have some fruit, Joonyoung.
- Okay.

410
00:39:36,534 --> 00:39:37,235
Here.

411
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:40,402
Have a grape.

412
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,735
We should get ready to go.

413
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,167
Enjoy the fruit.

414
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,467
I'll go get the keys.

415
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,102
Do you want to sleep over?

416
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,301
It's late.

417
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,534
Your dad can drive you
to school in the morning.

418
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:01,934
Right?

419
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:06,968
But we don't have a space
for him to sleep.

420
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,868
When did you prepare all these?

421
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:22,034
What do you think?

422
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,400
Do you like your room?

423
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,767
How have you been?

424
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:28,334
I was thinking about you,

425
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:29,901
so I decided to say hello.

426
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:26,535
(Kim Yoonki)

427
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:32,502
(Kim Yoonki)

428
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,267
Help!

429
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:39,235
Help!

430
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,734
Doctor...

431
00:42:41,534 --> 00:42:42,502
Dr. Ji?

432
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:45,235
Dr. Ji.

433
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:48,934
Dr. Ji?

434
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,767
Who...

435
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:25,968
Who are you!

436
00:45:07,634 --> 00:45:09,634
(Kim Yoonki)

437
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:16,101
This is the police.

438
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:19,168
Open the door.

439
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:36,135
Did you get a look on his face?

440
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:39,702
No.

441
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,400
I didn't see his face.

442
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:54,736
Dr. Ji?

443
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:00,700
What's going on?

444
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:02,434
Are you hurt badly?

445
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,235
Let's take care of your wound first.

446
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:14,434
Where's the first-aid kit?

447
00:46:20,934 --> 00:46:22,101
I'm okay.

448
00:46:24,434 --> 00:46:25,467
Sir?

449
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:27,200
Are you her guardian?

450
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:29,068
Yes. We work at the same hospital.

451
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:31,401
Can you answer a few questions?

452
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:34,768
Wait here.

453
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:52,068
(Son)

454
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:13,769
What is it?

455
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:17,435
Your mom's not answering her phone?

456
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:21,667
I'm sure she went to bed.

457
00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:24,135
She never goes to bed this early.

458
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,133
She has trouble falling asleep.

459
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:35,668
(Mom)

460
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:38,201
Mom?

461
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,734
Hey, Joonyoung.

462
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:44,768
I missed your call because
I was taking a shower.

463
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,934
How was dinner?

464
00:47:48,434 --> 00:47:49,668
Did you enjoy it?

465
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:52,635
Yes.

466
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,168
By the way,

467
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:57,934
can I sleep here tonight?

468
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:05,135
Would you like that?

469
00:48:10,968 --> 00:48:12,202
That's great then.

470
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:14,568
All right.

471
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:16,101
You can sleep over at your dad's.

472
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,667
Will you be okay by yourself?

473
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:20,435
Yes, I'll be fine.

474
00:48:25,534 --> 00:48:27,101
You can sleep at his place.

475
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:29,901
Don't be late to school tomorrow.

476
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:31,967
All right.

477
00:48:33,467 --> 00:48:34,534
Good night.

478
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:48,968
What is it?

479
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:51,868
Did your mom say no?

480
00:48:53,467 --> 00:48:54,335
No.

481
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:56,701
She's okay with it.

482
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,200
She said I can sleep here.

483
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:00,768
Awesome.

484
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:02,534
Another round?

485
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:18,602
Your witness interview is tomorrow.

486
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:19,834
I'll go with you.

487
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:22,067
Thank you.

488
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:26,401
Apparently he bumped into
your neighbor as he ran away.

489
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,434
She's the one who called the police too.

490
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:44,034
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable...

491
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:45,900
(Hubby)

492
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:53,901
Here you go.

493
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:02,701
You're rich, aren't you?

494
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,967
You're an accountant, right?

495
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:07,802
Anyway...

496
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,001
My boss told me...

497
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,569
...that you're rich.

498
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,368
Me?

499
00:50:22,934 --> 00:50:24,735
I don't have much money.

500
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:28,334
You have enough to buy
me a purse, don't you?

501
00:50:29,701 --> 00:50:32,669
Why should I buy you a bag?

502
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,133
Because...

503
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,434
I'm going to be your girlfriend
from now on.

504
00:50:50,267 --> 00:50:51,235
No?

505
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:06,001
I removed all the shards in your skin.

506
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:08,735
Are you hurt anywhere else?

507
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:12,267
He just...

508
00:51:12,734 --> 00:51:14,335
...gave me a fright.

509
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,534
Who did it?

510
00:51:21,934 --> 00:51:23,902
Is it someone you know?

511
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,501
I don't know.

512
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:28,935
He kept his mask over his face.

513
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,701
I can't let you stay here.
Let's go to my house.

514
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:41,068
It's okay.

515
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:44,601
I just want to rest.

516
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:50,068
You can go to your room and relax.

517
00:52:09,634 --> 00:52:10,535
Are you okay?

518
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,435
Stay here. I'll go.

519
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,200
Who is it?

520
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,767
Oh my.

521
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,400
Why are you here?
You said you're sleeping over.

522
00:52:52,634 --> 00:52:56,034
He insisted to go home because
he was worried about you.

523
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:00,267
Mom, are you hurt?

524
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,801
Just slightly. I'm fine.

525
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:07,068
It's not that bad.

526
00:53:13,434 --> 00:53:15,101
- Mom...
- It's nothing.

527
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:19,135
Don't worry about me.
Just go to your room.

528
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:22,067
It's okay.

529
00:53:30,033 --> 00:53:31,400
How did you hurt your arm?

530
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:33,934
Did it happen again?

531
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:36,401
That's none of your business.

532
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:39,101
- Can you leave now?
- Did you call the police?

533
00:53:42,734 --> 00:53:44,468
She needs rest.

534
00:53:44,901 --> 00:53:46,435
Can you come back some other time?

535
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:45,968
You've done enough
by calling the police.

536
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:49,034
Why go out of your way
and get hurt like this?

537
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:51,335
Let's go to the hospital
first thing in the morning.

538
00:54:53,901 --> 00:54:56,101
I called you again and again.

539
00:54:56,901 --> 00:54:57,835
But you didn't pick up.

540
00:54:57,901 --> 00:55:01,101
A former client called
me out of the blue.

541
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:03,634
I was so busy talking
that I lost track of things.

542
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,068
Does it hurt?

543
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:08,468
Gosh, this bruise won't
go away for a while.

544
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:18,101
Don't ever poke your nose
in someone else's problem again.

545
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:25,202
(Get out of this city, Ji Sunwoo!)

546
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:56,534
Long time no see.

547
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:00,268
What brings you here?

548
00:57:02,534 --> 00:57:03,601
Why did you...

549
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,567
...send me that text last night?

550
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:15,102
It seemed like you were in
a bad situation.

551
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:17,834
What situation?

552
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:20,001
I heard Lee Taeoh is back.

553
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:24,434
He's trying to get you fired.

554
00:57:25,868 --> 00:57:27,001
Did you know?

555
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,667
I heard you called the cops.

556
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:47,701
Yeah.

557
00:57:48,534 --> 00:57:49,368
Why?

558
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:51,468
Just because.

559
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:54,800
Since a few days ago,

560
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:57,500
some stranger was sneaking
around your house.

561
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:02,867
Was it Lee Taeoh?

562
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:08,001
I'm not sure about the
man I saw yesterday.

563
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:08,934
But...

564
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:11,734
Taeoh...

565
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:13,601
...did come to your place once.

566
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,600
It was during daytime
when no one was there.

567
00:58:30,601 --> 00:58:31,935
Why not have Joonyoung...

568
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:34,035
...stay at my house for a while?

569
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:40,068
This place has poor security.
It's dangerous.

570
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:00,567
Who knows what else is going to happen?

571
00:59:15,133 --> 00:59:16,500
How can I help you?

572
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,834
You can't just barge in like this.

573
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,401
Where is Lee Taeoh?

574
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:26,968
You can't just come in like this.

575
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,001
What brings you here?

576
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,467
Where's the CEO office?

577
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,067
Ma'am...

578
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:36,200
You can't.

579
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,101
Move!

580
00:59:38,234 --> 00:59:40,168
Do you have an appointment
with the CEO?

581
00:59:41,968 --> 00:59:43,502
Tell him Ji Sunwoo is here.

582
00:59:44,734 --> 00:59:45,901
Right now.

583
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:56,568
He said you can go in.

584
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:08,368
What do you want from me?

585
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:13,435
I know you want me to step down
from assistant director,

586
01:00:14,701 --> 01:00:16,168
but that's not all you want.

587
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:20,535
Why don't you leave this place
before you make yourself more miserable?

588
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:22,701
If you want,

589
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,433
I can get a nice job for you in Seoul.

590
01:00:27,868 --> 01:00:29,335
That's it?

591
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:33,967
Throwing stones at my house?

592
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,600
Breaking in to mess with my things...

593
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,834
...and have me attacked?

594
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,134
Did you think I was going
to run away in fear?

595
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:47,235
If any danger occurs, you should tell me.

596
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:48,601
I don't think...

597
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:50,767
...Joonyoung should stay there.

598
01:00:50,868 --> 01:00:53,369
- Who's the man you sent?
- Don't try to frame me.

599
01:00:53,467 --> 01:00:54,634
I know nothing about it.

600
01:00:55,534 --> 01:00:56,502
Anyway,

601
01:00:57,067 --> 01:01:00,035
you should leave this place
before something worse happens.

602
01:01:00,267 --> 01:01:02,300
I'll take good care of Joonyoung...

603
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,667
Don't even think about it!

604
01:01:05,934 --> 01:01:07,934
You can't have Joonyoung.

605
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:13,235
I know you want to torment me,

606
01:01:14,534 --> 01:01:16,534
but it's making Joonyoung nervous.

607
01:01:16,634 --> 01:01:19,968
Did it ever occur to you that
you're the one to blame for that?

608
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,067
He said you can't fall
sleep without alcohol!

609
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,501
What kind of mom...

610
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,133
...makes her own child worry about her?

611
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:31,767
Not to mention, you invited
a man to your house.

612
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,233
Moreover...

613
01:01:34,501 --> 01:01:36,835
...you weren't even aware that
Joonyoung was seeing a psychiatrist!

614
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:39,868
Can you really...

615
01:01:41,734 --> 01:01:43,101
...call yourself a mother?

616
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:47,469
Enough.

617
01:01:47,534 --> 01:01:49,768
Don't make it any harder for Joonyoung.

618
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:51,234
Send him to me.

619
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:53,435
Drink all the booze you want
and go on dates!

620
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:56,501
You can do anything you want!

621
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:00,968
Don't mess with me.

622
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,133
Get out of this town.

623
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:08,569
That's the only way.

624
01:02:29,601 --> 01:02:30,601
Okay.

625
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,334
Thank you.

626
01:03:02,534 --> 01:03:03,768
Come in.

627
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:09,501
- Dr. Ji?
- Oh my. I forgot.

628
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,734
- You can go home now.
- That's not it.

629
01:03:12,734 --> 01:03:14,801
There's someone here to see you.

630
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,901
(Wifey)

631
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:45,667
(Wifey)

632
01:03:47,968 --> 01:03:51,435
(You have seven missed calls)

633
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,367
Why did you go to my husband's office?

634
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:12,736
Instead of me,

635
01:04:13,968 --> 01:04:15,702
you should ask your husband.

636
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:19,301
I said we should bury the hatchet
and try to live in peace.

637
01:04:20,701 --> 01:04:22,335
I thought you agreed.

638
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:29,734
Is that what you really want?

639
01:04:29,834 --> 01:04:31,335
We don't have a choice, do we?

640
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,801
Then you can start by keeping
an eye on your husband.

641
01:04:35,801 --> 01:04:36,769
Seriously...

642
01:04:39,534 --> 01:04:41,001
What is your problem?

643
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:43,501
You don't know Taeoh.

644
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:48,435
You have no idea what he's capable of.

645
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:34,735
I told you to just scare her,
not hurt her.

646
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:47,767
Can't you see what she did to me?

647
01:05:47,934 --> 01:05:51,168
That woman won't sit back
and take it when she's threatened.

648
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:52,367
Don't ever...

649
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:55,901
...lay a finger on Sunwoo.

650
01:05:55,968 --> 01:05:59,035
I rotted in prison for a year
thanks to that woman.

651
01:06:01,434 --> 01:06:03,368
There's only so much I can take.

652
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:06,401
If you disobey me and hurt her again...

653
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:09,368
Our contract will be over.

654
01:06:09,467 --> 01:06:11,500
And you can say bye to your money.

655
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:14,268
Get out of my car.

656
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:19,567
Get lost!

657
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:51,268
- This one...
- Okay. It goes there.

658
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:52,734
And this one...

659
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,501
And this one...

660
01:06:54,567 --> 01:06:56,700
-Goes there?
-Yes.

661
01:06:56,834 --> 01:06:59,101
-Your mom must be home.
-Yes.

662
01:07:03,734 --> 01:07:05,168
Why are you so late?

663
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,367
What's up with her?

664
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:12,835
Did she argue with Taeoh?

665
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:32,001
Be careful.

666
01:07:33,901 --> 01:07:36,535
You could end up like me one day.

667
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:24,601
Hello.

668
01:08:35,634 --> 01:08:37,502
You're really enjoying this.

669
01:08:38,267 --> 01:08:40,801
I think our team won the bet.

670
01:08:40,901 --> 01:08:42,535
You pay them, Mom.

671
01:08:42,634 --> 01:08:46,034
You just wait.
It's not over until it's over.

672
01:09:03,501 --> 01:09:05,335
-High five!
-Well done.

673
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:06,801
Madam!

674
01:10:28,133 --> 01:10:29,767
Looks like you're having fun.

675
01:10:31,767 --> 01:10:33,934
I want to join the Ladies' Society.

676
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,400
What should I do?

677
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:48,066
The rule says you need approval
from the members.

678
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:50,601
But who will vote for you?

679
01:10:50,767 --> 01:10:52,301
Would it be enough...

680
01:10:54,801 --> 01:10:56,302
...if more than half of the members
vote for me?

681
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,368
Of course...

682
01:11:00,067 --> 01:11:03,067
- You could, but...
- Before you embarrass yourself...

683
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,401
...you should go back.

684
01:11:07,467 --> 01:11:08,435
Not one person here...

685
01:11:09,267 --> 01:11:12,334
...will welcome you to join.

686
01:11:15,434 --> 01:11:17,135
Then instead of wasting time,

687
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:20,468
let's just start right away.

688
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:25,701
All right.

689
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:26,767
Okay.

690
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:31,901
Those who want Dr. Ji
to join our society,

691
01:11:32,601 --> 01:11:33,901
please raise your hand.

692
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:53,034
I vote yes.

693
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:56,434
Me too.

694
01:12:07,334 --> 01:12:09,268
She is the assistant director after all.

695
01:12:09,734 --> 01:12:11,501
It's hard for me to say no.

696
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:21,801
Too bad.

697
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,467
You didn't get the majority vote.

698
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,734
I vote yes.

699
01:12:44,567 --> 01:12:45,435
Dakyung.

700
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,234
Thank you.

701
01:13:33,501 --> 01:13:36,102
(The World of the Married)

702
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,901
You want to join the Ladies Society?

703
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,367
What's your objective?

704
01:13:40,434 --> 01:13:42,968
Let's just say I'm sending
a warning to Lee Taeoh.

705
01:13:43,133 --> 01:13:44,867
What were you doing
leaving the kid at home?

706
01:13:45,033 --> 01:13:47,267
Are you that serious with that guy?

707
01:13:47,334 --> 01:13:48,434
Why don't you stop.

708
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:50,701
Ji Sunwoo is not your wife.

709
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,334
That psychiatrist from Seoul...

710
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,134
...seems to have a good reputation.

711
01:13:56,234 --> 01:13:58,668
Do you think it was my idea...

712
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:00,802
...to have you removed from your position?

713
01:14:00,901 --> 01:14:04,502
Are you scared that I'll tell her
what you did to me?

714
01:14:04,701 --> 01:14:05,901
Your husband...

715
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,433
How much do you trust him?

716
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:08,867
Watch your mouth.

717
01:14:09,234 --> 01:14:11,935
This is between us.
Don't drag Dakyung into this.
