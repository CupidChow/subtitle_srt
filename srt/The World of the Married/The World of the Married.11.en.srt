(The World of the Married)

3
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,368
We never should've met that woman.

4
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,901
Shit.

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,567
Both you and me...

6
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,001
Our lives got screwed over...

7
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,401
...when we met that woman.

8
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,600
When he brings the money,

9
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,734
you and I will leave Gosan for good.

10
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:31,068
Okay?

11
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:34,168
Let's go somewhere
where nobody can find us...

12
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,034
and start over.

13
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,801
Okay, Hyunseo?

14
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:45,501
No.

15
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,568
No...?

16
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,767
No. I don't want to.

17
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,001
I told you I'm a changed man.

18
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,368
I'll be good to you from now on.

19
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,167
Hyunseo...

20
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,734
Don't leave me. Please?

21
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:26,634
You can't leave me.

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,700
Is there hope for us?

23
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:40,702
Can't we try?

24
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,001
Even if we find a winning lottery ticket,

25
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:52,135
there is no hope for us.

26
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,568
If I stay with you,

27
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:02,668
my life will always be miserable
just like today.

28
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:06,634
So please...

29
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:11,235
Let's stop.

30
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:17,667
No...

31
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,901
I can't...

32
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:37,934
Hyunseo.

33
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:40,602
Hyunseo.

34
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:48,001

(Ji Sunwoo)

37
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,200
You can't go in there.

38
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:47,935
Come with me.

39
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,602
Let go.

40
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,934
There's something I have to check.

41
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,400
I think it's person I'm looking for.

42
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,569
It's a man.

43
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,967
It's not the person you're looking for.

44
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:15,168
You shouldn't stay here. Let's go now.

(Friday, January 3rd)

46
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,701
Did you get hurt?

47
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:02,201
No. There was something on me.

48
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:30,335
(Episode 11)

49
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:35,202
Mom, did you hear the news?

50
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,135
Someone died at Gosan Station last night.

51
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,867
Who said so?

52
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,500
It was on the news.

53
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:46,702
My classmates are going
nuts on social media.

54
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,767
Eat up or you'll be late.

55
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:54,068
Don't suicidal people normally
jump onto the track?

56
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,801
But he jumped of the roof.
Isn't that weird?

57
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:01,134
Don't you have an English test today?

58
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:03,468
My friends don't think it was suicide.

59
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:05,968
What do you think, Mom?

60
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,734
You'll concentrate this time, right?

61
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,200
Last time, you got one question
wrong when you knew the answer...

62
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,901
...because you got distracted.

63

(A man in his 30s fell to
death at Gosan Station)

64

Someone fell to death at Gosan Station.

65
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,168
Right in the heart of the city...

(Specialist Kim Yoonki)

67
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,534
Can we talk?

68
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:08,936
Come in.

69
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,268
Where were you last night?

70
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,067
At the office.

71
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:30,535
With whom?

72
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:35,101
-Alone.
-What time did you leave?

73
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:38,367
I don't know.

74
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:40,601
Around 12:30 AM?

75
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:46,335
He clocked out around 10:30 PM.

76
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:49,101
That's the last record
in the security system.

77
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,801
He didn't clock in again after that.

78
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,235
Why do you ask?

79
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,067
A man died at
Gosan Station last night.

80
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,302
Apparently, it's Park Inkyu.

81
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:04,235
How do you know all that?

82
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:09,334
I just happened to pass by.

83
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:10,801
Shit!

84
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,268
I'll kill that bastard.

85
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:43,035
Then I heard people talking
about a man falling down.

86
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,267
What in the world?

87
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,101
What the?

88
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:51,568
That's when I saw you.

89
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,300
So, you just happened to pass by
at the time of the accident.

90
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,634
And you just...

91
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,535
...happened to see me?

92
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,434
That's right.

93
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,935
I just happened to be there...

94
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:10,600
...by coincidence.

95
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:14,335
How did you know...

96
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:17,635
...that it was Park Inkyu?

97
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,968
How did you know that it was Park Inkyu?

98
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:24,501
Answer me.

99
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,434
I saw him fall.

100
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:33,001
You reported him for
trespassing and blackmailing.

101
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:37,434
-So?
-I figured it's better for you to leave.

102
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:43,268
Do you think...

103
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:50,101
I pushed him?

104
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,800
That never crossed my mind.

105
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:04,100
Since the police know about
the bad blood between you and him,

106
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
I figured it would look bad on you.

107
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,201
That's all.

108
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:12,734
You had it all figured out
in a split-second.

109
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,801
I must say, you're very quick witted.

110
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:17,502
It's how I am.

111
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,101
Is that all?

112
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,234
Why?

113
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,934
Do you have any more questions?

114
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:44,702
Hello?

115
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:49,802
Hello?

116
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,101
I'm sorry, Dr. Ji.

117
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,734
I screwed up.

118
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:11,968
Where are you right now?

119
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:13,401
What happened to you?

120
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,468
I didn't do it.

121
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,868
I'm innocent, Dr. Ji.

122
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,767
That man...

123
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,535
...showed up all of a sudden.

124
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,101
"That man"?

125
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:35,334
Who?

126
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,934
I just got a call from the police.

127
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,867
They want you to come in for questioning.

128
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,834
What?

129
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,367
According to them, the last
person he called was you.

130
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:53,301
Is that true?

131
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:57,734
Lee Taeoh...

132
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,100
Who?

133
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,868
That man, Lee Taeoh...

134
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,167
Are you hungry too, Jenny?

135
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:07,568
Your husband...

136
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:08,902
...is stalking me.

137
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,033
I'm trying to get rid of her for good.

138
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,334
Okay, put it here.

139
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,368
Give one to the rabbit.

140
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,868
Where did it all go wrong?

141
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:25,934
You shouldn't have backed
down so easily.

142
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:29,235
You should've held your
ground until the end.

143
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,202
You may have kept your pride,

144
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,834
but you ended up gaining nothing.

145
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:36,868
It only turned out great
for someone else.

146
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Are you saying it was wrong
to get a divorce?

147
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,834
What are you talking about?

148
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,001
I was talking about
the assistant director position.

149
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:52,368
I heard Kim Yoonki turned it down.

150
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:54,836
Why did he turn down
such a good opportunity?

151
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:56,501
Do you know anything about it?

152
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:57,968
If you're really want to know,

153
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,333
you should ask Dr. Gong yourself.

154
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,934
Tell him you want that job
and get it over with.

155
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,634
Goodness, no way.

156
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,068
Yes, Yerim.

157
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,002
Me?

158
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,467
Sunwoo.

159
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,834
Can I talk with you for a minute?

160
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,601
Sorry,

161
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm a little busy right now.

162
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,867
The police came by.

163
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:43,535
The intruder who broke into
Ms. Ji Sunwoo's house last time...

164
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,168
Is it him?

165
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:47,968
You reported the incident, didn't you?

166
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:51,467
I'm not sure...

167
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,101
I bumped into him
when it was dark.

168
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,434
I didn't get a good look
on his face.

169
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,634
Have you seen this scarf before?

170
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:18,268
Oh no...

171
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:21,001
Did I give too much
information to the police?

172
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,467
I see.

173
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,634
I'll call you later. I have a patient.

174
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,500
What did you say to the police?

175
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,135
It's none of your business.

176
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,600
You don't have to know.

177
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:23,868
(Husband: Son Jehyuk)

178
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:27,134
I didn't bother to appoint an attorney.

179
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:29,935
Don't make it sound like
you're being generous.

180
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,300
Either way,

181
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:34,567
I'm letting you do whatever you want.

182
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,867
I'm letting you go.

183
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,800
So you can have a care-free life.

184
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,934
If that's not what I want,
then can I tear this apart?

185
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,500
I'm not sure...

186
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,867
...if I can live without you.

187
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:01,168
Don't act like you're sorry.

188
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,135
But I meant it.

189
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:09,901
I guess it wasn't enough.

190
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:15,133
I hope you don't get cold feet
about showing up in court.

191
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:18,234
Tell me more about the police.

192
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,567
What's going on?

193
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,433
It's not me.

194
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,268
It's Sunwoo.

195
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,601
Do you recognize that scarf?

196
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,568
It's mine.

197
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:40,168
I gave it to Min Hyunseo.

198
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:45,501
Why did Park Inkyu...

199
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:49,001
...have this in his hand
when he died?

200
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,300
I wouldn't know.

201
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,934
How did he get that?

202
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,369
When was the last time
you saw Min Hyunseo?

203
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:01,068
At Gosan Station.

204
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:04,034
She said she was going
to a friend's place.

205
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:05,767
That's when I gave her my scarf.

206
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,101
I see.

207
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:11,168
You'll have to come to the station
as an official witness.

208
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:13,501
I'll cooperate, of course.

209
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:16,569
Call me anytime if you have
any other questions.

210
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:23,701
-Here comes Dr. Gong.
-Did you hear anything?

211
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:25,967
Hello.

212
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:27,100
Hello.

213
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,101
What's going on?

214
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,233
A detective just came by.

215
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,266
What's a detective doing here?

216
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:36,167
The person who fell off
the roof of Gosan station...

217
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,267
I think it's someone Dr. Ji knows.

218
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,467
Why does she always
stir up the hospital?

219
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,634
Dr. Gong.

220
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,535
Can I have a word with you?

221
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,234
Assistant director?

222
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,168
I thought it was something serious.

223
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,201
I already have a lot on my mind.

224
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,867
Can't we talk about that
some other time?

225
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:01,936
Considering my years of experience
and level of contribution,

226
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,167
I believe I'm more than qualified.

227
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:07,600
-I worked really hard too.
-I know you have.

228
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:09,635
Then you should give me a chance.

229
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:12,101
I want to give you a chance,

230
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,167
but you're still single.

231
00:25:17,868 --> 00:25:20,402
-What?
-It's not like you have a family to feed.

232
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:22,634
Why are you so desperate
for that position?

233
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:28,435
-Dr. Kim Yoonki is single, too.
-Come on.

234
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:31,568
It's different for men.

235
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,368
So it's okay for a man
to be ambitious,

236
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,068
but it's not okay for women?

237
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,668
I'm not desperate. It's about survival.

238
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:40,601
Look here, Dr. Seol.

239
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:43,401
Things are hectic around here
because of Dr. Ji's problem.

240
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,068
The last thing I need
is you complaining.

241
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:49,501
I don't like the way you're
behaving right now.

242
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:52,801
Do you know how selfish
you look right now?

243
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:56,934
Women are a pain in the ass.

244
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,166
Jeez!

245
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:00,769
Yes.

246
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:02,634
I'm a woman.

247
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,235
Not to mention, I'm single.

248
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:10,200
That's why I pushed myself even harder.

249
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:13,135
I don't have children who can
take care of me when I'm old.

250
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:15,202
And I don't have a husband
who can protect me.

251
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,934
Look what you're doing to Sunwoo.

252
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,267
As if demoting her in exchange
for the donation wasn't enough,

253
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:23,534
now you're calling her
a pain in the ass?

254
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:24,435
Why?

255
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:27,468
Do you see her as a criminal
because a detective stopped by?

256
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:28,634
No!

257
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:30,001
I never said she was a criminal.

258
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,767
Every time we faced a crisis,

259
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:34,935
she saved the hospital
while you stood by and watched!

260
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:36,934
And now you're saying
that women are a pain?

261
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:38,068
Why?

262
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:41,967
-Is it because she's single too?
-Look here, Dr. Seol!

263
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,568
-Why are you overreacting today?
-You tell me.

264
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:46,234
Explain to me why women
are a pain in the ass.

265
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:50,502
Explain to me why it's wrong
for a woman to be single!

266
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:53,667
Goodness.

267
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:01,834
Hey.

268
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,934
Our careers hit a dead-end here.

269
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,467
Why did you...

270
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:08,901
...have to get a divorce?

271
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,034
(Fall off at Gosan Station)

272
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:30,634
(Fall off at Gosan Station)

273
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:35,302
(Retracing the footsteps of the
man who jumped off Gosan Station)

274
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,268
(Park Ink...)

275
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:42,301
(Death at Gosan Station)

276
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,934
(A man in his 30s jumped off
Gosan Station building at night)

277
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:53,034
(Park decided to take his own life
after being unable to find a job...)

278
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,801
(The police have not ruled out
the possibility of murder.)

279
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,334
-You never played this one?
-No.

280
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,533
Can you show me?

281
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:17,068
Wish-woosh... Let's go forward.

282
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:20,101
What are you doing? Aren't you going
to get ready for the get-together?

283
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,900
You go by yourself.

284
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,334
Hey, that guy who died at Gosan Station.

285
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:27,768
Mr. Cha's wife has a juicy
story to share about him.

286
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:28,901
She asked us to come.

287
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:32,068
What story?

288
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,334
I don't know.

289
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:35,268
Let's go hear it from her.

290
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,734
Unbelievable.

291
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:55,068
Wait.

292
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:57,967
I'll do it.

293
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,268
(Receipt: Gosan Station Parking Lot)

294
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,101
Where were you last night?

295
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:32,300
At the office.

296
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:36,434
What time did your husband
come home last night?

297
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:37,667
I don't know.

298
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:40,001
Around 12:30 AM?

299
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:42,868
Did you know that your wife...

300
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,834
...put my girlfriend up
to follow you around?

301
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,601
Right before Park Inkyu died,

302
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,836
he spoke to Mr. Lee Taeoh
on the phone.

303
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:53,034
Who reads newspapers
these days anyway?

304
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:11,801
Dakyung!

305
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:14,468
Are you sure you're not going?

306
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,767
Big news!

307
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,567
-Come here.
-What?

308
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,335
-Come here.
-What?

309
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,701
-Hurry.
-What?

310
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:58,601
Joonyoung.

311
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:01,368
The police visited your mom
to question her.

312
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,301
-Hey.
-Why did you tell him?

313
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,301
What?

314
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,600
It's his mom. He probably knows.

315
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,233
What did the police want?

316
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:11,768
The Gosan Station murder case.

317
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,200
Apparently, the dead guy is
your mom's lover.

318
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:16,601
Do you know anything about it?

319
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,168
What? Really?

320
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,435
Gosh.

321
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,001
Just because she was questioned,
doesn't mean that she's the culprit.

322
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:30,235
He could've been a patient of Dr. Ji.

323
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:33,135
Sometimes, the police consults
with medical experts.

324
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:40,502
Shooting your mouth off
when you don't know the details...

325
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:42,602
...is so ignorant.

326
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:56,634
They're dating.

327
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,167
They're totally dating.

328
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,700
Where are you going?

329
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:03,602
(Mom)

330
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:27,802
Joonyoung.

331
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,434
What was...

332
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:37,867
...Dr. Ji's relationship
with the dead guy?

333
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:45,601
A divorcée and a younger man.

334
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:47,335
Can it be more obvious?

335
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,601
Oh my...

336
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:53,501
What do you mean it's obvious?

337
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:56,701
I can't say it out loud,

338
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:00,268
but all the moms' groups of
Gosan are talking about it.

339
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:04,735
Don't tell me you believe
that groundless rumor.

340
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,467
What do you mean it's groundless?

341
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:11,700
But they found something that
belongs to Dr. Ji on the scene.

342
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:12,901
Really?

343
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:15,834
Are they saying Ji Sunwoo killed him?

344
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,901
How do you even know that?

345
00:33:19,434 --> 00:33:21,368
My husband did some digging.

346
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:26,301
My Haekang is a friend of her son.

347
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,500
I couldn't help but get curious.

348
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:32,834
You wouldn't know how we feel
since you don't have children.

349
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:37,968
A politician should, by all means...

350
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:41,001
...be careful of gossips.

351
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:44,501
As his wife, you should...

352
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:46,435
...watch your mouth.

353
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:51,133
I do watch my mouth elsewhere.

354
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:54,334
I only told you ladies
because I trust you.

355
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,868
Of course.

356
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Something like this
should be shared among us.

357
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,334
Everyone here has something
to say about Dr. Ji.

358
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,901
Besides, she's a member of our group.

359
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,133
That's right.

360
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:09,568
If we can't exchange information
regarding a serious issue like this,

361
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,901
what's the point of our Ladies' Society?

362
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,334
You call it "exchange information,"

363
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,569
but it's actually just a rumor, isn't it?

364
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,734
What's up with you today?

365
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,467
You keep crossing the line.

366
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:26,168
Goodness, why would you think that?

367
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:29,568
Shouldn't you go back
to the hospital, Dr. Seol?

368
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:34,034
I adjust my own consultation
schedule, ma'am.

369
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,667
I'm an experienced doctor, you know.

370
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:42,734
I have something to tell you.

371
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,401
I'm going to court tomorrow.

372
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:49,600
I'll be divorced in a month.

373
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:51,401
Really?

374
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:54,401
You should've stopped
after giving him a fright.

375
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:56,868
How will you live alone without children?

376
00:34:56,968 --> 00:34:59,268
I'm sure he had some
sense knocked into him.

377
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:01,235
Just take him back.

378
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,667
It's not a scare tactic.

379
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,934
I'm really...

380
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:08,501
...getting divorced.

381
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:12,535
I'm more than happy to
share the reason with you...

382
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:14,035
...as long as you ask.

383
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,433
Please don't let your
imaginations run wild.

384
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,400
Okay, then.

385
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,868
I'll let myself out.

386
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:25,134
Feel free to talk about me.

387
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:35,935
I'll go and ask her...

388
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,634
...what happened.

389
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:50,235
This group is almost coming to an end.

390
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,233
Yerim!

391
00:35:59,434 --> 00:36:01,834
If you're trying to stop me, don't bother.

392
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:04,868
Why would I do that?
You were awesome back there.

393
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:06,434
Well done.

394
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:08,935
Let's go have a drink.

395
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:29,335
How are things with your mom these days?

396
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,201
Did she go to work today?

397
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,301
Of course she did.

398
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,934
What time did she get home last night?

399
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,500
Did she come home late?

400
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,068
Why are you asking me these questions?

401
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,934
Of course I should ask.

402
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,300
I need to know if your mom
is raising you properly.

403
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,068
What's wrong?

404
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:01,502
Joonyoung.

405
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:03,335
Why did you guys get a divorce?

406
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,035
Why did you come back?

407
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,334
You're the problem.

408
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,935
You left for another woman...

409
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,734
...and then came back as you pleased.

410
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,735
That was all your fault.

411
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,567
Whatever your issues are,
sort it out with Mom.

412
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,234
I don't want to get involved.

413
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,634
(Kim Yoonki)

414
00:37:53,734 --> 00:38:00,468
Your call cannot be reached.
Please leave a message after the beep.

415
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:30,234
What's the matter with you?

416
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:34,301
We've met before. Right?

417
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:37,935
I think I've seen you with
Chairman Yeo a few times.

418
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,700
What is the meaning of this?

419
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,967
Why are you following Ji Sunwoo?

420
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:44,101
I don't know what you're talking about.

421
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:48,701
This is getting more fun.

422
00:39:50,934 --> 00:39:54,401
Is Chairman Yeo involved
in that accident?

423
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:59,234
(Wild Rabbit)

424
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,167
He called Lee Taeoh...

425
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:16,468
...and threatened him to bring money.

426
00:40:27,534 --> 00:40:28,834
Where's Park Inkyu?

427
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:33,201
I'm going to kill that punk.
Tell me where he is!

428
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,501
Let me go!

429
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:39,834
I was terrified.

430
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,967
So I told him.

431
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,101
That Inkyu's on the rooftop.

432
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:06,767
I never expected something like that...

433
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,769
...to happen.

434
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:20,734
He did it.

435
00:41:23,534 --> 00:41:25,335
But you didn't witness the scene.

436
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,868
He killed Inkyu.

437
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:34,135
Do you think...

438
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,600
...people will believe you?

439
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:41,201
I know.

440
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:45,901
Who would believe a poor,
lowly girl like me?

441
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:48,701
That's why I ran away.

442
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,334
Like a coward.

443
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,267
The police are looking for me, right?

444
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:07,101
If they find out that I was
with him before he died,

445
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:09,268
what will happen to me?

446
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,301
Since you two had a dispute,

447
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:16,168
it won't turn out well for you.

448
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,267
It wasn't me.

449
00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:21,535
It was Lee Taeoh.

450
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:25,734
Chairman Yeo is watching Taeoh's back.

451
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,867
For his daughter's sake,

452
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:32,268
he'll do anything to prevent
Taeoh becoming a suspect.

453
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:37,735
It's better if you don't
go out of your way.

454
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:03,335
People won't believe me,

455
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:06,101
but they'll believe you.

456
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:09,968
You should take it.

457
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:11,736
The only person...

458
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:14,768
I can trust now...

459
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:18,368
...is you.

460
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:33,901
Will you help me?

461
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,834
I'll call you.

462
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:43,168
Stay put and lay low until then.

463
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,333
Do you trust me?

464
00:44:42,934 --> 00:44:44,034
What do you want?

465
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:47,767
I had dinner with Joonyoung.

466
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:51,667
Why are you home so late?

467
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,735
The police called.

468
00:44:56,834 --> 00:44:58,668
They asked me to come in as a witness.

469
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:02,402
They already gave me a visit.

470
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,268
You were at Gosan Station
last night, weren't you?

471
00:45:06,801 --> 00:45:08,201
I saw you.

472
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:27,901
Why?

473
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:31,133
Are you...

474
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:34,268
...going to frame me for murder?

475
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:35,434
Watch your mouth.

476
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,267
-You're Joonyoung's mother.
-That's right.

477
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:44,168
I'm glad you brought it up.

478
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,234
I'm Joonyoung's mom,
and you're Joonyoung's dad.

479
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:52,534
Now tell me the truth.

480
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:57,801
Park Inkyu...

481
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,300
Did you kill him?

482
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:09,368
Someone saw you going up
to the rooftop.

483
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:10,467
Who said that?

484
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:13,335
Was it...

485
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:17,168
...Min Hyunseo?

486
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:21,800
Did you two conspire to set me up?

487
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:24,034
-Why would I do that?
-Because it was you.

488
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:25,834
You killed Park Inkyu!

489
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:26,835
Am I wrong?

490
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:31,101
You threatened Hyunseo
and went up to the rooftop.

491
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,101
Park Inkyu fell off after that.

492
00:46:35,234 --> 00:46:38,234
He had already jumped off
by the time I got there.

493
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:41,068
So there's only two possible answers.

494
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,234
Either Min Hyunseo killed him,

495
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:46,834
or you two killed him together.

496
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:48,134
Do you even...

497
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:52,035
...hear yourself right now?

498
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,133
-Am I wrong?
-You're wrong!

499
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,068
Can you swear on Joonyoung?

500
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:57,101
Don't say his name like that.

501
00:46:57,334 --> 00:46:59,668
-I didn't do anything wrong.
-It wasn't me either.

502
00:46:59,767 --> 00:47:01,468
I did go there out of anger,

503
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:03,868
but I didn't do it.

504
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:07,968
Fine.

505
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:11,935
It wasn't me or you.

506
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:14,068
Then it's Min Hyunseo.

507
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,700
Let's put it on her.

508
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,268
Are you out of your mind?

509
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:23,001
Do you want to frame
that poor girl for murder...

510
00:47:23,801 --> 00:47:25,535
...just to save your own ass?

511
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:27,968
I'm trying to save both of us!

512
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:29,467
Don't you get it?

513
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:47,101
Hey, Lee Taeoh!

514
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,035
Thank you.

515
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:54,034
Hey!

516
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:57,735
Just the person I wanted to see.
Wait right there!

517
00:47:57,801 --> 00:48:00,535
Just think about what's
best for Joonyoung.

518
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:01,768
Got it?

519
00:48:02,634 --> 00:48:03,701
Hey.

520
00:48:04,868 --> 00:48:08,635
Didn't you promise to make
me assistant director?

521
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,934
Myungsook, be careful. You'll fall.

522
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:19,267
Hey!

523
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,400
Where do you think you're going, punk?

524
00:48:27,501 --> 00:48:29,335
You're so cute.

525
00:48:31,067 --> 00:48:33,067
-Myungsook.
-Bastard!

526
00:48:33,868 --> 00:48:34,769
Hey!

527
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,301
You!

528
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:39,635
What was that guy doing here?

529
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:42,434
Did he get on your nerves again?

530
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,134
He was just dropping by to see Joonyoung.

531
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:47,402
We're going for another round.

532
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:49,601
Do you want to come with us?

533
00:48:51,934 --> 00:48:54,902
I'm going to have a chat
with my friends.

534
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,034
Okay.

535
00:49:00,634 --> 00:49:01,868
Do you have a lot of homework?

536
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,401
Do you want me to bring
some snacks over to you?

537
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:05,867
No.

538
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:10,435
Did you enjoy dinner with your dad?

539
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:13,635
Yes.

540
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:17,502
Go to bed early if you're tired.

541
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:20,502
Don't worry. I'll go to bed in time.

542
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,068
Okay.

543
00:49:22,968 --> 00:49:24,268
Bye.

544
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,567
Hey.

545
00:49:34,634 --> 00:49:37,568
He's in middle-school. Let him be.

546
00:49:37,634 --> 00:49:41,135
I know you're worried about him,
but he'll just think you're nagging.

547
00:49:41,234 --> 00:49:42,601
That's right.

548
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:44,035
Come here and have a drink.

549
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:46,735
How did you get so drunk?

550
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:48,334
Did some good happen today?

551
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:52,801
We drank to celebrate our breakaway
from the Ladies Society.

552
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:55,368
Breakaway?

553
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:57,234
She's going to pull the trigger.

554
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,433
Divorce.

555
00:49:59,901 --> 00:50:01,769
Divorce papers are stamped.

556
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,567
And we're going to court tomorrow.

557
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:05,902
Just one month and my
marriage will be over!

558
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:14,768
Don't look at me like that.
I'm on cloud nine.

559
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:25,435
Why are you crying?

560
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,668
Even Sunwoo is enduring everything.

561
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:40,302
I didn't know it would be this easy.

562
00:50:41,067 --> 00:50:42,568
I feel empty.

563
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,433
I only had one document to stamp.

564
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:52,834
Why did I...

565
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:57,401
..beat myself over something so futile?

566
00:51:00,334 --> 00:51:02,001
Is that all there is...

567
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:06,367
...to marriage?

568
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,201
How come...

569
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:13,934
...I'm left with nothing afterwards?

570
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:17,867
We were married.

571
00:51:18,901 --> 00:51:20,702
Did that really meant nothing?

572
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,934
How nice would it be
if we can just burn that bridge?

573
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:29,301
Brace yourself.

574
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:33,002
Getting over divorce won't
be as easy as you think.

575
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:35,301
That's how it was with me.

576
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,667
Anyway,

577
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:45,068
I'm so glad that you're both single now.

578
00:51:45,601 --> 00:51:46,634
You.

579
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,500
Stop crying!

580
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:52,901
You!

581
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,501
Stop bickering!

582
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:57,368
And me...

583
00:52:01,467 --> 00:52:04,234
I'll always be the cool girl.

584
00:52:07,767 --> 00:52:08,800
Okay?

585
00:52:20,734 --> 00:52:22,235
Sunwoo...

586
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:24,166
Be careful.

587
00:52:25,334 --> 00:52:27,401
The accident at Gosan station...

588
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:30,467
Some people are saying
that you're the culprit.

589
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:36,034
Is that so?

590
00:52:40,434 --> 00:52:41,534
Nah!

591
00:52:41,801 --> 00:52:43,335
Screw them!

592
00:52:44,934 --> 00:52:47,868
Since when did Ji Sunwoo care
about other people's opinions?

593
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,134
Hey.

594
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,701
Just act like you're innocent
even if you did kill him.

595
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,801
And you should take back
the assistant director position.

596
00:52:58,901 --> 00:53:01,735
You'll be the boss!

597
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:03,534
Okay?

598
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:05,502
Cheers.

599
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,168
Cheers.

600
00:53:10,634 --> 00:53:11,767
We rock.

601
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:25,801
Why aren't you asleep yet? It's late.

602
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:37,668
The guy who died at Gosan station...

603
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:42,535
Did you know him?

604
00:53:44,901 --> 00:53:45,901
Who said that?

605
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,834
I heard the police gave you a visit.

606
00:53:49,234 --> 00:53:50,634
My classmates told me.

607
00:53:52,634 --> 00:53:54,168
He was my patient.

608
00:53:55,033 --> 00:53:57,066
That's why the police came to see me.

609
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:00,001
You didn't do it.

610
00:54:01,601 --> 00:54:02,435
Right?

611
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:07,402
Of course not.

612
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:11,634
-My gosh.
-But why do people doubt you?

613
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:16,502
They're all probably bored.

614
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:20,034
Some people just like to gossip.

615
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,400
I'm sure some of your friends
are like that.

616
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:26,600
They normally bitch about
the annoying ones.

617
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,335
Why can't you live in peace?

618
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,168
Why can't you have a normal life
like the other moms?

619
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:35,335
What about me?

620
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:37,635
Why do I have to live like this?

621
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,635
It wasn't my fault.

622
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:45,868
You divorcing dad because he
left for another woman...

623
00:54:48,467 --> 00:54:50,500
I never wanted any of that.

624
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:08,302
Your mom and dad are at fault.

625
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:39,767
Nice!

626
00:55:39,868 --> 00:55:42,469
Nice. Into a hazard.

627
00:55:44,367 --> 00:55:46,567
It seems like you lost your touch.

628
00:55:47,734 --> 00:55:50,401
I didn't get to come often
because of Jenny.

629
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:53,301
I'll challenge you when
the weather's warm.

630
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:54,834
Sounds good to me.

631
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,934
Game on.

632
00:56:01,434 --> 00:56:04,302
How are things with Taeoh?

633
00:56:08,767 --> 00:56:10,934
When you ask me questions like that,

634
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,667
I feel like you're checking my homework.

635
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:15,967
Really?

636
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:18,268
Sorry.

637
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:21,402
It's not all sunshine and rainbows.

638
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:26,135
I learned...

639
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:28,501
...that's just how marriage is.

640
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:31,601
I didn't know that before I got married.

641
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,400
You can always break up
if you have doubts.

642
00:56:38,634 --> 00:56:40,168
I'll take care of you and Jenny...

643
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:42,368
...for the rest of your lives.

644
00:56:45,467 --> 00:56:47,134
I know you still think...

645
00:56:48,834 --> 00:56:50,702
...that Taeoh is not good enough.

646
00:56:51,234 --> 00:56:52,434
I understand,

647
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,767
but it was my decision
and I want to bear the consequences.

648
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:00,934
And I don't want to trouble you
and Mom again with my marriage.

649
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:06,934
You know that a girl needs her father.

650
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:10,700
Jenny should have a dad.

651
00:57:12,901 --> 00:57:14,735
You know what I mean?

652
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,202
No, I don't.

653
00:57:26,467 --> 00:57:28,534
I'll just play nine holes today.

654
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:30,135
Why? Are you bored?

655
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,268
I want to go home early
so I can eat with Taeoh.

656
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,033
-What time is it?
-Are you insane?

657
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,168
Why are you sleeping here?

658
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,968
I guess I asked the
chauffeur to bring me here.

659
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:39,734
I want your hangover soup.

660
00:58:40,868 --> 00:58:41,836
Please?

661
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,267
It feels like heaven
without having to cook.

662
00:58:50,734 --> 00:58:52,702
Just drink water.

663
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:55,668
Maybe it's because I'm home.

664
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,435
I slept like a baby last night.

665
00:59:05,634 --> 00:59:06,901
Aren't you going to work?

666
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:08,268
I should.

667
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:14,001
I'm going to see Sunwoo first.

668
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,334
What for?

669
00:59:20,434 --> 00:59:22,935
I have a friend who's a cop.

670
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:25,502
But he's based in another jurisdiction.

671
00:59:25,601 --> 00:59:26,535
Anyway...

672
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:30,568
I got him hammered
so I could ask him a few things.

673
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:34,801
But something strange is going on.

674
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:36,801
What's strange?

675
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,135
Gosan Station has surveillance
cameras left and right.

676
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:44,869
The server just happened to
be down due to maintenance,

677
00:59:44,934 --> 00:59:46,802
and no footage were taken that day.

678
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:50,434
From noon to midnight.
12 hours gone, just like that.

679
00:59:53,267 --> 00:59:57,267
The routine inspection just happened
to take place on that particular day?

680
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,334
No.

681
00:59:58,934 --> 01:00:00,934
It was due to a sudden error.

682
01:00:02,534 --> 01:00:04,235
It was an impromptu inspection.

683
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:07,301
That's why...

684
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:10,202
...the police won't close
the case as suicide.

685
01:00:10,267 --> 01:00:12,400
They think someone
tampered the evidence.

686
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:16,868
Maybe Chairman Yeo took action.

687
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:19,335
No way.

688
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:21,234
You're going too far.

689
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:24,368
In a small city like this,

690
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:28,467
the tycoons can get away
with a lot of things.

691
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:29,834
You know that.

692
01:00:30,367 --> 01:00:31,667
Especially Chairman Yeo.

693
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,500
I wouldn't be surprised if he has the
stationmaster and the chief in his hands.

694
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:36,901
Right?

695
01:00:41,968 --> 01:00:43,836
This is the original. No other copies.

696
01:00:47,501 --> 01:00:49,002
You and me...

697
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,201
We have to take this secret to the grave.

698
01:00:54,133 --> 01:00:55,067
What about Dakyung?

699
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:59,101
She hasn't said much after checking
Mr. Lee's clock out record.

700
01:01:00,133 --> 01:01:02,300
She must not find out.

701
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,901
We have to sweep this under the rug, okay?

702
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:09,001
Are you sure if that would be...

703
01:01:09,434 --> 01:01:10,868
...the best for Dakyung?

704
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,067
I'm sorry.

705
01:01:16,434 --> 01:01:17,534
Don't be.

706
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:21,367
You're not entirely wrong.

707
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:23,867
Let's decide what to do...

708
01:01:25,133 --> 01:01:27,200
...after we watch this.

709
01:01:27,968 --> 01:01:29,502
What about Ji Sunwoo?

710
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:25,435
Hello?

711
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:47,268
What is it?

712
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:49,001
Is something bothering you?

713
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:51,669
No.

714
01:02:52,467 --> 01:02:53,600
You don't have to know.

715
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:58,602
You have so many secrets...

716
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:01,602
...that I shouldn't know about.

717
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:09,501
I'm having a headache...

718
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,068
...because of what happened to Park Inkyu.

719
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,534
Why do you have a headache?

720
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:23,934
You said you had nothing to do with it.

721
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,268
I may...

722
01:03:32,734 --> 01:03:34,501
...have to bring Joonyoung.

723
01:03:47,968 --> 01:03:49,869
How could you?

724
01:03:51,968 --> 01:03:52,869
"No."

725
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:55,401
"It can't be true."

726
01:03:55,968 --> 01:03:59,035
I try to pull myself together
several times a day.

727
01:04:01,367 --> 01:04:03,201
And Joonyoung is the first thing
you bring up?

728
01:04:05,067 --> 01:04:07,467
-What are you talking about?
-Where's your wedding ring?

729
01:04:08,734 --> 01:04:10,934
Did you decide to take it off forever?

730
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:13,367
And what about the
bloodstain on your shirt?

731
01:04:16,467 --> 01:04:18,600
Why did you go to the station that night?

732
01:04:19,701 --> 01:04:20,801
Answer me.

733
01:04:21,968 --> 01:04:24,836
What happened at Gosan Station that night?

734
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:04,401
I can understand why
you're acting like this,

735
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:06,668
but it wasn't me.

736
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,934
I didn't do it.

737
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,068
I did go to Gosan Station at that time.

738
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:14,834
But I didn't even get to see his face.

739
01:05:14,901 --> 01:05:18,135
He had already jumped off
by the time I got there.

740
01:05:19,767 --> 01:05:21,635
Then tell that to the police.

741
01:05:24,067 --> 01:05:25,134
That will solve everything.

742
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:36,135
Ji Sunwoo was there.

743
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:43,334
What are you talking about?

744
01:05:45,934 --> 01:05:46,902
Did she...

745
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:48,935
...kill him?

746
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,634
I'm not sure.

747
01:05:50,734 --> 01:05:51,767
But...

748
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:55,001
I do have some doubts.

749
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:58,402
Min Hyunseo could've acted on her own
or they could've done it together.

750
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:02,102
Then they sent me to
the rooftop to frame me.

751
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,801
Then why won't you tell the police?

752
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:10,067
She's Joonyoung's mom!

753
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:12,867
How can I...

754
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,333
...turn the mother of my child
into a murderer?

755
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,134
So?

756
01:06:18,534 --> 01:06:20,868
You're going to protect
a murder suspect...

757
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:22,301
...because she's Joonyoung's mom?

758
01:06:30,033 --> 01:06:32,634
Let's bring Joonyoung first, okay?

759
01:06:36,234 --> 01:06:38,102
I couldn't tell you because I knew
you'd get worried.

760
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,200
I'm sorry.

761
01:06:40,133 --> 01:06:41,200
But...

762
01:06:41,634 --> 01:06:42,868
It wasn't me.

763
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,734
You have to believe me.

764
01:06:49,901 --> 01:06:51,435
Then convince me.

765
01:06:53,234 --> 01:06:54,301
To believe you.

766
01:07:41,467 --> 01:07:43,667
Why did you put a tail on Ms. Ji Sunwoo?

767
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:49,434
What is this, Dr. Kim?

768
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:52,534
I saw Lee Taeoh that night.

769
01:08:17,434 --> 01:08:21,834
Please don't mess with Ji Sunwoo
just to cover up after your son-in-law.

770
01:08:22,334 --> 01:08:23,968
If you keep this up,

771
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:28,134
I'll have to come forward
about what I saw.

772
01:08:33,968 --> 01:08:35,435
What's your point?

773
01:09:08,634 --> 01:09:09,602
Please come in.

774
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:28,135
You wanted to frame me for murder?

775
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:34,668
Given the circumstances
and the witnesses,

776
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:37,868
Lee Taeoh looks more suspicious than I do.

777
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:42,235
Actually, I don't have
that many friends...

778
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:44,469
...here in Gosan.

779
01:10:44,534 --> 01:10:48,101
I don't have the power to
fabricate investigation results.

780
01:10:48,534 --> 01:10:49,534
So why would I do that?

781
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:50,967
Just so happens...

782
01:10:52,334 --> 01:10:54,302
There is no footage taken on that day.

783
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:58,534
How would I know? I'm not a cop.

784
01:10:58,767 --> 01:10:59,834
Don't you think so?

785
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,600
We can just...

786
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:05,502
...check the footage from the next day.

787
01:11:06,434 --> 01:11:09,135
If anyone came by to retrieve the footage,

788
01:11:10,968 --> 01:11:12,602
I'm sure he was caught on camera.

789
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:21,001
What do you want?

790
01:11:26,801 --> 01:11:28,235
Both Taeoh and I...

791
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:33,334
Neither of us can become murderers.

792
01:11:36,434 --> 01:11:37,668
Because Park Inkyu...

793
01:11:40,934 --> 01:11:42,234
...committed suicide.

794
01:13:01,968 --> 01:13:03,735
Mr. Lee Taeoh?

795
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:10,001
You need to come with us.

796
01:13:30,033 --> 01:13:31,767
I'm at the police station.

797
01:13:35,067 --> 01:13:37,601
I'm sorry for putting
you in a tough spot.

798
01:13:40,267 --> 01:13:42,534
I don't want to burden you anymore.

799
01:13:44,267 --> 01:13:45,634
From now on,

800
01:13:46,534 --> 01:13:48,801
I'll take care of my own problems.

801
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,433
(Husband)

802
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,467
(Lee Taeoh)

803
01:15:03,601 --> 01:15:04,701
Let's go.

804
01:15:16,467 --> 01:15:19,767
It seems like your plan
has gone awry, Dr. Ji.

805
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:07,135
(The World of the Married)

806
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,735
I'm sorry,

807
01:16:08,834 --> 01:16:11,034
but I don't give a damn
about Lee Taeoh's future.

808
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,233
What more do I have to do
to gain your trust?

809
01:16:13,334 --> 01:16:16,401
Do you know why I couldn't
get away from Inkyu?

810
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:17,901
I pitied him.

811
01:16:17,968 --> 01:16:20,368
He was never like that
when he was with me.

812
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:22,767
But somehow, he looks whole now.

813
01:16:22,834 --> 01:16:25,668
She's enduring all that for you.

814
01:16:26,033 --> 01:16:27,233
That's what moms do.

815
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:30,135
Both of you were clinging on to it.

816
01:16:30,534 --> 01:16:32,468
You must cut off that vicious circle.

817
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:34,901
Even if hatred is the only
thing that's left,

818
01:16:34,968 --> 01:16:37,202
there's no place in her heart
for someone else.

819
01:16:37,267 --> 01:16:38,101
Not yet.

820
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,068
If I told you that I regret
marrying her...

821
01:16:40,133 --> 01:16:42,667
If I told you that I'm fed up with it....

822
01:16:43,901 --> 01:16:45,835
Will you tell me the truth?
