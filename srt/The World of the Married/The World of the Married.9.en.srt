(The World of the Married)

3
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,834
You wish to join the Ladies' Society?

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,867
Yes.

5
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,034
This is surprising.

6
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:01,235
I thought you were here
to talk about the hospital.

7
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,133
I've heard...

8
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:08,767
...that some people are
out to take your place.

9
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:12,301
I shouldn't trouble you
with something like that.

10
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:14,801
It's not right.

11
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,267
Are you telling me to back off
on that matter...

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,467
...since it's none of my concern?

13
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:22,868
I just want to do something...

14
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:27,168
...for our community.

15
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,301
Frontal breakthrough?

16
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,868
Is that what you're planning?

17
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,734
I wouldn't put it that way.

18
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:43,068
You want to air
your dirty laundry in public?

19
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:46,569
I don't think that's a good idea, Dr. Ji.

20
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,234
I can't keep avoiding the situation.

21
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,601
You know better than anyone...

22
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:06,967
...about how I feel.

23
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,201
I do understand.

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,734
But still...

25
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,401
I don't feel like taking anybody's side.

26
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,200
I don't think I should either.

27
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,435
As long as you don't object,

28
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:26,968
I would be grateful.

29
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,467
So...

30
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,702
After you join the Ladies' Society,

31
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:37,135
what are you going to do?

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,467
I vote yes.

33
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:55,469
Dakyung.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,968
Thank you.

35
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,268
Welcome, Dr. Ji.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,434
Thank you, Madam.

37
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,601
Welcome.

38
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,101
Welcome.

39
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,601
Thank you for accepting me.

40
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,135
There's no reason why I should object.

41
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,801
What's your motive?

42
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,068
I thought I had your vote.

43
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:01,901
But I need to know where you stand.

44
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,534
Is this a call for truce?

45
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,268
Or are you picking a fight?

46
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,001
Let's just say...

47
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,268
...that I'm sending a warning to Taeoh.

48
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,034
If he finds out about this,

49
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,834
I figure he'll be more careful.

50
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,034
Careful about what?

51
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,701
Your husband is...

52
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,767
...stalking me.

53
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,600
Believe it or not, I'm telling the truth.

54
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:07,235
I'm worried.

55
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,835
Maybe you should seek
psychiatric help.

56
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,501
I should be worried about you.

57
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,901
Remember what I said?

58
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,433
You don't know Taeoh.

59
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,801
I think you're trying to
throw me off my game...

60
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,901
I'm not trying to pick a fight with you.

61
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,333
I'm telling you something
you don't know.

62
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,168
Hold on to your husband.

63
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,334
I beg you.

64
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,867
What are you up to?

65
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,001
Can't you just live peacefully?

66
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,234
No.

67
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:22,367
Are you insane?

68
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,801
Why did you vote yes?

69
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,535
I've sent holiday gifts and held
dinner parties every season!

70
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,101
It took a lot of effort
to build the Ladies' Society.

71
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:32,968
To stop people from talking
about your shameful marriage...

72
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,134
That's enough.

73
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,235
If that's how my own mother
thinks of my marriage,

74
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,001
I wonder what other
people would think.

75
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:39,735
My goodness...

76
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,333
Is it him?

77
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,667
Stay out of this, Mom.

78
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:49,001
I can take care of my own problems.

79
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,667
(Husband)

80
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:53,801
Hey honey.

81
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,335
How about a date tonight?

82
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:59,068
I made a reservation at a nice restaurant.

83
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,168
Okay.

84
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:27,769
What the police said makes sense.

85
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:31,701
Just because your ex-husband stopped
by when your house was empty,

86
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,334
doesn't mean that he's a suspect.

87
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,901
Do you also think
that I'm overreacting?

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,501
I'm saying, you should wait
for the investigation results.

89
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,901
Why don't I...

90
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
...stay at your place for a while?

91
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:53,202
We should do that.

92
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:54,867
I think it's a good idea.

93
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:10,101
Would this table do?

94
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,534
Shall we go somewhere else?

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,167
Do you feel awkward?

96
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:30,568
No.

97
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,301
It's not that I feel awkward...

98
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,533
Would it make you uncomfortable?

99
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,501
We're good.

100
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,201
The pinot noir they brought
in last week is excellent.

101
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:05,434
Would you like some?

102
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:09,134
Maybe next time.

103
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,301
I should take it easy tonight.

104
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,166
Okay.

105
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:34,302
Should we just join tables?

106
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,135
What do you want to eat?

107
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:06,101
You come here often, don't you?

108
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,502
But a place like this...

109
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:13,934
...is not really Sunwoo's taste.

110
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,100
I'll stop you there.

111
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,367
Ms. Ji Sunwoo is not your wife anymore.

112
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,268
Does it bother you
that your ex-wife is dating?

113
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,068
Whatever she does is
none of my business.

114
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,567
Just the sight of her alone...

115
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,267
...makes me feel uncomfortable.

116
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:23,702
Maybe it's because they're both doctors.

117
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:27,201
They seemed to be...

118
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:29,469
...hitting it off.

119
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,234
Damn it, that bastard.

120
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,934
Where did he learn how to drive?

121
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:37,367
Does he want to die?

122
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:40,968
Just admit it.

123
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,168
You're pissed because
your ex-wife is seeing another man.

124
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:46,435
What's wrong with you today?

125
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:47,567
You tell me.

126
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,668
I'm concerned about
the way you're acting today.

127
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,368
I know you were trying to act cool,

128
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,501
despite feeling uncomfortable.

129
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:22,502
I actually enjoyed the tension.

130
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,502
When people go hiking,

131
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:41,635
they think about
the distance they will go.

132
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:44,134
More precariously if
the mountain is higher.

133
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:50,435
Do you think I didn't expect this
when I started to have feelings for you?

134
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:55,567
So stop acting like you're okay
and take my hand.

135
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:58,135
Today was a rough day for you.

136
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:41,434
Are you doing your homework?

137
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:46,367
What did that guy say?

138
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,801
Confidentiality is our ground principle.

139
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:50,868
Even if I'm your mom,

140
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,834
he won't talk about it.

141
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:54,602
Don't worry.

142
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,868
Then why do you hang out
with him all the time?

143
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:03,468
Dr. Kim and I are colleagues.

144
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,867
There is nothing going on between us.

145
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,836
You are my everything.

146
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:10,836
You know that, right?

147
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:18,634
I'll leave you to study.

148
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,368
What were you doing
leaving the kid at home?

149
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,601
What I do is none of your business.

150
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:45,235
Are you that serious with that guy?

151
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:50,068
-Why do you care?
-What do you mean, why?

152
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:54,034
If you get remarried,
Joonyoung should live with me.

153
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:01,100
Stop beating around the bush
and tell me why you called.

154
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,801
I don't want you anywhere near Dakyung.

155
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,202
Why?

156
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:07,901
Are you scared...

157
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:10,368
...that I'll tell her
what you did to me?

158
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:11,668
Watch your mouth.

159
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,268
Stop making up stories
that aren't true!

160
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,801
I think you're scared
that I might tell her he truth.

161
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:18,235
Whatever it is...

162
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:21,702
This is between us.
Don't drag Dakyung into this.

163
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:24,534
Then stop harassing me!

164
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,468
Excessive weariness could
be a form of delusion.

165
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:49,168
Harboring that much hatred
against someone...

166
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:51,634
...means you still care.

167
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,367
Do you think...

168
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,635
...I'm still hung up
on my ex-husband?

169
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,834
Whatever it is, don't you want
a fresh start?

170
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,400
It was difficult for Joonyoung...

171
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:16,001
...to accept the divorce
and his dad's remarriage.

172
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,501
I can't make it worse for him.

173
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:31,634
Going somewhere?

174
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,901
I'm meeting a friend for a drink.

175
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:51,368
The playboy of Gosan.

176
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:54,001
- What the hell?
- I'm serious.

177
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,700
Sounds plausible.

178
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,368
- Then what does this stand for?
- Exactly as it sounds.

179
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,001
Really?

180
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,567
How is it pronounced?

181
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,934
- What brings you here?
- What do you think?

182
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:18,400
I came in for a drink
then I saw you.

183
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:22,268
I'll leave you two alone to talk.

184
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,267
Shall we have a drink?

185
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:18,402
This is on the house.

186
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:21,101
Since you're a regular.

187
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:34,701
Is she your sugarbaby?

188
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,734
What are you talking about?

189
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,334
She's giving me some freebies
because I spend a lot here.

190
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,700
I can tell you already slept with her.

191
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,468
No, I didn't.

192
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,435
Cut the crap.

193
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:55,602
I want to hear about your business.

194
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,901
How's the movie set construction going?

195
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,535
I'll invite you to the
groundbreaking ceremony.

196
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,134
You made it big, Taeoh.

197
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,001
You haven't changed at all.

198
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,167
You and your inferiority complex.

199
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:17,135
Of course I envy you.
Mooching off women is quite a talent.

200
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,534
Welcome.

201
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,034
So?

202
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:19,868
Did you enjoy sleeping with my wife?

203
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,201
How was Sunwoo?

204
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,001
Pretty fine, right?

205
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,101
Why do you want to know?

206
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:35,434
She's not your wife anymore.

207
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,467
Give it to me straight.

208
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,535
Quit beating around the bush.

209
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,500
Ji Sunwoo...

210
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,368
She's gorgeous.

211
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:55,901
And hot!

212
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:02,634
Son of a bitch.

213
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,102
She likes taking the lead.

214
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,668
- I bet you know that already.
- You're a real son of a bitch.

215
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,702
Better than being a scumbag
who abandoned his wife and son.

216
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:20,135
Right?

217
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:29,467
My goodness!

218
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:33,102
You know I'm right, jerk!

219
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,834
Oh dear!

220
00:21:39,434 --> 00:21:42,235
-Excuse me!
-You're the one who asked!

221
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,735
Why did you ask!

222
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,601
You piece of shit!

223
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,034
Let go of me, jerk!

224
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,568
-Let go!
-Please calm down!

225
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:02,901
Break them up.

226
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,501
- What are you doing!
- Please stop.

227
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:06,502
Hey!

228
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:08,667
Get over here!

229
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:09,867
-Come here!
-Let go!

230
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,801
Let go of me!

231
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,135
-Let go.
-Get out.

232
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:37,001
Why did you drink so much?

233
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,701
Did you have a party
with your staffs?

234
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:48,368
What happened?

235
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,867
Did you get hurt?

236
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,001
Were you in a fight?

237
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:54,068
I met Taeoh.

238
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:02,068
I ran into him by coincidence.

239
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:06,968
Wait.

240
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,402
Drink this.

241
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,369
I'll go get the ointment.

242
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:46,602
Are you happy with your wife?

243
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,202
Be good to your wife.

244
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:56,801
You don't want to go through divorce.
Trust me.

245
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,168
You made it big after your divorce.

246
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:04,135
That's a different story.

247
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,968
She puts up with your crap
because she's your wife.

248
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:09,935
You selfish bastard.

249
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:13,267
Do you think you'll stay young forever?

250
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:17,067
You need to get a grip
before it's too late.

251
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:20,200
When you get old,

252
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,600
the only thing that's left...

253
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,234
...will be your children.

254
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,134
Should we have a baby?

255
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,133
But...

256
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:16,568
Having a child will only
make your life difficult.

257
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,168
You know I'm a selfish bastard.

258
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,500
Shall we go downstairs?

259
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:05,901
Careful. That's it.

260
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:08,135
That's it.

261
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:26,602
Have you validated the equipment
requests from each department?

262
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:27,734
Yes, Dr. Ji.

263
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,367
Please manage the ones
purchased through open bidding.

264
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:32,467
Most importantly,

265
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:35,868
please make sure there are no
problems with the private contracts.

266
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:37,302
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

267
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:42,334
I see that OB-GYN achieved
a high rate in fertility treatment.

268
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,968
People talk I guess.

269
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,402
The number of patients increased.

270
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,934
So are the number of complaints.

271
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:54,900
Patients these days are smart.

272
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:59,035
When there's overtreatment or
excessive use of machines,

273
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:01,101
they think lobbying is involved.

274
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:05,834
I would never do such thing.

275
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,301
Right.

276
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:11,235
Let's be careful and avoid
any misunderstandings.

277
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:12,868
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

278
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,034
Let's wrap it up, Dr. Gong.

279
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,602
Shall we?

280
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:19,568
Great work, everyone.

281
00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:20,767
Thank you.

282
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,233
Oh, that's right.

283
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:32,101
Is Joonyoung still getting counseling?

284
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:44,235
This isn't the right place to talk
about family issues, Dr. Seol.

285
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:04,101
What happened?

286
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,569
Dr. Gong is not budging at all!

287
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,901
I'm here now to get the answer from him.

288
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:13,101
I know that.

289
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,501
I have to resolve this matter
as soon as possible.

290
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,067
Getting rid of one person
will solve the problem.

291
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,400
There's no need to beat
our brains over it.

292
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:27,669
If there's a splinter,
might as well remove it fast.

293
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,601
What is your decision regarding
the assistant director issue?

294
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:44,368
I was going to give you a call
about that matter.

295
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:48,401
I have an appointment
with Chairman Yeo tonight.

296
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,901
An appointment?

297
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:57,867
-What are you talking about?
-Dr. Ji strongly requested to do so.

298
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:03,934
You want to meet Chairman Yeo?

299
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:05,702
Yes, sir.

300
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,834
I'll talk to him face to face.

301
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,500
Just so you know,

302
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:15,068
I won't give up on that
donation, understand?

303
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:17,301
I know.

304
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:18,867
Are you sure you're up to it?

305
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,333
Unless...

306
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:24,068
...you want me out of
the assistant director's position.

307
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,767
What are you talking about?

308
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:28,734
I'll choose you over Dr. Seol any day.

309
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,800
You bring in the highest
number of patients.

310
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:35,102
And no one can handle
administrative work better than you.

311
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:38,401
If we get the donation
and secure your position for you,

312
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:39,935
I'll be very happy.

313
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,368
I will do my best.

314
00:29:42,434 --> 00:29:45,001
I knew I can count on you.

315
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,767
Just thinking about that matter
gives me a headache.

316
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:51,233
All right.

317
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,035
I'll arrange something with Chairman Yeo.

318
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:07,001
Do you think you can change the outcome?

319
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,800
- I have a patient in five minutes.
- Do you think it was my idea...

320
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:21,234
...to have you removed
from your position?

321
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,834
Did it ever occur to you that
Chairman Yeo gave the order?

322
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,001
Who is this?

323
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:45,268
I know he was sent by you.

324
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:48,501
No one in Gosan will take your side.

325
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,201
Leave the city before you
embarrass yourself.

326
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:53,935
For your own sake.

327
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:57,166
Are you worried about me?

328
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,901
Don't try to fight it. You will get hurt!

329
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,268
If you're done talking,

330
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:07,601
please leave, Mr. Lee Taeoh.

331
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,200
I told you not to leave
any loose ends.

332
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,934
Send my money first.

333
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:25,301
You were caught on camera.
Are you aware of that?

334
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,234
Send my money first.

335
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,967
You shouldn't ask for money
when you did a half-ass job.

336
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,734
Don't call me for the time being.

337
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,735
If you try to put it on me,

338
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:39,268
I will kill you.

339
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:42,034
What is it that you want to talk about?

340
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Apparently, Taeoh and Jehyuk
ran into each other...

341
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:55,101
...last night.

342
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:56,467
So?

343
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,834
We're both in the Ladies' Society.

344
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:03,669
And our husbands are friends.

345
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:08,768
We'll keep seeing each other
whether we like it or not.

346
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:10,434
So?

347
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,301
I know you don't like me.

348
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:19,300
But...

349
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:23,234
I want to be on good terms with you.

350
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,834
What's in it for you?

351
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,667
Do you expect me to sit down with you...

352
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,533
...and bitch about Sunwoo
behind her back?

353
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,800
Why did Ji Sunwoo...

354
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:45,001
...join the Ladies' Society?

355
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,068
You voted against her.

356
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:53,034
I figured you would know
what her motive is.

357
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,601
Your husband...

358
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,534
Just how much do you trust him?

359
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:07,301
I know it was difficult
for you to come see me.

360
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,168
So I'll give it to you straight.

361
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,168
Personally,

362
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:13,935
I'm not so fond of you.

363
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:16,800
But I find Taeoh to be worse.

364
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:18,968
I already told my husband...

365
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:21,433
...to stay away from Taeoh.

366
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:24,435
I don't want to get involved...

367
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:27,802
...in your family conflict anymore.

368
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,767
Is it gone? Have you looked everywhere?

369
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:16,702
I did.

370
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:18,502
-Dude, relax.
-Take it easy.

371
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:20,201
I told you it's not in here.

372
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:23,034
Stop obsessing over a pen.
Just buy a new one.

373
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:26,233
It's really expensive.
You can't find it in Korea.

374
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:27,734
It's sold in Germany only.

375
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:29,600
It was from my dad.

376
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,101
I'm sure it was in here this morning.

377
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:34,302
Maybe someone took it?

378
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:38,201
There's been a lot of missing
items in our class lately.

379
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:40,467
-No way.
-Can't be.

380
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:41,634
Hey, Joonyoung!

381
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:44,901
Did any of your stuff went missing?

382
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:46,101
No.

383
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,200
- Look carefully.
- This is so annoying!

384
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:59,634
This is the last assignment
for this semester.

385
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:03,535
Show me what you've
learned in my class.

386
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,234
Teacher?

387
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:22,301
Yes?

388
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:24,469
I need to go to the bathroom.

389
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,067
Go ahead.

390
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:37,468
Was that Haekang's pen?

391
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:39,734
No.

392
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:50,869
Why?

393
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,667
Why did you do that?

394
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,034
What do you know?

395
00:37:57,934 --> 00:37:59,067
Do you have proof?

396
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,967
We face this all the time.

397
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:15,602
Okay...

398
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:21,868
Keep up the good work until the end.

399
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:22,867

408
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,367
I want you to tell Haekang.

409
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:42,502
If you don't, I'll tell him.

No weird stuffs.

413

- Curry.
- Pork belly.

414
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:28,667
- Have a nice day.
- Take care.

415
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:29,934
Bye.

416
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,667

418

Well...

419
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:45,700
I guess we'll know soon.

420
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:50,968

421
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:54,402
Yes?

Okay.

- Dr. Ji Sunwoo?
- Yes, that's me.

426
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:18,634
A package for you.

00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:22,634
-Your signature please.
-Sure.

She didn't come with you?

You should've told your parents
before you left.

502
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,001
Good evening.

503
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,133
Are you all right?

504
00:51:14,868 --> 00:51:16,168
Did you get hurt?

505
00:51:17,534 --> 00:51:18,734
No, right?

506
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,467
He was hanging out here because he
didn't want to go to cram school.

507
00:51:25,801 --> 00:51:27,035
Thank you.

508
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,767
Thank you so much.

509
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:44,035
What happened?

510
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,734
Did you ditch cram school?

511
00:51:46,934 --> 00:51:47,967
Why did you turn off your phone?

512
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:50,033
I just wanted to.

513
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,667
- What?
- Can't I skip cram school for once?

514
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:55,735
Is that such a big deal?

515
00:51:55,834 --> 00:51:57,568
What's wrong with you?

516
00:52:02,934 --> 00:52:04,001
Excuse me.

517
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:31,535
Dr. Ji.

518
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:40,334
Joonyoung...

519
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:18,768
Did you eat dinner?

520
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:34,134
I don't think they'll make it.

521
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:35,934
Let's have dinner some other time.

522
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:39,267
Please allow me to say something
since we're here.

523
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:43,201
I'm very grateful for the donation,

524
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,300
but it's a painful decision for us.

525
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,001
To be honest, Dr. Seol is not
associate director material.

526
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:53,168
If you can please reconsider...

527
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,967
There are many other good
doctors at your hospital.

528
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,434
We do have many good doctors,

529
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:03,268
but I'm not sure if they can take
on the roll of assistant director.

530
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,400
What about the psychiatrist from Seoul?

531
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:10,735
I've been hearing good things about him.

532
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:22,734
Forget it. I have nothing to say.

533
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,068
Joonyoung.

534
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:33,100
Joonyoung.

535
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:37,501
-Just listen to me.
-Will you please back off?

536
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:39,668
What's gotten into you?

537
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:41,767
Why do you get to be the angry one?

538
00:54:41,868 --> 00:54:43,702
I don't want to talk to you.

539
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:46,934
What kind of mom calls the police
the police for skipping a lesson?

540
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:50,334
How could I not worry
when you've gone AWOL?

541
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:53,102
Open the door now!

542
00:54:53,901 --> 00:54:56,068
- Joonyoung!
- Let me talk to him.

543
00:54:59,734 --> 00:55:02,068
Losing your cool won't do any good.

544
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:03,267
Let me handle this.

545
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,268
Joonyoung, can we talk?

546
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:17,267
Why don't you wait downstairs.

547
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,667
You're obviously angry
because you think it's unfair.

548
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:40,368
What made you angry?

549
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:42,435
What is it that you can't stand so much?

550
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,334
Let's sort out all of
your negative emotions.

551
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:50,234
I'll wait for you to calm down.

552
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:57,135
And then we'll talk man to man.

553
00:57:06,968 --> 00:57:08,936
Apparently, he had a little fight
with his friends.

554
00:57:09,434 --> 00:57:12,634
Don't worry about it.
You can relax.

555
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,501
He's sorry about losing his temper.

556
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,467
What if you reduce your workload?

557
00:57:30,934 --> 00:57:32,668
If the assistant director
reduces her workload,

558
00:57:33,234 --> 00:57:35,434
what do you think will happen
to the hospital?

559
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:37,835
Joonyoung is going through
an important phase.

560
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:41,801
Perhaps it's better to
spend more time with him.

561
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:44,667
Isn't that more important
than your job?

562
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,467
I have to play his father's role, too.

563
00:57:53,868 --> 00:57:55,669
To give him a good life,

564
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:58,802
giving up work is out of the question.

565
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:00,268
You have to decide...

566
00:58:00,934 --> 00:58:04,234
...between material wealth
and his mental health.

567
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,268
You can't have both.

568
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,767
Are you telling me to accept my limits?

569
00:58:09,868 --> 00:58:11,302
Because I'm a divorcée?

570
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:14,634
Not all mothers are perfect.
Even the ones who didn't divorce.

571
00:58:19,501 --> 00:58:21,102
You don't understand, Dr. Kim.

572
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:24,667
Because you're not a parent.

573
00:58:33,033 --> 00:58:35,534
I just want to see Joonyoung.
What's wrong with you?

574
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:39,035
What makes you think you have the rights?

575
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,767
How dare you show up here!

576
00:58:41,834 --> 00:58:43,901
Let's get something straight.

577
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,034
It's not my fault that
you couldn't reach him.

578
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,333
It's him.

579
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,034
It's Park Inkyu.

580
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:56,268
- Say what?
- Do you think I'm acting like this...

581
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,667
...because I couldn't get a hold
of Joonyoung?

582
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,001
I got a dead bird...

583
00:59:00,968 --> 00:59:03,068
...and a bloody photo of Joonyoung
in a package.

584
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:07,134
That bastard's been following Joonyoung
after blackmailing me!

585
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:09,835
Are you sure?

586
00:59:11,934 --> 00:59:13,735
He was at the place
where Joonyoung was found.

587
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:17,001
I saw his face with my own eyes.

588
00:59:21,968 --> 00:59:22,936
You're behind this, aren't you?

589
00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:26,668
You dragged him into this.

590
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,801
As if threatening me wasn't enough,

591
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,868
did you make him go after Joonyoung too?

592
00:59:32,934 --> 00:59:34,501
I don't want to hear your bullshit.

593
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,701
Why on earth would I do such a thing?

594
00:59:37,634 --> 00:59:39,468
I think you know why.

595
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,834
What's wrong with you!

596
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:47,001
Why are you making my life miserable!

597
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:49,701
It wasn't me.

598
00:59:50,534 --> 00:59:51,667
I didn't do it.

599
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,968
Don't tell me you didn't know
that it will put Joonyoung in danger.

600
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,934
Your excuses won't work!

601
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,734
If I see that jerk prowling
around us one more time,

602
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:03,068
I will hurt you.

603
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,867
I'll go alone.

604
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:57,901
Second drawer from the bottom.

605
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,201
(Security System Activated)

606
01:01:14,834 --> 01:01:16,601
Security system disabled.

607
01:03:04,434 --> 01:03:05,634
Your husband is...

608
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,701
...stalking me.

609
01:03:46,234 --> 01:03:47,135
(Ji Sunwoo)

610
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:53,035
(Ji Sunwoo)

611
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:57,534
Hello?

612
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:58,768
It's Park Inkyu...

613
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:01,067
...isn't it?

614
01:04:03,267 --> 01:04:06,068
I can't tell. His face is all covered up.

615
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:10,335
You know he completed his sentence, right?

616
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:12,968
Did he come looking for you?

617
01:04:13,734 --> 01:04:14,702
No.

618
01:04:14,968 --> 01:04:17,302
I don't think he knows where I live.

619
01:04:18,434 --> 01:04:20,135
He appeared before my eyes.

620
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:21,801
He even blackmailed me.

621
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,368
He might give you a visit.

622
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,834
Maybe you should hide.

623
01:04:28,133 --> 01:04:30,734
Like I said, I don't think
he knows where I am.

624
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,667
We broke up a long time ago.

625
01:04:34,067 --> 01:04:35,501
Don't ever call me...

626
01:04:35,801 --> 01:04:37,468
...to talk about this again.

627
01:04:42,934 --> 01:04:44,601
(Min Hyunseo)

628
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:58,035
Gosh, the vending machine's so far away.

629
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:00,668
Who were you talking to on the phone?

630
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:05,102
My roommate.

631
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:07,868
She asked me when I'm coming home.

632
01:05:14,133 --> 01:05:14,967
Drink up.

633
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,934
So... How's your work? Good?

634
01:05:32,901 --> 01:05:33,568
Yes.

635
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,267
Good to see you're healthy...

636
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:46,501
...and well.

637
01:05:47,834 --> 01:05:49,034
That's all I wanted to see.

638
01:05:55,434 --> 01:05:56,235
Hyunseo...

639
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,600
Do you still hate me that much?

640
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,101
I never blamed you for what happened.

641
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:08,634
I missed you a lot.

642
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:13,068
Hyunseo...

643
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,967
Didn't you miss me?

644
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,867
I was worried about you.

645
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:23,134
And I felt bad for you.

646
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:28,635
Can we...

647
01:06:30,033 --> 01:06:31,534
...start over?

648
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:34,502
I promise to be a better man.

649
01:06:35,968 --> 01:06:38,202
I've changed a lot.

650
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:41,401
I won't give you a hard time again.

651
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,100
I promise.

652
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:49,334
Can you honestly...

653
01:06:51,467 --> 01:06:53,234
...picture us being together?

654
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,434
What are you sneering at?

655
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:24,568
How dare you mess with my son?

656
01:07:24,834 --> 01:07:26,034
Are you crazy?

657
01:07:26,267 --> 01:07:27,968
Give me a break.

658
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:30,401
I didn't do anything.

659
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,500
Not yet anyway.

660
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:35,767
"Not yet"?

661
01:07:36,868 --> 01:07:39,702
- "Not yet"?
- The police already knows my face.

662
01:07:40,934 --> 01:07:43,034
I'm screwed if you call of our deal.

663
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,768
So you'd better pay me.

664
01:07:46,434 --> 01:07:47,768
Stop pissing me off.

665
01:07:47,868 --> 01:07:49,535
You dumbass.

666
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,167
You should've known that
our deal went south...

667
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:54,867
...the moment you went after my son.

668
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:58,601
Stay away from me and my son.

669
01:07:58,968 --> 01:08:00,035
Is that clear?

670
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:02,234
You're ratting out just like that?

671
01:08:03,734 --> 01:08:05,901
No, you're the one who
didn't keep your promise.

672
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,167
How dare you threaten me?

673
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:10,667
I've already been to jail.
I can go again.

674
01:08:11,868 --> 01:08:14,635
Who's going to stop me from
snitching to the police?

675
01:08:14,734 --> 01:08:16,001
That would be fun.

676
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:20,801
A famous movie producer paid
someone to beat up his wife?

677
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:22,168
That will surely make the headlines.

678
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:29,634
Listen, Lee Taeoh.

679
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:34,068
The real threat hasn't even started.

680
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:35,801
You agreed to pay me.

681
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,934
Now I want double.

682
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,734
Only then our deal will end.

683
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:51,901
I want double, got it?

684
01:09:55,334 --> 01:09:56,235
Honey.

685
01:09:57,934 --> 01:09:58,967
Dakyung.

686
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:20,567
Where have you been? It's late.

687
01:10:22,868 --> 01:10:23,769
Dakyung.

688
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:31,734
Come out quietly.

689
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:33,434
You'll wake Jenny.

690
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:50,267
Is something wrong?

691
01:10:52,133 --> 01:10:53,600
I met a friend.

692
01:10:57,868 --> 01:10:58,868
What about you?

693
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,500
Why were you late?

694
01:11:04,033 --> 01:11:05,834
Something happened to Joonyoung.

695
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:11,400
Joonyoung...

696
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:17,101
What was it this time?

697
01:11:19,934 --> 01:11:21,067
It wasn't a big deal.

698
01:11:25,801 --> 01:11:27,502
Is he having problems?

699
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,001
Is his mom unable to
control him by herself?

700
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,601
He doesn't have problems.

701
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:33,369
Don't say things like that.

702
01:11:33,467 --> 01:11:35,401
But you rush over there
if anything happens.

703
01:11:35,501 --> 01:11:38,469
Why are you trying to fix their problems?
Do you miss her that much?

704
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:47,066
I'm trying to get rid of her for good.

705
01:11:47,901 --> 01:11:49,934
If you don't believe me,
ask your father.

706
01:11:52,634 --> 01:11:53,868
Your husband...

707
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,300
Just how much do you trust him?

708
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,600
Your husband...

709
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:11,034
Just how much do you trust him?

710
01:12:20,434 --> 01:12:21,534
I'll believe you.

711
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:29,267
I said...

712
01:12:30,701 --> 01:12:31,635
I'll believe you.

713
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:37,868
I'm so sorry, Father.

714
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:40,135
Something unexpected came up.

715
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,134
My son didn't pick up his phone.

716
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,801
I was afraid something bad
might have happened to him.

717
01:12:46,701 --> 01:12:48,868
He never acted like that before.

718
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:51,300
I couldn't think straight.

719
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:53,801
I didn't even know you called.

720
01:12:53,901 --> 01:12:55,702
Good to hear that everything's okay.

721
01:12:56,934 --> 01:12:59,201
You don't have to keep explaining.

722
01:13:00,534 --> 01:13:03,901
What should I do about
the assistant director thing?

723
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:06,867
Let me think about it.

724
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,335
Aren't you going to work?

725
01:13:10,634 --> 01:13:12,301
I need to take care of some things.

726
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:14,168
Yes, sir.

727
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:27,102
You must have been shocked.

728
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,268
Kids goes through that
phase once in their lives.

729
01:13:30,434 --> 01:13:33,868
My kids gave me a rough time
during their puberty.

730
01:13:34,067 --> 01:13:35,935
I know how you feel.

731
01:13:37,467 --> 01:13:38,801
I'm sorry.

732
01:13:39,367 --> 01:13:41,101
I won't let my family matters...

733
01:13:41,434 --> 01:13:43,834
...interfere with my work
at the hospital again.

734
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,901
That is easier said than done.

735
01:13:47,801 --> 01:13:49,568
He's been seeing a psychiatrist
for six months,

736
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:51,301
and yet you didn't know.

737
01:13:51,534 --> 01:13:54,235
This is why a boy needs his father.

738
01:13:54,434 --> 01:13:58,101
But it's not like you can
ask Mr. Lee for help.

739
01:13:59,267 --> 01:14:01,768
All I've been thinking about was work.

740
01:14:01,868 --> 01:14:04,968
I didn't know what you
were going through.

741
01:14:05,267 --> 01:14:07,534
Don't try too hard.
Just focus on your son.

742
01:14:07,601 --> 01:14:08,968
Your child should be your priority.

743
01:14:09,033 --> 01:14:11,667
I know you're upset.

744
01:14:11,767 --> 01:14:13,834
Even if Dr. Kim helps you,

745
01:14:14,467 --> 01:14:16,335
he can't compare to his father.

746
01:14:17,734 --> 01:14:20,501
A woman can't handle
everything by herself.

747
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:21,767
Isn't that right?

748
01:14:23,734 --> 01:14:25,801
I told you not to talk
about my family issues.

749
01:14:25,868 --> 01:14:28,935
If you want my job,
win it fairly with your own merits.

750
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,734
Don't you think it's cowardly of you?

751
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:34,635
Am I the only one who
knows that Dr. Kim is...

752
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:36,435
...counseling Joonyoung?

753
01:14:36,734 --> 01:14:39,034
How come you never doubt Kim Yoonki?

754
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,034
Why did he provide counseling
to your son of all people?

755
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,634
And he kept it a secret from you.

756
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:44,402
Don't you think it's strange?

757
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:49,435
Stop making me feel bad, Sunwoo.

758
01:14:49,534 --> 01:14:51,968
I might be the only ally you have...

759
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,400
...in the city of Gosan.

760
01:14:57,667 --> 01:15:01,234
Perhaps it's better to
spend more time with him.

761
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:04,001
Isn't that more important
than your job?

762
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:08,835
Do you know Chairman Yeo Byunggyu?

763
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:11,801
Everyone in Gosan knows
who Mr. Yeo Byunggyu is.

764
01:15:11,868 --> 01:15:14,335
I lived here for two years.
Of course I know who he is.

765
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,500
Not like that.

766
01:15:16,601 --> 01:15:19,668
Do you know him personally?

767
01:15:19,901 --> 01:15:22,835
No. I've never met him personally.

768
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,467
But why do you ask, Dr. Gong?
Is something wrong?

769
01:15:25,534 --> 01:15:27,667
Nothing. See you.

770
01:15:27,801 --> 01:15:28,801
Yes, sir.

771
01:15:33,467 --> 01:15:35,134
- Hello.
- Hello.

772
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,567
Have you talked to Joonyoung?

773
01:15:57,968 --> 01:16:00,235
You seem to have a way with him.
What's your secret?

774
01:16:00,901 --> 01:16:02,201
Because I'm a specialist.

775
01:16:06,334 --> 01:16:07,835
How did you end up...

776
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,001
...counseling my son?

777
01:16:14,267 --> 01:16:15,334
Actually...

778
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,268
I've been keeping a secret for you.

779
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,967
When I was Joonyoung's age,

780
01:16:24,934 --> 01:16:27,268
I was a hell of a troublemaker.

781
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:30,001
I stole things and ran away from home.

782
01:16:30,334 --> 01:16:34,101
But eventually I came to my senses
and went to med school.

783
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:43,335
One day, I saw Joonyoung on the street.

784
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:46,102
I took one look at him and I knew.

785
01:16:49,267 --> 01:16:51,267
"That boy is in anxiety."

786
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:54,568
"I should talk to him."

787
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:57,700
I couldn't let him go.

788
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,634
So you didn't start counseling him...

789
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:08,602
...because he's my son?

790
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:10,233
Not at all.

791
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:28,701
Is this a joke?

792
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:30,034
You got what you were promised.

793
01:17:30,133 --> 01:17:32,500
I said the price went up double.

794
01:17:33,033 --> 01:17:34,300
I made myself clear.

795
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:38,968
We're not equals just
because we did business!

796
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,467
Give me the phone you used to call me.

797
01:17:44,801 --> 01:17:46,834
I am through with you.

798
01:17:46,934 --> 01:17:48,635
You're going to need me.

799
01:17:50,968 --> 01:17:53,968
You haven't achieved half of your goal.

800
01:17:54,033 --> 01:17:56,333
- Don't pull that bullshit on me!
- That woman.

801
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,600
You want to have her.

802
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:01,668
Don't you?

803
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:09,601
You hate her so much
that you want to kill her.

804
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,134
But you don't want to lose her
to some other punk.

805
01:18:13,801 --> 01:18:16,101
Don't you want to tear her down
so she can't go anywhere?

806
01:18:18,734 --> 01:18:21,235
You want to see her beg for her life.

807
01:18:22,067 --> 01:18:23,200
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

808
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:28,734
I bet you want to hear this
as you destroy her.

809
01:18:29,033 --> 01:18:30,467
That you're the only man...

810
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,634
...she ever loved.

811
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:45,568
So...

812
01:18:47,834 --> 01:18:49,768
What do you think of those two?

813
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:05,267
They still have feelings for each other.

814
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:14,201
They're not done with each other yet.

815
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:22,235
(A World of Married Couple)

816
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,567
Yerim disappeared all of a sudden.

817
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:26,034
Someone told me...

818
01:20:26,267 --> 01:20:28,634
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

819
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,634
We agreed to receive donation
from T.O Pictures.

820
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:33,701
100 million won every year
for the next ten years.

821
01:20:33,767 --> 01:20:35,034
I trusted you.

822
01:20:35,601 --> 01:20:38,502
That's why I shared everything with you.

823
01:20:38,601 --> 01:20:40,335
I know this sounds strange,

824
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,067
but there's nothing I can do
for the time being.

825
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:43,734
I have to protect you.

826
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:46,335
The sight of you makes me so angry.

827
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:48,067
I beg you...

828
01:20:49,067 --> 01:20:50,935
Just get out of my sight.
