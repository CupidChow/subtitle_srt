00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,500
(The World of the Married)

2
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:48,101
We had to be perfect.

3
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:53,202
I promised myself over and over again...

4
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:56,501
...to endure through
any hardships or obstacles.

5
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,767
The joys in life.

6
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:06,701
The sadness...

7
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,301
The pains...

8
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:10,669
And happiness.

9
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,301
Because we're supposed to
share all of those...

10
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,500
...as a married couple.

11
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:22,201
Because he and I were meant
to be together forever.

12
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:27,968
No matter what happens,
I must stay strong.

13
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:33,734
But now...

14
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:37,467
What is this woman talking about?

15
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,202
Lee Taeoh...

16
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:44,834
He slept with me.

17
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,534
I told you so.

18
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:54,034
That you could end up
like me one day.

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,134
Are you insane?

20
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:02,667
You think I'll listen to you?

21
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:06,735
You're trying to ruin our family
since you're about to leave.

22
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:10,634
Shall I tell you what color
underwear he wore that day?

23
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,901
I'm not lying.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,734
Believe it or leave it.

25
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,268
That's up to you.

26
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,068
You make me sick.

27
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,534
You're filthy and horrible.

28
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,601
Aren't you embarrassed to see Joonyoung?

29
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,502
It was that night when
Joonyoung slept...

30
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,234
...at the Internet cafe.

31
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,501
What happened?

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,067
What about Joonyoung?

33
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,735
I just sent Joonyoung off.

34
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:40,501
It is what it is.

35
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,968
I'm sorry...

36
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:47,402
...you had to see that.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,701
You guys should go home now.

38
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:53,001
We'll leave when Taeoh comes back.

39
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,034
Yes. How can we leave you alone?

40
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,634
I said I'm fine.

41
00:03:58,234 --> 00:03:59,334
It's late.

42
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:00,302
You should go now.

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,500
Hey.

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,367
You look really pale.

45
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,235
Did she...

46
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:08,669
...say something strange?

47
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:11,401
You know how she is. She's always weird.

48
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:13,834
I don't care.

49
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,035
I'll just ignore her.

50
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:18,668
What did that woman say?

51
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:20,268
It wasn't a big deal.

52
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,168
I just want some rest.

53
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,568
Please just go.

54
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:30,868
Okay?

55
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,467
(Episode 15)

56
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,500
I'm hungry.

57
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,402
Should we eat something?

58
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:24,235
Get a grip.

59
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:28,367
Why do you make it difficult for everyone?

60
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,400
How much more do we have to suffer?

61
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:39,469
You scumbag.

62
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:33,202
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,500
Where's Joonyoung?

64
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,167
Joonyoung...

65
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,634
Where is he?

66
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,034
What happened to him?

67
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,333
Did you sleep with her?

68
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,434
Ji Sunwoo...

69
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,734
Did you sleep with her?

70
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,434
Think before you answer.

71
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,867
Unless you want to repeat
the same mistake.

72
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,301
It all depends...

73
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,168
...on your answer.

74
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,868
Will you tell me the truth?

75
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:59,601
Or lie?

76
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:04,901
If you tell the truth, I will resent
you for the rest of my life.

77
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,200
But if you lie...

78
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:11,701
I will never forgive you for that.

79
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,867
But I'll never forgive you if you lie.

80
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,168
That would be real betrayal.

81
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,567
So be honest with me.

82
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,868
Are you...

83
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:22,701
...having an affair?

84
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,567
Go ahead and pick your poison.

85
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,133
I heard it was the night when
Joonyoung didn't come home.

86
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:37,868
I was taking care of Jenny by myself
because she got sick that night.

87
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:41,534
And you lied that you were with Jehyuk!

88
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,434
I called you many times
because our baby was sick.

89
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,534
And you were busy banging her?

90
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:55,068
- Did Sunwoo say that?
- Answer me.

91
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:58,567
Did you sleep with her?

92
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,534
Did you?

93
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,001
Yes...

94
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,669
What's with you two?

95
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:43,802
It was just...

96
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,402
...an accident.

97
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:52,068
It was a one-time mistake
that didn't mean anything.

98
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,534
It was empty and meaningless.

99
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:58,934
I don't want to think
about it ever again.

100
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,368
But now...

101
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:05,901
She won't be around anymore.
She will leave soon.

102
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:07,834
She already submitted her resignation.

103
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,201
Don't mind her, Dakyung.

104
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,168
Who cares where she is?

105
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:14,202
I can't trust you anymore!

106
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:18,801
When she said...

107
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:22,501
...you were stalking her,
I still trusted you.

108
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,734
When I saw all those photos
of that woman on your phone,

109
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,234
I still trusted you.

110
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:30,801
Even that time when she
faked your alibi...

111
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:35,101
"She was trying to save her son's dad."

112
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:38,535
"It was probably for Joonyoung's sake."

113
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,968
That's what I thought.

114
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,768
But now I know.

115
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:48,001
You two still have
feelings for each other.

116
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,001
Both you...

117
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:51,734
...and that woman.

118
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,600
She just wants to ruin my life.

119
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:07,167
Why else would she tell you that
without batting an eye?

120
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:09,334
She's trying to turn
us against each other!

121
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:11,968
Don't let her get to you.

122
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,868
You're the one I want to be with.

123
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,934
I wanted us to be happy.

124
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:21,235
That's why I tried to get rid of her,
and it worked!

125
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:24,434
Is that why you slept with her?

126
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,368
To get rid of her?

127
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:31,035
Do you expect me to believe that?

128
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,001
We loved...

129
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:14,734
We got married...

130
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:17,335
...and raised you together.

131
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,934
The person...

132
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:23,268
whom I spent most of my life with...

133
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,601
...is your dad.

134
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,635
Although we put each other through hell...

135
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:34,967
...and had to split up because
we couldn't be together,

136
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:39,202
but hatred wasn't the only
feeling that lingered.

137
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,768
Just like how you missed him,

138
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,167
I had a moment of weakness...

139
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,433
...that made me miss my husband.

140
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:06,435
I know you feel confused and betrayed.

141
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:09,968
I'm so sorry.

142
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:17,801
You can hate me forever.

143
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:22,567
But I will always support
and protect you.

144
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:28,300
All I want for you...

145
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:33,601
...is that you love yourself.

146
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,800
You're not like your mom and dad.

147
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,068
You can have a different life.

148
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:42,101
That's all you need to remember.

149
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:43,968
Okay?

150
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:48,168
I'm sure it's all over the school...

151
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,634
...that I'm a thief.

152
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,235
It's going to be difficult,

153
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:58,268
but you will overcome this.

154
00:15:58,367 --> 00:15:59,667
You have me.

155
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,133
I will be on your side.

156
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,801
Let's overcome it together, okay?

157
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,501
Can't we just leave?

158
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,334
To a place where no one will know?

159
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:21,302
Will you be okay...

160
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,100
...if you never see your dad again?

161
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,068
Yes.

162
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't want to see him ever again.

163
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,201
All right.

164
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:49,634
We'll go wherever we want.

165
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,367
I just need a few days
to straighten everything out.

166
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,033
Okay?

167
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,867
Thank you for being honest with me.

168
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,034
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

169
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,601
Does Joonyoung know what happened...

170
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,234
...between you two?

171
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,300
Poor kid.

172
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:04,834
I will never...

173
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:08,301
...let Jenny end up like Joonyoung.

174
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,868
I'm not like that woman.

175
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:16,434
I don't want to lose my mind
and resort to insanity.

176
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,268
I can get through this.

177
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:22,535
For Jenny's sake...

178
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:24,468
I will overcome this.

179
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,168
I will get through this...

180
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,001
...with you.

181
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:35,267
Dakyung...

182
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:42,435
Just give me some time.

183
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,268
I need it.

184
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:48,501
All right.

185
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:51,102
You can...

186
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,801
...take all the time you need.

187
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,067
I'll be waiting.

188
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:01,502
And I promise to do my best.

189
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:08,768
Sit down and eat.

190
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:26,735
Thank you.

191
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:40,701
The soup is delicious.

192
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:42,900
Good.

193
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:46,068
Enjoy your meal.

194
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,368
I'll go check on Jenny.

195
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:05,468
Okay.

196
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:22,367
Up you go.

197
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:31,001
Hey Jenny.

198
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,202
Daddy's going to work.

199
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:41,901
Have a nice day.

200
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,134
Okay.

201
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:45,901
I don't want to see him again.

202
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,201
Go to your room.

203
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:13,734
Where's Joonyoung?

204
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,102
If you have something to say, say it.

205
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:17,601
I'll pass it on to Joonyoung.

206
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:20,268
I came to apologize.
I will tell him myself.

207
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,368
He doesn't want to see you.

208
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:25,701
Joonyoung.

209
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,467
Joonyoung!

210
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:30,368
What are you doing?
He doesn't want to see you.

211
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:32,001
Joonyoung!

212
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,167
Leave now!

213
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:34,835
He doesn't want to see
you or talk to you!

214
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,368
He's scared right now.

215
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,534
I'm sorry.

216
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,235
I'm sorry that I hit you.

217
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,402
I want to apologize.

218
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,567
Talk to me, please?

219
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:53,368
It's not because I hate you.

220
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:55,834
- I lost my temper for a second...
- Leave.

221
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,268
We should clear the air between us.

222
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:03,434
Right?

223
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:05,667
If you don't leave now,
I'll call the police.

224
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:27,700
Stop harassing us and leave.

225
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,567
It's over.

226
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,035
Get out!

227
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,568
Was this your plan all along?

228
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:00,602
What?

229
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,734
- What are you talking about?
- Why did you tell Dakyung?

230
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,268
You said we should forget
about what happened.

231
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,501
Are you still hung up on me?

232
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,068
This is what you wanted.

233
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,001
I gave in and backed off.

234
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:18,601
I told you to look after him
so he doesn't get hurt again.

235
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,502
You said you'll raise him properly...

236
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:23,034
...and make him happy.

237
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,168
Yet you laid your hand on him
in front of that family?

238
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:29,168
So?

239
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:31,901
Were you trying to screw me over?

240
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:34,468
Do you want to take this to the end?

241
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:35,201
Why?

242
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:39,201
Are you afraid of getting dumped?

243
00:25:42,234 --> 00:25:44,801
Dakyung is a way better woman than you.

244
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:47,634
She said she'll forgive me.

245
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:49,102
How do you like that?

246
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:50,467
Disappointing, isn't it?

247
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:53,535
Will she really...

248
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:56,834
...find forgiveness in her heart?

249
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,100
Do you really think...

250
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:04,335
...she's different from me?

251
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,901
Don't kid yourself into thinking
that Joonyoung likes you.

252
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:12,767
He's just angry at me, that's all.

253
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:15,835
I won't give up Joonyoung.

254
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:26,601
This is your last warning.

255
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:30,335
Let Joonyoung go.

256
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:33,168
Or I will retaliate.

257
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:36,033
I will end you for good!

258
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:38,068
I will tear you down.

259
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:42,569
You're the one who's completely ruined.

260
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:46,235
You made a fool out of yourself
trying to screw me over!

261
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,067
Don't you still get it?

262
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:51,467
What's next? What are you going to do?

263
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:56,901
I can't let Joonyoung live
with a lunatic like you.

264
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,769
I will take him home with me
as soon as possible.

265
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,268
Keep that in mind.

266
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:36,534
What if he comes again?

267
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:39,669
What if he tries to take me again?

268
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:42,101
Don't worry.

269
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:44,168
He will never bother you again.

270
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:47,801
I told you that I'll protect you.

271
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:36,901
What is it?

272
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,435
Tell Chairman Yeo...

273
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,268
...that I wish to meet him.

274
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,267
How long are you going
to have me followed?

275
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:50,435
Or...

276
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,901
Are you keeping an eye on Taeoh?

277
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,034
I'll do anything for my
daughter's happiness.

278
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:59,135
I told you before.

279
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,635
You're finally acknowledging...

280
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
... that your daughter is unhappy.

281
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:09,435
What did you say to my
daughter last night?

282
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:10,801
The real question is...

283
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,134
What happened...

284
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,268
...between me and Taeoh.

285
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,133
I always knew that you didn't trust Taeoh.

286
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:25,335
So I'm sure...

287
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:27,835
...you have a pretty good idea.

288
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:33,935
Your daughter...

289
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,867
What was her dream?

290
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:47,202
My daughter...

291
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:53,168
She loved to travel since she was little.

292
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:55,501
So I took her to places.

293
00:29:56,934 --> 00:30:00,101
She loved going to art museums
in particular.

294
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,234
Come to think of it,

295
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:06,868
things were great back then.

296
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:12,001
She said, once she enriches her
experience and learn more about art,

297
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:14,068
she will...

298
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,268
...run art gallery someday.

299
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:19,434
Can you...

300
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,835
...give her all the support she needs...

301
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,268
...if she wanted to?

302
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,101
Of course.

303
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:30,868
She could've lived freely
using her skills to the fullest.

304
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:37,300
But unfortunately Lee Taeoh
dragged her down.

305
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:43,401
You love your daughter so much.

306
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,401
Don't you think it's a pity...

307
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,601
...that she's wasting her sweet youth...

308
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,801
...over a man?

309
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:56,534
She's so insecure about
being the second wife.

310
00:30:57,601 --> 00:30:59,068
From one woman to another,

311
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:01,634
I pity her.

312
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:07,801
That's why...

313
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,400
...I took the liberty of coming here.

314
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:13,268
Because you're the kind of man
who would...

315
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,967
...do anything for your daughter.

316
00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:52,001
Dakyung.

317
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:53,701
It's me.

318
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:55,200
Are you okay?

319
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:56,134
Yes.

320
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:58,734
I'm fine.

321
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,100
Everything's fine.

322
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,668
Why did you call me?

323
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,734
It's about Ji Sunwoo.

324
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:08,602
I think she left for good.

325
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:10,301
I was looking into some real estate...

326
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,400
...and found her house up for sale.

327
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:15,167
Since she packed up
and left with the boy,

328
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,901
you don't have to worry
about her anymore.

329
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,734
Are we doing the right thing?

330
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:49,035
Are you going somewhere?

331
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:04,168
You give these back to the kids.

332
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:13,602
Tell them I'm...

333
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,334
...really sorry.

334
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:21,034
I wanted to say sorry to you as well.

335
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:27,836
I'm sorry...

336
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:29,534
...to trouble you like this.

337
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:31,967
Joonyoung.

338
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,335
I acted like that because I like you.

339
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,367
I was worried.

340
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:43,101
I just wanted you to stop.

341
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,668
I wasn't trying to be stuck-up.

342
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,467
So...

343
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,734
If I have offended you...

344
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:55,867
...then I'm sorry too.

345
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,467
Thanks.

346
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:34,468
Shall we?

347
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:36,569
Yeah.

348
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:31,734
It's so quiet.

349
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,801
- Hello.
- Welcome back, sir.

350
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:37,835
Many of Dr. Ji's patients stopped coming.

351
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:39,335
It is a little quiet around here.

352
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:42,802
Have you heard from Dr. Ji?

353
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:44,768
No.

354
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:48,901
According to Dr. Seol, she's left town.

355
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,868
Left town?

356
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:51,301
For good?

357
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,234
(To Taeoh)

358
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:54,001
What's going on between you two?

359
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:56,501
Sunwoo took Joonyoung and left.

360
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:57,668
Is that true?

361
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:01,701
Sunwoo took Joonyoung and left.
Is that true?

362
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:08,368
I'm sure you thought it through
before you made your decision.

363
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,134
I just...

364
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:16,367
...want you to be happy, Dr. Ji.

365
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:19,868
I just wanted to tell you that.

366
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,800
Your message has been deleted.

367
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's a solidly-built house.

368
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:49,668
In good condition too.

369
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:50,968
Come on in.

370
00:36:53,901 --> 00:36:56,468
The owner had to leave
all of a sudden,

371
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:59,967
so the furniture hasn't
been removed yet.

372
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,034
Feel free to look around.

373
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:04,368
Thank you.

374
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:31,701
Are you the realtor?

375
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:33,535
Did someone come to look at the house?

376
00:38:33,634 --> 00:38:37,001
Yes. She's touring the second floor.

377
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,367
When do you think my house will be sold?

378
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:42,501
I'm not sure.

379
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,568
Business is so bad these days.

380
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:47,401
But I can't just slash the price.

381
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:48,368
I'm worried.

382
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:51,068
I'm sure your house will
find a new owner soon.

383
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:54,601
A house will always meet
its owner in the end.

384
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:58,266
Dakyung?

385
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,001
What brings you here?

386
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:06,934
Do you know each other?

387
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:11,233
We need to catch up.
You can go now.

388
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:12,301
Sure.

389
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:18,468
Please give me a call
after you think it over.

390
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:28,467
Sunwoo left the key to me
so I can clear out her stuffs.

391
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:31,134
I didn't expect to see you here.

392
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:35,768
I just wanted to make sure that she left.

393
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,134
I know that's not the only thing...

394
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:40,602
...you wanted to make sure.

395
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:44,801
You wanted to make sure that
two are done with each other...

396
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,402
...because you're anxious.

397
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:50,300
I can understand.

398
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:52,268
I would be anxious too.

399
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:56,267
I'll leave you alone now.

400
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:58,901
Lee Taeoh...

401
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,300
He won't forget Sunwoo that easily.

402
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:07,801
Sunwoo knows that too.

403
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:09,869
That's why she left in a hurry.

404
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:13,401
What makes you think so?

405
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:17,535
Or did that woman ask you to tell me that?

406
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:22,867
She did.

407
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:26,268
I expected as much.

408
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:29,168
Jehyuk said...

409
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:30,935
Men...

410
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,434
Even if they have someone,

411
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:35,868
they can't help but
think about their exes.

412
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:38,135
He thinks that's how Taeoh feels.

413
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:42,434
Sunwoo went off the grid for a while.
You know that, right?

414
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,767
Taeoh came by back then.

415
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,935
He asked me to check
if she's doing okay.

416
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:52,235
I can't forget that look in his eyes.

417
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:56,168
Why do you think he did that?

418
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,734
Living in suspicion of your
husband is like hell.

419
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:07,034
I know that better than anyone.

420
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,168
That's why I wanted to tell you...

421
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:12,768
...from one woman to another.

422
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:15,201
And as someone who's been where you are.

423
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:23,702
If you don't believe me,
we can go to my house.

424
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:25,701
I'll show you the security footage.

425
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Sunwoo even passed me
the security ID and password.

426
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:34,469
You'll see how often Taeoh came by...

427
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:37,935
...and how he prowled around
her house when it's empty.

428
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:39,433
It should be caught on camera.

429
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:01,268
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

430
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:55,968
Let's think of this as a short trip.

431
00:42:57,634 --> 00:43:01,734
Let's clear our heads
and relax for a while.

432
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:04,935
I feel strange.

433
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:11,068
You're unfamiliar with this place.

434
00:43:11,234 --> 00:43:12,935
You'll get used to it slowly.

435
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:14,968
Don't you worry about a thing.

436
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,300
Think happy thoughts from now on.

437
00:43:17,434 --> 00:43:19,868
Just think about where you want
to go and what you want to do.

438
00:43:19,968 --> 00:43:21,669
I'll do anything you ask.

439
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,801
We can go back if that's what you want.

440
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,268
I'm almost done with the urgent ones.

441
00:43:51,534 --> 00:43:53,001
Should we go on a trip somewhere?

442
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:55,369
Where?

443
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,267
You need to take it easy.

444
00:43:58,434 --> 00:44:00,601
Let's go somewhere warm
so we can relax.

445
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:02,668
Bali or Hawaii?

446
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:04,367
How about Hawaii?

447
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,167
All right.

448
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:08,801
Any date is fine for me.

449
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:11,368
You can choose a date
that meets your schedule.

450
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:12,701
All right.

451
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:05,534
Sorry.

452
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:08,967
Can I...

453
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:12,500
...stay over tonight?

454
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,934
Maybe some other time.

455
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:28,801
I'm sorry.

456
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,734
I went overboard.

457
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,467
I ruined the mood.

458
00:45:40,734 --> 00:45:42,368
Are you upset?

459
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:43,934
I'm home.

460
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,634
Hey.

461
00:46:49,567 --> 00:46:50,567
Where's Jenny?

462
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,434
She's asleep.

463
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,634
Is everything okay?

464
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:04,534
I'm fine.

465
00:47:06,434 --> 00:47:09,734
I'm going to cook ramyeon.
Do you want some too?

466
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,400
No, I'm fine.

467
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:13,101
Okay then.

468
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:17,435
Thank you.

469
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:54,035
Are you sure you don't care
about where we're going?

470
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,567
School is the same everywhere.

471
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:01,868
Your hospital is more important.

472
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:06,868
Should I look for something in Seoul?

473
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:10,634
In case when you go to college.

474
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:13,669
You should start seeing someone.

475
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:18,135
Find a nice boyfriend.

476
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:20,234
I'm okay with it.

477
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:27,834
Why did you hate Dr. Kim Yoonki?

478
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,368
You're way out of his league.

479
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,035
What?

480
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:32,333
Really.

481
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:34,035
You deserve so much better than him.

482
00:49:46,634 --> 00:49:47,901
How's Joonyoung?

483
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,067
(From Kim Yoonki)

484
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:50,600
How are you doing?

485
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:05,968
(Ji Sunwoo)

486
00:50:10,734 --> 00:50:11,801
Yes, hello?

487
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,267
I'm sorry.

488
00:50:14,868 --> 00:50:16,901
I left without saying goodbye.

489
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:21,268
I know I shouldn't be like this,

490
00:50:21,334 --> 00:50:23,001
but I can't stop worrying about you.

491
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:25,734
Are you doing okay?

492
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:29,368
We're trying to figure out our next move.

493
00:50:31,734 --> 00:50:33,301
He's calmed down a lot.

494
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:36,501
It's been ages since he laughed.

495
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:42,302
The kids said they understand
and you don't have to be sorry.

496
00:50:43,267 --> 00:50:44,901
Do you have to switch schools?

497
00:50:48,634 --> 00:50:50,535
I want to know how you're doing.

498
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:54,568
Are you okay?

499
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:01,534
The air is so nice here.

500
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:04,335
I can see the stars clearly.

501
00:51:08,634 --> 00:51:10,001
Maybe that's why...

502
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,834
...I can see everything clearly now.

503
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:19,001
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

504
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:21,801
I will never forget your kindness.

505
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:23,768
Sunwoo...

506
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:28,202
When you decide where you will go...

507
00:51:29,968 --> 00:51:31,068
...will you let me know?

508
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:20,567
(Yeo Dakyung)

509
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:50,834
What is it?

510
00:53:42,968 --> 00:53:44,635
I'll convince Taeoh...

511
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:48,534
...to sign away his parental rights.

512
00:53:50,234 --> 00:53:51,801
In return...

513
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:53,868
...don't expect him to pay child support.

514
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,268
I never said anything about child support.

515
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:02,467
There's no guarantee that
you won't show up again.

516
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,667
I don't want the two of you
using Joonyoung as an excuse...

517
00:54:09,868 --> 00:54:11,769
...to see each other again.

518
00:54:15,868 --> 00:54:19,001
You know very well that
Joonyoung was just an excuse.

519
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:21,735
That's why you came all
the way here to see me.

520
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,468
He said it was a mistake.

521
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,101
And I believe him.

522
00:54:34,968 --> 00:54:36,535
If you don't want to be humiliated,

523
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:39,168
promise me that you will never
appear before us again!

524
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,367
If you don't,

525
00:54:42,934 --> 00:54:45,701
I will file an adultery
lawsuit against you.

526
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:48,968
You don't think I can do it? Try me!

527
00:54:57,334 --> 00:54:59,935
What is it that you're trying to protect?

528
00:55:01,534 --> 00:55:02,502
Lee Taeoh?

529
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:05,434
Your family? Or...

530
00:55:06,033 --> 00:55:07,200
Your pride?

531
00:55:09,501 --> 00:55:11,135
If I promise you that,

532
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:15,235
will your anxiety go away?

533
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:17,601
That's none of your business.

534
00:55:18,534 --> 00:55:21,402
Right. Whatever decision you make...

535
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:25,701
...is none of my business.

536
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:31,935
But there's something you need to know.

537
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,368
What are you doing?

538
00:55:39,801 --> 00:55:41,068
I'm going to show you...

539
00:55:43,334 --> 00:55:44,734
...Lee Taeoh's true nature.

540
00:55:55,033 --> 00:55:56,934
It's a song that I used to like.

541
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:00,001
That's how Taeoh came to like this song.

542
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,867
It was more than just a song.
It had a special meaning to us.

543
00:56:07,234 --> 00:56:08,935
When he proposed to me...

544
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,201
...he turned on this song.

545
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,101
"Marry me, Sunwoo."

546
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,668
"I'll do my best"...

547
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,701
..."to make you and our baby happy."

548
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,201
"I'm not doing this because
I feel responsible for the baby."

549
00:56:31,701 --> 00:56:33,734
"It's because I love you, Ji Sunwoo."

550
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:39,501
"Whatever life may bring,
I want to be there for you."

551
00:56:39,601 --> 00:56:41,135
"Let's live together."

552
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:50,400
Is that what he said to you?

553
00:56:53,901 --> 00:56:56,402
Did he whisper into your ear...

554
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,300
...that you are his one and only love?

555
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:04,801
Don't lie to me.

556
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:11,168
You don't have anything to prove that.

557
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:19,768
Come with me.

558
00:57:20,267 --> 00:57:22,667
I will prove that it's not a lie.

559
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:24,867
Where are we going?

560
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:30,402
My house.

561
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,401
What's this got to do with anything?

562
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:13,168
I was really surprised when I
noticed this for the first time.

563
00:58:15,133 --> 00:58:16,233
Can't you see?

564
00:58:17,334 --> 00:58:18,467
Take a good look.

565
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,534
When I went to your place,
I saw it in your bedroom.

566
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:27,601
Our taste in perfume...

567
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,167
Our taste in underwear...

568
00:58:33,234 --> 00:58:35,168
Even our taste in wedding dresses.

569
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:39,168
You and I are so much alike
that it made my skin crawl.

570
00:58:40,534 --> 00:58:42,135
Did Taeoh get them for you?

571
00:58:43,701 --> 00:58:44,502
Or...

572
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:47,001
...did you pick them yourself?

573
00:58:51,734 --> 00:58:55,068
You bought the same ones
after seeing them in my room.

574
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:56,334
You're unbelievable.

575
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,935
How low can you get?
Don't you think it's childish?

576
00:59:26,968 --> 00:59:29,669
I don't have the absolute proof
you're looking for.

577
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:35,434
But,

578
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:38,235
I don't lie.

579
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:45,567
I don't know if Taeoh is aware of it,

580
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:48,268
but...

581
00:59:50,734 --> 00:59:52,435
...you and I are two of a kind.

582
00:59:54,367 --> 00:59:55,734
What do you think?

583
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,667
It's a common fashion style.

584
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:11,101
Your lies are not going to work.

585
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:12,934
You're meticulous and
detail-oriented, right?

586
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:15,634
And you always stick to a plan.

587
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:18,001
To you,

588
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:21,202
a free spirit like Taeoh
must've looked so charming.

589
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:24,901
And Taeoh probably fell for you...

590
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,834
...because you admire him
and you would do anything for him.

591
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:32,201
He's instinctively drawn to
women like you and me.

592
01:00:38,734 --> 01:00:42,568
Are you trying to tell me
that he's still hung up on you?

593
01:00:44,834 --> 01:00:47,934
I don't know why I'm
listening to your delusions.

594
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:51,368
What if he meets another woman like us?

595
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,333
You're right.

596
01:00:56,234 --> 01:00:57,835
It is a common style, just like you said.

597
01:01:00,234 --> 01:01:03,367
The world is full of
women like you and me.

598
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:08,734
Unfortunately, Lee Taeoh is a free spirit.

599
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,400
He's drawn to women
who take good care of him,

600
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:17,635
but when he starts to feel suffocated,

601
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:20,100
he'll look for a hole to breathe.

602
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,667
Just like he fell for you...

603
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:25,201
...when he was with me.

604
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:31,368
When Jenny...

605
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:36,101
...reaches Joonyoung's age,

606
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,200
are you sure the same thing
won't happen to you?

607
01:02:33,634 --> 01:02:35,468
That's how vain it is.

608
01:02:36,934 --> 01:02:39,934
You thought your love is so grand,
but it's nothing.

609
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:46,067
What is a married couple?

610
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:50,334
You get married...

611
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,534
...because you delude yourself
into thinking that it's meant to be.

612
01:02:55,534 --> 01:02:57,468
Is it really worth risking
everything you have...

613
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:02,533
...just because you've been
sleeping together in the same bed?

614
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,769
You know you'll be unhappy.

615
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:16,435
I'm still not sure what it is.

616
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:22,535
But one thing's for sure.

617
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:28,068
You can't raise a child with
a man who will hurt you eventually.

618
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:31,501
Think carefully.

619
01:03:32,868 --> 01:03:34,868
This could be your last chance...

620
01:03:36,234 --> 01:03:37,668
...to get away from it.

01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:55,602
The investor whom I'm meeting today
said he enjoyed reading the scenario.

625
01:05:56,133 --> 01:05:57,433
I'm getting a good feeling about this.

626
01:05:59,567 --> 01:06:00,734
That's great.

627
01:06:01,467 --> 01:06:03,268
I'll call you when I get the investment.

628
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,734
We should party.

629

632

Thank you.

We should have dinner some time

636
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,467
Sounds good. Please let me know.

637
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:05,702
Thank you.

- Is there a problem?
- The payment keeps declining.

640
01:07:19,267 --> 01:07:21,168
Do you have another card?

Thank you.

Hey, Councilor Cha.

644
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,667
I'm sorry about last time.

645
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:38,801
What brings you here?

646
01:07:38,901 --> 01:07:42,235
I just met an investor.

01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,335
How's the sponsorship offer
from Chairman Yeo going?

648
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,567
He already broke his promise.

649

You didn't know?

650
01:07:55,334 --> 01:07:58,168
Why? Did something happen?

651
01:07:58,267 --> 01:07:59,968
I'm sure you know more than I do.

652

Sir?

653
01:08:02,467 --> 01:08:04,034
- Sir?
-Yes?

654
01:08:04,133 --> 01:08:06,067
This card is also declining.

655
01:08:07,801 --> 01:08:09,168

Why are the company credit cards blocked?

661
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,301

and throw you out...

...by the chairman.

663

What?

How dare you talk to me that way!

01:09:24,267 --> 01:09:26,934
If you want to see your
daughter one last time,

671
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:29,134
get a grip and go home.

672
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:36,168
(Wife)

673
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:43,934
Your call cannot be reached...

674
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:45,701
Honey. Dakyung.

675
01:09:47,334 --> 01:09:49,135
Why won't you answer my calls?

676
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,667
Is something wrong?

677
01:09:53,767 --> 01:09:56,401
I think your father is
very upset with me.

678
01:09:58,901 --> 01:09:59,835
Never mind.

679
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,467
I'll talk to you when I get home.

680
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:05,068
Call me when you get my message.

681
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,233
Who are you people?

682
01:10:31,501 --> 01:10:32,768
What are you doing?

683
01:10:33,834 --> 01:10:35,735
I have arranged all the documents.

684
01:10:41,234 --> 01:10:42,568
Take your shit and beat it.

685
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:44,967
I don't want to talk to you any more.

686
01:10:45,934 --> 01:10:47,902
Take this car to the destination.

687
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,667
Yes, sir.

688
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,233
The car?

689
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,400
What documents are you talking about?

690
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:55,469
For divorce!

691
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,767
Giving up your parental right
as Jenny's father!

692
01:10:58,934 --> 01:11:00,802
And the company I gave you.

693
01:11:01,334 --> 01:11:02,401
It's all over.

694
01:11:02,834 --> 01:11:04,335
Are you still not following?

695
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,001
Father, why are you doing this?

696
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,734
- You seem to have misunderstood...
- Don't call me father!

697
01:11:10,834 --> 01:11:12,268
- Father...
- Bastard!

698
01:11:15,801 --> 01:11:17,834
I only wanted one thing from you.

699
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:19,668
To make...

700
01:11:20,601 --> 01:11:22,801
To make my daughter happy.

701
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:25,567
If only you had done that,

702
01:11:26,501 --> 01:11:27,901
I would've treated you better.

703
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,667
Not just as my son-in-law,

704
01:11:29,801 --> 01:11:30,834
but like my own son...

705
01:11:31,534 --> 01:11:32,701
...or a friend.

706
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:35,967
When my precious daughter
introduced you...

707
01:11:36,934 --> 01:11:38,802
...I actually thought
we could be like that.

708
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:42,302
But unfortunately,

709
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:46,268
you were nothing but a failure,
just as I expected.

710
01:11:49,367 --> 01:11:50,601
Let's end this.

711
01:11:51,534 --> 01:11:52,968
Don't ever...

712
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:55,301
...show your face to us again.

713
01:11:57,467 --> 01:11:58,801
I'll talk it out with Dakyung.

714
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:00,735
Where is Dakyung? Where is she?

715
01:12:12,701 --> 01:12:13,535
Jenny.

716
01:12:23,901 --> 01:12:24,735
Honey.

717
01:12:25,534 --> 01:12:26,634
Dakyung...

718
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,901
Just ignore him and get in the car.

719
01:12:31,467 --> 01:12:32,901
I'll handle this.

720
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:35,635
Wait for me in the car.

721
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:40,368
You said you'd forgive me.

722
01:12:41,367 --> 01:12:44,534
You said we'll work on it.
Why are you doing this?

723
01:12:44,634 --> 01:12:46,868
That's when you made one mistake.

724
01:12:48,701 --> 01:12:51,302
But you know that's not the case.

725
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:53,968
I won't fall for your lies again.

726
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:55,701
We're done.

727
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,234
You don't have to listen to your father.

728
01:13:00,634 --> 01:13:02,368
This is between us.

729
01:13:02,434 --> 01:13:04,168
Dad knew everything!

730
01:13:05,434 --> 01:13:08,335
He took every possible precaution
because he was worried about me.

731
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:12,968
I pity Jenny for having a father like you,

732
01:13:14,234 --> 01:13:15,901
but she's better off without you.

733
01:13:16,901 --> 01:13:18,468
Don't you ever think
about seeing her again.

734
01:13:21,767 --> 01:13:23,134
You are all I have.

735
01:13:27,133 --> 01:13:28,600
I love you.

736
01:13:28,934 --> 01:13:29,967
Please...

737
01:13:30,567 --> 01:13:32,801
The song you used
when you proposed to me...

738
01:13:36,267 --> 01:13:38,267
You used it when you proposed to her.

739
01:13:39,934 --> 01:13:42,134
You bought me the same
perfume that she used.

740
01:13:42,234 --> 01:13:44,234
The underwear and wedding dress too.

741
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:50,001
What am I to you?

742
01:13:54,567 --> 01:13:55,934
What was I?

743
01:13:57,067 --> 01:13:58,634
What are you talking about?

744
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:01,168
It turns out that she wasn't
the one in delusion.

745
01:14:04,367 --> 01:14:05,400
It was me.

746
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:10,233
I know everything now.

747
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:12,467
To you, I was...

748
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,734
...nothing more than
a substitute for Ji Sunwoo.

749
01:14:22,534 --> 01:14:24,001
Go to that woman.

750
01:14:37,567 --> 01:14:38,301
Dakyung.

751
01:14:38,734 --> 01:14:39,568
Hold on a second.

752
01:14:39,734 --> 01:14:41,801
Jenny! Jenny!

753
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,400
Dakyung, please let me talk to Jenny...

754
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:47,668
Dakyung! Let me talk to Jenny...

755
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,168
Get out!

756
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:44,001
Get out of the car!

757
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,134
It's all your fault.

758
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:52,368
I lost everything because of you!

759
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:54,235
You planned this from the beginning.

760
01:16:54,334 --> 01:16:56,235
To ruin me!

761
01:16:59,634 --> 01:17:01,934
What the hell did you say to Dakyung...

762
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:03,267
You bitch!

763
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,334
My house...

764
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:28,901
Money...

765
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:32,568
And my family...

766
01:17:38,133 --> 01:17:40,101
I lost everything.

767
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,834
(Son)

768
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:29,768
Mom?

769
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:32,901
I took care of it.

770
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,533
I'll be there soon. Wait for me.

771
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:41,200
What about Dad?

772
01:18:43,033 --> 01:18:44,734
Did you work things out with him?

773
01:20:34,267 --> 01:20:36,667
Use this to rent a motel
room or something.

774
01:20:37,267 --> 01:20:39,634
And start thinking about
what you're going to do.

775
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:42,302
Let me know if you come up
with a plan.

776
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:46,233
I'll give you some money
to rent a studio.

777
01:20:50,501 --> 01:20:51,634
You're the devil.

778
01:20:55,968 --> 01:20:58,168
I shouldn't have met you.

779
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,968
My life's ruined because of you.

780
01:21:02,868 --> 01:21:04,769
Why didn't you just kill me instead?

781
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:08,267
It would've been easy for the both of us.

782
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:10,468
Get a grip.

783
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,267
Before you start blaming others,

784
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:16,567
think about all the things you've done.

785
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:18,934
You ruined your own life.

786
01:21:19,567 --> 01:21:21,034
Get it through your thick head!

787
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,700
Joonyoung knows everything.

788
01:21:25,534 --> 01:21:26,435
What?

789
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:28,834
The reason I hit you.

790
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,234
Joonyoung knows everything.

791
01:21:33,901 --> 01:21:35,802
Joonyoung hates you. No...

792
01:21:36,133 --> 01:21:37,166
He loathes you.

793
01:21:38,567 --> 01:21:41,201
He knows what an awful person you are.

794
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,601
He will never have a happy life
as long as he's with you.

795
01:21:52,167 --> 01:21:54,434
Joonyoung won't abandon me
just like you did!

796
01:21:56,267 --> 01:21:57,434
I will tell him...

797
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,700
...about what you did to me today.

798
01:22:01,634 --> 01:22:06,068
Joonyoung should know how you
destroyed his father's life!

799
01:24:11,634 --> 01:24:14,335
Madam, have you been receiving
one-on-one lessons?

800
01:24:14,434 --> 01:24:18,701
- What are you talking about?
- Your tee shot was so smooth.

801
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:19,800
Goodness.

802
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,200
It's so nice to be outdoors.

803
01:24:24,501 --> 01:24:26,435
Word is that the building
site of the movie set...

804
01:24:26,534 --> 01:24:28,468
...is up for sale at a cheap price

805
01:24:28,534 --> 01:24:32,035
Is Chairman Yeo's family
never planning on coming back?

806
01:24:34,267 --> 01:24:36,801
My husband thinks so too.

807
01:24:37,434 --> 01:24:40,834
Apparently, Dr. Ji Sunwoo... is back.

808
01:24:41,033 --> 01:24:43,734
Lee Taeoh was divorced
and chased out....

809
01:24:43,868 --> 01:24:46,202
...while Chairman Yeo's family left
Gosan all of a sudden.

810
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,967
And Ji Sunwoo didn't
hesitate to come back.

811
01:24:49,033 --> 01:24:50,934
Don't you think...

812
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:53,468
...there is a story behind all that?

813
01:24:53,567 --> 01:24:57,967
I heard Dr. Ji is responsible
for their divorce.

814
01:24:58,334 --> 01:25:00,668
Every married couple has a secret.

815
01:25:00,734 --> 01:25:04,468
Don't gossip about their family issues
or you might get in trouble.

816
01:25:04,534 --> 01:25:05,634
Be careful.

817
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:07,601
By the way...

818
01:25:07,934 --> 01:25:10,701
What's Dr. Gong going to do?

819
01:25:10,767 --> 01:25:12,967
The chairperson is quite adamant about it.

820
01:25:13,434 --> 01:25:15,834
And since it's hard to find
a doctor like her...

821
01:25:15,868 --> 01:25:18,035
I think he'll hire her again.

822
01:25:18,701 --> 01:25:20,335
Good idea.

823
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:28,569
(Employee Parking Only)

824
01:25:44,934 --> 01:25:46,768
Hello.

825
01:25:54,767 --> 01:25:56,268
Dr. Ji.

826
01:25:56,968 --> 01:25:58,902
- Dr. Ji!
- Hello!

827
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,100
How have you been?

828
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,400
Good.

829
01:26:01,601 --> 01:26:03,835
- How have you been?
- It's been a long time.

830
01:26:03,934 --> 01:26:05,101
Tell me about it.

831
01:26:05,834 --> 01:26:07,101
- Have you all been doing well?
- Thank you.

832
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:07,967
Thank you.

833
01:26:10,267 --> 01:26:11,634
Dr. Ji!

834
01:26:15,968 --> 01:26:17,936
(Family Love Hospital
Assistant Director Seol Myungsook)

835
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:20,567
Good for you.

836
01:26:21,667 --> 01:26:23,301
Congratulations, Assistant Director.

837
01:26:25,734 --> 01:26:27,235
When can you start?

838
01:26:28,234 --> 01:26:30,968
Director Gong ordered me to meet you.

839
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:32,668
I'm supposed to persuade you.

840
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:34,801
You've been back for quite some time now.

841
01:26:34,868 --> 01:26:37,068
He insists that you should come to work.

842
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:43,635
Director Gong is nervous that another
hospital might take you away.

843
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,834
Would that be okay though?

844
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,267
I feel guilty about coming back.

845
01:26:48,367 --> 01:26:50,801
Don't worry about a thing
and just come to work.

846
01:26:51,868 --> 01:26:54,068
We kept your office vacant all this time.

847
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:57,102
Stop playing hard to get, okay?

848
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,167
Thank you.

849
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,034
By the way...

850
01:27:06,834 --> 01:27:08,201
About Taeoh...

851
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,300
I don't think he left for good.

852
01:27:12,467 --> 01:27:14,001
Remember Woo Hosang?

853
01:27:14,234 --> 01:27:16,035
My high school friend
whom you met last time.

854
01:27:16,734 --> 01:27:18,968
He saw Taeoh recently.

855
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:23,268
- Where?
- In Gosan.

856
01:27:23,801 --> 01:27:25,735
He was refusing to pay
money at a cart bar...

857
01:27:25,968 --> 01:27:28,769
...looking totally wasted and dejected.

858
01:27:29,734 --> 01:27:33,468
My friend said he took care
of the bill out of pity,

859
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,534
but Taeoh disappeared all of a sudden.

860
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,234
When was that?

861
01:27:41,834 --> 01:27:44,535
About... a week ago?

862
01:27:47,367 --> 01:27:50,434
Why don't you go look for him?

863
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,167
I'm worried that he might get in trouble.

864
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,033
Why would I do that? I'm sure he's fine.

865
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,634
When are you coming home, Mom?

866
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:12,734
Okay.

867
01:29:14,534 --> 01:29:15,667
Joonyoung.

868
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,567
I'm home.

869
01:30:02,133 --> 01:30:03,166
Joonyoung?

870
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,300
Joonyoung...?

871
01:30:16,968 --> 01:30:18,702
(Son)

872
01:31:05,167 --> 01:31:06,200
I'm taking...

873
01:31:06,701 --> 01:31:08,135
...Joonyoung with me.

874
01:31:47,567 --> 01:31:50,234
(The World of the Married)

875
01:31:50,467 --> 01:31:53,101
I'm so proud of Joonyoung
for staying strong.

876
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,567
Everything is fine now.

877
01:31:55,634 --> 01:31:57,168
We should do another photo-shoot
before it's too late.

878
01:31:57,501 --> 01:31:59,968
What are we waiting for?

879
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,233
Have you been sulking all this time
because I played hard to get?

880
01:32:03,334 --> 01:32:04,668
Don't say anything.

881
01:32:04,734 --> 01:32:07,401
Let's just stay like this a bit.

882
01:32:07,968 --> 01:32:10,836
Have you heard from Taeoh?

883
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,534
Would he show up again?

884
01:32:13,634 --> 01:32:16,301
You've always been the one for me.

885
01:32:16,734 --> 01:32:18,168
Let's start over.

886
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,368
It's too late.

887
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:21,968
You ruined everything, Dad.

888
01:32:22,067 --> 01:32:23,601
Actually...

889
01:32:23,934 --> 01:32:27,268
...Jehyuk thinks he saw
Taeoh not long ago.

890
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:28,400
Sunwoo...

891
01:32:29,434 --> 01:32:30,834
Will you come here to see me?
