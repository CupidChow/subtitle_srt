Here.

5
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:51,710
Are you okay about going
back to your old school?

6
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,901
Instead of moving to a new place,

7
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:56,601
I'd rather face my problem head-on.

8
00:00:56,918 --> 00:00:59,001
Looks like you've found some courage.

9
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,302
I'm glad.

10
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,468
- Dad.
- Hey.

11
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:30,368
Hey.

12
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,701
Wow, what a delicious smell.

13
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,168
Oh wow.

14
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,567
It's my favorite, grilled fish.

15
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,067
I'm hungry.

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,918
Wash your hands first.

17
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,126
I'll get your rice.

18
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:44,934
Why can't you do anything right?

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,200
You get scolded by Mom all the time.

20
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:48,868
Hey.

21
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:52,501
That's because your mom's
madly in love with me.

22
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:54,235
-Yeah right.
-Yes.

23
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:55,835
He's right about that.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
See?

25
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,700
Look at his face.

26
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:04,534
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

27
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,068
How was school?

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,667
Same old, same old.

29
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,168
How was your day, sweetie?

30
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,868
I'm going on a business trip
to China next Tuesday.

31
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:20,302
Really?

32
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:22,235
Will we hear some good news soon?

33
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,001
I have...

34
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:25,601
...a good feeling about this.

35
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,084
Your dad is oozing confidence.

36
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,268
What will you get for me in China?

37
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:35,068
What do you want?
What should I get for you?

38
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,834
You're all I need, Dad.

39
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:40,701
Wow, Joonyoung.

40
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,626
All I need is your mom.

41
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,567
I'm done.

42
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,768
Okay. Go get some rest.

Hey, Yerim.

52
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,333
I noticed your lights were on.

53
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,368
When did you return?

54
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,702
Are you okay, Sunwoo?

55
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,435
Joonyoung is hanging in there.
I'm so thankful.

56

Everything's in order now.

57
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:42,467
What about you, Yerim?

58
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:44,168
How have you been?

59
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:52,869

Sounds good to me.

63
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,834
Who are you meeting with?

64
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,100
That's a secret.

65
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:06,701
Be home for dinner. Don't be late.

66
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:12,834
Here.

67
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:15,801
I'll give you a call if I'm late.

68
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,001
This will suit your level.

69
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,001
It has a lot of pictures.

70
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:09,934
Are you looking down on me?

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,033
You ditched school so many times.

72
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,600
It's going to be tough catching up.

73
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:15,734

You're such a buzz-kill.

76
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:22,901
Ice cream is on you,
since I picked a book for you.

77
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:37,535
Hello.

78
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,234
- Hello.
- Hello.

79
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,235
- Welcome.
- Oh hello.

80
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:05,968
Hello.

81
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:10,701
Dr. Ji.

82
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,601
I heard you were back.

83
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,068
How have you been?

84
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:18,200
- How's Haekang?
- Gosh, we're doing fine.

85
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,042
I hope your family's doing okay. See you.

86
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:22,769
Wait.

87
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,401
Do I..

88
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,234
...still make you uncomfortable?

89
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:30,542
Goodness. Of course not.

90
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,876
Things are good between our boys.
Why would I be uncomfortable?

91
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,634
If you're uncomfortable
about what happened last time,

92
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,701
I apologize.

93
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:42,201
Oh okay...

94
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:47,034
Let's forget about the old grudge,

95
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,368
and hang out like we used to, okay?

96
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:51,401
Bye now.

97
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,801
Hello, Madam.

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,100
Should I say congratulations?

99
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,234
Or should I give you a compliment?

100
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:19,936
Anyhow...

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,467
You got tenacity. I like that.

102
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,669
You're very generous
with your compliments.

103
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:31,368
I decided not to leave because
that's what Joonyoung wanted.

104
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:33,368
No need to be modest.

105
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:39,035
I know who's behind the departure
of Chairman Yeo's family.

106
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:45,768
The women of this town are
being very careful...

107
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,460
...to not get on your nerves.

108
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,001
But still...

109
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,600
Maybe you should've gone with the flow...

110
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:01,293
...and let things run their course.

111
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,250
If you pour too much passion
in any relationship,

112
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:08,435
someone's bound to get hurt.

113
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:11,534
I hope...

114
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,869
... you don't have to
go through that again.

115
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,034
You've been through enough.

116
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:25,568
How is it?

117
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Do you like it?

118
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,634
I'll pick my own clothes next time.

119
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:32,367
You don't like it?

120
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:37,401
Guess who has the worst
sense of fashion in school.

121
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,702
Who?

122
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,668
The kid who wears what their mom
bought for them.

123
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:44,268
Wow. You're all grown up now, huh?

124
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm going to get a refund.

125
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:47,634
Don't.

126
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,035
These look pretty good.

127
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:54,368
Fine. I'll give you my
credit card next time.

128
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:59,701
I want to start cram school next week.

129
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,376
You don't have to strain yourself.

130
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,168
You can take more time off if you want.

131
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,934
It's better than being bored all the time.

132
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,918
Some kids are taking prep course.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,801
All right.

134
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,567
I'll get you enrolled.

135
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:40,202
Aren't you leaving?

136
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:42,769
Joonyoung...

137
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,901
Look.

00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:53,534
(From Yoon Noeul)

139
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:54,502
What are you doing?

140
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:56,668
Sorry.

141
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:02,234
Good night.

142
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,669
One more.

143
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:42,801
Sure.

144
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,668
How are you?

145
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:55,868
Did you eat dinner?

146
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:03,301
Why won't you call me?

147
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,377
Why don't you get your own place?

148
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,635
How long are you going to live like this?

149
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,301
Are you here to nag...

150
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,042
...at this ungodly hour?

151
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,402
I was only playing hard to get.

152
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,068
You're still sulking about that?

153
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:53,902
So?

154
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,667
You didn't even try that hard.

155
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:00,201
I'm a little disappointed.

156
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:01,201
And?

157
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,901
I was worried if you
were sick or something.

158
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:05,568
That's it?

159
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:12,101
And I missed you.

160
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:25,335
I missed you too.

161
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,634
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:36,168
You don't have to say anything.

163
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:41,234
Let's just stay like this for a while.

164
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,433
Joonyoung!

165
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,834
Are you ready to go?

166
00:14:56,834 --> 00:15:00,268
(One week ago)

167
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,001
You look great.

168
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,917
Your lipstick is too bright.

169
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,335
Is it?

170
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,801
Should I go with something light?

171
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,333
No.

172
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:20,634
I think it's pretty.

173
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:29,535
Congrats on getting back together.

174
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:30,602
Congratulations.

175
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,300
Congratulations.

176
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:35,235
Gosh, you're making me blush.

177
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,867
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of it,

178
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:38,402
but someone couldn't resist.

179
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:39,201
What?

180
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,667
I was going to stand
up and shout hurrah.

181
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,801
But I'll skip that part
to save you the embarrassment.

182
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:51,468
It's remarkable how you two
overcame those hard times...

183
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,235
...and found forgiveness.

184
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,101
You deserve to be cheered.

185
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,334
Just enjoy it, Yerim.

186
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:58,734
Thank you.

187
00:15:59,033 --> 00:15:59,901
Everyone...

188
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,433
Thank you.

189
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,201
We should also celebrate their return.

190
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:11,734
I'm glad.

191
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:14,502
You'll have it easy from now on.

192
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,292
Thank you for your concerns.

193
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:20,601
I'll do my best from now on
to thank all of you.

194
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,468
Joonyoung and I have a deal.

195
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,801
If there’s anything I can do,
just let me know.

196
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,735
You too, Joonyoung. Okay?

197
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,968
Excuse me for a second.

198
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,067
Where are you going?

199
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:37,001
To the restroom.

200
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,001
It's okay.

201
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:55,401
Everything is going to be just fine.

202
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,835
Have you heard from Taeoh?

203
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,801
No. Nothing.

204
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,634
I'm sure he left Gosan.

205
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,834
Why would he come back?

206
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:10,968
Right.

207
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:12,935
No one has seen him.

208
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,201
What is it?

209
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,267
It's nothing.

210
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,600
The food is good.

211
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,467
You can order more.

212
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,201
Nice place, right?

213
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,968
We should hang out sometime.
Just us girls.

214
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:10,567
All right. We'll hang out at my place.

215
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,267
Fantastic.

216
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,168
See you next time, Joonyoung.

217
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,201
- Good night, Dr. Seol.
- Bye.

218
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,467
This single lady will get going.

219
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:18,801
- Bye.
- Take care.

220
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:19,901
- See you.
- Good bye.

221
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,934
Take care.

222
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,135
The rest of us should go
for a second round.

223
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,300
We'll leave you two alone
so you can have some quality time.

224
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:30,068
I had a good time.

225
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:31,901
- I'll see you next time.
- Sure.

226
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:34,134
Take care, Sunwoo.
And you too, Joonyoung.

227
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:35,967
Take care.

228
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:43,001
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

229
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,709
Our house is very near. We'll just walk.

230
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:47,302
See you next time, Dr. Kim.

231
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:49,901
Very well, then.

232
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:52,034
See you again, Joonyoung.

233
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,168
- Good night.
- Bye.

234
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,400
Shall we go now?

235
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,234
Yes.

236
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,767
The air is so fresh.

237
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:23,601
- Right?
- Yes.

238
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:36,101
What is it?

239
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:39,368
Nothing.

240
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,736
I had a great evening.

241
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,168
Thank you.

242
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:52,834
I never imagined...

243
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:56,368
...that we would walk
together like this again.

244
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:59,401
I thought we were over.

245
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,601
The weather is nice.

246
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,335
If it weren't for you,

247
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,701
my life would've fallen apart.

248
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,235
You're my savior.

249
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,501
You saved me.

250
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,709
I'll never let go of your hand again.

251
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:39,500
Don't be so dramatic.

252
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:43,968
Everyone fights their own battles.

253
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:47,234
I only realized...

254
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:50,034
...when you weren't there.

255
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:51,734
I realized...

256
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,168
...that I like you a lot.

257
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:57,968
So I want to give it a try.

258
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,202
Marry or don't marry,
you will regret it either way.

259
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:04,702
I've been there once.

260
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:06,235
I think I can do it again.

261
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:07,868
That's my girl.

262
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,268
You're so cool sometimes.

263
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:21,868
Dr. Kim seems like a nice guy.

264
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:25,034
I think he has feelings for Sunwoo.

265
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:31,001
I think I saw Taeoh recently.

266
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:32,235
What?

267
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,635
It happened so fast so I'm
not sure if it was him.

268
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:38,801
I thought it would be better
if Sunwoo didn't know,

269
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:40,101
so I didn't say anything.

270
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,267
Maybe I should've told her.

271
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:44,335
I'm not sure.

272
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:05,734
What is it?

273
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,967
Nothing. Let's go inside.

274
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,734
Good night, son.

275
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:21,901
Good night.

276
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,502
I'm late.

277
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,201
I'm so late.

278
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:15,768
- Honey!
- Yes?

279
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:18,168
-Your coffee!
-Yes.

280
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,601
- Thanks.
- Be careful. It's hot.

281
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:25,534
I'm off to work.

282
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,702
- Safe driving.
- Okay.

283
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:18,301
Joonyoung.

284
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,567
Hello.

285
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:24,401
I'll get going.

286
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,200
Why are you here? I could've walked home.

287
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,167
Why did Noeul just leave?

288
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,801
I was going to buy some
tteokbokki for you guys.

289
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,433
It's okay.

290
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:51,468
What?

291
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,567
What is it?

292
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,701
Gosh.

293
00:25:20,534 --> 00:25:23,402
I'll give you a ride everyday
for the time being.

294
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,801
I don't think we have to worry anymore.

295
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:28,268
It's boring to be at home by myself.

296
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,233
Okay.

297
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:48,534
I have to go to the toilet.

298
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:33,101
Mom?

299
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:35,802
Yes?

300
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:47,868
Don't call him.

301
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:50,901
Don't try to find out where he is,
or what he's doing.

302
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,751
He's trying to mess with your head.
Just ignore him.

303
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:56,201
Just call the police
if he does this again.

304
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:44,268
A vow renewal?

305
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,368
What for?

306
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,268
It's going to be a hassle for you.

307
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:54,068
Gosh.

308
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:55,634
Back then...

309
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:57,335
...I had absolutely nothing,

310
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:59,734
but we got married in a haste
because I was afraid of losing you.

311
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,934
I never gave you a proper wedding.

312
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:06,134
This wedding dress I bought
on a three-month installment plan...

313
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:08,102
...should be in the house somewhere.

314
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:10,402
You know something about this veil?

315
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,435
I actually bought it online.

316
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:18,801
That's why we should
do another photo-shoot.

317
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:22,801
You look pretty in anything,

318
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,935
but I always wanted you
to wear a proper wedding dress.

319
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,534
Should we?

320
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:32,102
Let's do another photo-shoot
before it's too late.

321
00:28:33,234 --> 00:28:34,801
What's the big deal anyway?

322
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:38,202
What have we been waiting for?

323
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,767
Then I should start
taking care of my skin.

324
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:46,135
You don't need skin care.

325
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,600
Since we're doing this,

326
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,901
let's do a photo-shoot every 10 years.

327
00:28:57,634 --> 00:29:01,034
Joonyoung is getting older.

328
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,735
Let's leave photos of us...

329
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:06,768
...getting old together.

330
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:08,377
We should leave our
memories through pictures.

331
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:13,102
Every moment we share is precious.

332
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,901
Even when Joonyoung gets married...

333
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:16,901
...and we become grandparents?

334
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:18,168
Absolutely.

335
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,600
I'm sure you'll be
a beautiful grandmother.

336
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,701
- What?
- It was worth it after all.

337
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,502
Supporting my husband all this time.

338
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:32,702
What the heck?

339
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:38,834
How dare you talk to your
husband that way?

340
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:11,135
The food was really nice, Sunwoo.

341
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,267
I never ate anything so good.

342
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:15,268
Why did you cook so much?

343
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,168
I didn't intend to, but it just happened.

344
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:18,667
Thank you for enjoying the food.

345
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:21,034
It's because she's bored all day.

346
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:23,834
"Joonyoung, should we make
our own Kimchi?"

347
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:25,634
She actually said that.

348
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:29,035
I think housekeeping is my thing.

349
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:31,101
Maybe I should choose
a different career.

350
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:34,068
I should make her come to work
so she doesn't get any ideas.

351
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,567
Yes, please.

352
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:37,667
I'll go to my room now.

353
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:40,234
- Bye, Joonyoung.
- Goodnight, Joonyoung.

354
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:44,166
Let's have a drink.

355
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,300
Yeah, sure.

356
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:50,569
It's good to see Joonyoung smile.

357
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,634
I think he has a girlfriend.

358
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:56,402
Really? That is so adorable.

359
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:57,968
You must be a little jealous.

360
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,935
I'm happy to see that he's doing okay.

361
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:02,700
I wish things were always like this.

362
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:05,402
I'm sure he'll grow up
to be a fine young man.

363
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:09,134
All he needs is his wonderful mother.

364
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:12,501
It'll be fine as long as you stay strong.

365
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:13,734
I should.

366
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,668
Sunwoo...

367
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,834
Jehyuk thinks...

368
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,500
...he saw Taeoh not long ago.

369
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:22,734
Where?

370
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:25,735
At his favorite bar near his office.

371
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,200
He wasn't sure about it,
but I thought you should know.

372
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:32,235
He must be spending his
days completely drunk.

373
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:34,202
Just like his father did before he died.

374
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,500
What if he wastes his life away?

375
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,367
He couldn't have gone
there on purpose, right?

376
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:45,134
That used to be his favorite bar.
Maybe it's force of habit.

377
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:49,834
I'm sure he didn't go there
to harm Jehyuk.

378
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,968
Right. Jehyuk is not even sure who he saw.

379
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,634
As long as he's not in Gosan, right?

380
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:56,535
Right.

381
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:58,934
Don't worry.

382
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,968
I'm sure he's doing fine on his own.

383
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:04,302
Although he might need some time.

384
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,433
I hope so.

385
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:08,168
I hope he pulls himself together
and get a life.

386
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:10,001
I don't want to see him ever again.

387
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,333
Come on, it's me you're talking to.

388
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:26,401
I need to hang up now.

389
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,101
Okay, I got it.

390
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:30,802
Okay.

391
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:34,501
Did you have fun?

392
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:35,702
Yes.

393
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:38,901
Who was that?

394
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:40,634
My friend from college.

395
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,901
We weren't that close,

396
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,734
but he called me out of blue.

397
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,469
Aren't you going to bed?

398
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:54,701
I want to do a little reading first.

399
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,634
Would you like a glass?

400
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:14,135
Sounds good.

401
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:19,567
What are you reading?

402
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,133
Honey.

403
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:04,801
What are you doing up?

404
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:21,001
I thought I would be okay.

405
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,401
I know it's all behind us now,

406
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:27,934
and you won't cheat on me again, but...

407
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:30,801
I know that...

408
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,567
But to tell you the truth...

409
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,367
I'm not okay.

410
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,834
I can't help it.

411
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,634
I keep getting suspicious...

412
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:54,901
...and nervous.

413
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,967
I can't help but keep thinking about it.

414
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,233
I don't think I can forgive you.

415
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:17,701
I'd rather hate you instead.

416
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:21,967
I love you.

417
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,868
I know I still love you.

418
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:30,701
That's what makes it more difficult.

419
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,834
What if I continue to be like this?

420
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,700
What if I can't forgive you?

421
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:45,068
What if I can't let go...

422
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:51,500
...and keep resenting you
for the rest of my life?

423
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,400
I said I'm fine.

424
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:30,102
You're not going anywhere, right?

425
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,034
No.

426
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,801
Don't worry about me and go.

427
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:41,702
If you're going to meet a friend,
just invite them here.

428
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,459
Just worry about yourself.

429
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:47,469
Do you want to stay unemployed?

430
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,500
Don't worry about a thing
and just come to work.

431
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,959
We kept your office vacant all this time.

432
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,735
Stop playing hard to get, okay?

433
00:38:58,567 --> 00:38:59,667
Thank you.

434
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,034
By the way...

435
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,067
About Taeoh...

436
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:10,068
Apparently, he's still around.

437
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:11,801
Remember Woo Hosang?

438
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,834
My high school friend
whom you met last time.

439
00:39:14,534 --> 00:39:16,734
He saw Taeoh recently.

440
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:21,101
- Where?
- In Gosan.

441
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,568
He was refusing to pay
money at a cart bar...

442
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:26,535
...looking totally wasted and dejected.

443
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:31,268
My friend said he took care
of the bill out of pity,

444
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:34,301
but Taeoh disappeared all of a sudden.

445
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,001
When was that?

446
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:40,768
About...

447
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:42,335
...a week ago?

448
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:48,267
Why don't you go look for him?

449
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,001
I'm worried that he might get in trouble.

450
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,800
Why would I do that? I'm sure he's fine.

451
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:31,735
-Mom?
-Hey...

452
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:33,334
Are you at home?

453
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:34,502
Yeah.

454
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:36,900
Are you okay?

455
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:38,734
I'm fine.

456
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:40,700
When are you coming home?

457
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:44,901
I'll go home after buying some groceries.

458
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:46,567
Okay.

459
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:29,467
Joonyoung.

460
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,367
I'm home.

461
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:46,100
Joonyoung?

462
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:47,334
Joonyoung...?

463
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:51,335
(Son)

464
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:23,201
I'm taking...

465
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:25,135
...Joonyoung with me.

466
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:35,869
(Lee Taeoh)

467
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:46,375
Your call cannot be reached.
Please leave….

468
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,292
Your call cannot be reached.
Please leave….

469
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,668
(Lee Taeoh)

470
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,035
Taeoh?

471
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,168
Sunwoo...

472
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:41,769
I'm sorry...

473
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:46,734
Is Joonyoung with you?

474
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,167
Yes.

475
00:43:54,934 --> 00:43:56,234
He's with me.

476
00:44:04,868 --> 00:44:06,035
Where are you?

477
00:44:14,534 --> 00:44:16,534
I missed Joonyoung so much...

478
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,968
I just wanted to be with him.

479
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:26,400
That's all there is, Sunwoo.

480
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,268
I'm sorry.

481
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,302
I know. I understand.

482
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:35,768
Is he okay?

483
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,268
Is everything all right?

484
00:44:48,234 --> 00:44:49,668
I'll be on my way.

485
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:52,968
Let's talk face to face, okay?

486
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:57,601
Shall we have lunch together?

487
00:44:57,701 --> 00:44:58,535
We should.

488
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:02,835
The three of us can grab
something together and talk.

489
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:06,935
Taeoh.

490
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:09,467
Are you listening?

491
00:45:11,968 --> 00:45:13,068
Hello?

492
00:45:14,234 --> 00:45:15,035
Really?

493
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:20,234
Will you come see me?

494
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:22,568
Absolutely.

495
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:25,460
Of course I will.

496
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:30,734
I'm sure Joonyoung would like that.

497
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:34,268
Are you...

498
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,134
...with him right now?

499
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,367
I'll ask him.

500
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,367
Can you put him on?

501
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:57,200
Hello?

502
00:46:01,934 --> 00:46:02,934
Taeoh?

503
00:46:06,634 --> 00:46:07,901
Taeoh!

504
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,960
When I was around your age...

505
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,101
My dad ran away.

506
00:47:02,634 --> 00:47:04,335
And he never came back...

507
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:09,734
...until he died.

508
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:15,934
I didn't want that to happen to you.

509
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:21,368
I wanted to have you near me.

510
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:28,901
Because if we live apart,

511
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,584
you might think that I abandoned you.

512
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:35,834
I couldn't let that happen.

513
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:39,368
I have never abandoned you,
even for a moment.

514
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:47,068
That's all I ever wanted, Joonyoung.

515
00:49:21,801 --> 00:49:22,868
Are you okay?

516
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:26,266
He asked me to keep him
company for a while.

517
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:29,668
He was afraid he might do something.

518
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,467
So I went with him.

519
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,168
I wanted to tell him something.

520
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:49,734
Sunwoo...

521
00:49:51,801 --> 00:49:53,235
That's all. I swear.

522
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:56,801
Please don't get the wrong idea.

523
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,034
Get in.

524
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:09,568
Mom.

525
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,734
Let's get something to eat.

526
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,634
Just like we discussed earlier.

527
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:29,734
Are you drunk?

528
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:33,468
Yes.

529
00:51:34,067 --> 00:51:34,901
A little.

530
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,333
Enjoy.

531
00:51:58,567 --> 00:51:59,535
Go ahead and eat.

532
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:02,835
Let's eat, Joonyoung.

533
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:06,035
How have you been?

534
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:43,534
Sorry...

535
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,834
I saw you a few days ago.

536
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:55,901
Here.

537
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,301
I saw you and Joonyoung.

538
00:54:04,267 --> 00:54:06,168
I should've been there with you.

539
00:54:07,133 --> 00:54:09,433
I should've been the one next to you.

540
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,567
Next to my family and friends...

541
00:54:14,634 --> 00:54:16,268
That should've been my place.

542
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:19,502
Why are you saying this now?

543
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:22,602
You ruined everything.

544
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:24,768
Joonyoung...

545
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:28,735
Why are we even here?

546
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:31,268
My mood is spoiled.

547
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:35,085
I thought your dad needed a moment
to let go of the past.

548
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:37,834
That way, we can start over.

549
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,701
All three of us.

550
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:45,934
Right.

551
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:49,868
We should start over.

552
00:54:50,267 --> 00:54:52,968
Let bygones be bygones.

553
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:58,568
I'll forgive you,
so please forgive me in return.

554
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,934
- What?
- For Joonyoung's sake.

555
00:55:05,709 --> 00:55:08,293
We should do our best
as Joonyoung's parents.

556
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:11,101
It'll be hard at first,

557
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,334
but he will settle down
if we all work together.

558
00:55:16,968 --> 00:55:19,101
We can go back to the old days.

559
00:55:20,801 --> 00:55:24,035
- No.
- The three of us will be a family again.

560
00:55:24,734 --> 00:55:28,034
- You know that's impossible.
- I'm working on a script.

561
00:55:28,133 --> 00:55:30,200
I can find a good production company.

562
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,767
If you don't want that...

563
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,800
I'll quit writing movies
and find another job.

564
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:39,535
We should make small sacrifices
for a better future.

565
00:55:39,634 --> 00:55:40,468
Stop.

566
00:55:40,934 --> 00:55:41,835
Just stop.

567
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,735
Things are over between us, Taeoh.

568
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:50,035
We're done.

569
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,068
You've always...

570
00:56:01,033 --> 00:56:02,534
... been the one for me.

571
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:06,268
I realized that too late.

572
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:09,535
Please take me back, Sunwoo.

573
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,233
You want that too.
Isn't that why we're here?

574
00:56:22,601 --> 00:56:23,801
Is that true, Mom?

575
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,567
Are you going to take him back?

576
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:27,067
Never.

577
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:30,934
Not a chance.

578
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:34,533
I can't let you keep
stalking us like a madman.

579
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:36,668
It's too nerve-wrecking.

580
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:41,126
I was giving you a chance
to make things right with your son.

581
00:56:42,634 --> 00:56:44,734
Are you going to ruin this, too?

582
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:49,234
You're unbelievable.

583
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:54,001
Why don't you get it?

584
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,001
I have nothing now.

585
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:03,634
I lost everything.

586
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:07,734
Please give me another chance.

587
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:14,368
Isn't that what family is about?

588
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:32,834
If this is how you're going to be,
just go drop dead somewhere.

589
00:58:39,968 --> 00:58:41,869
I'll help you until you can settle down.

590
00:58:43,868 --> 00:58:45,369
I didn't come here to beg.

591
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:49,400
Don't make me more miserable
than I already am.

592
00:58:53,209 --> 00:58:55,501
This could be your last time
to see Joonyoung.

593
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:58,901
Do you really want to end it like this?

594
00:59:02,634 --> 00:59:04,502
Think about Joonyoung.

595
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:09,293
Get your life together.

596
00:59:11,734 --> 00:59:14,301
That's the only thing you can do...

597
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:19,801
...for Joonyoung.

598
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:30,867
Let's go.

599
00:59:35,133 --> 00:59:36,533
Let's go.

600
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:57,584
Say goodbye to your dad.

601
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Joonyoung.

602
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:12,268
I don't want you to become like me.

603
01:00:18,067 --> 01:00:21,234
The most special person in the world
is someone who sticks by you.

604
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:26,935
If you take them for granted
because they're close,

605
01:00:29,868 --> 01:00:31,935
you'll end up making foolish
mistakes like I did.

606
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:37,301
If you forget...

607
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:41,901
...the person who loves you
and cherishes you,

608
01:00:44,868 --> 01:00:46,702
you'll lose everything.

609
01:00:47,934 --> 01:00:49,635
Remember that, okay?

610
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:05,802
Forget about me.

611
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:09,001
I will never show up again.

612
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:14,100
I guess this is...

613
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:23,967
...goodbye.

614
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,967
If you're done talking, we'll go now.

615
01:03:08,834 --> 01:03:10,001
Dad!

616
01:03:34,968 --> 01:03:37,569
The man who tore my heart to shreds...

617
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:41,001
The enemy whom I killed...

618
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:44,568
The object of my hatred...

619
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,267
The man who I was madly in love with...

620
01:03:49,968 --> 01:03:51,035
He was my enemy...

621
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:52,934
...and my comrade.

622
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,968
The man who was a partner
and an enemy.

623
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,402
My husband.

624
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,868
What choice...

625
01:05:54,234 --> 01:05:56,301
...should I have made?

626
01:05:57,367 --> 01:05:59,701
Did I have a choice to begin with?

627
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,735
Was there a chance for me...

628
01:06:05,601 --> 01:06:07,335
...to correct my wrongdoing?

629
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:24,768
Joonyoung!

630
01:06:36,901 --> 01:06:38,235
Joonyoung!

631
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:48,268
Everything that I've been holding onto...

632
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,934
...were all insignificant.

633
01:06:54,601 --> 01:06:55,901
After I finally realized that,

634
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:59,667
it was already too late.

635
01:07:15,634 --> 01:07:16,435
And now...

636
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:21,233
I lost the most important
thing in my life.

637
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,434
(One Year Later)

638
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:55,125
-Can you tell your CEO that I was here?
-Okay.

639
01:07:55,334 --> 01:07:56,001
Okay.

640
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,268
Please.

641
01:08:06,067 --> 01:08:09,301
(Scene Seven : In front of the house)

642
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:32,701
Have you...

643
01:08:33,367 --> 01:08:34,901
...heard from Joonyoung?

644
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,234
Dr. Ji, you have a patient.

645
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,267
- What?
- You have a patient.

646
01:08:49,634 --> 01:08:50,801
Okay.

647
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,068
Hello, Sunwoo.

648
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:02,435
How have you been?

649
01:09:07,736 --> 01:09:09,268
Still no news...

650
01:09:10,033 --> 01:09:11,300
...on Joonyoung?

651
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:17,302
I'm finally starting to settle down.

652
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:21,301
-Welcome.
- Hello.

653
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,867
I have more regulars now.

654
01:09:22,968 --> 01:09:25,001
- Thank you.
-What can I get for you?

655
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:31,800
Why? You want some cake?

656
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,268
No. I was just looking.

657
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,233
Let's go home.

658
01:09:36,701 --> 01:09:38,268
Yeah. I'm hungry.

659
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,901
I have no regrets about my decision.

660
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,701
(Art and Law)

661
01:10:24,067 --> 01:10:25,968
To be more precise,

662
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:28,869
I'm trying not to have regrets.

663
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:30,502
After all,

664
01:10:31,267 --> 01:10:34,001
I'm responsible for my own life.

665
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,209
Take your prescription.

666
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:48,834
By the time you read this email,

667
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:51,767
I hope you have found some peace.

668
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:56,500
You're here.

669
01:10:56,734 --> 01:10:58,268
- Hello.
- Hi.

670
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:00,367
- Chart please.
- Yes, Dr. Seol.

671
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:01,700
-Shall we?
-Okay.

672
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,500
I have a seminar to attend
on the fourth of next month.

673
01:11:13,634 --> 01:11:15,834
Can you check my appointment
schedule on that day?

674
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:16,735
Sure.

675
01:11:17,901 --> 01:11:20,968
You have two patients,
Ms. Choi Sookyung and Mr. Jung Namsik.

676
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:23,734
Reschedule their appointment date
before the seminar.

677
01:11:23,868 --> 01:11:24,802
Yes, Dr. Ji.

678
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:27,268
- Call in the next patient.
- Okay.

679
01:11:32,634 --> 01:11:34,068
Long time no see.

680
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:35,401
Dr. Ji.

681
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:41,335
Oh my...

682
01:11:43,701 --> 01:11:45,302
You look much better.

683
01:11:46,901 --> 01:11:47,802
Well...

684
01:11:48,033 --> 01:11:49,734
Don't believe everything you see.

685
01:11:50,634 --> 01:11:53,001
I've been showing some improvements...

686
01:11:54,467 --> 01:11:55,368
But...

687
01:11:56,501 --> 01:11:59,469
I realized I can't beat this on my own.

688
01:12:00,542 --> 01:12:02,126
The moment you let your guard down,

689
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,867
life screws you over.

690
01:12:07,133 --> 01:12:09,166
Life is full of uncertainties.

691
01:12:09,634 --> 01:12:10,901
Don't you agree, Dr. Ji?

692
01:12:12,734 --> 01:12:13,568
Yes.

693
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:16,460
Good luck on your treatment.

694
01:12:16,968 --> 01:12:19,669
I have a patient to see.

695
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:23,368
People only provide a small consolation.

696
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,333
But in fact,

697
01:12:25,934 --> 01:12:28,368
they don't care about the
misfortunes of other people.

698
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:40,600
You've spent all those
time feeling guilty.

699
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:42,368
Enough is enough.

700
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:45,234
Have you seen Mr. Ha Dongsik...?

701
01:12:48,267 --> 01:12:49,367
Mr. Ha Dongsik?

702
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,767
I hope you have forgiven everything now.

703
01:13:01,133 --> 01:13:02,500
Most of all...

704
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:04,959
I hope you have forgiven yourself.

705
01:13:26,767 --> 01:13:28,701
- Hello.
- Hello.

706
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:30,668
Hello.

(Counseling Center for Runaway Teenagers)

708
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,967
(Counseling for Youths
Living on the Streets)

709
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,834
No matter how hard I try,

710
01:14:05,834 --> 01:14:08,768
I cannot dare to mention
the word "forgiveness."

711
01:14:10,434 --> 01:14:12,335
(We can help them return
to their families.)

712
01:14:12,434 --> 01:14:16,235
(The Lee family finally found
their lost son after 12 long years.)

(We will do our very best to reunite
you with your son, Ms. Ji Sunwoo.)

714
01:14:22,634 --> 01:14:24,667
Thinking that you can
forgive someone...

715
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:29,001
...is just as arrogant as...

716
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:33,035
...condemning someone.

717
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:37,268
All I can do...

718
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:42,201
...is stay at home and hold down the fort.

719
01:14:45,133 --> 01:14:47,600
Waiting for my son to return one day.

720
01:14:49,701 --> 01:14:52,168
Living in tentative hope...

721
01:14:53,334 --> 01:14:55,068
Enduring all those days
of tedium and anxiety...

722
01:15:01,767 --> 01:15:04,800
Letting go of the arrogance
that I can define,

723
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:08,268
judge and take responsibility
for everything...

724
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,533
is probably the best thing I can do.

725
01:15:23,834 --> 01:15:26,335
Taking your partner
out of the picture...

726
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:28,584
...whom you shared most
of your life with...

727
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:32,500
...is just like giving myself up.

728
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:36,233
That pain will never end.

729
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,602
That's the world of the married.

730
01:15:42,901 --> 01:15:44,968
There can be no
one-sided assailant...

731
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:48,302
...or victim.

732
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:50,500
That's not how it works.

733
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:58,751
If I continue to reflect
on our past mistakes...

734
01:15:59,601 --> 01:16:00,535
Also...

735
01:16:02,459 --> 01:16:05,668
If I endure each day without
being consumed by the pain...

736
01:16:17,634 --> 01:16:18,634
Then maybe...

737
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,734
...that moment will find
me like a redemption.

738
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,417
The moment when I can
finally forgive myself.

739
01:16:50,701 --> 01:16:51,901
You're here.
