00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:00,868
Your call cannot be reached...

(Ji Sunwoo)

8
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:30,434
It seems like your plan
has gone awry, Dr. Ji.

9
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:34,501
Things aren't turning out
as you expected.

10
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:35,901
Right.

11
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,569
All my effort came to nothing.

12
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,401
It's funny how things work out.

13
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:45,667
What are you going to do?

14
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:48,934
Unless you do something,

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,400
your son-in-law will become a murderer.

16
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,368
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

17
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:59,568
but I don't give a damn about
Lee Taeoh's future.

18
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,467
All I care about...

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,434
...is my daughter.

20
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:05,801
Your daughter can just break up with him,

21
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:10,100
but what about your granddaughter?

22
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,667
The daughter of a murderer.

23
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,867
She'll have to live with that
label for the rest of her life.

24
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:19,368
Right now,

25
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,567
you and I are on the same boat, Mr. Yeo.

26
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:26,335
You just don't want to admit it.

27
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,701
So what will it be?

28
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,901
You're also on the suspects list.

29
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,501
Have you forgotten about that?

30
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,200
Don't worry about me.

31
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,001
Will you save your son-in-law or not?

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,801
That's all you need to decide.

33
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,667
I know you feel uncomfortable.

34
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,468
I understand,

35
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:12,669
but we have an obligation
to investigate this case.

36
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,634
Can you just tell me
where you were that night?

37
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:25,567
You have to give me something.

38
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:29,901
Keeping your silence...

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,801
...could get you in trouble.

40
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,268
How come he's not saying anything?

41
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,202
Is he hiding something?

42
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,734
I think so, too.

43
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,901
He will have to talk.

44
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,869
How can I help you, ma'am?

45
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:24,701
You didn't have to come
here for questioning.

46
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,167
As for your scarf,

47
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,801
Ms. Min Hyunseo already told us
that she dropped it at the scene.

48
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,468
It's about Mr. Lee Taeoh.

49
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,469
That day...

50
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,035
At the time of Park Inkyu's death,

51
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:15,735
He was with me.

52
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,734
Mr. Lee Taeoh and I...

53
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,467
We were together.

54
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:34,068
We were in my car at the parking lot.

55
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:40,935
That's not what Ms. Min said.

56
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:47,767
That's not true.

57
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:51,935
Mr. Lee was on the emergency
staircase with me.

58
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,234
Inkyu fell off after he went up there.

59
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:59,168
That's just an allegation
you made against him.

60
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,734
You can't incriminate a person...

61
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,367
...based on allegations.

62
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:06,135
Isn't that right, detective?

63
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,669
You're absolutely right.

64
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:14,602
But since we have a witness,

65
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:18,201
we have to ask questions.

66
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,268
He was with me at that time.

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
Do you have proof?

68
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,934
It's Mr. Lee Taeoh's wedding ring.

69
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,001
It was in my car.

70
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:50,468
I'm...

71
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,401
...his alibi.

72
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,434
Would that be enough?

73
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,067
His ring?

74
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,768
Why are you asking?

75
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,134
I can't give you the details
due to our disclosure policy.

76
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:24,701
But you have to be honest
for your husband's sake.

77
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,535
When did you notice...

78
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,700
...that your husband's ring was missing?

79
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,502
I haven't seen it since that night.

80
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,968
I don't know where it is.

81
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,101
Thank you for your cooperation.

82
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,102
(Episode 12)

83
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,668
We need to talk.

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,267
I met with Chairman Yeo
before I came here.

85
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,569
Is that how...

86
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,500
...your family treat you?

87
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:49,201
Did you abandon Joonyoung and me...

88
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,734
...only to be a fifth wheel
in that family?

89
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,769
You said you'll take care of it.
Why did the cops call me?

90
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,968
You won't hear from them again.

91
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:41,735
Did you...

92
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,201
...prove your innocence?

93
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:50,735
Yes.

94
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,101
Thanks to Sunwoo.

95
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:57,268
What?

96
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,001
Isn't it funny?

97
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,068
It's messed up, isn't it?

98
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,368
The one who came to my rescue...

99
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,101
...was none other than Ji Sunwoo.

100
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:12,402
But you said she could be the killer.

101
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:13,368
Yeah.

102
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:17,101
She could've incriminated herself.

103
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:21,467
But she took the risk and came
for me anyway.

104
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:22,368
Why?

105
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,001
For what?

106
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,568
Does she still have feelings for you?

107
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,268
Because of Joonyoung!

108
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Because I'm Joonyoung's father!

109
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:39,067
You know something, Dakyung?

110
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:43,802
I'm...

111
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,800
...also Jenny's father.

112
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,034
Am I wrong?

113
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:11,901
How nice would it be...

114
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,134
...if we can just burn that bridge?

115
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,868
Brace yourself.

116
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:22,035
Getting over a divorce is
not as easy as you think.

117
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,101
That's how it was for me.

118
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,234
Did you sleep well?

119
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:03,535
What's wrong?

120
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:05,701
Don't feel like eating?

121
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,101
Hold on. I'll make you a toast.

122
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:10,301
It's okay.

123
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,168
It'll just be a second.

124
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,301
Forget it.

125
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,435
Park Inkyu?

126
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,233
We decided it was death by suicide.

127
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,334
It was suicide?

128
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:33,501
The autopsy report and circumstantial
evidence all point to suicide.

129
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:36,101
And his family didn't
raise any complaints.

130
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,267
I think the case will be closed.

131
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,001
I see.

132
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,734
You don't have to be worried anymore.

133
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,168
I'm sorry for bothering you.

134
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:43,801
Why did you do that?

135
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:48,669
I told you to trust me.

136
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,667
And I told you...

137
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,934
...that I don't want
to burden you anymore.

138
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,834
I had it under control.

139
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,501
If you hadn't gone out of your way,

140
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,767
it would've been easier.

141
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,334
So they're saying...

142
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,101
...he committed suicide?

143
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,802
That means Inkyu died...

144
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,469
...because I broke up with him.

145
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,502
You don't have to feel guilty.

146
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,767
That was his choice.

147
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,501
It's all over now.

148
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:32,869
Okay?

149
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:45,934
I've finally gotten closure,

150
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:49,535
but what about you?

151
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,001
What's your plan from now on?

152
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:56,035
You should...

153
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,800
...worry about your own future.

154
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:05,267
Do you know why I couldn't
get away from Inkyu?

155
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,401
I pitied him.

156
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,335
He was absolutely the worst,

157
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:15,568
but I couldn't leave
him out of pity.

158
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,502
That's how I ended up here.

159
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,068
You had the same look
in your eyes yesterday.

160
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,968
You knew you were fooling yourself.

161
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,934
Just like when I defended
him and protected him,

162
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,600
you were doing all that...

163
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,168
...for Lee Taeoh.

164
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,367
Be careful.

165
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,101
You could end up like me...

166
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,500
...one day.

167
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:34,934
Did everything work out well?

168
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,801
I guess you could say that.

169
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:44,034
I'm sure the police investigated properly.

170
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,800
I couldn't let Joonyoung
become the son of a murderer.

171
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:52,835
Also,

172
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,467
Lee Taeoh doesn't have it in him.

173
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,434
It turns out that I'm just
another selfish human being.

174
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:04,101
I guess you could say that.

175
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,967
Be careful of Chairman Yeo.

176
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:20,368
He'll only see what he wants to see.

177
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,334
I'm sorry to have concerned you.

178
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:38,235
To hit a good shot,

179
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:41,301
one must push away
all distracting thoughts.

180
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,501
But I learned that you can't
just push them away.

181
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:46,368
You have to control them.

182
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,034
So, what's your plan from now on?

183
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:55,801
An investor is interested
in a script that I'm working on.

184
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,533
-We're having meetings.
-Ji Sunwoo.

185
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:02,434
Didn't you tell me...

186
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:05,268
...that you'll get rid of her for good?

187
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,335
Are you going to let it go?

188
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:12,034
I'm going to avoid her whether she
chooses to stay in Gosan or not.

189
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,435
Every time I run into her,

190
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:17,301
misunderstandings arise
between Dakyung and me.

191
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,067
Are you using Dakyung as an excuse...

192
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,801
...to keep an eye on Ji Sunwoo?

193
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,769
To drive her out of the city,

194
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,567
I did all sorts of things.

195
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,634
I was even accused of murder.

196
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:36,168
What more do you want me to do?

197
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:42,668
Park Inkyu fell off at 23:12:30 PM.

198
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:47,335
If you look at the bottom of the screen,

199
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:54,468
And Mr. Lee went into
the emergency staircase...

200
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:57,101
...at 23:13:38 PM.

201
00:19:57,968 --> 00:20:01,135
That's after Park Inkyu fell off the roof.

202
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,867
Do you have time this weekend?

203
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,234
Let's play a round of golf with Dakyung.

204
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,367
I'm sorry.

205
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,867
I don't think I can make it.

206
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,868
My mom said...

207
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,335
...that man died because
Joonyoung's mom dumped him.

208
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,800
They were lovers?

209
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:40,234
Holy shit.

210
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,101
Hey, no one commits suicide
over a break-up.

211
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,834
-I just don't get it.
-But...

212
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:47,335
-Did he really commit suicide?
-Dude.

213
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,367
What?

214
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:00,202
It sounds like you're
talking about my mom.

215
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,801
-So what?
-I want to know too.

216
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:06,968
Say it out loud so I can hear it.

217
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,700
Forget it.

218
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,467
Come on, say it.
I didn't hear you just now.

219
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,201
Hey, what do you want me to say?

220
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:19,667
I'm sure you've seen the news.

221
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:21,067
What you said...

222
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,867
...wasn't on the news.

223
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:25,067
He jumped to his death because
he got dumped by his girlfriend.

224
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,634
And that girlfriend's your mom.

225
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:29,001
-According to who?
-My mom said so.

226
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,600
All the moms in the neighborhood know.

227
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,535
He was my mom's patient!

228
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:35,801
Your mom should keep her
big, fat mouth shut.

229
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:39,367
-What did you just say?
-Your mom's a famous backbiter.

230
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,834
-She makes up stories all the time.
-You want a fight?

231
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,534
Come on, hit me.

232
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,901
Don't tell me you're chickening out.

233
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:49,468
Hit me!

234
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:53,901
What are you guys doing?

235
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:55,333
Break it up!

236
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:02,101
Damn it.

237
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,734
What are you doing here?

238
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,901
Why aren't you at cram school?

239
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:35,867
Are you sick?

240
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:41,867
You need to tell me what
happened so I can...

241
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,501
Can't I just skip for one day?

242
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:46,801
Do I have to give you a reason?

243
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,302
Just for today?

244
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,635
Will you be okay tomorrow?

245
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,335
How long are you going
to keep this up?

246
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,034
I don't know. Just leave me alone.

247
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:16,435
Hold this.

248
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:18,867
This one...

249
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:23,101
Stop being so late all the time.

250
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,534
I came early today.

251
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,901
It's late. You need to get going now.

252
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,667
Don't forget to eat dinner.

253
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,167
Okay.

254
00:23:31,434 --> 00:23:32,768
I'll see you at home.

255
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:34,868
Be careful on your way home.

256
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:36,801
Hello, Miyeon.

257
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:39,201
It's been a long time.

258
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,367
Dr. Ji.

259
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:42,101
How have you been?

260
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,134
Good.

261
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,601
Noeul, are you going home?

262
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,934
Yes.

263
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:50,500
I was just about to leave myself.

264
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,634
Would it be okay if I give
her a ride home?

265
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:56,734
Oh no. You don't have to.

266
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,301
I'm going that way anyhow.

267
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:01,634
Would you like that, Noeul?

268
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:05,368
Yes.

269
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:20,001
Thank you for the ride, ma'am.

270
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:23,535
You deserve it for being such
a good daughter to your mom.

271
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,567
It's just the two of us against the world.

272
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,167
I wish Joonyoung...

273
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:35,168
...would get along with me
just like you do.

274
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:38,467
I guess he's upset with me.

275
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:40,001
He won't talk to me.

276
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,167
How's Joonyoung doing at school?

277
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:46,901
Is he doing okay?

278
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:53,668
He got all grumpy and
skipped cram school today.

279
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,868
I need to know what's going on
to make him feel better.

280
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:01,034
But he won't talk to me.

281
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,602
I guess you don't want to tell me.

282
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:13,368
You know how boys are. They're childish.

283
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:16,734
The other guys were saying
all kinds of crazy things.

284
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
What did they say?

285
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:23,701
About the man who died
at Gosan station...

286
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,167
The guys said...

287
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:28,901
...that he was your boyfriend.

288
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:31,801
Who said that?

289
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,067
Oh, Assistant Director Ji.

290
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,167
Oh, that's right. You're not
the assistant director anymore.

291
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:20,735
I was surprised you called me.
What is it about?

292
00:26:23,534 --> 00:26:25,301
Do you want to know about my boyfriend?

293
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:32,334
You shouldn't run your mouth
like that in front of your kid.

294
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,134
How would you know
if I have a boyfriend?

295
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:38,968
What's gotten into you?

296
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,368
-Are you insane?
-You chose the wrong person to mess with.

297
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,369
Your husband wants to become
a politician, doesn't he?

298
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:48,500
Would you like to be sued
for defamation?

299
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,867
Or would you like me to spread
a dirty scandal about you?

300
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,100
I can think of a million ways to sabotage
your husband's political career.

301
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,268
What do you think?

302
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,068
Sounds fun, doesn't it?

303
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:08,335
If Joonyoung hears another
one of your bullshit stories...

304
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:10,168
I will...

305
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:13,102
...destroy you and your husband.

306
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,634
Have you decided not to
wear your ring anymore?

307
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,333
Taeoh.

308
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:03,135
Honey.

309
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,334
Coming.

310
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,301
-Your laundry.
-Thank you.

311
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:06,301
Have a nice day.

312
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,167
(Untitled Image File from "Wife")

313
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,634
Come and take your luggage.

314
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,500
Thank you.

315
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,401
Wait.

316
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,768
I'm going in.

317
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:10,433
Excellent!

318
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:11,901
I was hungry. Did you

319
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,602
order it for me?

320
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:16,469
You could've ordered some beers too.

321
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,300
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

322
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:45,934
I'll throw away anything
you leave behind today.

323
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,267
Do what you have to do.

324
00:30:58,567 --> 00:30:59,634
Yerim.

325
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:02,502
Do you have depression?

326
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:04,535
No. I'm on vacation.

327
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:07,268
Have you been living on delivery food?

328
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,401
What's it to you?

329
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,667
Do you sleep okay?

330
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:14,268
Let's go to Dr. Kim for counseling.

331
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,569
Stop talking nonsense.

332
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,800
Just take your luggage and leave.

333
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,934
When did you become such a nagger?

334
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:46,701
Did you meet with Haekang's mom?

335
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:50,001
What did you tell her?

336
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,601
That's between the grown-ups.

337
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:57,701
-It's none of your business.
-Mom, please!

338
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:01,168
When you hear false rumors,
you have to correct them.

339
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:03,701
Don't just keep the problem to yourself.

340
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:05,667
Don't ever let him get to you again.

341
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,267
He'll think you're a pushover.

342
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,035
Okay?

343
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:20,201
I'll check.

344
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:22,135
Hey, Joonyoung.

345
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:23,567
Joonyoung.

346
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,367
Are you here to see your mom?

347
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:30,435
Your mom's juggling work and family.

348
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:32,634
She must be so busy.

349
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:45,667
Did you eat dinner?

350
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:47,435
Yes.

351
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,801
Mom said we should go
on a family vacation.

352
00:32:52,968 --> 00:32:54,702
When are you available?

353
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,669
I'll be busy for a while.

354
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,468
I took away the blanket.

355
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:05,900
I want you to sleep
in the bedroom from now on.

356
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,567
Put it back. I have to
pull an all-nighter.

357
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:11,401
-When will you...
-Hey, Joonyoung.

358
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,168
How are you?

359
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:17,301
Me?

360
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:19,201
I'm already home.

361
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,134
I see.

362
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,868
Really? That's great.

363
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:28,233
Sure. Sounds good.

364
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
Here you go.

365
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,768
You must be going through
a difficult time.

366
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:07,834
Your dad told me what happened,
so I have a general idea.

367
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,768
Told you what?

368
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:15,767
About your mom.

369
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:18,568
The rumors.

370
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,201
Those are all lies.

371
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,268
You're right.

372
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:23,400
Those are all lies.

373
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:29,001
But the problem is that people
believe those stupid rumors.

374
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:32,801
But Joonyoung.

375
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,600
As much as you're going
through a hard time,

376
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:39,934
your mom's probably
going through the same.

377
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,967
I don't want to talk to you about my mom.

378
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:50,868
I have no hard feelings...

379
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,901
...toward you nor your mom.

380
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,133
The truth is, I want you two
to have a good life.

381
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,101
But unfortunately trouble
keeps finding you.

382
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:09,201
Frankly speaking,

383
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,300
I would leave this place right
away if I were your mom.

384
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,834
Those kind of rumors are
too much to bear.

385
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:27,367
But your mom can't leave
because of one reason.

386
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:31,568
And that's you.

387
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:35,302
She's enduring all that for you.

388
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,767
Because she's a mother.

389
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:41,001
And that's what moms do.

390
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,635
I realized that after I became
a mother myself.

391
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:49,402
That's what it's like to be a mom.

392
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:56,068
So I was wondering...

393
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:00,602
What if you lived with your dad?

394
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:04,502
Your mom's a successful doctor.

395
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:08,068
She can have a good life
anywhere outside of Gosan.

396
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,334
You know that.

397
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,434
Are you telling me...

398
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:18,434
...to abandon my mom for my dad?

399
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:20,268
Think what's best for your mom.

400
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:23,335
And what's best for you.

401
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,268
You're in middle school now.

402
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,569
You're old enough to think for yourself.

403
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:31,302
And your dad wants you
to move in with us.

404
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:33,635
You're always welcome to our house.

405
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:36,268
Okay?

406
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,534
Good job, Sunwoo.

407
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:51,502
That woman deserved it.

408
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:52,734
Did she break into tears?

409
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:55,302
I bet she was scared.

410
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:58,335
I had to do something.

411
00:36:58,434 --> 00:37:00,402
So I gave her a serious warning.

412
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,034
Joonyoung wasn't very pleased.

413
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:07,834
He lashed out at me.

414
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:09,935
Maybe it's because he's a boy.

415
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,868
It gets worse as he grows.

416
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,467
I wonder if it's because
he lives apart from his dad.

417
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:21,235
Be grateful that you don't have children.

418
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,367
But still, you can't
live without Joonyoung.

419
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:28,068
It sounded like you were bragging.

420
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,267
Was it obvious?

421
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:34,935
(Lee Taeoh)

422
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:42,568
What do you want?

423
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:44,768
Where are you?

424
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
You need to come home now.

425
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,101
Oh gosh!

426
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:33,534
What are you so surprised about?

427
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:35,235
You've seen me like this before.

428
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:36,901
What are you doing?

429
00:38:36,968 --> 00:38:40,302
I got sweaty cleaning the house,
so I took a shower.

430
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:45,735
No one asked you to clean the house.

431
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,301
If you're done here, just leave.

432
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,468
-Oh no!
-What?

433
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:53,635
What is it?

434
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,400
Can you get me a fresh
pair of underwear?

435
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:22,602
I didn't want to take him away
while you weren't here.

436
00:39:23,234 --> 00:39:24,568
What are you talking about?

437
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:43,701
What are you doing?

438
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:46,235
I finished packing.

439
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:49,035
Are we leaving now?

440
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:50,469
Yeah.

441
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,167
We will go if that's what you want.

442
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:57,634
But you should tell your mom first.

443
00:39:58,067 --> 00:39:58,901
Joonyoung...

444
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,034
You want to live at your dad's place?

445
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,334
I've done some thinking.

446
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:12,101
I feel like I'm holding you back
from having a normal life.

447
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,401
Why would you say that?

448
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:17,168
You're the reason I live for.

449
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:18,701
I don't want you to live for me.

450
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:21,301
That makes me feel worse.

451
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:23,469
I'll just live with Dad.

452
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:25,767
That would be better...

453
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:27,300
...for both you and me.

454
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,500
Did you put the idea into his head?

455
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:50,168
I saved you.

456
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,201
And this is what I get?

457
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:56,434
Joonyoung called me.

458
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:59,068
He asked if he can stay at my place.

459
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:05,567
I'll try to make him feel better.

460
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:10,367
Don't worry about it too much, okay?

461
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Hey.

462
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:20,367
Your briefcase.

463
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:25,934
I will come more often.

464
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,167
Joonyoung!

465
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:13,067
Joonyoung.

466
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:16,634
Can we talk before you go?

467
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:22,267
Please look at me.

468
00:42:23,267 --> 00:42:24,868
You should say goodbye to your mom.

469
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,033
Forget it.

470
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:27,600
Let's go.

471
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:20,301
Come on in.

472
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,034
Welcome.

473
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:27,701
I hope you like it here.

474
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,367
Go inside.

475
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:42,234
Thank you for understanding.

476
00:44:10,534 --> 00:44:13,201
You should call your mom
and let her know you've arrived.

477
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:15,600
She'll be worried about you.

478
00:44:18,601 --> 00:44:19,435
Hey.

479
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:22,502
It's better for her if I stay away.

480
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:31,135
She won't hear those stupid
rumors anymore because of me.

481
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:35,534
"Stupid rumors"?

482
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:37,469
What are you talking about?

483
00:44:37,534 --> 00:44:39,534
Nothing ever stays between the grown-ups.

484
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:42,068
The kids already know.

485
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,167
I hate pretending like
everything is fine.

486
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,634
Did you meet with Haekang's mom?

487
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:05,901
What did you say to her?

488
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:07,936
Mom, please!

489
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:15,034
(Lee Taeoh)

490
00:45:19,334 --> 00:45:20,501
It's me.

491
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,302
Have you talked to Joonyoung?

492
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:27,734
He thinks you're tolerating
all those rumors for his sake.

493
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,268
He's okay.

494
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:33,368
He said if you don't want to live here,

495
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,367
you can leave.

496
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:42,667
He really said that?

497
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:46,769
Why would he say that?

498
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:48,868
Did you...

499
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,768
...say something to him?

500
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:53,868
No.

501
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:58,435
I'm not sure where he got that idea.

502
00:45:58,534 --> 00:45:59,402
He said...

503
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:02,534
...he just wants to stay with me.

504
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,967
Only for a few days.

505
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,467
Keep your promise.

506
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:10,101
I can't change his mind
if that's what he wants.

507
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,001
I don't want to hear it.

508
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:14,734
Tell Congressman Cha to watch his mouth.

509
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:18,035
If you still think he's your friend
after what happened,

510
00:46:18,534 --> 00:46:20,502
you don't deserve to be Joonyoung's dad.

511
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,133
Do you hear me?

512
00:47:27,734 --> 00:47:28,834
Did you sleep well?

513
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:31,468
Time for breakfast.
Toast is almost ready.

514
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:33,334
I'm late.

515
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:35,534
I'm going to school.

516
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:40,101
Wait. I'll give you a ride.

517
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,501
It's okay. I can go alone.

518
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,134
But you said you're late.

519
00:47:45,634 --> 00:47:47,535
I'll give you a ride.

520
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:49,435
Are you sure you don't want breakfast?

521
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:50,535
I'll be fine.

522
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,067
But you'll be hungry until lunch.

523
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:55,801
Come on, man.

524
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:19,235
(Mom)

525
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:24,035
(Mom)

526
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,734
Hello?

527
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:27,667
Are you going to school?

528
00:48:27,901 --> 00:48:29,168
Did you eat breakfast?

529
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:30,702
Yes.

530
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:34,001
What's with your voice?
Did you catch a cold?

531
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:35,601
No.

532
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,767
You could've called me.
I might forget your voice.

533
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:42,467
How are you?

534
00:48:46,534 --> 00:48:47,601
How are you?

535
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,500
I'm fine except that I miss you.

536
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,601
Mom, I have to go now.

537
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:56,968
Okay.

538
00:48:57,033 --> 00:49:00,433
Be good at school and have a nice day.

539
00:49:00,734 --> 00:49:01,734
By the way...

540
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:03,634
When will you come home?

541
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:08,501
I'll talk to you later.

542
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:11,001
All right. Let's talk later.

543
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,600
My wife's wondering about you, Dr. Seol.

544
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,868
She says you haven't called.

545
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:41,268
My chances of becoming
assistant director is gone.

546
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:44,235
Why would I call your wife?

547
00:49:44,334 --> 00:49:45,868
You're quite a snob.

548
00:49:45,968 --> 00:49:48,268
I'm a blatant snob just like you.

549
00:49:48,334 --> 00:49:52,101
But how could you spread
our private conversation?

550
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,934
It's so awkward for me
to see the nurses.

551
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:59,300
Maybe you should think before you speak.

552
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:01,268
Look here, Dr. Seol!

553
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,201
Good morning.

554
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:17,467
This is just a business proposal.

555
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:18,667
Dr. Kim...

556
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:20,602
Will you marry me?

557
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,701
Pardon?

558
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:25,101
If you want to advance
your career here,

559
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:26,601
you have to get married.

560
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:28,901
There's no promotion
for a single person.

561
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,801
Right, Dr. Gong?

562
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:32,868
What should I do, Dr. Gong?

563
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,400
Should I marry her?

564
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:40,402
Oh for crying out loud...

565
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,767
It seems like he's in a tough spot
with all the nurses complaining.

566
00:50:57,767 --> 00:50:59,067
Stop teasing him.

567
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,834
I'll bother him and embarrass him
until he makes a formal apology.

568
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:06,201
To all the women working here.

569
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:08,601
You have my silent support.

570
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,600
Marry me?

571
00:51:24,968 --> 00:51:26,435
What are you thinking?

572
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:30,168
It's nothing.

573
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:32,101
How's Joonyoung?

574
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,467
Is he doing okay?

575
00:51:34,901 --> 00:51:35,735
Yes.

576
00:51:36,934 --> 00:51:38,535
I think he's doing okay.

577
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,467
Would you like to go to the movies?

578
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,235
It must be boring by yourself.

579
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:49,001
Maybe some other time.

580
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,934
What are you doing in here?

581
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:26,368
Why did you take him in?

582
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,400
Do you think it's easy to
raise someone else's child?

583
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:32,701
He's not just anybody's child.
He's Taeoh's son.

584
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:34,334
I don't know about you,

585
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:37,435
but what was Dr. Ji thinking?

586
00:52:37,968 --> 00:52:40,502
How can she let her son go like that?

587
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:41,935
Will you stop?

588
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:45,534
-It was my idea.
-I'm asking you why.

589
00:52:45,734 --> 00:52:47,368
Why do you have to complicate things?

590
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:49,001
Don't say that.

591
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:52,734
He didn't do anything wrong.
It was all between the adults.

592
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:56,368
Part of it was my fault.

593
00:52:58,267 --> 00:53:00,868
I want to guide him to the right path.

594
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:03,534
I hope you're okay with it.

595
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:06,068
You're my daughter and all,

596
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,201
but you surprise me sometimes.

597
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,667
Hi, Taeoh.

598
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:16,900
Hey.

599
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:19,435
I'll pick Joonyoung up on the way.

600
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:21,702
Yes.

601
00:53:25,834 --> 00:53:27,101
You act like you're still newlyweds.

602
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:30,734
My son's staying at my place.

603
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:34,634
Right. You must take care of your son
even if you're divorced.

604
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,968
I didn't know you were such a good dad.

605
00:53:41,234 --> 00:53:43,202
What did you want to see me about?

606
00:53:43,267 --> 00:53:44,101
Oh...

607
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,834
My book concert is just around the corner.

608
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,734
(Communication is the Future)

609
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:54,700
Are you getting ready
for the political scene?

610
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,334
About that...

611
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,901
Can you be my sponsor?

612
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,167
You're the most successful person
among our alumni.

613
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:04,467
You'll do it, right?

614
00:54:05,267 --> 00:54:06,201
I'm not sure.

615
00:54:06,734 --> 00:54:08,801
I have a new movie coming up.

616
00:54:08,868 --> 00:54:11,202
I also have to focus on Joonyoung.

617
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,800
I'm not sure if I can find the time.

618
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:14,702
You don't have to make time.

619
00:54:14,801 --> 00:54:17,702
I'll put your name in.
You just have to show up.

620
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:20,101
If you want me in,
I want to be in all the way.

621
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,934
I won't be of much help
unless I do my best.

622
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,534
I don't want you to resent me later on.

623
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:28,768
So I'd rather not do it at all.

624
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,134
What's wrong?

625
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,768
Do you need permission
from your father-in-law?

626
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:42,968
Let me give you a word
of advice as a friend.

627
00:54:45,267 --> 00:54:47,267
You should watch your language
in front of your kid.

628
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,834
You know our sons are friends.

629
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:51,767
Did it not occur to you that
Joonyoung would hear about it?

630
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:54,068
That was between the kids.
Why are you bringing that up?

631
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:57,233
You should've been more careful
since the kids are involved.

632
00:54:57,934 --> 00:54:58,902
Don't you think so?

633
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:02,934
I know. Part of it was Sunwoo's fault.

634
00:55:03,234 --> 00:55:04,634
But I'm a little disappointed.

635
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,100
My son's feelings were hurt.

636
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,767
Don't make it troublesome for all of us.

637
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:17,200
Go ask Chairman Yeo yourself.

638
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:20,168
It's Mr. Yeo you want. Not me.

639
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:23,268
-Taeoh.
-Let's not stoop so low.

640
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:26,402
You want to be a politician, don't you?

641
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:28,401
Stop embarrassing yourself.

642
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:38,102
How's Dakyung doing?

643
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:40,334
I thought she'd be upset,

644
00:55:40,434 --> 00:55:42,135
but she looked lively.

645
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,334
She wants to be the bigger person.

646
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,200
Oh well.

647
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,901
To avoid any further issues
with that woman,

648
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:52,001
maybe it's better that way.

649
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:56,467
You should check in on her often
to see if she's okay.

650
00:55:56,734 --> 00:56:00,368
It won't be easy for her
to raise a boy...

651
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,601
...when she has no experience.

652
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:04,601
You look awesome.

653
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:05,767
That's my boy.

654
00:58:06,801 --> 00:58:08,735
You look so good.

655
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:11,167
I knew it would look good.

656
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,867
Your brother looks great.

657
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:20,867
Here.

658
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:22,401
Do you like it?

659
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:34,201
I guess it looks okay.

660
00:58:38,934 --> 00:58:39,902
You look great.

661
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,334
We should've bought that.

662
00:59:01,801 --> 00:59:03,168
It looked good on you.

663
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:05,167
Why did you turn it down?

664
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,068
Maybe it's not his style.

665
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,567
Sorry. I didn't know.

666
00:59:11,234 --> 00:59:13,367
Next time, I'll choose
something that's your style.

667
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,367
Can you please get along with Dakyung?

668
00:59:38,834 --> 00:59:40,735
She wants to be your friend.

669
00:59:43,334 --> 00:59:44,501
Do I have to?

670
00:59:45,934 --> 00:59:47,967
Do I have to suck up to her
if I want to stay here?

671
00:59:48,968 --> 00:59:51,235
No, that's not what I meant.

672
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,101
We're family.

673
00:59:55,701 --> 00:59:58,168
How could you think that I'm her family?

674
00:59:58,234 --> 00:59:59,868
I think that's too much.

675
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,667
If she's not your family,

676
01:00:02,701 --> 01:00:04,135
then what is she to you?

677
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,767
If that's how you're going to be,

678
01:00:07,534 --> 01:00:09,301
things will get awkward in the house.

679
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,134
If you don't want me here, just say it.

680
01:00:12,601 --> 01:00:13,768
I can leave anytime.

681
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:36,801
Sunwoo.

682
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:39,634
Is it too late?

683
01:00:41,067 --> 01:00:42,501
You're welcome anytime.

684
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:44,501
Come on in.

685
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:52,501
Have you decided where to go?

686
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:55,635
Seoul.

687
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,934
I'm going to stay close to my parents.

688
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,467
You said they won't approve
your divorce that easily.

689
01:01:01,801 --> 01:01:03,635
I guess your parents have a soft spot.

690
01:01:04,634 --> 01:01:07,535
"Our no-good daughter disappointed us."

691
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:09,534
That's what they're thinking.

692
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:19,334
Should I get out of this city too?

693
01:01:21,734 --> 01:01:22,867
Does Joonyoung...

694
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,867
...want to live with his dad?

695
01:01:25,868 --> 01:01:27,068
Actually...

696
01:01:30,267 --> 01:01:32,068
I saw Joonyoung today.

697
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:36,601
He was never like that
when he was with me.

698
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,567
But when I saw him there,

699
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,801
his life looked perfect somehow.

700
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:46,568
Even his face looked comfortable.

701
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:50,468
They looked like a real family.

702
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:54,867
I can't...

703
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,600
...fill that emptiness in him.

704
01:01:58,968 --> 01:01:59,836
Right.

705
01:02:01,067 --> 01:02:02,968
He's a big boy.

706
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:06,302
You have to respect his opinion.

707
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:09,767
Just let him stay there
if that's what he wants.

708
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:13,268
Be honest.

709
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:17,035
Don't you need a break too?

710
01:02:19,267 --> 01:02:21,034
Remember what you told me last time?

711
01:02:23,067 --> 01:02:24,901
Even after your divorce,

712
01:02:24,968 --> 01:02:27,402
that vicious circle just won't end.

713
01:02:29,934 --> 01:02:31,301
The way I see it,

714
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,001
both of you have been clinging on to it.

715
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:39,467
You must end that vicious circle.

716
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:41,901
In order to do that...

717
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:44,101
...one of you must leave this city.

718
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:46,834
That would be the best option.

Jehyuk...

720
01:02:58,267 --> 01:03:00,135
He seems to come by often.

721
01:03:01,701 --> 01:03:02,701
I don't know.

722
01:03:03,501 --> 01:03:05,302
I wonder what's gotten into him.

723
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:08,068
He's so annoying.

724
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,968
Maybe he wants to start over?

725
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:15,434

Let's go have lunch.

What were you looking at?

735
01:04:16,434 --> 01:04:20,534
Come on. I want a look. What is it?

736
01:04:20,634 --> 01:04:22,368
I was checking out shopping malls.

737
01:04:22,434 --> 01:04:24,101
What shopping mall?

738
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:31,668
Dr. Kim, take Dr. Seol for lunch.

739
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,101
Aren't you going to eat?

740
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:36,300
I'm expecting a call from a patient.
I'm going to eat later.

741
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,434
She looks depressed
since Joonyoung left.

How many times do you
worry about her in a day?

743
01:04:49,033 --> 01:04:50,700
I worry about you too, Dr. Seol.

744
01:04:52,968 --> 01:04:54,569
So we're both just co-workers to you?

745
01:04:54,634 --> 01:04:56,068
Do you expect me to believe that?

746
01:04:58,434 --> 01:05:00,801
Is there a chance for something more?

747
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:02,834
What do you think, Dr. Seol?

748
01:05:03,868 --> 01:05:06,235
Taeoh is all she thinks about.

749

Even if hatred is the
only feeling that's left,

750
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,367
there's no place in her heart
for someone else.

751
01:05:13,834 --> 01:05:15,001
Not yet anyway.

752
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,600
But you never know what
could happen in the future.

753

What are these?

773
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:02,167
You want to send Joonyoung
abroad for study?

774
01:09:02,234 --> 01:09:04,168
Is that why you wanted to bring him?

775
01:09:04,634 --> 01:09:05,568
Why not?

776
01:09:05,834 --> 01:09:07,967
It's a good opportunity for him.

777
01:09:09,334 --> 01:09:11,634
I brought him because
I wanted him to be here.

778
01:09:12,734 --> 01:09:16,001
He came here to live with me.
I'm not sending him anywhere!

779
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:23,835
Think about how this would make him feel.

she did that to get custody?

788

it'll be much better if he studies

You can't just put it back together.

810
01:11:46,334 --> 01:11:48,501
I can't live without her.

811
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:50,668
What else can I do?

812
01:11:50,968 --> 01:11:52,001
I have to do something.

813
01:11:52,067 --> 01:11:53,668
It's like a habit.

814
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:57,034
You feel comfortable
because you're used to it.

815
01:11:59,434 --> 01:12:01,768
That's right. I'm used to it.

816
01:12:01,968 --> 01:12:04,469
But after I lost what I had,

817
01:12:06,133 --> 01:12:08,700
I realized that love isn't
just about animal attraction.

818
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:12,135
I regret it so much.

01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:19,134
The things you can't live without.

821
01:12:21,701 --> 01:12:23,302
Turns out that's love.

822
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,135
She left me because I made a mistake.

823
01:12:36,501 --> 01:12:37,768
But I won't give her up.

824

I don't want to live in regret like you.

825
01:12:47,734 --> 01:12:49,801
Do you think I'm regretting it?

01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:13,001
Who's that? Your wife?

830
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:15,668
It's Sunwoo.

831
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:25,235
By the way,

832
01:13:26,467 --> 01:13:28,667
Sunwoo is thinking about leaving town.

833
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:28,768
He probably couldn't take everything
since he was in a rush.

834
01:14:29,467 --> 01:14:32,968
Tell him to call me if he
needs anything else.

835
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,834
Are you really leaving?

836
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:43,668
I'm thinking about it.

837
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:45,934
Why?

838
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:50,435
It's what you wanted.

839
01:14:54,834 --> 01:14:55,834
Right.

840
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:00,967
I'll talk it over with Joonyoung,

841
01:15:03,067 --> 01:15:04,534
I'll leave if he wants me to.

842
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:12,934
Can I entrust him to you?

843
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,601
At first, I thought he didn't
want me to worry about him.

844
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,600
But maybe he really wants me to leave.

845
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:35,601
The other kids are gossiping about me.

846
01:15:36,467 --> 01:15:37,767
I'm sure he's embarrassed of me.

847
01:15:40,033 --> 01:15:41,600
And I'm sure he's fed up with me.

848
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:46,834
I should keep my distance.

849
01:15:53,734 --> 01:15:55,468
But if Joonyoung changes his mind,

850
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:58,234
I will come and get him.

851
01:16:00,234 --> 01:16:01,068
Okay.

852
01:16:02,534 --> 01:16:03,502
You can do that.

853
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:12,334
Would you like a glass?

854
01:16:59,734 --> 01:17:01,168
How's your marriage working out?

855
01:17:04,434 --> 01:17:06,101
Do you still love her?

856
01:17:07,801 --> 01:17:09,235
You tell me.

857
01:17:12,033 --> 01:17:13,934
What did marriage mean to you?

858
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,601
And what was love?

859
01:17:23,534 --> 01:17:25,068
To me, marriage...

860
01:17:30,334 --> 01:17:31,701
...was just an illusion.

861
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,934
My home...

862
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:40,201
The stable foundation of my life...

863
01:17:44,033 --> 01:17:47,333
I thought no one could take what's mine.

864
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:51,901
Love was the start of that illusion,

865
01:17:54,734 --> 01:17:56,501
and it ended in pain.

866
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,400
It could've ended as a fling.

867
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,067
If only you had given me a pass...

868
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,267
You still blame me for what happened?

869
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:12,435
I've...

870
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:15,268
...given it some thought.

871
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:19,868
If only you had given me
another chance back then...

872
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:25,434
...what would have happened?

873
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:32,334
You need to leave. It's late.

874
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:34,834
If I told you that I regret
marrying her...

875
01:18:36,767 --> 01:18:39,067
If I told you that marriage
turned out to be nothing...

876
01:18:41,067 --> 01:18:42,634
Would that be enough?

877
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:48,901
The moment when love became marriage,
it wasn't the same anymore.

878
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,134
And I'm fed up with it.

879
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:54,567
If I put it that way...

880
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,067
Will you tell me the truth?

881
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,800
-What truth?
-Tell me you regret what you did.

882
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,168
Not forgiving me,

883
01:19:11,367 --> 01:19:14,001
pushing me away
and making me the bad guy!

884
01:19:15,534 --> 01:19:17,268
Tell me you regret it all.

885
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:23,334
Tell me you still have feelings for me.

886
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,901
You psycho.

887
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,734
What else can it be?

888
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,667
Why did you fake that alibi for me?

889
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:36,234
Why did you lie for me!

890
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:41,501
Be careful.

891
01:19:42,934 --> 01:19:45,134
You could end up like me...

892
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,567
...one day.

893
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:53,900
You're drunk. Go home.

894
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:59,502
Weren't you waiting for me to come back?

895
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:01,600
Don't you want me to get on my knees...

896
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:02,935
...and beg you to take me back?

897
01:20:04,334 --> 01:20:06,668
Isn't that what you were hoping for?

898
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,767
-Get out, now.
-You've been using Joonyoung...

899
01:20:08,868 --> 01:20:10,968
...as an excuse to stay here!

900
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,234
Even at this moment, you're dying...

901
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:19,001
...to be in my arms.

902
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,868
Am I wrong?

903
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,500
-You're crazy.
-Tell me I'm wrong.

904
01:20:35,801 --> 01:20:36,968
Can you really deny that?

905
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:32,934
(Calling "Husband"...)

906
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,300
(Incoming call: Wife)

907
01:22:00,367 --> 01:22:01,235
Do you...

908
01:22:03,067 --> 01:22:04,200
...want me to come back?

909
01:22:07,067 --> 01:22:07,901
No.

910
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,434
You hold on to that marriage.

911
01:22:41,801 --> 01:22:44,435
(The World of the Married)

912
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:49,067
It all went wrong from
the divorce, didn't it?

913
01:22:49,133 --> 01:22:51,300
Did you have to ask that?
He's on his way to school.

914
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:55,235
This is not a common teenage problem.

915
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:57,868
Can I see Joonyoung right now?

916
01:22:58,033 --> 01:22:59,600
It's already over between you two.

917
01:22:59,734 --> 01:23:02,235
You put each other through hell.

918
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:04,068
Why did you two meet up again?

919
01:23:04,133 --> 01:23:08,233
You can try to bury the hatchet,
but that won't solve the problem.

920
01:23:08,334 --> 01:23:10,135
You're a doctor so you should know.

921
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,901
Kleptomania should be
treated by a specialist.

922
01:23:13,033 --> 01:23:16,333
Don't leave too fast.

923
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:17,402
Can you really...

924
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,500
.., raise our son well without me?
