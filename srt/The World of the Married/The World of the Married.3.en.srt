(The World of the Married)

3
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,768
Didn't you miss me?

4
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:48,500
I haven't seen you in a while.
Can you smile?

5
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:50,335
If that's all you want to say,
then leave.

6
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,669
I'm busy. I have to go in now.

7
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:58,701
Shall we get married?

8
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:05,500
You don't have to feel responsible.

9
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,834
I needed some time to prepare this.

10
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:01,168
You know I can't live without you.

11
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,867
Let's get married.

12
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:16,502
Sunwoo.

13
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,467
I'll make you and our baby happy.

14
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,767
I'm not doing this because
I feel responsible for the baby.

15
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,101
It's because I love you, Ji Sunwoo.

16
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,867
Whatever happens next,

17
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,101
I want to be there for you.

18
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:40,034
Let's live together.

19
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,335
Dakyung.

20
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:50,800
Dakyung!

21
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,268
Dakyung!

22
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:14,068
What were you thinking?

23
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:17,234
What are you trying to gain by letting
Taeoh know about her pregnancy?

24
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,101
He should know as the father.

25
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:25,568
It's his responsibility to take.

26
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,635
What if he does want to
take responsibility?

27
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,535
Are you going to divorce him?

28
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:33,034
Do you want me to do that?

29
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:36,301
I'm just worried about you.

30
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,734
Don't worry.

31
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,768
I'll decide whether to keep it or not.

32
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,100
Okay.

33
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,535
I'll leave it up to you.

34
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:49,934
The fact that I'm pregnant
is not important.

35
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:53,135
I won't use that as an excuse
to make you stay with me.

36
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:55,767
Don't be mistaken.

37
00:04:57,767 --> 00:05:00,201
What is it that you want to confirm?

38
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,801
I want to see Taeoh making a choice.

39
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,701
Not for the sake of
our marriage or Joonyoung.

40
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,134
I want him to choose me.

41
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,601
What matters is...

42
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,235
...whether you love me or not.

43
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:19,168
What's the point of staying married
if he doesn't choose me?

44
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:22,836
Right?

45
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,634
I guess...

46
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:29,968
Taeoh wouldn't choose her
unless he's out of his mind.

47
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:33,701
I'm sure he'll break up with her.

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,567
You know it, too.

49
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,101
I can't live without you.

50
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,467
I'm sick of hiding.

51
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,435
From now on, I'll call you
whenever I want to.

52
00:05:58,534 --> 00:05:59,634
I'll call you often.

53
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,435
I'll see you when I want to see you.

54
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:02,567
Sure.

55
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,867
If you ever hang up on me again...

56
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:07,402
...it's over between us.

57
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,667
I won't do it again.

58
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,367
I promise.

59
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,233
Trust me.

60
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,134
Okay?

61
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,367
Prove it.

62
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,867
(Episode Three)

63
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:54,936
Her CRP level has increased.

64
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,200
And her blood pressure is bad.

65
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,901
I believe you're giving her fentanyl.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,434
I'm giving her maximum dosage.
I can't give her more.

67
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:03,068
She could suffer cardiac arrest,

68
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,768
or lose consciousness.

69
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:06,535
Is there another way?

70
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,901
You know it, too.

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,200
We've done everything we could.

72
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:21,767
Hey...

73
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,801
Sorry that you had to come
all the way here...

74
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,934
...when you're busy.

75
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,700
Should I ask Taeoh to drop by?

76
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,634
It's fine.

77
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,567
There's nothing he can do anyway.

78
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:41,901
No need to make him worry.

79
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,800
I'll leave after you fall asleep.

80
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,502
Men...

81
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,302
If you embrace them
with a generous heart...

82
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,134
...they will come to their senses one day.

83
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:07,202
You and Joonyoung...

84
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:11,967
...mean everything to Taeoh.

85
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,534
So...

86
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,001
Even if I die...

87
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,234
Please...

88
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,567
...take good care of Taeoh.

89
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:27,168
Mother.

90
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,567
Visiting hour is over, Doctor.

91
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,033
The patient needs to rest.

92
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:06,734
(Family Love Hospital)

93
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:16,936
You're back.

94
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:25,867
Wash your hands.

95
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:27,469
And tell Joonyoung to come down.

96
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:55,867
I forgot to wear this.

97
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,367
Grease stains can't be removed.

98
00:11:02,934 --> 00:11:05,334
Thank you. I'll be careful.

99
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,001
You said something urgent came up.

100
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,135
Did you take care of it?

101
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,867
How long are you going to fool her?

102
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,101
You have to come clean with Sunwoo
and end your affair.

103
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,701
It's over for me the moment
Sunwoo finds out.

104
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:35,368
She will ask for a divorce.
How can I tell her?

105
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,234
And she'll never let me see Joonyoung.

106
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,401
I can't imagine my life without Sunwoo.

107
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:45,268
Then break up with Dakyung
as soon as possible.

108
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,034
Never mind.

109
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,001
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

110
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:56,767
I don't understand what's
so complicated about it.

111
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,068
When I'm with her...

112
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,235
I feel alive.

113
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,300
She gives me inspirations.

114
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,234
She's dear to my heart.

115
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:19,568
I love her.

116
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:23,435
- What about Sunwoo?
- Of course I love Sunwoo.

117
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,268
Are you kidding me?

118
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,368
Sometimes, the heart wants more.

119
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,734
It's not like your love switch
goes off after you're married.

120
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:37,702
I feel a different kind of love for
Sunwoo than I do for Dakyung.

121
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,501
The craziest part is...

122
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,734
...I'm in love with both of them
at the same time.

123
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,901
You're so full of it.

124
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:52,302
How can you love both of them
at the same time?

125
00:12:54,634 --> 00:12:57,368
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- It's hard to understand, right?

126
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,034
You don't think it's possible, right?

127
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,834
You would never understand
unless you've experienced it.

128
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,235
I love both of them...

129
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:07,834
...with all my heart.

130
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:12,302
So what?

131
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,168
Will you keep this going?

132
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:26,135
Yes.

133
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:29,634
It's been taken care of.

134
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I felt bad about rushing out this morning.

135
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:41,934
Come to think of it,

136
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:46,001
you had every right to be suspicious.

137
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,367
I've been distant, haven't I?

138
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,501
I'll try to be a better husband.

139
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:58,501
I won't upset you again.

140
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,501
Are you sure I have nothing
to worry about?

141
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:06,601
Absolutely not.

142
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:10,268
You have absolutely nothing...

143
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:11,934
...to worry about.

144
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:08,702
Yes.

145
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,634
You're in a favorable position.

146
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:16,101
If he doesn't know that
you're aware of his affair,

147
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,801
then it's better for our side.

148
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,468
Things are looking good for us.

149
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,634
Have you obtained enough
evidence to prove his infidelity?

150
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,168
No.

151
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:29,135
Not yet.

152
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:35,934
If you can obtain material evidence
of their infidelity,

153
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,801
then it's' game over.

154
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:42,834
For example... Underwear, condom,
or a photo of their love nest?

155
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:49,968
Please don't consult
with private detectives.

156
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,867
The court will reject
any illegally obtained evidence.

157
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:57,035
And you could face a countersuit for
violating the Information Network Law...

158
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,967
...and Communications Privacy Act.

159
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,701
-Pardon?
-Using hidden cameras...

160
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:05,669
...or tracking devices
would be a bad idea.

161
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:08,368
You could face criminal punishment.

162
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,901
Then...

163
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,533
What should I do?

164
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:18,535
You can tail your husband
in public places.

165
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,869
Take as many photos as you can.

166
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:23,634
A photo of them entering a hotel...

167
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,034
...would be the icing on the cake.

168
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,567
If you fail to take a photo,

169
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:31,501
we can get a court order to secure
the hotel surveillance footage...

170
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:32,868
...as evidence.

171
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:35,868
You want me...

172
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:40,034
...to tail him myself?

173
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,901
If you find that difficult,

174
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:45,634
you can try going through
his cellphone and PC.

175
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,301
They could've exchanged explicit photos,

176
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,268
or left a video of their intercourse.

177
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,901
I've seen people who does that.

178
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,734
I need to think it over.

179
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,134
Are you sure about the divorce?

180
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:38,268
Once you see your husband
making love to another woman,

181
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,668
things will never be the same again.

182
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:44,268
Think carefully before you decide.

183
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:48,168
Will you keep your marriage
despite your husband's infidelity?

184
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,201
Or...

185
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,467
...will you divorce him for good?

How was it like when your
parents got divorced?

193
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,735
They were super noisy.

194
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,701
They screamed and threw stuffs.

195
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,767

Why do you keep talking to me?

00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,068
I kept hitting the wrong notes
because of you.

200
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:28,934

203
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,500
Do I seem okay?

204
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,233
I guess you look all right.

205
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,501
That's right.

206
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,535
If they quiet down during a fight,

207
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,734
it won't lead to a divorce, right?

208
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,202
Why are you curious about that?

209
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:10,669
Or they could be acting cool
when they're in front of you.

210
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,634
Aren't you uncomfortable
staying at a motel?

211
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,734
It's all right.

212
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,034
I've gotten used to it.

213
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,800
What about your boyfriend?

214
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,101
Is he still giving you trouble?

215
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:57,868
I haven't heard from him.

216
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:01,567

217

How's your thing going?

220
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:27,834
I'm pondering...

221
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:30,435
...very carefully.

222
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:33,168
Are you going to keep pondering
and let it fizzle out?

223
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,534
Like I've said before,

224
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,567
divorce is not an easy decision.

225
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:45,535

No.

232
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,900
That will never happen.

233
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,468
I hope you don't have to use me.

234
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,035
But just in case.

235

He cheated on his wife.

00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:51,635
I'm not sure if his promise
is trustworthy.

He's been serious since
we've met two years ago.

251

If you're so confident,

252
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,867
why would you wait
for two more months?

253
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,400
Because I trust him.

254
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,634
I wouldn't have taken it this far
if I didn't have confidence in him.

Taeoh is still seeing that woman, right?

I'm not sure.

258
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,335
...Sunwoo knows.

259
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:54,402
Are you sure?

260
00:26:54,801 --> 00:27:00,168
Men can't hide their mistresses
from their wives forever.

261
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:04,634
That's how powerful women's intuition is.

262

That's spooky.

284
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,702
Have you made your decision?

285
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:56,502
First... Check his financial situation.

286
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:07,502

Have you been busy at work?

290
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:24,034
I'm going to make time
to come by from now on.

291
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:26,901
I feel bad for leaving everything
up to my husband.

292
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:32,035
You cannot let your husband know
until you confirm everything.

293
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,901

there's nothing to settle.

297
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:49,300
But you are behind on interest payments.

298
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:51,900
What?

299
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:55,768
I mean...

300
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,834
...the interest from the mortgage loan.

301
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,201
It's been overdue for
four months now.

302
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,534
I thought you came by to settle that.

303
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:15,168
He got a mortgage loan?

304
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:18,534
When?

305
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:23,467
It's already been three years.

306
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,801
He said you were busy,

307
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:30,135
so he brought a seal and the
power of attorney....

308
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:31,801
...to process the mortgage request.

309
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:35,634
That process is illegal now,

310
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,168
but a power of attorney was
enough back then.

311
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:44,868
He said he already discussed
all the details with you.

312
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:46,868
So we processed the request.

313
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:50,134
No wonder he looked so
tormented these days.

314
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,668
Now I know why.

315
00:30:55,701 --> 00:30:58,035
I guess he couldn't tell me
because he felt guilty.

Mom.

334
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:25,868
Mom?

335
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:31,901
What are you doing?

336
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:33,435
Well...

337
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,334
I was looking for something.

338
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,568
Noeul said she hated saying
goodbye to her friends.

339
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:53,901
What are you saying?

340
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:56,200
She had to transfer here...

341
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,167
...because her parents got divorced.

342
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,335
I would hate it too.

343
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,635
If you and Dad got divorced.

344
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:12,801
I don't want to change schools.

345
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:15,501
I don't want to move.

346
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:22,401
I'm just saying.

347
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:13,534
I have to work overtime.

348
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:16,101
I have a screenplay to work on.

349
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,068
Don't wait up for me.

350
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,800
(Video)

351
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:17,635
Once you see your husband
making love to another woman,

352
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,001
things will never be the same again.

353
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:58,735
Sunwoo.

354
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:12,934
What are you doing here
at this hour?

355
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:15,233
Is something wrong?

356
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:21,501
I was curious why you had to...

357
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:24,168
...work late all of a sudden.

358
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:32,135
Are you...

359
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:36,834
Are you okay?

360
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:39,700
Have you had dinner?

361
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:42,902
Do you want me to
get you some coffee?

362
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,801
We just had some.

363
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:46,834
But...

364
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,567
Are you really okay?

365
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:56,101
Sunwoo.

366
00:42:07,968 --> 00:42:10,469
Sorry for interrupting you.

367
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,167
What brings you here?

368
00:43:30,033 --> 00:43:31,634
What should I do?

369
00:43:37,634 --> 00:43:40,135
I guess you've already figured it out.

370
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,967
That Taeoh is seeing another woman.

371
00:43:46,434 --> 00:43:47,634
Sunwoo...

372
00:43:47,934 --> 00:43:50,401
-I was...
-You knew everything,

373
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:53,434
and you asked me to take care of him?

374
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,168
How could you...

375
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,635
...do that to me?

376
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:01,968
I told him not to tell you,

377
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,767
and end his affair.

378
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:07,667
Taeoh said he will.

379
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:11,301
What more can I do?

380
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:19,102
It's too late.

381
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:22,501
That woman got pregnant.

382
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:30,168
He said he will...

383
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,669
...protect his family no matter what.

384
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:34,602
He promised me.

385
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:36,300
He said...

386
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:40,534
...he would never abandon his child
like his father did.

387
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:43,567
You just have to stay strong.

388
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,734
He made one mistake.

389
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,101
It'll all pass if you forgive him
and embrace him.

390
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:52,467
"One mistake"?

391
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:57,401
You resented your husband
for your whole life.

392
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:59,767
How could you talk to me
about forgiveness?

393
00:44:59,868 --> 00:45:03,001
You're a mother too.

394
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:06,568
If Joonyoung did the same thing,

395
00:45:07,234 --> 00:45:09,534
would you have made a different choice?

396
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:13,100
Think about your child's future.

397
00:45:13,901 --> 00:45:16,368
You should forgive for his sake.

398
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:23,968
He went around my back
and got a mortgage loan.

399
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:27,769
He even laid his hands on
his son's insurance money.

400
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:31,068
How do you expect me to forgive him?

401
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,101
I wanted him to keep being
a father to my son.

402
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:42,367
But I changed my mind
after listening to you.

403
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:45,968
If I forgive, Joonyoung will
grow up to be just like him!

404
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:46,867
Hey.

405
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:48,535
Sunwoo...

406
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:51,101
- Please.
- I'm going to divorce him.

407
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:53,602
I will kick him out
and leave him broke.

408
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,268
I'll make sure he never sets
foot in this town again.

409
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,267
He will never see Joonyoung again.

410
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:01,768
This is a promise.

411
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:11,101
My son got tired of living
with someone perfect like you!

412
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:17,802
Why do you think Taeoh did that?

413
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:23,034
He wouldn't have cheated on you
if you had given him some space!

414
00:46:25,634 --> 00:46:26,535
So...

415
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:32,301
Is it my fault?

416
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,568
Is that what you're saying?

417
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:39,934
My son spent his life in tears....

418
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,701
...for not having a father.

419
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:49,634
And now you want to take
his son away from him?

420
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:54,001
I will not stand by and watch.

421
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,067
Divorce him after I die.

422
00:46:58,234 --> 00:46:59,935
If you want a divorce...

423
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,901
Kill me first!

424
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,901
You can't die, Mother.

425
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,368
You must see for yourself...

426
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:59,368
...how Taeoh's life crashes and burns.

427
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:09,801
Right here on this bed.

428
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:39,469
(Health Examination Result)

429
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:50,202
You look thin.

430
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:51,768
Is something wrong?

431
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,768
Your blood-cholesterol is a little high.

432
00:49:59,234 --> 00:50:01,001
And there are signs of fatty liver.

433
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:13,701
You don't have to take medicine,
but it should not be left untreated.

434
00:50:13,801 --> 00:50:15,868
You have to improve your diet first.

435
00:50:16,434 --> 00:50:18,168
And exercise regularly.

436
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,101
Would golf work?

437
00:50:24,434 --> 00:50:28,501
No. You need to break sweat
at least two to three times a week.

438
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:30,200
This is embarrassing.

439
00:50:30,834 --> 00:50:32,735
You must think I'm unattractive.

440
00:50:32,968 --> 00:50:34,635
You're in pretty good shape
for a man in his 40s.

441
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:36,401
That's a relief.

442
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,100
Why do you get checkups
from another hospital?

443
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,967
We have pretty good packages here.

444
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:45,268
It takes some courage to come here.

445
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:46,968
If I face you...

446
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:49,434
...wearing only a robe
without an underwear,

447
00:50:49,534 --> 00:50:51,001
I would feel weird.

448
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:03,734
Is it because of Taeoh?

449
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,934
-What about Taeoh?
-Nothing.

450
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:08,868
It's just...

451
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,734
It seems like he can't find
an investor for his project.

452
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,801
I was wondering if you're
concerned about him.

453
00:51:16,734 --> 00:51:18,301
Is the company...

454
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,434
...low on finance?

455
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:24,401
You make it hard for me to answer
with that deadpan expression.

456
00:51:25,367 --> 00:51:29,834
I don't like him that much,
but he's still my client.

457
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:34,168
Just like the doctor-patient
confidentiality,

458
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:37,601
an accountant cannot disclose
any information about his client.

459
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:44,668
I'll call you when
the blood test results are in.

460
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:51,535
Have a nice day.

461
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,868
Call me anytime if you need
a drinking buddy.

462
00:52:05,234 --> 00:52:07,367
I can give you some counseling.

463
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,234
Why didn't you answer your phone?

464
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:26,201
I was seeing a patient. Why?

465
00:52:26,801 --> 00:52:28,402
I got a call from Taeoh.

466
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:31,001
He's going to his mother.

467
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:34,368
He wants you to come right now.

468
00:52:39,234 --> 00:52:40,901
Mom...

469
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,234
We will hold the funeral
at Love Hospital's funeral hall.

470
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:24,667
We'll send a vehicle...

471
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:29,001
The receiver is unavailable.
Please leave a voice message.

472
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,735
You will be charged after the beep.

473
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,068
(Lee Taeoh)

474
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:46,068
-We don't have to go.
-Gosh!

475
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:48,200
- Enough already!
- Okay, okay.

476
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,534
My gosh.

477
00:53:52,434 --> 00:53:54,901
- Dakyung!
- What brings you here?

478
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:56,168
Are you going somewhere?

479
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:59,734
We don't have to,
but your mother's so enthusiastic.

480
00:54:00,868 --> 00:54:03,068
We got the news
from the alumni association.

481
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:05,367
How can we ignore that?

482
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:09,135
Dr. Ji Sunwoo's mother-in-law
has passed away.

483
00:54:11,868 --> 00:54:13,402
We'll be right back.

484
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,568
You should crash here tonight, sweetie.

485
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:18,601
- Have some chicken and beer with me.
- Okay.

486
00:54:18,701 --> 00:54:20,834
- Oh for god's sake!
- Let's hurry.

487
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:22,901
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

488
00:54:52,534 --> 00:54:54,634
Your table's in room number three.

489
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:58,801
(Our condolences for your loss,
from Son Jehyuk Accounting Firm)

490
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,001
This way.

491
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:07,901
Hello.

492
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:11,667
I thought she was in good health
at the nursing home.

493
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:14,367
I know. It happened so fast.

494
00:55:14,834 --> 00:55:17,101
I don't mean to speak ill
of the deceased,

495
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,567
but Sunwoo has one less
thing to be burdened about.

496
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:21,001
I guess you're right.

497
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,234
She was hospitalized around the time
when Joonyoung started walking.

498
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,767
Since then, the money
for surgery, hospital,

499
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:29,134
caretakers and the
nursing home...

500
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:31,434
...were taken care of by Sunwoo.

501
00:55:31,634 --> 00:55:32,435
Hey.

502
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,400
When did Taeoh ever earn any money?

503
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:37,434
The house, his company...

504
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,568
It was all built on Sunwoo's money.

505
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:43,634
- Sunwoo is remarkable.
- No doubt.

506
00:55:44,267 --> 00:55:45,534
Still...

507
00:55:46,701 --> 00:55:48,935
We shouldn't badmouth
Taeoh on a day like this.

508
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:52,035
Or his mother won't rest in peace.

509
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:56,335
You have matured, Jehyuk.

510
00:56:04,968 --> 00:56:05,936
Then...

511
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:08,101
Thank you.

512
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:32,034
We're expecting a lot more mourners.

513
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:35,635
You can't stay drunk.

514
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,267
No matter how sad you are,
you shouldn't forget your manners.

515
00:56:40,968 --> 00:56:43,202
Don't break down in front of Joonyoung.

516
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,534
He'll learn from you.

517
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:48,068
Put it on.

518
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:52,035
And straighten your tie.

519
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:54,934
Tidy your shirt.

520
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,200
Dr. Ji?

521
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,100
Hello, sir.

522
00:57:11,534 --> 00:57:12,402
Joonyoung.

523
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:42,067
Oh dear...

524
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:43,935
It must be so hard for you.

525
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:48,469
I'm sure she's at a better place now.

526
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:51,335
Of course.

527
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,302
We think so too.

528
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,234
Thank you.

529
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:56,234
Thank you for coming.

530
00:57:57,067 --> 00:58:00,968

532
00:58:05,601 --> 00:58:06,901
Here you go.

533
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:16,801
Hello.

534
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:18,834
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Mr. Yeo.

535
00:58:18,934 --> 00:58:20,501
-This way.
-You can sit.

536
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:21,667
Please sit down.

537
00:58:29,234 --> 00:58:31,468
His mother was a beautiful woman.

538
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,700
Is that so?

539
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:58,535
Mom.

540
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,033
Are you okay?

541
00:59:03,701 --> 00:59:04,468
Can I...

542
00:59:05,634 --> 00:59:08,001
Can I step outside for some fresh air?

543
00:59:10,033 --> 00:59:12,800
-Okay.
-Will you be okay on your own?

544
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:14,301
Dad's right here.

545
00:59:14,901 --> 00:59:15,869
Go.

546
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:11,401
(Press the button and
take the parking pass)

547
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:54,801
Are you all right?

548
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:01,668
No.

549
01:01:02,234 --> 01:01:03,968
Maybe it's because you're
in the field of culture,

550
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:05,768
you sure think differently.

551
01:01:05,868 --> 01:01:08,569
I love that idea of yours.

552
01:01:08,634 --> 01:01:12,767
If you could help me out
just a little bit...

553
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:14,468
I will consider it.

554
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:16,233
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

555
01:01:16,634 --> 01:01:18,168
He's here.

556
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Can I talk to him?

557
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:23,200
Do you remember the ski resort project
that I've told you about?

558
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:27,967
How about we tear it all down

559
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,801
Mr. Lee was just telling me...

560
01:01:47,901 --> 01:01:49,568
Have you talked to Taeoh?

561
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:55,368
He's still fooling around?

562
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,100
Gosh, that bastard.

563
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:02,501
What if...

564
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:06,401
...I divorce him?

565
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Can you handle the life of a divorcée?

566
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,134
What's the big deal?

567
01:02:16,334 --> 01:02:18,568
Divorce is common these days.

568
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,301
Right, divorce is common these days.

569
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:26,134
But how come a woman rarely
admits that she's a divorcée?

570
01:02:28,067 --> 01:02:31,601
You don't know what it's like
to be a divorcée, do you?

571
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:35,535
Even if it's all Taeoh's fault,
and you've nothing to be ashamed about,

572
01:02:35,801 --> 01:02:38,435
people will still talk behind your back...

573
01:02:38,801 --> 01:02:43,302
...that you must lack something,
or go around meeting men at night.

574
01:02:44,133 --> 01:02:47,367
You were suspicious of Taeoh's secretary
because she's a divorcée.

575
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:50,502
That's what it was like for my mother.

576
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:54,201
She went through all sorts of
absurd rumors as a divorcée...

577
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,534
...and worked hard to raise me.

578
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:58,535
But my father...

579
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:03,934
He married a young woman
and lived very happily.

580
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:06,968
Retribution? Justice?

581
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,235
Those are all lies.

582
01:03:09,334 --> 01:03:13,268
A divorce only leaves the woman miserable.

583
01:03:16,601 --> 01:03:17,801
So...

584
01:03:18,868 --> 01:03:21,635
Think carefully before you decide, okay?

585
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,368
I'll get going.

586
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:51,402
He couldn't have gone far.
Can you wait?

587
01:03:51,467 --> 01:03:52,801
Did he say anything before he left?

588
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:55,634
-I think he's greeting a guest.
-Oh really?

589
01:03:55,734 --> 01:03:57,235
- He should be back soon.
- Sure.

590
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:01,702
- Why not wait a little more?
- It's okay.

591
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:04,667
We should pay our respect first.

592
01:04:04,934 --> 01:04:06,501
-Excuse me.
-Hold on.

Where did my dad go?

595
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:22,302
- Have you seen him?
- What?

596
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,167
Where did Taeoh go?

597
01:04:26,734 --> 01:04:27,501
Taeoh?

598
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:29,668
Can you go outside and look for him?

599
01:04:29,868 --> 01:04:30,836
Okay.

600
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,667

601
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:38,467

Are you...?

I am.

Sure.

Sunwoo...

642

There are two types of men in the world.

666
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:55,135
The cheater...

667
01:17:55,234 --> 01:17:57,001
...and the one who gets caught cheating.

668
01:17:57,801 --> 01:18:01,335
Men aren't the only ones
with instinctive desires.
