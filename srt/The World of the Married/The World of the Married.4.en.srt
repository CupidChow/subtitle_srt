(The World of the Married)

3
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,066
I love you.

4
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,167
You know that, right?

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,101
Yes.

6
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,134
Of course I know.

7
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,033
My son.

8
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,135
My house.

9
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:00,634
My life.

10
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:05,134
I won't let anything of
mine being taken away.

11
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,834
Lee Taeoh is the only thing
I want out of my life.

12
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:14,702
Your house is on collateral.

13
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:17,502
And your bank accounts are
under your husband's company.

14
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:19,834
You're asking for a lot.

15
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,234
I must take it all back...

16
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:26,735
...by any means necessary.

17
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:30,635
If he already siphoned it off
to someone else's account,

18
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,667
you may not get anything back.

19
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,168
All right.

20
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,734
This is the important part.

21
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,102
Divorce is all about confidentiality.

22
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:47,234
Please control your emotions
so your husband doesn't find out.

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,800
You have to deceive him properly.

24
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,767
If you're not up for that,

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,134
you'll have to forgive and move on.

26
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,535
It must be hard for Joonyoung.

27
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,800
He did like his grandmother.

28
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,435
And it's his first time losing
someone close to him.

29
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,800
Don't worry about Joonyoung.
I'll take care of him.

30
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:38,101
You should pull yourself together.

31
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,868
Take it easy at work.

32
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:46,601
I'm worried about your health.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,067
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,367
I'm sorry that I kept accusing you...

35
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,934
...of seeing another woman.

36
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,867
I think I did it because
I love you too much.

37
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:47,035
It's just something that women do.

38
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,035
Sometimes I want to check
if you still love me.

39
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:47,335
Hold on a second.

40
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,034
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:58,701 --> 00:04:59,968
A patient is calling.

42
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:13,801
I'm slowly befriending her.

43
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,368
We spend a lot of time
at each other's houses.

44
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,135
I heard you're very close with Mr. Yeo.

45
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:02,901
So I came to you.

46
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,834
(Episode 4)

47
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:14,168
We found gonorrhea
from your PCR STD test.

48
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,469
You'll be fine as long as
you take antibiotic.

49
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,334
At my age?

50
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:26,068
This is so embarrassing.

51
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,801
Don't be.

52
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:31,434
It's a common disease among adults.

53
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,434
Right?

54
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,567
So it's not necessarily...

55
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,934
...transferred by doing it, right?

56
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:47,736
You mean intercourse?

57
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:55,901
You can get it when your immune system
is weakened by exhaustion and stress,

58
00:07:56,534 --> 00:08:00,567
or at a sauna or a spa.

59
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,435
Right, doctor?

60
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,935
Are you sure I can trust that doctor?

61
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:21,233
You saw her asking me
to help her husband.

62
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,635
She's a quick-witted person.

63
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,834
She'll handle it discreetly.

64
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:26,967
Don't worry.

65
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,434
What?

66
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:32,634
It is very unlikely that it was caused...

67
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,802
...by anything other than intercourse.

68
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,567
99 percent of the times...

69
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,635
...it's passed on through sexual contact.

70
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:45,234
I'm sure it's going well.

71
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,567
Look.

72
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:48,967
(Specialist Ji Sunwoo)

73
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:53,701
Did the doctor explain...

74
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:58,135
Honey.

75
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,001
Thank you for your consultation.

76
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:07,235
Honey...

77
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,635
Honey. Honey!

78
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,967
Honey!

79
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,034
Honey...

80
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,235
I'm a doctor.

81
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:25,001
I have a responsibility
to inform the patient...

82
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:28,135
...about the cause and
treatment of her illness.

83
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:33,934
I don't know why you thought
I'd cover up your friend's affair.

84
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,501
If you're done here,
I wish you a nice day.

85
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:44,067
All right.

86
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,101
I guess I was wrong about you.

87
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:11,702
Say what?

88
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:15,402
It's Mr. Yeo, Dakyung's father.

89
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,200
He's with Sunwoo right now.

90
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,801
It looks like they're having
a serious conversation.

91
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:28,302
I'm not sure what they're
talking about though.

92
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,968
You have principles as a doctor.

93
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,667
I'm sorry if that hurt your pride,

94
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,400
but you're a married woman yourself.

95
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,301
I'm just saying,

96
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:47,467
it could've been much better
to keep her in the dark.

97
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:48,600
I'm not sure.

98
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,801
I personally think that couples
shouldn't keep secrets from each other.

99
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:57,868
Does that mean you know everything
that your husband does?

100
00:10:59,133 --> 00:10:59,967
Yes.

101
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,801
I know everything about my husband.

102
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:06,135
He doesn't know how to keep secrets.

103
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,168
Looks like he's on a short leash.

104
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:14,001
By the way,

105
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:15,902
your daughter...

106
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,035
...is dating someone.

107
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:35,435
Oh dear.

108
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,268
I ended up revealing
your daughter's secret.

109
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,001
I thought it was a serious relationship.

110
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,035
I figured your family already knew.

111
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,635
I'm sure she would've told us
if that was the case.

112
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,233
My Dakyung...

113
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,268
She may be pampered and naive,

114
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:54,902
but she is smart.

115
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,801
Not as smart as you, of course.

116
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,135
-Have a nice day.
-Thank you.

117
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,601
-Mr. Yeo.
-Yeah.

118
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,401
How do you do?

119
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,535
How was the funeral cortege?

120
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:17,934
It went well.

121
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,569
-Cheer up.
-Thank you.

122
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:22,634
Thank you for the talk.

123
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:29,468
Goodbye, sir.

124
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:45,534
-What brings you here?
-Oh... I was just passing by.

125
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,867
What did you talk about with Mr. Yeo?

126
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,735
Why won't you answer me?

127
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,368
Who is he?

128
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,901
Bring him home some time.

129
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:01,367
-We want to meet him.
-Forget it.

130
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:03,368
We're just dating.

131
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:04,767
Someone saw you.

132
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,001
They said you two looked intimate.

133
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,534
Who saw us?

134
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:09,168
Let's drop this.

135
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,368
Just break up with him
if it's not that serious.

136
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:15,135
I'll find a decent man for you.

137
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:17,135
Wait until we fix a blind date.

138
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:18,068
No.

139
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:25,301
What's wrong with you!

140
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:28,767
I convinced your dad
when you insisted to move out.

141
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:31,302
And now your love life is
on everyone's lips.

142
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,401
Don't embarrass me like that.

143
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,801
You know how scary your dad is
when he gets angry.

144
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,867
I'm an adult.

145
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:41,035
Can you respect my privacy, Dad?

146
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:43,201
Dad.

147
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,034
Move back in with us
if you don't want a blind date.

148
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,634
It's not good for a girl to live alone.

149
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:54,702
By the way,

150
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,568
you look like you gained some weight.

151
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,100
Work on your diet.

152
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,434
Hey Mom.

153
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:16,467
-Are you tired?
-I'm fine.

154
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:20,967
-Mom!
-Hey.

155
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,934
Hey!

156
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,135
-Dad!
-Dad!

157
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:34,901
Noeul!

158
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:39,836
Do you need...

159
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:41,834
...a ride home?

160
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:54,868
Thank you.

161
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,001
Isn't it hard...

162
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:09,267
...raising a child by yourself?

163
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,034
What else can I do?

164
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:15,401
We just have to accept things
the way they are.

165
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,034
Does she get uneasy about...

166
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,034
...living apart from her dad?

167
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:25,168
I think she's used to it now.

168
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:27,836
She doesn't ask about him anymore.

169
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,302
Thank you for giving us a ride.

170
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:37,267
Miyeon?

171
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:39,867
Yes?

172
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,302
That night...

173
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:48,301
...when I visited the office.

174
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:51,534
You know why I did that, right?

175
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:59,101
I'm sorry,

176
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,133
but I'm not sure...

177
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,901
what you're talking about.

178
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
I see.

179
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:18,534
It seems like I've wasted your time.

180
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,534
I'll get going now.

181
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,767
-Why did you do that?
-Are you serious?

182
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,868
That's not what I meant.

183
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:57,802
I don't want to talk about it. Get out!

184
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:13,601
I said, get out!

185
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:16,101
I saw your husband leaving.
It seems like they had a fight.

186
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:19,502
I'll find out more.

187
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,567
Is something wrong?

188
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,601
No.

189
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,601
I just feel like drinking.

190
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:41,534
What were you thinking?

191
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:47,201
I'm not upset because
the donation's been cut off.

192
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,567
You should've looked the other way
for the patient's sake!

193
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,468
The patient wanted to know.

194
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,067
-She was my patient.
-Exactly!

195
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:59,534
Didn't you know that her husband
is our biggest sponsor?

196
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:02,268
You know,

197
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:05,802
bringing up your doctor's conscience
as an excuse was overkill.

198
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,268
Be honest. You let empathy get in the way.

199
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:13,701
A woman with a cheating husband.

200
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:21,068
It looked a little risky.

201
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,602
You're the one playing a risky game.

202
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:25,168
What?

203
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:30,300
You're a double spy.

204
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:38,268
When will you stop?

205
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:59,034
I know you're not that kind of person,

206
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:02,867
but a hospital is a crowded place.

207
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:06,734
I came here just to be sure.

208
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:10,268
You know Gosan is a small place.

209
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:11,901
Please make sure...

210
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:16,001
...that our family affair
doesn't leak out.

211
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,634
All patient information will
remain confidential. Don't worry.

212
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:28,335
Do you...

213
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,534
...blame me?

214
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:35,435
Would you have been better off...

215
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:38,901
...not knowing?

216
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,501
I'm not getting a divorce.

217
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,734
Ignorant people might ask...

218
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:49,300
...if I'm tolerating his affair
because of his money.

219
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,002
But why do you think I spent
all those years with him...

220
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:58,268
...if money was the only
thing that mattered?

221
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,402
Is the time you've spent
with him enough...

222
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:10,768
...to forgive him and move on?

223
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:12,769
He was just...

224
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:15,834
...fooling around with a woman.

225
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:19,335
What is there to forgive?

226
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,968
To men,

227
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,067
sex is like excretion.

228
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:31,134
I made him the man he is today.

229
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,367
His background, wealth,

230
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,934
and even his personality.

231
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:37,400
If I divorce him,

232
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:41,868
I'd be wasting everything I've
done for him over the years.

233
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,168
I don't want that.

234
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,734
Please answer my call.

235
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,700
Are you going somewhere?

236
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,535
Yes.

237
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:50,335
Something came up at work.

238
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:52,702
It seems like the staffs can't handle it.

239
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:55,334
At this hour?

240
00:22:55,868 --> 00:22:56,702
I'm sorry.

241
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:59,068
Don't wait up for me.

242
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,334
Enjoy your drink.

243
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:17,900
Thank you.

244
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,867
He just left. Can you check on him?

245
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,734
I'm sorry, but I need to go home early.

246
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:33,934
-Okay.
-Sorry.

247
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,600
(Start Recording)

248
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,834
Hyunseo.

249
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:49,801
A car...

250
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:52,700
...and a flat.

251
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,701
I must say, you're good.

252
00:24:57,601 --> 00:24:59,268
Did you get yourself a sugardaddy?

253
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:00,767
What's wrong with you?

254
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,868
-We've broken up.
-Is that what you thought?

255
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:05,902
I beg to differ.

256
00:25:06,234 --> 00:25:08,367
-I'm not done with you.
-Beat it.

257
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:11,035
Hyunseo.

258
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,534
That crazy lady is
a hospital director after all.

259
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,235
It's her, isn't it?

260
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:20,602
What's up with you two?

261
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,134
Are you dating her?

262
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:27,201
She's just a doctor who treated me.

263
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:30,701
My life has nothing to do with her.
Stay out of it.

264
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,233
Get out of my life.

265
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,335
Are you crazy?

266
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,302
This number cannot be reached...

267
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:32,268
Did something go wrong?

268
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:34,268
Why won't you answer your phone?

269
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:06,469
(Recent Calls)

270
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:09,201
(Lee Taeoh)

271
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:35,567
Hello?

272
00:27:36,634 --> 00:27:37,868
Oh, hey.

273
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,401
You're still awake?

274
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,801
You rushed out in a hurry,
so I got worried.

275
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,034
How did it go?

276
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:53,200
I've taken care of the urgent matter,

277
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:56,535
but I need more time to finish it up.

278
00:27:58,334 --> 00:27:59,835
Will you be working overnight?

279
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,601
I think so.

280
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:07,802
You must be exhausted.

281
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:10,867
Make sure you get some rest.

282
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,234
All right.

283
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:14,902
Thank you.

284
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,033
I love you.

285
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:24,668
Me too.

286
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:12,302
(Did something go wrong?
Why won't you answer your phone?)

287
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:43,868
Sunwoo!

288
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,901
Sunwoo.

289
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,568
You didn't hear me?
What were you thinking?

290
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,167
Just some trivial thoughts.

291
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,868
I guess you just finished work.

292
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:25,467
Is something troubling you?

293
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:26,701
No.

294
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,368
I came out for some exercise.

295
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:34,734
I saw what you saw.

296
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,034
At the parking lot.

297
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,667
I'm so busted.

298
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:46,734
Taeoh got busted all right.

299
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:49,534
Talk about bad timing.

300
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:55,601
What should I do?

301
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,734
How can I help you?

302
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:12,767
Is divorce the answer?

303
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:17,035
I don't know.

304
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,467
Maybe my family will be better off
if I sweep it under the rug.

305
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:29,401
Then how will I live
with all that pent up resentment?

306
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:39,868
I feel like every step I took
in my life was wrong.

307
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:48,166
I wonder...

308
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,801
...if I'm no longer attractive as a woman.

309
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,567
No way.

310
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:01,201
How silly of me.

311
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,335
I feel stupid telling you this.

312
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,334
Whenever you need me.

313
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:09,968
We can go somewhere near for a drink.

314
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:13,700
I'll take a raincheck on that offer.

315
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,467
Thank you, Jehyuk.

316
00:33:18,534 --> 00:33:19,502
You're home late.

317
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,134
Yes, I'm tired.

318
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,067
How about dinner?

319
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,634
Of course I've eaten. Look at the time.

320
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,168
You did great.

321
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:37,968
Come back in two weeks.

322
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,501
Make sure you eat healthy until then.

323
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,335
-Okay, thank you.
-Sure.

324
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:44,235
-Take care.
-Thank you.

325
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,101
I'm looking for Dr. Ji Sunwoo,
the assistant...

326
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,300
There she is.

327
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,267
Should we go inside?

328
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,434
Or should we talk here?

329
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:19,868
Go inside.

330
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,235
Looking for this?

331
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,234
Where's Hyunseo?

332
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,167
Why are you looking for her?

333
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,934
This is what you should be worried about.

334
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:01,934
I have photos of your husband
going into that house...

335
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,400
...right here.

336
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:28,934
How about...

337
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:30,702
...a fair trade?

338
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,434
This is a hospital.

339
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:36,034
-What do you think you're doing?
-My point exactly.

340
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,734
Who would look bad if we raise
our voices in here?

341
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:48,101
What do you want?

342
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:55,335
20 million?

343
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:58,168
No?

344
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:00,300
Let's make it 30 million then.

345
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,935
I'm not giving money
to some punk like you.

346
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,235
You have until next week.

347
00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:15,235
Or everyone will know that
you hired someone...

348
00:36:16,868 --> 00:36:18,535
...to tail your husband.

349
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:27,768
Min Hyunseo...

350
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,367
Is she safe?

351
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:31,935
Why?

352
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:34,001
Do you think I locked her up or something?

353
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,634
Hyunseo...

354
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:39,201
...can't stand you.

355
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,300
She wants this to be the last payment.

356
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:46,768
You have until next week.

357
00:37:05,634 --> 00:37:07,734
You've ensured us that you will
get the evidence.

358
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,300
What happened?

359
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,601
I don't think you're fit to lead this war.

360
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,300
You might as well forget
about the divorce.

361
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:19,301
It's better not to do it at all.

362
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:38,001
Dr. Ji?

363
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:42,334
What is it?

364
00:37:42,968 --> 00:37:45,135
I think these are from your husband.

365
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:14,435
(You're still a wonderful woman)

366
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,567
Do you like the gift?

367
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:27,302
Why did you send me this?

368
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:31,402
Think of it as consolation from a friend.

369
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:33,901
You don't need to overthink it.

370
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,734
This is all part of client management.

371
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:38,201
Lee Taeoh is my client after all.

372
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:40,667
Thank you anyway.

373
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:41,934
One thing about me,

374
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:45,601
I try not to think much
when my head's in a mess.

375
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,502
I don't even think before I decide.

376
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:50,767
In life, nothing ever goes as planned,

377
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:53,168
and there is no answer.

378
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:56,668
Just going with the flow...

379
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:58,467
...isn't so bad.

380
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,501
Have you ever been betrayed...

381
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,535
...by someone close to you?

382
00:39:18,968 --> 00:39:21,535
Do you trust that husband of yours?

383
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:29,501
Nothing was found from your
ECG and endocrine tests.

384
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,801
And they didn't find anything...

385
00:39:32,934 --> 00:39:34,735
...from your allergy test.

386
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,335
I can't find the cause
even in this place.

387
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:45,768
It seems to be a psychiatric problem...

388
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:48,735
...rather than a medical problem.

389
00:39:48,968 --> 00:39:51,569
I suggest you see a neuropsychiatrist...

390
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I know my own symptoms.

391
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,268
I don't need psychotherapy.

392
00:39:57,467 --> 00:39:59,401
Just give me the usual medicine.

393
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:03,235
Most people think that they
know their own problems.

394
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,834
You should seek...

395
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:07,067
...professional help instead.

396
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:09,435
How about you, doctor?

397
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,867
You have the same symptoms as me.

398
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,500
-Mr. Ha Dongshik...
-Instead of dealing with it alone,

399
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:23,802
you should seek professional help.

400
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,967
Raise your toes and look at the ceiling.

401
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:34,302
Make sure you stretch out...

402
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,768
...every part of your spine.

403
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:41,201
Keep engaging your core.

404
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:45,435
Now go back to your original position.

405
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:47,168
Keep your eyes to the front,

406
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:51,001
raise your knee slightly
and stretch your leg out all the way.

407
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,068
Stretch it out slowly.

408
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,534
Eyes to the front.

409
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:57,535
Less tension on your shoulders.

410
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:59,501
Keep your pelvis aligned.

411
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:03,435
Now, slowly stretch out your legs
without lowering your feet.

412
00:41:03,534 --> 00:41:04,868
Stretch.

413
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:07,502
Less tension on your shoulders.

414
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,302
Keep your pelvis aligned.

415
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:14,834
Go back up.

416
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:22,401
Let's go again.

417
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,601
I have three older sisters.

418
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:04,567
So...

419
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,801
I only need to see a person's backside...

420
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:09,600
...to know if they're pregnant.

421
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:18,201
What's your point?

422
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,734
I thought it was strange
that you're quitting after this week.

423
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,367
What a surprise.

424
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:32,834
I'm not sure what you mean,

425
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,034
but if you don't like the
fact that I'm quitting,

426
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,200
you can ask for a refund.

427
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:41,868
I only put up with your shenanigans...

428
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,734
...because you're Taeoh's toy.

429
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:48,001
But now...

430
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:50,235
The situation's changed.

431
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,035
I can't keep my mouth shut anymore.

432
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:58,034
Tell her.

433
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,868
Go ahead. I wish you would.

434
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:06,101
I bet you can't.

435
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:09,968
All this time you covered up for us,
and now you want to be loyal?

436
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,600
That's hilarious.

437
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,968
When she finds out,

438
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:17,602
do you think she will back down?

439
00:43:19,434 --> 00:43:22,101
She would rather see you
ruin your life over...

440
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,035
...raising Taeoh's bastard.

441
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:35,068
Maybe Sunwoo is only pretending
like she doesn't know anything.

442
00:43:36,934 --> 00:43:38,001
Didn't that ever occur to you?

443
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,901
Taeoh is just leading you on, isn't he?

444
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,567
There is no cure for stupidity.

445
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:00,201
Do you want to eat out?

446
00:44:01,467 --> 00:44:03,467
We need a diversion.

447
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:05,168
Let's go somewhere nice.

448
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,268
I'll send you the address.

449
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,834
See you there.

450
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,202
Okay.

451
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:22,367
What is it?

452
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:25,100
Are you going somewhere nice?

453
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:34,667
Have you heard anything
from the investors?

454
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:39,200
You're asking a lot of questions today.

455
00:44:40,434 --> 00:44:41,668
I'm sorry.

456
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:50,835
That night...

457
00:44:51,701 --> 00:44:54,068
......when I visited the office.

458
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:58,868
You know why I did that, right?

459
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,400
(Lee Taeoh: Pairing restaurant...)

460
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:49,935
Dakyung, get in.

461
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,433
What are you doing here?
You didn't even call me.

462
00:45:52,534 --> 00:45:56,435
I'm here to see my daughter of course.
What else?

463
00:45:57,868 --> 00:45:59,168
Well, you saw me.

464
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,334
Bye.

465
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:02,635
-I'm busy.
-Hey!

466
00:46:02,734 --> 00:46:04,767
I can't just leave when
you have a long face.

467
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:07,369
Get in. Let's go shopping.
I need to buy some clothes.

468
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:08,667
Hurry up.

469
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,734
Come on!

470
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:12,867
Chop-chop.

471
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,367
How do I look?
Does it look good on me?

472
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:24,534
Are you really not going
to buy the one we saw earlier?

473
00:46:24,634 --> 00:46:26,868
I'll buy it for you.

474
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,801
Forget it. I don't need it.

475
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,901
It'll look great on you
if you lose a little weight.

476
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,600
Will you cut it out?

477
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:41,367
Oh my, that one looks cute.

478
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:42,567
How adorable!

479
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:45,001
My goodness. Hello there.

480
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,801
-Oh hello.
-Hello.

481
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:50,735
So pretty!

482
00:46:51,701 --> 00:46:55,235
Hey! Come here and pick something for me.

483
00:47:04,701 --> 00:47:06,001
Why are you buying this?

484
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:08,068
Did someone get pregnant?

485
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:11,035
My friend's son is in college,
and he knocked up a girl.

486
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:13,401
She'll be a grandmother next month.

487
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,801
How can they be so immature?

488
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,168
They're pretty nerveless
for 20-year-old kids.

489
00:47:20,334 --> 00:47:22,401
As if becoming a grandma wasn't enough,

490
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:24,168
she has to raise the baby too!

491
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:26,467
She's about to go insane!

492
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:30,634
Just get something so we can go.

493
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,268
Hey. I don't want to be
a grandma too early.

494
00:47:35,701 --> 00:47:36,768
Don't let me down.

495
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:39,467
Excuse me.

496
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:41,634
Can you have this wrapped?

497
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,401
Yes, thank you.

498
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:47,302
This goes in the bottom?

499
00:48:01,267 --> 00:48:02,501
Why didn't you go inside?

500
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:05,902
How is it?

501
00:48:06,934 --> 00:48:08,334
Isn't it nice to dine out?

502
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:10,035
I'm sure you're happy, Joonyoung.

503
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:12,068
I'm glad I didn't have to cook dinner.

504
00:48:12,234 --> 00:48:15,202
I bet you're excited
for some good food.

505
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,801
I'm not a kid. I don't get
excited over such things.

506
00:48:17,901 --> 00:48:18,735
Then?

507
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:22,935
The three of us coming to
a place like this in a long time.

508
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,333
Anyway,

509
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:26,402
this place looks nice.

510
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:29,068
You have a good eye.

511
00:48:29,334 --> 00:48:32,268
I booked the hottest place in town.

512
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,335
Let's go in.

513
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:37,401
Oh my.

514
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:39,300
Dr. Ji!

515
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,201
What a coincidence.

516
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,100
Did you just finish dinner?

517
00:48:48,434 --> 00:48:49,467
We came without a reservation.

518
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:51,834
We were just leaving because
they don't have tables.

519
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:53,501
I see.

520
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:54,668
Enjoy your evening.

521
00:48:55,334 --> 00:48:56,202
Then...

522
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,767
Why don't you join us?

523
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:01,035
We made a reservation.

524
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:04,101
Oh no.

525
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:07,802
I'd hate to bother you.

526
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:14,033
I was wondering how I should
thank you for attending the funeral.

527
00:49:14,934 --> 00:49:16,568
As long as it's okay with you,

528
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:17,867
you can join us.

529
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:22,635
Should we?

530
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:27,901
We're in a bit of trouble and
my husband will arrive soon.

531
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:29,734
Are you okay with that?

532
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,534
Oh, yes.

533
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:33,368
Sure.

534
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:40,334
Honey, over here!

535
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:41,301
Over here.

536
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,834
How are things with your boyfriend?

537
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:20,968
What's the matter?

538
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,368
Here.

539
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:23,934
Dakyung is...

540
00:50:24,534 --> 00:50:26,368
...a social butterfly.

541
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:30,434
A lot of people misjudge her
because she has so many friends.

542
00:50:30,534 --> 00:50:32,701
But she's not seeing anyone.

543
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:34,935
-Is that so?
-Yes.

544
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,268
Maybe I heard her wrong.

545
00:50:45,467 --> 00:50:46,567
I have homework to do.

546
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:47,701
I'll go now.

547
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
Okay.

548
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:52,400
My apologies.

549
00:50:53,434 --> 00:50:54,668
Please excuse us.

550
00:51:01,234 --> 00:51:03,234
He loves his son dearly.

551
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:06,102
They always stick together
wherever they go.

552
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,500
A son means a lot to his dad.

553
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,468
Mr. Lee is so good-looking.

554
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:14,834
I bet a lot of actresses
tried to flirt with him.

555
00:51:14,934 --> 00:51:17,001
Of course there were.

556
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:21,001
But Taeoh is so devoted to his family.

557
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,233
Even if that ever happens,

558
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:26,367
it's nothing more...

559
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:31,568
...than just excretion for men.

560
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,533
Right. All men make mistakes.

561
00:51:50,868 --> 00:51:54,335
Even Mr. Choi's wife was generous
enough to forgive him.

562
00:51:55,834 --> 00:51:57,802
She's getting a building from him.

563
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,301
Hello?

564
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,700
You should watch your mouth
as a doctor.

565
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:43,800
Whatever happened to
doctor-patient confidentiality?

566
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,534
You said he'll get a divorce in two months
and have the baby with you.

567
00:52:47,968 --> 00:52:50,669
I figured you already introduced
him to your parents.

568
00:52:52,234 --> 00:52:54,468
I'm sorry if I caused you trouble.

569
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:36,968
(Min Hyunseo)

570
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,500
Who is it?

571
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:15,801
Who is it?

572
00:55:17,534 --> 00:55:18,601
It's me.

573
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:26,567
Hyunseo...

574
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:36,634
What happened to you?

575
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,267
I'm sorry.

576
00:55:41,434 --> 00:55:43,302
Do you mind if I stay for a few minutes?

577
00:55:49,901 --> 00:55:51,468
I have decided.

578
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:55,668
I'm going to get an abortion.

579
00:55:58,033 --> 00:56:02,300
I don't have money,
and parents whom I can depend on.

580
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:06,834
And the baby's father
beats me up all the time.

581
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:09,268
I'm not fit to be a mother.

582
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:11,868
The baby...

583
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,368
...would only be miserable.

584
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:18,135
You don't have to give me that look.

585
00:56:19,267 --> 00:56:21,267
I feel so relieved now
that I've made a decision.

586
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,901
My life is important to me.

587
00:56:26,334 --> 00:56:28,901
I don't want to end up
with a baby at my age.

588
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:33,435
You're lucky.

589
00:56:34,334 --> 00:56:35,968
You don't have to worry
about this kind of thing.

590
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:40,102
You have parents who support you.

591
00:56:40,868 --> 00:56:41,702
And soon,

592
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:43,668
you'll get married.

593
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:49,800
What's the matter?

594
00:56:50,234 --> 00:56:51,668
Is something wrong?

595
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:58,100
Actually...

596
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:03,602
He's married.

597
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,934
What am I going to do?

598
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:22,301
I'm about to go crazy.

599
00:57:31,501 --> 00:57:34,235
You said he was getting a divorce.

600
00:57:34,334 --> 00:57:36,568
He wants to divorce her right now.

601
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,434
He can't put up with her anymore.

602
00:57:40,534 --> 00:57:42,268
That woman is the problem though.

603
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:46,834
She'll continue to stay with him
even if she finds out.

604
00:57:47,868 --> 00:57:49,569
That's how shameless she is.

605
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,335
What's she like?

606
00:57:53,601 --> 00:57:56,502
She belittles people thinking
that she's better than everyone.

607
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:00,734
She is such a snob.

608
00:58:01,067 --> 00:58:04,467
I bet he hates living
with a woman like her.

609
00:58:05,901 --> 00:58:06,735
Well...

610
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,100
He said he's not sexually attracted
to her anymore.

611
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:14,668
He said sleeping with her
is just a responsibility.

612
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,534
Why would he want to sleep with her?

613
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:18,601
She's old now.

614
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:27,135
It's late. Why don't you stop?

615
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:28,634
Aren't you sleepy?

616
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:31,335
I'm almost done.

617
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,400
I'll be upstairs.

618
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,634
(Min Hyunseo)

619
00:59:06,968 --> 00:59:08,302
(Son Jehyuk)

620
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,067
Did you find the answer
you were looking for?

621
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Not yet.

622
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,267
What about tomorrow?

623
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:53,901
Shall we go for a drink?

624
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:12,802
Where's your mom?

625
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:37,901
Eat some fruits.

626
01:01:38,434 --> 01:01:39,901
Enough with the cookies.

627
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:48,268
Aren't your lips too red?

628
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,333
Does it look weird?

629
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:54,734
I'm just saying.

630
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,268
What do you think, honey?

631
01:02:05,534 --> 01:02:07,502
I thought you're going to a conference.

632
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:09,502
It's a little too much if you ask me.

633
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,534
It's been a while since I went out,

634
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:14,667
so I tried a new look.

635
01:02:15,267 --> 01:02:17,300
But the reaction isn't so great.

636
01:02:19,868 --> 01:02:21,836
It's a little too much,
but it's not bad.

637
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:29,267
I made dinner.
You just have to heat it up.

638
01:02:29,367 --> 01:02:30,367
All right.

639
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,967
Hey, apparently this guy is moving teams.

640
01:02:34,868 --> 01:02:36,102
-Really?
-Yes.

641
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:39,534
-That's a shame.
-He was pretty good.

642
01:02:39,634 --> 01:02:41,135
Awe, man.

643
01:02:41,734 --> 01:02:44,801
-This sucks.
-Money is everything.

644
01:03:39,801 --> 01:03:41,101
You're early.

645
01:03:47,834 --> 01:03:49,034
You look wonderful today.

646
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:50,767
But then again,

647
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:52,100
that's how you always look.

648
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:55,168
Can you pour me a glass?

649
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:30,501
I never thought this would happen.

650
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:32,001
What?

651
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,001
Spending time with you like this,
just the two of us.

652
01:04:37,634 --> 01:04:38,634
But?

653
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:43,034
It's not as bad as I thought.

654
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,068
That's it? "Not bad"?

655
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:48,734
I should step up my game.

656
01:04:58,968 --> 01:05:00,836
Why do people cheat anyway?

657
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:04,868
There are two types of men in the world.

658
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:06,535
The cheating type,

659
01:05:06,634 --> 01:05:08,368
and the type that gets caught cheating.

660
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:11,734
Our instinct always get the better of us.

661
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,233
Instinct...

662
01:05:14,834 --> 01:05:16,967
...is not only wired to the male brain.

663
01:05:30,868 --> 01:05:32,602
My new place is in the middle of a repair,

664
01:05:32,701 --> 01:05:34,734
so I've been staying at a hotel.

665
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:36,101
Yes.

666
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,267
I'll see you at the hospital soon.

667
01:05:41,968 --> 01:05:42,802
Yes sir.

668
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:00,368
No way.

669
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,067
You still don't believe me?

670
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:06,468
I swear it was pure jealousy.

671
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:09,901
Men always try to exert
dominance on each other.

672
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,067
They pretend like they don't know,

673
01:06:15,267 --> 01:06:18,135
but I know position Taeoh is in...

674
01:06:19,534 --> 01:06:20,601
...among his friends.

675
01:06:25,934 --> 01:06:28,501
You decided to provoke Taeoh that day,

676
01:06:29,133 --> 01:06:33,400
because you felt like your perceived
hierarchy was being challenged.

677
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,268
You only used me as an excuse.

678
01:06:38,067 --> 01:06:39,035
Am I wrong?

679
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,367
Taeoh doesn't deserve...

680
01:06:50,367 --> 01:06:52,134
...someone like you.

681
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:57,334
You knew, right?

682
01:06:58,634 --> 01:07:00,168
That I like you.

683
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,100
I had a rough idea.

684
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:06,134
And yet, you're here.

685
01:07:25,133 --> 01:07:26,300
It's not a bad way...

686
01:07:27,133 --> 01:07:29,300
...to get back on Taeoh.

687
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,533
You can say no.

688
01:07:35,234 --> 01:07:36,935
It's up to you.

689
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,700
(Bird's Hill Hotel Parking Lot)

690
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:46,668
What are you doing here?

691
01:14:47,434 --> 01:14:48,968
You could've just called.

692
01:14:57,834 --> 01:14:59,168
Let's break up.

693
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:05,301
I couldn't help it yesterday.

694
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,600
-Let's calm down...
-I got rid of the baby.

695
01:15:14,734 --> 01:15:15,568
What?

696
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,101
You happy now?

697
01:15:20,834 --> 01:15:23,068
There's no reason for us
to see each other.

698
01:16:12,133 --> 01:16:13,600
Are you leaving already?

699
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:17,368
I was hoping we can do another round.

700
01:16:18,567 --> 01:16:19,967
I should go to work.

701
01:16:24,767 --> 01:16:26,134
At 4:00 AM?

702
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:31,668
I have a family.

703
01:16:34,334 --> 01:16:36,835
You're ruining the moment.

704
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,534
About Yerim...

705
01:16:47,234 --> 01:16:50,001
Do you want to tell her or should I?

706
01:16:51,801 --> 01:16:52,635
What?

707
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,200
Should I tell Taeoh?

708
01:17:02,267 --> 01:17:04,001
You're welcome to do it if you want to.

709
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:10,767
But,

710
01:17:12,067 --> 01:17:14,001
you don't want to break up
with Yerim at all.

711
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,034
If you want revenge, take it out on Taeoh.

712
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:31,034
Women are capable of cheating too.

713
01:17:31,767 --> 01:17:33,334
We just refrain from cheating...

714
01:17:33,701 --> 01:17:38,101
...because we believe that the
wedding vows must be kept sacred.

715
01:17:40,834 --> 01:17:43,435
That's why I suggest you stop
fooling around like this.

716
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,500
Statements of T.O Entertainment's
corporate funds...

717
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,035
...and details of Taeoh's
personal account.

718
01:17:56,434 --> 01:17:58,935
Find everything and hand it over to me.

719
01:18:01,467 --> 01:18:02,567
Wait...

720
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,134
Am I being blackmailed?

721
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:08,834
Yes.

722
01:18:26,734 --> 01:18:29,235
Instead of dealing with it alone,

723
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:31,501
you should seek professional help.

724
01:18:33,567 --> 01:18:37,068
I found this at the restaurant
on your husband's birthday.

725
01:18:43,467 --> 01:18:44,834
I'm sure you will find this...

726
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:46,467
...helpful.

727
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,268
Use a fork.

728
01:19:04,701 --> 01:19:06,202
-I don't have one.
-Oh, there's my dad.

729
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,268
Wait here. I have to take his pictures.

730
01:19:13,968 --> 01:19:15,335
If you don't believe me,

731
01:19:16,534 --> 01:19:19,301
I'll go to Mr. Yeo right now
and tell him about us.

732
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:21,701
Are you crazy?

733
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,500
My son.

734
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,134
My house.

735
01:20:03,534 --> 01:20:04,634
My life.

736
01:20:07,234 --> 01:20:10,735
I won't let anything of
mine being taken away.

737
01:20:19,934 --> 01:20:23,268
Lee Taeoh is the only thing
I want out of my life.

738
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:55,101
(The World of the Married)

739
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,601
This is the new neuropsychiatrist.

740
01:20:57,701 --> 01:20:58,901
I'm Kim Yoonki.

741
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,467
About Sunwoo...

742
01:21:00,667 --> 01:21:03,001
Did you notice anything strange about her?

743
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:06,867
I thought you two made up
when you sent her the flower basket.

744
01:21:06,968 --> 01:21:08,535
Taeoh doesn't know yet, does he?

745
01:21:08,734 --> 01:21:09,968
Don't worry.

746
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:12,034
I haven't said anything yet.

747
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:13,934
You should break up with him.

748
01:21:14,033 --> 01:21:15,367
Don't let him walk all over you.

749
01:21:15,467 --> 01:21:18,867
I guess your parents don't
know about your pregnancy.

750
01:21:18,968 --> 01:21:22,802
That's why you shouldn't covet
what belongs to others.

751
01:21:22,901 --> 01:21:24,802
Were you always this low?

752
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:26,735
When you were fooling around
with another girl,

753
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:29,234
you should've known that you
may never see your son again.

754
01:21:29,334 --> 01:21:30,901
I couldn't help it.

755
01:21:30,968 --> 01:21:33,101
Falling in love is not a sin!
