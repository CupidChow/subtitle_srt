(The World of the Married)

3
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,068
Let go of me.

4
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,800
I can't just let you go.
I saw everything.

5
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:38,168
-Let go of me.
-You're going to tell me why you did that.

6
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:39,667
Why do you care?

7
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,668
What is going on?

8
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,668
Is this your car?

9
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,735
Yes.

10
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:53,534
Aren't you Dr. Ji's son?

11
00:01:57,968 --> 00:01:59,936
-Hey!
-Oh no, it's okay.

12
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:01,769
It's all good.

13
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:03,934
Excuse me.

14
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:06,968
May I ask who you are?

15
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:13,202
What lingering emotions do
they have for each other?

16
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,202
Bitterness? Hatred?

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,834
Those kind of feelings?

18
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:21,934
Beneath the surface, it could
be obsession or sympathy,

19
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,968
Or it could be affection.

20
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,500
I don't know yet.

21
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:30,834
It will come to light when one
of them's completely broken.

22
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,767
If there's any spark left,

23
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,601
we should throw oil on the fire
to see what happens.

24
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:39,868
All I want...

25
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:41,701
...is my daughter to be happy.

26
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,200
Do you really want to
take this to the end?

27
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:48,435
When you're not sure
how it will turn out?

28
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,435
You also want to check, don't you?

29
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:56,234
From what I know,
you have feelings for Dr. Ji.

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,667
It seems like you misunderstood.

31
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:05,235
I don't have any feelings for Dr. Ji.

32
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,468
To get the most out
of our counseling sessions,

33
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,867
I induced her to project
her feelings onto me.

34
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:14,367
What a surprise.

35
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:18,769
That way, I can read
her innermost feelings.

36
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:35,001
Do you know what it's
like to truly hate someone?

37
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:38,534
The mere sight of her makes me sick.

38
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:40,468
It's either her or me!

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,334
It won't end until one of us is dead.

40
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,368
You can fool everyone else
but not me.

41
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,101
What you're feeling...

42
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,501
...is love.

43
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:53,834
Shut up.

44
00:03:55,701 --> 00:04:00,368
I am nothing like you!

45
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:28,268
Dad, how do I look?

46
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,868
Wow, you look great.

47
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:33,302
Where did you get your
good looks from?

48
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:34,634
Mom, of course.

49
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,067
Mom's coming.

50
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,968
Wow, you look beautiful.

51
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,567
You look so pretty.

52
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,701
How did I get so lucky?

53
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,868
Okay, here we go.

54
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,901
-Isn't my wife beautiful?
-Stop it.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,767
I'm just complimenting your beauty.

56
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:01,035
Gosh, stop being so mushy, Dad.

57
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,567
Okay. My goodness.

58
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,367
But you really are beautiful.

59
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:07,501
I mean it.

60
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,101
What do you want this time?

61
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,001
You can't come in here!

62
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,101
We can talk outside!

63
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:48,201
What if your wife...

64
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,634
...finds out that you've been visiting me?

65
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,302
When are you going to
stop messing with me?

66
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:59,002
Would it kill you to see me
have a peaceful life...

67
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,301
...here in my hometown?

68
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,101
I should ask you the same question.

69
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,235
You're the one who's tormenting me!

70
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,135
What were you watching?

71
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,168
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

72
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:27,435
I love you.

73
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:48,002
You kept this?

74
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,268
Do you watch this
whenever you can?

75
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:52,601
Were you...

76
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,968
...hoping that I'd come back?

77
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:02,467
I can't stand the sight of you.

78
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:08,502
You sued me for assault and
banned me from seeing my own son!

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,834
I feel sick when I think
about what you did!

80
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,934
Just exactly what are you
expecting from me?

81
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,934
You're the one who barged
into my house late at night.

82
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:21,268
What do you want from me?

83
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:29,135
Just be honest.

84
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,134
Do you want me to beg? Just tell me.

85
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,068
But I assure you that
nothing will change.

86
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:56,102
If you keep holding out like this,

87
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,434
I might snap and do something awful.

88
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,201
So please...

89
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,836
...get out of my life.

90
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,134
I can't breathe if you're still around.

91
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,035
If only you disappear,

92
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:26,502
my life will be perfect.

93
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:45,767
Sunwoo!

94
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:47,967
Come have a look.

95
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:54,034
Don't we look perfect?

96
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,867
If only you disappear,

97
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,434
my life will be perfect.

98
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,335
I'm glad you're here.

99
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,334
Good for you.

100
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,101
The IVF success rate of our hospital...

101
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,868
...is just as high as
any hospital in Seoul.

102
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:21,168
I hope we're not too late.

103
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,268
Well, you're certainly not early.

104
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:27,067
We'll know for sure when
your test results are out.

105
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,035
Even worse cases have
a good success rate.

106
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:33,368
Stress will make it worse, you know that.

107
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,834
Shall we start with the basic tests?

108
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:43,768
Okay.

109
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,335
How long do I have to wait?

110
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:57,035
I've been waiting a long time.
Why aren't you checking?

111
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,834
I have to see a dentist later.

112
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:01,067
I can't waste more time here.

113
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,433
I'm sorry. Please wait a little longer.

114
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:06,068
-I can't wait forever.
-What is this?

115
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,834
-I don't have time.
-What's going on?

116
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:11,467
-Dr. Ji is running late.
-She hasn't come in yet?

117
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,734
Have you tried calling her?

118
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:16,968
This never happened before.

119
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,468
-Dr. Ji!
-I'm sorry.

120
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,133
I'm sorry. I'll see you right away.

121
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,301
Can I have the chart?

122
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,135
Goodness, Dr. Ji.

123
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:26,768
You just got here?

124
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,101
You're late.

125
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,134
Yes, a little.

126
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,735
She must have had another
drink last night.

127
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:41,435
Nurse?

128
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:43,035
-Yes, Dr. Seol.
-Please escort them.

129
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,968
Yes, ma'am.

130
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,267
Hello. Please come with me.

131
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:47,168
Okay.

132
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:52,701
Yes?

133
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,768
Go Jaseong is here to see you.

134
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:56,901
Hello.

135
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:01,501
I was late because I wasn't
feeling well this morning.

137
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:02,734
I understand.

138
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:05,468
You have too much on your plate.

139
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,700
I'll be more careful.

140
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:12,734
Let me know if you're tired.
I'll adjust your workload.

141
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:18,968
There's no need for that.

142
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:22,534
I've always delivered
and will continue to do so.

143
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,934
About Dr. Kim...

144
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,635
Do you happen to know if
he has a personal connection...

145
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,201
...with Chairman Yeo Byungkyu?

146
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,001
Why are you staring at me?
Do you want to ask something?

147
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:49,235
I thought about it,

148
00:11:49,968 --> 00:11:51,968
and I think you're right.

149
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,634
Joonyoung is my highest priority.

150
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:57,568
So I’m wondering,

151
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:02,235
would you like to be
assistant director?

152
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:04,901
If you take the job,

153
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:09,035
it'll be easier for me to step down.

154
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:18,535
But I like my current position.

155
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,534
I won't be of much help
to the hospital anyway.

156
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,400
Someone with more passion
should take the role.

157
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:28,569
Are you sure you don't want it?

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,767
No. I'm not interested.

159
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,034
How was it?

160
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,268
They have a few more tests to run.

161
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:51,535
Maybe we should've come here sooner.

162
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:54,434
Then you would be less worried.

163
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:57,001
It's okay.

164
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm not worried.

165
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,702
Even if I can't have a baby...

166
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,001
I'll always thank you for this.

167
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,768
Mr. Son Jehyuk, come in.

168
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,534
I'll be back in a jiffy.

169
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:16,067
-Take care.
-Thank you.

170
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,001
(Friday, December 17th)

171
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:38,468
(Recent Calls: Min Hyunseo)

172
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:52,068
Your call cannot be reached.
Please leave a message….

173
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:55,135
Hyunseo.

174
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:58,702
I'm worried about you.
Please text me.

175
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,435
I'm going out for one hour.
Please adjust my consultation hours.

176
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,501
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

177
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,001
Why does she have so many
personal business to take care of?

178
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,101
Women don't know how to separate
work and personal life.

179
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:32,135
Goodness.

180
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,534
-Oh geez.
-Not all women are like that.

181
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,668
It's just Ji Sunwoo.

182
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,868
You shouldn't generalize
all women like that.

183
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:41,268
It's unfair.

184
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,868
-Please wait a moment.
-Okay.

185
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,834
Go Yerim?

186
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:08,634
We're ready for Mrs. Go Yerim.
Did she go somewhere?

187
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,335
I'll look for her.

188
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,936
I told you not to come here.

189
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:47,667
Park Inkyu...

190
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,135
You met him, didn't you?

191
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:53,202
Don't think about lying to me.

192
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,435
I changed my number...

193
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,535
...and tried to keep a low profile.

194
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,634
But somehow he knew
where to find me.

195
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:09,901
Hyunseo.

196
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,901
Do you need my help?

197
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:22,634
He must not find out
that I'm seeing you like this.

198
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:25,734
You need to leave.

199
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:28,735
Don't come looking for me again.

200
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,600
You said you're going to the restroom.
What are you doing?

201
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,102
What on earth?

202
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,435
Is that Dr. Ji?

203
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:52,501
What is she doing here?

204
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,834
Is she off today?

205
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:03,367
What was that?
She left without saying hello.

206
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,367
All right then.

207
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:12,101
We can meet there and go
to Dakyung's place together.

208
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:13,567
Okay.

209
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,334
Bye.

210
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:21,335
Your dad absolutely adores Jenny.

211
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,567
I should tell the maid to prepare dinner.

212
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:28,435
I should tell Taeoh
to come home early tonight.

213
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:29,335
Okay.

214
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,868
We'll take you to your massage room.

215
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,601
This lady requested for you, Hyunseo.

216
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,133
-Oh my.
-Yes?

217
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
-You lost weight.
-Yes.

218
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,500
Forget about diet.
I want a strong massage today.

219
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,001
-Yes, ma'am.
-As hard as you can.

220
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:04,834
Aren't you going to take
me to the room?

221
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:09,868
Please come with me.

222
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,100
Did you try calling her?

223
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,701
-Yes.
-Did you look everywhere?

224
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:40,568
Yes.

225
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,468
Where did she go?

226
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:43,600
What's going on?

227
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,767
Is something wrong?

228
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:47,568
Well...

229
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,834
It's Jehyuk and Yerim.

230
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:57,967
They came here for fertility
consultation and tests,

231
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:01,901
but then Yerim disappeared
all of a sudden without a word.

232
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:03,634
Disappeared all of a sudden?

233
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,601
Geez, why isn't she picking up?

234
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:28,734
What?

235
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:29,968
What are you doing?

236
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:32,302
If you're not busy,
can we go for a drink?

237
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:33,968
No.

238
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,600
Not today.

239
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,235
Why? Are you busy?

240
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,834
Now is not a good time.

241
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,367
I'll call you later.

242
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,934
Thank you.

243
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,967
Since when did you start working here?

244
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,635
Do you still keep in touch with Ji Sunwoo?

245
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:27,235
Did she tell you...

246
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,567
...that I'm a member here?

247
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,367
It's been about a year
since I worked here.

248
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,601
It took a while to get my license.

249
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,734
I recently heard about
your return to Gosan.

250
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:46,201
I didn't expect to run into you here.

251
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,767
Do you still report
my every move...

252
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,333
...to that woman?

253
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,401
Are you feeling insecure?

254
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,067
Not at all.

255
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:05,668
Why?

256
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,601
I heard you got married,

257
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:12,434
but I don't think you're happy.

258
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Well, you know what they say.

259
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,367
Once a cheater...

260
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:21,035
...always a cheater.

261
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:58,201
-Have a nice day, Teacher!
-Have a nice day!

262
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Lee Joonyoung.

263
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,834
We need to talk.

264
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:19,968
What's going on?

265
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:22,934
They must be dating.

266
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:25,935
Are they really...?

267
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,502
-What's going on?
-What is this?

268
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:31,601
Are you guys dating?

269
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:35,801
Hey, did you see that?

270
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,634
Looks like romance is blooming
in our class.

271
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:42,302
Why do you care if I steal
or do crazy things?

272
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,901
Whatever you're doing...

273
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,001
...is also my business.

274
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,568
You of all people should behave better.

275
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:52,201
I want you to tell
Haekang the truth...

276
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,801
...and promise me you
won't do it again.

277
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:59,801
Why don't you tell him yourself?

278
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,567
Do as you please. See if I care.

279
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:05,502
Hey!

280
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,234
Damn...

281
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:13,834
Kids like you...

282
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:16,535
...make everyone look bad including me.

283
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,567
Because of delinquents like you,

284
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:22,569
...people think kids with
divorced parents are all bad.

285
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:27,501
Why can't you just suck it up?

286
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,368
Lee Joonyoung.

287
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,001
Do you...

288
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,801
...have a thing with Noeul?

289
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,067
No, I don't.

290
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:59,334
Are you guys really a couple?

291
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,534
Are you insane?

292
00:26:01,234 --> 00:26:02,568
Then help me out.

293
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:05,201
I like Noeul.

294
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,135
I need your help.

295
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,168
You're closer to her than I am.

296
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:14,702
Jenny's going to make curry for me.

297
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:19,868
Of course I'm home early.
Your parents are coming.

298
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,367
Where are you now?

299
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,300
I'm almost there.
My parents will be there soon too.

300
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,401
Hurry up.

301
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Okay.

302
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,267
Jenny, Mommy's almost here.

303
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,701
Daddy's hungry. Make me some curry.

304
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:44,134
Yum, yum!

305
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,867
Your mom can't be this early.

306
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,034
Shall we go see who it is?

307
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,968
Up you go.

308
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,967
Are you there?

309
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,568
What are you doing here?

310
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:53,201
How dare you!

311
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,567
I also find this annoying.

312
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,434
So...

313
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,435
Let's get this over with.

314
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:03,268
All right?

315
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:17,168
I'll call you tomorrow.

316
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:18,901
You need to leave now.

317
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,066
I said, now!

318
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,101
(End call)

319
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,134
(Ending call)

320
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,834
Mommy's home!

321
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:43,367
Did someone come by?

322
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:44,968
Yeah.

323
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,233
He was selling newspaper subscription,
but I said no.

324
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:51,001
Who reads newspapers
these days anyway?

325
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:52,167
Right?

326
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,001
I'll go get changed.

327
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:57,934
Okay.

328
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:15,534
Look at her eating chicken.

329
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,535
She's eating well.

330
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:23,534
Drink some water. Slowly.

331
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,501
That's it.

332
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:28,235
You should eat some too.

333
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:29,568
Okay.

334
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,235
-Do you need something?
-No.

335
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,935
I'll look after Jenny.

336
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:39,367
Enjoy your meal.

337
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,367
Jenny, finish your chicken outside
so Mommy can eat.

338
00:30:43,434 --> 00:30:45,768
-Okay, let's go.
-There you go.

339
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:47,667
My goodness.

340
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:50,668
Your father was clueless
about raising babies.

341
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:53,502
Taeoh is a very attentive
husband in that way.

342
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:56,400
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

343
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:59,135
Jenny, let's go play.

344
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:00,834
Jenny.

345
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:02,668
-So adorable.
-This way?

346
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:05,134
-Look at her.
-Let's go.

347
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,001
About Taeoh...

348
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:26,968
Apparently, he's been talking with Dr. Ji.

349
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:30,435
I know.

350
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,234
Taeoh is honest with me.

351
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:36,934
About why he went there and met her.

352
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,202
And you're okay with that?

353
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:44,234
I understand his situation.
His son lives there.

354
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:47,700
I assumed as much when we came back.

355
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:51,869
What is it?

356
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,968
Are you worried because of her?

357
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:59,834
I could care less about that woman.

358
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:02,802
Don't mind her, Dad.

359
00:32:03,934 --> 00:32:06,902
I trust Taeoh. We're perfectly fine.

360
00:32:09,534 --> 00:32:12,201
Remember what I said when I...

361
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:13,601
...gave you my blessings?

362
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,101
If you're not happy,

363
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,535
you can come back to me anytime.

364
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:25,368
Of course.

365
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,533
I remember.

366
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,068
Dad.

367
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:39,302
You know I love you, right?

368
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:41,801
Not really.

369
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:27,734
Hey, Mr. Lee.

370
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:29,901
Sorry to bother you late at night.

371
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,869
I need you to withdraw 10 million won
in cash from the reserve fund tomorrow.

372
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,134
Right.

373
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:38,734
Have it ready by the end of your shift.

374
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,534
Want a drink?

375
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,435
Sounds good.

376
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,300
Someone told me...

377
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,567
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

378
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,667
Have you ever heard of that?

379
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:57,967
Does that...

380
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:01,101
...bother you?

381
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:04,202
What about you?

382
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:16,501
What we had wasn't an affair.

383
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,300
Who cares what other people think?

384
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:23,168
We both know that it's not true.

385
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:25,535
Don't let it get to you.

386
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:29,135
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

387
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,001
You're right.

388
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,534
I know we have nothing to be ashamed of.

389
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:49,867
But I don't understand why...

390
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:53,067
...even when we're married,

391
00:35:55,968 --> 00:35:59,268
I can't get that saying out of my head.

392
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:05,134
I'm not worried about what others think.

393
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:08,700
But it's been nagging on my mind.

394
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:15,102
It makes me feel rotten.

395
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,667
(Husband)

396
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:53,067
(You have one missed call from "Husband")

397
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:24,968
(Go Yerim)

398
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:41,667
Sweetheart.

399
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,801
Yerim.

400
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:01,101
Seriously...

401
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,501
Where did she go?

402
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:16,102
(Wife)

403
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:19,168
Honey, what happened?

404
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,468
I'm at my parent's place.

405
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:26,202
You should've called
to let me know you're going.

406
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,234
I've been looking everywhere for you.

407
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,200
What's up with you? Is something wrong?

408
00:38:32,234 --> 00:38:34,135
Why didn't you answer your phone?

409
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:35,967
Hello?

410
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:37,335
Hello?

411
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:07,068
I heard good news.

412
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:10,001
Will you be promoted to
assistant director soon?

413
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:12,868
Where did you hear that?

414
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:15,769
Visiting different hospitals
is part of my job.

415
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:18,200
People talk, you know.

416
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:19,634
Just wait.

417
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,267
Soon, you'll be coming
to our hospital more often.

418
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,500
I knew I can count on you.

419
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:32,734
You want to grab a coffee?

420
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:36,368
-You have a guest.
-He's my junior from high school.

421
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:38,468
Hello. I'm Woo Hosang.

422
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,268
Are you assistant director Ji Sunwoo?

423
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:41,701
I've heard a lot about you.

424
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,834
He's a friend of Taeoh.

425
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:48,868
I see. I'll let you guys catch up.

426
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:53,135
Why did you tell her that for?

427
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:54,401
You made her uncomfortable.

428
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:57,701
Why? We all know each other.

429
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,369
Excuse me.

430
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,767
Who is that in Dr. Seol's office?
He looks familiar.

431
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:11,735
Mr. Woo from Jaeho Medicine,
the medical equipment company.

432
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,767
I've been seeing him a lot these days.

433
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:16,033
Thank you.

434
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,134
Welcome.

435
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:22,467
Dr. Ji.

436
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:25,934
Can we talk?

437
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:34,835
(Director of Family Love Hospital)

438
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:39,568
I want to give
the assistant director position...

439
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,300
...to Dr. Kim Yoonki.

440
00:40:45,968 --> 00:40:48,535
-Dr. Gong...
-After a considerable debate,

441
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:51,834
the chairperson and I agreed
on a decision.

442
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:53,767
I want you to respect our decision.

443
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:03,034
-Is Mr. Yeo Byungkyu behind this?
-Dr. Ji.

444
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:06,368
Is it Chairman Yeo?

445
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:14,435
We agreed to receive donation
from T.O Pictures.

446
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:16,568
100 million won every year
for the next ten years.

447
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,067
We're waiting for the board's approval,

448
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:20,968
but that's just a formal procedure.

449
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:23,901
Before the appointment is announced,

450
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,534
hand over everything to Dr. Kim.

451
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,602
I've been paged by Dr. Gong.
Do you know what it's about?

452
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:46,702
What is it?

453
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:49,567
What's wrong?

454
00:41:53,534 --> 00:41:55,368
Congratulations on becoming
the assistant director.

455
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:59,168
It's a big responsibility.
Please do your best.

456
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:00,435
What?

457
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,901
He wants me to be assistant director?

458
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,634
I don't believe it.

459
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:28,968
Who would've ever thought
that Kim Yoonki was the dark horse?

460
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:32,301
I knew something was up
when he was acting all kind...

461
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,467
...and considerate towards you.

462
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:38,867
Counseling Joonyoung was
a part of his plan.

463
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:42,334
Even I feel betrayed.

464
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:45,001
I can only imagine how you feel.

465
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,567
I know you're making a large donation,

466
00:43:32,868 --> 00:43:35,569
but you don't have the rights
to interfere in personnel management.

467
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:38,201
I want you to leave Gosan.

468
00:43:38,434 --> 00:43:41,302
I'll give all the money
you need for resettlement.

469
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:47,301
You're crossing the line.

470
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,934
There's no line that I cannot cross.

471
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:56,401
I'll do anything for my
daughter's happiness.

472
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:58,435
If you're so concerned
about her happiness,

473
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,500
you should've stayed away from Taeoh.

474
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:04,834
She used to be a smart young lady.

475
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:06,702
Don't you think she's
too good for him?

476
00:44:11,434 --> 00:44:12,434
I do.

477
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:15,935
She became a mother
at such a young age.

478
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,867
And her husband has all sorts of problems.

479
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,368
So...

480
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:24,534
I'm getting rid of all
the obstacles in front of her.

481
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,634
I supposed that obstacle is me.

482
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:33,401
You're still obsessed with your ex-husband.

483
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:36,135
I must keep you away from her.

484
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:40,734
Which means...

485
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:43,334
...I don't have to play
by the rules either.

486
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,467
I have to protect myself and my son.

487
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:52,401
You know very well that I own this city.

488
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:57,168
You should take my advice and back off.

489
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:17,101
Dr. Ji.

490
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,834
Hello, Madam.

491
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:20,469
What brings you here?

492
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,701
Your dress code says
you're not here for golf.

493
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:25,400
I had to meet someone.

494
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:28,634
My husband already told me.

495
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:31,834
That you've decided to step down
from assistant director.

496
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:34,402
Yes.

497
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:37,935
I'll get going now.

498
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:41,600
It's a shame that all your effort
came to nothing.

499
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:43,934
But don't take your work...

500
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,734
...outside of the hospital.

501
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:51,434
If he's seen with a divorcée
at a bar late at night,

502
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,467
it could damage his reputation.

503
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:56,468
People will think it's inappropriate.

504
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:59,201
And it's embarrassing for me too.

505
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:29,968
He took 10 million won
from the reserve fund.

506
00:46:30,968 --> 00:46:32,101
How much did he take so far?

507
00:46:32,434 --> 00:46:34,068
40 million won.

508
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:02,001
Your call cannot be reached.
Please leave a message….

509
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,034
(Wife)

510
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:04,867
(Can you please pick up? Yerim...)

511
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,701
At least tell me why.

512
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:09,001
Why...

513
00:47:27,934 --> 00:47:32,001
Your call cannot be reached.
Please leave a message….

514
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:42,634
Shit.

515
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,368
Joy...

516
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:11,501
Where is she?

517
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:14,001
She quit her job.

518
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,434
She doesn't work here anymore.

519
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
What is going on...?

520
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,467
(Lee Taeoh)

521
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:24,601
I told you so.

522
00:49:25,334 --> 00:49:27,101
You should've treated your wife properly.

523
00:49:32,968 --> 00:49:34,402
What are you talking about?

524
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:37,801
Joy...

525
00:49:39,567 --> 00:49:40,967
She's a tough cookie, isn't she?

526
00:49:43,234 --> 00:49:44,168
What did you do?

527
00:49:46,601 --> 00:49:48,135
Did you set me up?

528
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:52,867
Did I force you to date her?

529
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:55,301
She was looking for a sugardaddy.

530
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:58,634
So I gave her some information about you.

531
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:01,667
I didn't know you would
take the bait so easily.

532
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:04,600
Don't put the blame on me like a fool.

533
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:07,601
You've got yourself in that mess...

534
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:10,868
...because you're a scumbag.

535
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:11,234
How do you know Mr. Yeo?

536
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,500
Let's talk inside.

537
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:29,035
Would you care for tea?

538
00:51:29,334 --> 00:51:31,101
I asked you a question.

539
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:35,568
-Did you eat dinner?
-What were you two conspiring about?

540
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,634
He asked me for a favor,

541
00:51:40,901 --> 00:51:42,435
so I'm providing counseling.

542
00:51:47,767 --> 00:51:49,401
What did he ask from you?

543
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,501
Did he ask you to run
a psychological screening on me...

544
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,200
...in return for the
assistant director position?

545
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,068
And you call yourself a doctor?

546
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:00,867
I know this sounds strange,

547
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:04,001
but it was for your own good.

548
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:13,834
I had to find out what's
going on in his mind.

549
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,767
He can be a threat to you
at any given time.

550
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:22,168
You psychopath.

551
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:25,635
Don't respond to him
if he provokes you again.

552
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:31,134
Is that all you can say
after stabbing me in the back?

553
00:52:31,234 --> 00:52:34,434
I'm not interested in that position.
I will step down soon.

554
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,801
I don't have a choice
at the moment.

555
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,601
I have to convince Chairman Yeo.

556
00:52:40,234 --> 00:52:41,901
And I have to protect you.

557
00:52:43,734 --> 00:52:44,968
I trusted you.

558
00:52:48,367 --> 00:52:51,701
That's why I spilled all
of my deepest secrets.

559
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,967
And you sold them off?

560
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,067
You're no doctor!

561
00:53:02,434 --> 00:53:04,501
Don't ever come near my son again.

562
00:53:25,934 --> 00:53:27,101
(Incoming call from "Son")

563
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:31,434
Hey Joonyoung.

564
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:33,233
When are you coming home?

565
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,302
I'm almost there.

566
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:37,201
Is everything okay?

567
00:53:38,234 --> 00:53:39,668
Something's going on...

568
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:41,768
...at Mrs. Go's house.

569
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:45,934
Calm down, honey.

570
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,935
Please listen to me.

571
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:51,935
Yerim!

572
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:53,500
Yerim...

573
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:54,967
Why are they doing?

574
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,701
What's going on?

575
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,133
Stop it.

576
00:53:58,901 --> 00:53:59,769
Don't do this.

577
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,667
Please don't.

578
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,068
I think he screwed up.

579
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:18,401
Honey.

580
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:20,635
Please.

581
00:54:21,234 --> 00:54:23,001
Can we talk first?

582
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:24,901
I'll send the divorce papers
to your office...

583
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,634
...as soon as they are ready.

584
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,301
Honey.

585
00:54:36,968 --> 00:54:37,836
Honey.

586
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,234
Honey...

587
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:44,302
Honey!

588
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,433
Yerim!

589
00:54:53,934 --> 00:54:55,234
I'm sorry.

590
00:54:59,934 --> 00:55:01,568
I lost my head for a moment.

591
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,434
Please don't do this.

592
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:08,701
Let's talk face to face, please?

593
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:14,034
It's all my fault...

594
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:30,568
What's going on?

595
00:55:32,334 --> 00:55:34,701
What did you do?

596
00:55:42,334 --> 00:55:43,401
It was Taeoh.

597
00:55:44,901 --> 00:55:46,335
Taeoh did this.

598
00:55:48,934 --> 00:55:50,568
I made a mistake.

599
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:53,168
But I was set up.

600
00:55:53,901 --> 00:55:56,335
He threw a bait at me and I took it.

601
00:55:56,934 --> 00:55:58,134
What are you talking about?

602
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,533
-You're not making any sense.
-I was set up from the beginning.

603
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:03,469
He made her approach me.

604
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:06,368
He gave her Yerim's number
so she can send those photos.

605
00:56:06,634 --> 00:56:07,734
It was all Taeoh.

606
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,100
Everything went according to his plan.

607
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,267
He's capable of anything.

608
00:56:22,434 --> 00:56:23,834
Brace yourself.

609
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,467
Stay focused or you will end up like me.

610
00:56:28,501 --> 00:56:29,435
That bastard...

611
00:56:33,133 --> 00:56:34,101
...is crazy.

612
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:42,968
If you keep holding out like this,

613
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,634
I might snap and do something awful.

614
00:56:49,501 --> 00:56:50,801
So please...

615
00:56:56,467 --> 00:56:58,268
...get out of my life.

616
00:57:32,267 --> 00:57:33,868
What are you doing here?

617
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:35,567
You didn't tell me you were coming.

618
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,367
It's your day-off, right?

619
00:57:40,701 --> 00:57:41,569
Let's go.

620
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:45,734
Where are we going?

621
00:57:46,534 --> 00:57:47,601
You'll find out soon enough.

622
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:52,569
Here.

623
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:56,435
Be careful.

624
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:15,735
Go ahead.

625
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:17,934
Choose whatever you like.

626
00:58:19,434 --> 00:58:20,268
Okay.

627
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,801
They're all pretty.
I don't know what to choose.

628
00:58:34,934 --> 00:58:35,835
This one.

629
00:58:38,267 --> 00:58:39,434
Can you take that one out?

630
00:58:39,534 --> 00:58:40,801
Sure. You have a good eye.

631
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:41,735
Yes.

632
00:58:51,901 --> 00:58:52,934
Can you give me your hand?

633
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:54,535
What?

634
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:55,468
I want you to try it on.

635
00:58:56,267 --> 00:58:57,801
Oh, okay.

636
00:59:06,567 --> 00:59:07,401
What do you think?

637
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,500
I think it's really pretty.

638
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:10,435
Do you like it?

639
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,334
-Yes, it's pretty.
-Right?

640
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:19,401
But this one looks really expensive.

641
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:29,268
I want this one.

642
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:30,468
Sure.

643
00:59:32,968 --> 00:59:35,202
Do you know how much this is?

644
00:59:36,767 --> 00:59:38,900
I can afford this one.

645
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:42,900
We'll measure your finger first.
You can pick it up in a week.

646
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:44,801
-One moment please.
-Okay.

647
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,333
Excuse me.

648
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,667
I'm buying this for a wedding.

649
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:51,868
Please be extra careful.

650
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:53,068
Sure.

651
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:16,801
Test results are ready.

652
01:00:17,968 --> 01:00:19,068
Oh, dear.

653
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:21,068
Just as I thought. You have the flu.

654
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:24,900
I'll write you a prescription.
Get as much rest as you can.

655
01:00:24,968 --> 01:00:26,368
I knew it.

656
01:00:26,701 --> 01:00:29,035
I've been feeling completely worn out.

657
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,267
Should I give you some IV drip?

658
01:00:31,334 --> 01:00:33,668
No. I don't think that's necessary.

659
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,034
By the way,

660
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:39,168
have you heard the news
about Yerim?

661
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:43,402
I heard it got pretty loud.

662
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:46,133
She even put the house up for sale.

663
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:48,500
Perhaps she wants to get a divorce...

664
01:00:48,834 --> 01:00:51,001
...and leave Gosan for good.

665
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,800
I didn't know that.

666
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:58,867
Divorce isn't always the best solution.

667
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:01,234
But young people these days...

668
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:05,134
...take divorce so lightly.

669
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:10,568
Maybe it's pointless to hold
onto a broken marriage.

670
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:13,602
It's not easy to live as a divorcée.

671
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:16,268
Even if you have one drink with your boss,

672
01:01:16,367 --> 01:01:18,367
and they come up with
all sorts of rumors.

673
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,934
People are still...

674
01:01:21,501 --> 01:01:22,801
...narrow-minded.

675
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,400
You know that...

676
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:26,402
...better than anyone else.

677
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:09,701
After what happened two years ago,

678
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:15,868
I should've accepted the fact
that our marriage was over.

679
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,901
No matter how I tried,

680
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:22,667
it was nothing but an empty shell.

681
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,567
After talking big about how
I will keep my marriage...

682
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,834
And look at me now.

683
01:02:35,234 --> 01:02:36,901
Taeoh and I created that mess.

684
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:43,202
I shouldn't have dragged you two in.

685
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:46,568
I'm so sorry.

686
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:52,034
I don't know what to say.

687
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:54,468
Now that everything fell apart,

688
01:02:57,467 --> 01:02:58,801
I finally get it.

689
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,901
I wasn't holding onto love.

690
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,934
I was just refusing to give up.

691
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,500
Obsession doesn't do any good.

692
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:14,101
It only adds salt to the wound.

693
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,400
So...

694
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:20,101
You should...

695
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,901
...stop thinking about Taeoh.

696
01:03:26,667 --> 01:03:29,034
You have to get away from Taeoh.

697
01:03:29,901 --> 01:03:31,934
Just shake it off and leave.

698
01:03:32,734 --> 01:03:35,401
Forget about revenge.
Just ignore him.

699
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,100
You keep fighting back,

700
01:03:38,467 --> 01:03:40,567
but it looks like obsession to me.

701
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,667
What is marriage?

702
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:54,967
And what is divorce?

703
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,268
Some people just can't let go...

704
01:04:01,868 --> 01:04:04,502
...even when they know it's
just an empty shell.

705
01:04:05,601 --> 01:04:07,168
I let it go.

706
01:04:08,267 --> 01:04:09,834
We split up.

707
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:12,135
But why am I still...

708
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:15,534
...in an endless loop?

709
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,469
Not everyone does that.

710
01:04:17,968 --> 01:04:19,368
That's your fault.

711
01:04:21,434 --> 01:04:24,268
As long as you try to win,
it won't end.

712
01:04:24,501 --> 01:04:25,601
The way I see it,

713
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:29,368
you're no different from Taeoh.

714
01:04:45,067 --> 01:04:46,301
Take it.

715
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:56,101
What is this?

716
01:04:56,868 --> 01:04:58,302
Will it be enough if I bring...

717
01:04:58,534 --> 01:05:00,701
...this much money every month?

718
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:03,135
If you don't like working here,

719
01:05:03,701 --> 01:05:05,768
you can quit whenever you want.

720
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:09,667
I can take care of you.

721
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,200
How does our future look?

722
01:05:16,901 --> 01:05:18,235
I think...

723
01:05:18,901 --> 01:05:20,468
...it looks okay.

724
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:28,034
What kind of work do you do?

725
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,335
Why do you want to know?

726
01:05:31,534 --> 01:05:32,934
Don't you trust me?

727
01:05:36,501 --> 01:05:38,968
Where are you staying now?

728
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:56,035
(Min Hyunseo)

729
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,135
Inkyu came to see me.

730
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:08,467
Are you all right?

731
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:12,400
He has a lot of money.

732
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:13,968
I think...

733
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:16,901
...you were right.

734
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,868
Do you know where he is right now?

735
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:47,168
Can we talk?

736
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:55,768
Your face looks terrible.

737
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,100
If you had it treated in the first place,

738
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,301
you wouldn't have a scar.

739
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:08,333
Did you go see a doctor?

740
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:10,235
Just get to the point.

741
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,634
I don't want to talk to you.

742
01:07:13,968 --> 01:07:15,435
I know everything.

743
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:20,168
I know Taeoh put you up to it.

744
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:23,401
You broke into my house.

745
01:07:24,033 --> 01:07:25,667
And you used Joonyoung...

746
01:07:27,567 --> 01:07:29,001
...to blackmail me.

747
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,268
I know everything.

748
01:07:32,133 --> 01:07:34,700
-Do you have proof?
-The scar on your face.

749
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,834
Just how many orders did
you get from Taeoh?

750
01:07:43,634 --> 01:07:45,901
Did he order you to blackmail me
until I leave town?

751
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:48,834
Or...

752
01:07:53,133 --> 01:07:54,266
...did he order you to kill me?

753
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,801
Are you not afraid of anything?

754
01:08:06,534 --> 01:08:07,901
Should we...

755
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:09,869
...finish what we started?

756
01:08:09,934 --> 01:08:11,902
How much money did he offer?

757
01:08:13,767 --> 01:08:16,701
-Enough to give up your future?
-Bullshit.

758
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:19,035
Was it worth it or not?

759
01:08:19,133 --> 01:08:21,266
Don't talk about my future.

760
01:08:21,701 --> 01:08:24,035
I went to prison because of you!

761
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:26,534
There are consequences
for what you did.

762
01:08:27,901 --> 01:08:29,934
And you'll have to pay for it.

763
01:08:30,734 --> 01:08:32,501
Don't you still get it?

764
01:08:33,868 --> 01:08:36,569
Do you think Taeoh will
take care of you forever?

765
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:41,334
Taeoh put you up to it, right?

766
01:08:44,434 --> 01:08:46,335
You were following his orders, right?

767
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,400
Just spit it out.

768
01:08:52,334 --> 01:08:53,801
If you do, I'll ask the police...

769
01:08:54,868 --> 01:08:56,769
...to go easy on you.

770
01:08:58,133 --> 01:08:59,900
Get out of my home.

771
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:00,936
Say it.

772
01:09:01,434 --> 01:09:02,968
Say Taeoh put you up to it.

773
01:09:03,234 --> 01:09:04,601
Piss off.

774
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,368
-I knew it.
-No.

775
01:09:16,901 --> 01:09:17,769
No!

776
01:09:21,434 --> 01:09:22,402
Give it to me!

777
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:24,535
Give it to me!

778
01:09:24,634 --> 01:09:26,101
(The folder is empty)

779
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,267
Give it back!

780
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,234
Please stop, Inkyu.

781
01:10:10,334 --> 01:10:12,101
You shouldn't give up on your life.

782
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:17,268
You're still young.

783
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:34,001
Get out.

784
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,434
Before I kill you.

785
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:07,335
Can we talk?

786
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,068
Your face looks terrible.

787
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,068
If you had it treated
in the first place...

788
01:11:25,367 --> 01:11:27,001
Did you record it?

789
01:11:28,434 --> 01:11:29,801
Yes.

790
01:11:30,767 --> 01:11:32,834
But I didn't get his confession.

791
01:11:37,968 --> 01:11:38,836
Get in.

792
01:12:02,267 --> 01:12:03,135
What?

793
01:12:03,567 --> 01:12:06,334
Hyunseo quit her job.

794
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:08,434
When?

795
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,534
She went out and came back,

796
01:12:10,601 --> 01:12:14,035
then she packed her things and
left saying that she's quitting.

797
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:16,467
We were baffled too.

798
01:12:22,868 --> 01:12:25,135
Did she say where she was going?

799
01:12:25,901 --> 01:12:27,168
I don't know.

800
01:12:27,434 --> 01:12:31,168
I think she's moving to the provinces.

801
01:12:31,868 --> 01:12:33,901
I'm not sure if she said Ulsan or Busan.

802
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:43,967
Hyunseo!

803
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:58,267
Hyunseo!

804
01:13:07,434 --> 01:13:08,467
Min Hyunseo!

805
01:13:18,501 --> 01:13:19,601
Hyunseo!

(Lee Taeoh)

807
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,867
What do you mean you want more money?

808
01:14:00,534 --> 01:14:02,402
I gave you what you asked!

809
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:05,802
Our deal is over.

810
01:14:06,434 --> 01:14:08,567
She took Hyunseo!

811
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,867
Bring me 30 million won
or I tell her everything.

812
01:14:13,067 --> 01:14:15,134
Gosan station. Right now.

813
01:14:15,234 --> 01:14:16,735
I'll be on my way.

814
01:14:17,367 --> 01:14:19,400
Just wait if you want the money.

815
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:23,034
Shit!

816
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:26,635
I'll kill that bastard.

817
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:09,868
Will you have a place to stay?

818
01:15:12,234 --> 01:15:14,168
I have a friend in Ulsan.

819
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:17,301
There's a job opening at
the factory she works at.

820
01:15:17,934 --> 01:15:19,301
That's where I'm planning to go.

821
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:27,267
I hope you can forget
about your life here,

822
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:30,868
and start fresh.

823
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,901
I won't contact you again.

824
01:15:48,267 --> 01:15:49,834
I won't either.

825
01:15:51,133 --> 01:15:53,333
Don't even think about coming back.

826
01:16:43,267 --> 01:16:44,400
I'll take these.

827
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:49,001
Enjoy your food.

828
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:53,835
Let's go.

829
01:17:43,934 --> 01:17:45,001
Hold on.

(The World of the Married)

834
01:25:15,267 --> 01:25:17,901
I heard someone died at
Gosan Station last night.

835
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,100
When that guy brings the money,

836
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:22,035
we can leave Gosan for good.

837
01:25:22,234 --> 01:25:24,501
There's no hope between us.

838
01:25:24,734 --> 01:25:25,968
Enough is enough.

839
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:27,001
Let me go.

840
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,400
I think that's the person I'm looking for.

841
01:25:29,467 --> 01:25:30,968
Did you see that person fall?

842
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,300
I just happened to pass by.

843
01:25:34,734 --> 01:25:37,001
Do you recognize the scarf?

844
01:25:37,067 --> 01:25:39,035
The person who jumped off
the roof of Gosan station...

845
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,034
I think it's someone Dr. Ji knows.

846
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,901
Do you think I pushed that person?

847
01:25:43,968 --> 01:25:46,335
Gosan Station has surveillance cameras
left and right.

848
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,368
The server just happened to be down
due to maintenance,

849
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:50,035
and no footage was taken.

850
01:25:50,133 --> 01:25:52,300
Dakyung must not find out about this.

851
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,734
We have to take this secret to the grave.

852
01:25:55,968 --> 01:25:57,602
Are you Mr. Lee Taeoh?

853
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,500
You need to come with us.
