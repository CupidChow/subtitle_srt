00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,304
(Duting Station)

3
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:09,632
(Imperial Decree: Investigate the collusion
between government and businessmen)

4
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,640
My lord,

5
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,280
he has left.

6
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,720
Your foresight proves right.

7
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
How did you know

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,480
Prefect Xia would send someone?

9
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,200
Longevity in bureaucracy

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,240
breeds crafty officials,

11
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,640
especially paranoid ones like Xia Ciyi.

12
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,160
He'd never believe

13
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,480
a eunuch would travel days

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,840
just to deliver a decree
that everyone can predict.

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,440
So you let him see the real decree

16
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,600
to make the Xia and Lu families

17
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,160
turn on each other.

18
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
By the way, my lord,

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,880
the decree states

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,080
you must investigate
the Lu family immediately.

21
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,840
Why don't we start now?

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,120
True justice for Ningzhou's corruption

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,880
requires more
than exterminating the Lu family.

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
We must redress
every pearl-related death

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,520
with proper accountability.

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,880
My lord,

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,360
as you suspected,

28
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,600
there is another decree.

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,040
It describes Ningzhou's
entrenched factions,

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,000
ordering Shen Que
to investigate the collusion.

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,400
If proven guilty,

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,680
he's authorized to strike.

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,200
Now I understand.

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,360
This is why Shen Que
spared the Lu family.

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,000
His Majesty has empowered him fully.

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,120
This means

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,480
His Majesty wants a sacrificial lamb
from Ningzhou.

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,360
If Shen Que spared the Lu family

39
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,720
for Ye Qinglan's sake,

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,480
then I'll be the next
to face consequences.

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
My lord, you want to...

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,400
Make his beloved mistress

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
suffer more in the Lu family.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,016
(Prosperity Blessed by Heaven)

45
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,440
A'man.

46
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,320
I just went to Madam Lu's chamber.
She's absent.

47
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,560
She left early to oversee Hongzhu Port.

48
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,880
We had been surrounded for days.
She worried it might hurt business,

49
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,680
so she went out

50
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
to reassure the pearlers.

51
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,040
Lu Shi'an.

52
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,800
I'm not here for her.

53
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,640
I came for you.

54
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,600
Lu Shi'an,

55
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,680
this is our divorce agreement.

56
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,000
From now on, let's separate paths.

57
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,280
No obligations remain.

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,520
You want to divorce me?

59
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,840
Since when can wives abandon husbands?

60
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,680
It happens today.

61
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,400
You brought her back.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,320
I don't want to be humiliated anymore.

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm sick of living with you.

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,040
Truth emerges at last.

65
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,000
Since you think I'm worthless
and spineless,

66
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,000
unfit for a prefect's daughter like you,

67
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,080
I'll grant your wish.

68
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,600
Just leave!

69
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,440
I never coveted status.

70
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,320
Ungrateful fool!

71
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
How dare you propose this divorce!

72
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,360
Staying in the Lu family longer

73
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,920
would make me another mad woman.

74
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,800
Father,

75
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,560
I don't like Lu Shi'an.

76
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,760
Let me return home.

77
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
That's not up to you.

78
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
Listen.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,120
Even if you die, die in the Lu family.

80
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,440
Guards! Get her out!

81
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,040
Understood.

82
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,840
Father!

83
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,080
Father!

84
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
Isn't this Lady Jinzhi?

85
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
Master Lu forbade opening gates.

86
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,520
None may admit her.

87
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,760
Understood.

88
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,560
You demanded the divorce!

89
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,120
Why come back now?

90
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,680
Since you left,

91
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,840
there's no need to come back.

92
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
Servants!

93
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,880
Laugh freely. I'm homeless.

94
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,480
I once envied you.

95
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,280
Lu Shi'an made these Mohele dolls?

96
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,680
You got some too?

97
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,080
He once obsessively crafted

98
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
these Mohele dolls.

99
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,760
Look. These are all his creations.

100
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,480
Identical to yours.

101
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,200
Anyone could make these.

102
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
There's no such coincidence.

103
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,080
Look.

104
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,440
Every Mohele doll has a leaf
under its feet.

105
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,560
All personally painted
by Lu Shi'an himself.

106
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,360
How could this be?

107
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
How could it be him?

108
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,360
How could it be him?

109
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,360
Didn't he give all these to you?

110
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:02,920
Not your concern.

111
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,840
You mustn't speak of this to Lu Shi'an.

this was all a misunderstanding,)

I was too willful before.

125
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,520
I neglected your feelings.

127
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,840
Give me another chance.

128
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,920
Don't worry.

129
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,320
I won't treat you as I did before.

130
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,240

131
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,240
Did you know Xia Jinzhi previously?

132
00:10:58,816 --> 00:10:59,560
Don't mention her.

133
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,440
Your birthday is coming.
How would you like to celebrate?

134
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,760
I'd rather not.

135
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
No.

136
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,040
I will make proper arrangements.

137
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,440
A'man, I was too capricious before.

138
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:16,960
I neglected your feelings.

139
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,160
Let's live properly from now on.

140
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,960
Give me another chance, just this once.

141
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,120
Don't worry.
I'll never repeat past mistakes.

142
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,640
Turns out apologies sound

143
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
so detestable.

144
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,240
Finished?

146
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,560
Happy birthday, Mother.

147
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,600
Jin is well. Happy birthday.

148
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,880
My lady, Master Lu wants to see you.

149
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,120
A'man, over here.

150
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,080
Take a seat, A'man.

151
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,640
I went to watch
Xiaofan Restaurant's chefs make these.

152
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,160
All are what you like to eat.

153
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,120
If only Jin were here with us.

154
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,600
Wouldn't it be great
for the three of us?

155
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,000
How is Jin recently?

156
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
She's good.

157
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,880
A'man, today's your birthday.

158
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:18,320
Eat longevity noodles first.

159
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,160
It's okay if you're not hungry.

160
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,360
Let me show you something.

161
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,320
Come on.

162
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,840
Let's go.

163
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,560
Hurry over.

164
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,600
Let's go.

165
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,880
A'man, stand here.

166
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,360
I'll perform magic for you.

167
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,960
Stay there.

168
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,680
A'man,

169
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,680
happy birthday.

170
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
You missed the fiery bayberries
at this year's lantern festival.

171
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,080
I made some for you.

172
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,160
A'man, wait a moment.

173
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560
It's alright.

174
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,400
You needn't prepare these for me.

175
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
No, I insist.

176
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,400
Whatever you wish to see
or do hereafter,

177
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,320
I'll make it happen.

178
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
This is my debt to you.

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,840
Lu Shi'an.

180
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,800
Between you and me,

181
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,240
there's no debt.

182
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,080
Won't you even give me a chance

183
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,200
to make things up?

184
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,200
If only you'd stay by my side,

185
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,720
I'd do anything.

186
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,760
Are you keeping me here
because it will stop Lord Shen

187
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,080
from harassing the Lu family?

188
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,520
Don't forget.

189
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,200
I'm merely a criminal slave.

190
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,760
I know.

191
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:55,480
But my desire to keep you here is true.

192
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,760
My wish to save Jin is also true.

193
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,080
My love for you has always been real.

194
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,600
Enough. Speak no more.

195
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,280
The fireworks I bought are enormous.

196
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,880
My lord,

197
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,360
we've returned
before Lady Ye's birthday.

198
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,480
Why not to there yourself?

199
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:10,496
(Lu Residence)

200
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,680
The sentiment suffices.

201
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,680
My presence would only burden her.

202
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,160
But how will she know it's from you?

203
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,680
She'll know.

204
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,280
Thank you.

205
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,760
A'man. A'man. A'man!

206
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,360
In the past, I had little choice
in many matters.

207
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,000
Why can't you understand this?

208
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Should I understand
that you'll abandon me at any moment?

209
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,520
Within the entire Ningzhou,
only you would do such a thing.
