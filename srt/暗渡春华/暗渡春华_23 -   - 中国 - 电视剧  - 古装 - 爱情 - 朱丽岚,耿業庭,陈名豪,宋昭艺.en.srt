2
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:12,240
Grandmother, you haven't
played Go in years.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,840
What's put you in such a mood today?

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,120
I'm old now,

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,160
always reminiscing about the past.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
Shi'an, you were such a clever child.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,240
At seven years old, you'd watch
your father and me play Go.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,440
Only after watching a few times
did you learn.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,600
You still believe that now?

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,120
The truth is,
Father taught me in advance.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,080
Then we put on a show in front of you.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,280
Father always knew
you thought him dull-witted.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,880
So he used me

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,960
to earn your approval.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,960
Grandmother,

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,960
you believed that after Father's death,

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,360
I became traumatized,

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,640
obsessed with craftsmanship

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,680
and lost the brilliance

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,680
that outshone others of my age.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,440
But Grandmother,

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,640
I haven't changed.

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,080
The son who secretly tried to please you

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,120
is gone.

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,600
Your father

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,920
remained foolish till the end.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,680
He never understood what I wanted

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,800
and what the Lu family needed.

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,240
Invite Concubine Ye
to dine with me tonight.

30
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,680
I'll counsel her

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,200
to bring Jin back home.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,840
A Lu child shouldn't stay

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,320
with outsiders. It's improper.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
Since the poisoning incident,

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
she's been cooking her own meals.

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,960
Grandmother,

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,560
let me talk to her.

38
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,040
A Lu refusing Lu family meals?

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,880
Utterly disgraceful! Summon her.

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,720
Understood.

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,880
Ye Qinglan,

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,960
just go.

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,240
What do you mean?

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,440
I know you planned
to flee with Shen Que tonight.

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,960
I'll let you go.

46
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,200
You'd truly let me go?

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,920
If you stay,

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,960
Grandmother will kill you.

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,080
Kill me? Why?

50
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,040
You dare ask?

51
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,440
Since your birthday

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
when Shen Que attacked me,

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
your affair's become obvious.

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,600
You've shamed me throughout Ningzhou.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680
How could Grandmother tolerate this?

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,280
Only for Jin's sake do I

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,040
let you two shameless lovers escape.

58
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,440
Lu Shi'an! Must you be so crude?

59
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,200
Crude?

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,680
I fell in love with you

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,080
for your pretty face.

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,160
My mother warned me.

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
You're a temptress.

64
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,880
Proven right.

65
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,000
Keeping a wanton woman like you

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,320
brings misfortune to me.

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,400
I'll leave.

68
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Lu Shi'an,

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,280
no matter what,

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,800
thank you.

71
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,240
Thank you for letting me go.

72
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Grandmother,

73
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,200
it's time for us to settle this.

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,840
Why you? Where's Concubine Ye?

75
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,680
She'll arrive shortly.

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,880
I'll join you both for dinner.

77
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,720
Grandmother,

78
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,200
what's this?

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
This soup is called
Swallows Returning Home.

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,360
It was specially prepared for Lady Ye.

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,200
Drinking it

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,800
symbolizes washing away the past,

83
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
marital harmony,

84
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,640
and domestic peace.

85
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
It looks good.

86
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,400
Let me drink it in her stead.

87
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
It's just...

88
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,280
It's just soup.

89
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,760
Shi'an, are you going to defy me now?

90
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,560
Grandmother,

91
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,400
you may not know,

92
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
but I've been defying you for long.

93
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,640
You kept me away from A'man,

94
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,440
while I made her my concubine.

95
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,920
You banned me from obeying my mother,

96
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,680
yet I supported her constantly.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,440
You forbade cosmetics trade,

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,680
but I built my own workshop.

99
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,200
You used Jin's life

100
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,560
to control Shen Que and A'man,

101
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,600
but I stole the antidote.

102
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,640
Even now, you wish to kill her,

103
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,800
but I insist on letting her go.

104
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,520
Shut up!

105
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:02,274
(Duting Station)

106
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,640
My lord, you...

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,720
How did Princess Anhe really die?

108
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,200
You...

109
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,840
Speak!

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,400
You came to Ningzhou
not to investigate pirates.

111
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,040
Say another word,
and I'll cut out your tongue.

112
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,520
Since you've brought this up,

113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
I have nothing left to hide.

114
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:31,880
All visitors deserve hospitality.

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,240
Please sit first, my lord.

116
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
After all, I'm an official
of the Imperial Court.

117
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,480
If you kill me like this,

118
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,840
wouldn't that be too rash?

119
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,000
Calm yourself,

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,920
and let's have a proper conversation.

121
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,720
Please take a seat.

122
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,200
Princess Anhe was poisoned to death?

123
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,160
Yes.

124
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,440
Then why claimed she died in childbirth?

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,160
Princess Anhe discovered
Ningzhou's secret.

126
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,840
That's why she was poisoned.

127
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,880
I was worried more people
would be implicated.

128
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,080
So I reported
that she died in childbirth.

129
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,240
Then I punished the real culprit.

130
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,840
Real culprit?

131
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,600
Sang Huai, postmaster of Duting Station?

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,080
Correct.

133
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,600
That postmaster colluded
with the Lu family,

134
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,520
harboring pirates

135
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,920
and sustaining banditry.

136
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,240
When Princess Anhe learned this,

137
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,200
she couldn't possibly
leave Ningzhou alive.

138
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,840
Then why spared Ye Qinglan?

139
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,560
You've investigated thoroughly, my lord.

140
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,880
That postmaster committed murder,

141
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,280
but the child was innocent.

142
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,160
As the local magistrate,

143
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,000
I would naturally save whom I can.

144
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,680
I was building virtue.

145
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,880
The postmaster killed,
and then faced justice.

146
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,320
This sounds perfectly reasonable.

147
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,400
But upon closer inspection,

148
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
it's more like
letting true culprits escape

149
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
through a staged execution.

150
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,600
My lord,

151
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,040
without evidence,

152
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,120
you shouldn't make baseless claims.

153
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,400
Otherwise, when the Young Lord arrives,

154
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,080
I will face repercussions.

155
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,040
How many knew the postmaster

156
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
colluded with the Lu family?

157
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,560
Master Lu Shouzheng
of the Lu family, maybe.

158
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,880
But he died years ago.

159
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,000
Lady Ye might recall some details.

160
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,840
I won't pursue past matters,

161
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,960
but not today's affair.

162
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,520
You're the future family head.

163
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
Family head?

164
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,280
Do I truly command the Lu family?

165
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
I can't pursue my passions,

166
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,760
keep those I cherish,

167
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,000
nor even decide

168
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,800
my own survival.

169
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,320
Don't drink!

170
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,560
Don't drink it!

171
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,680
You...

172
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,880
Grandmother,

173
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,520
I'm fine. Sit.

174
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Shi'an...

175
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
Grandmother, do you know

176
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,400
how I miss the father
who lifted me skyward

177
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,280
and that

178
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,920
foolish, loving mother?

179
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,840
Nonsense!

180
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,440
My lord,

181
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,120
I've discovered

182
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,144
before Princess Anhe died,

183
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,600
Sang Huai did buy curare plants.

184
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,760
Master Fei's bone analysis
confirms this.

185
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,280
My lord.

186
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,960
My lord!

187
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:33,728
♪Willow buds by the shore,
like soft rains of the past♪

188
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:40,544
♪Creaking gates stir memories
in blossomed court♪

189
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:47,462
♪A paper umbrella
gathers fleeting splendor♪
