=Episode 15=

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,920
Madam.

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,200
Jin.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,120
Madam.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,640
Come on.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,720
No outsider here.
You can call her Mother.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,040
Mother.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,160
I thought

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,200
getting Jin back
would require great effort.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,760
It's the Governor-General's request.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Who would dare refuse?

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,920
Mother.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,360
Father.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,760
Let's stay together forever.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,640
Never part. Okay?

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,440
Let's go.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,240
Did you send someone to kidnap A'man
and implicate my family?

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,080
If I wanted her dead,

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,280
I'd fight her to the death

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,640
when our son passed.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,160
Why bother kidnapping her?

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,920
Jinzhi,

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,240
I... I...

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,520
I spoke in panic.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,720
I didn't doubt you.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,480
Enough with the pretense

28
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,240
and acting.

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,120
Jinzhi.

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
The Lu family faces crisis.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,480
We must overcome this together.

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,000
I can't even send word to my father.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can't help you.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,240
Oh, right.

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,520
Your concubine
is in Lord Shen's chambers.

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,560
Go beg her

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,840
to spare the Lu family.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,160
Xia Jinzhi.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,280
We are husband and wife.

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
Must we torment each other?

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,680
When did you ever treat me as your wife?

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
Then when did you ever see me

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,240
as your husband after we got married?

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,120
My lady,

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,320
the Master forbids
offerings for Lady Qin.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,360
Perhaps we should go back.

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
You may go back now.

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
I want to stay here alone.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,400
If they find it,

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,520
just tell them I escaped myself.

51
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,080
Today's your birthday.

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,160
Perhaps the Master has prepared gifts.

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,320
Let's go back now.

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,280
Since my mother's passing,

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,240
who would ever remember my birthday?

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,000
Let me speak with her awhile.

57
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
(Mother,)

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
(are all concubine's daughters
destined to suffer?)

59
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
(I really miss you.)

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,120
Lady.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,200
Your departed loved ones

62
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,960
might not want to see you so soon.

63
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,720
None of your concern.

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,320
Water ghosts might dwell
beneath these waters.

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,360
Take this.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,000
It'll ward off ghosts if you jump.

67
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,400
(Mother,)

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,000
(after you left,)

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,400
(this is my first birthday gift.)

70
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,360
Father.

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,600
Father.

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Father, I beg you.

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,160
I don't want to marry Lu Shi'an.

74
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,560
My heart belongs to another.

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,720
If I can't find him,

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,640
I'll remain unwed.

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,440
Nonsense!

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
You've always resented
your concubine-born status.

79
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,640
So

80
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
I arranged your marriage with a merchant
as his proper wife.

81
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,800
If you bear a legitimate heir,

82
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,080
you'll become the matriarch.

83
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
Do you understand?

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,040
If you insist on defying me,
you'll remain a concubine's daughter.

85
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,920
From now on,

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,120
you're no daughter of mine.

87
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,000
- Father!
- Hmph!

A'man.

105
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,680
Jin.

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,160
A'man.

107
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,640
Come on.

108
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,840
What's wrong?

109
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,840
Do you hear someone calling me outside?

110
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,760
No.

111
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,720
It's too hot.
It must be the cicadas singing.

112
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,440
Right, Jin?

113
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,200
No entry!

114
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,160
I'll just take a look. I won't go in.

115
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,520
Step back.

116
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,560
Jin, come have some watermelon.

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,440
Okay.

118
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,080
Let's have this piece.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Jin, don't eat too much.
Or you'll get a stomachache tonight.

120
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,600
You're so contradictory.

121
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,160
You ask her to eat when it's hot,
and worry she'll get cold.

122
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
Are you afraid of heat or cold?

123
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,920
I'm disciplining my kid.
Stop interrupting.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,840
Watch your tongue.

125
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,480
Understand, Jin?

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,280
Good girl.

127
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,440
She's too harsh.

128
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,320
Go. Bring a piece to Mr. Gao,

129
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,920
okay?

130
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
Okay.

131
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Take it slow.

132
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
You should also have a piece.

133
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
You enjoy opposing me.

134
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,400
Alright.

135
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,560
Just have a piece.

136
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,480
Let's go. I'll show you something.

137
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,600
Let's go.

138
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,960
What are you doing?

139
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,360
Jin asked me yesterday

140
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,440
about Xiangshan Hermit's poem:

141
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,256
I know it rained at night outside,
for the plantain leaves spoke first.

142
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
She asked what it really means.

143
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,480
I tried explaining,
but couldn't make it clear.

144
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
And it hasn't rained lately.

145
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,360
So as her foster father,

146
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,040
I must create
a rain-on-plantain-leaves scene myself

147
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,280
for her to listen.

148
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
At Jin's age,

149
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,120
she's full of "whys".

150
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,880
No one in the Lu family
explained things to her before.

151
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,560
But you've shown patience,

152
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,240
going to great lengths to teach her.

153
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,240
There are some things

154
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,280
you won't truly believe

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,080
or understand

156
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
until you've lived through

157
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
or experienced yourself.

158
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,320
What do you think, Lady Ye?

159
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,320
Shen Que.

160
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,480
I know what you want to say.

161
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
But right now,

162
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
I can't.

163
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,280
You don't have to answer
what I haven't asked.

164
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,520
Plantain leaves may whisper first,

165
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,640
but rain must fall first.

166
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,240
Wait.

167
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,520
I'll bring rain

168
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,720
for you and the entire Ningzhou.

Jin,

196
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,120
I brought you watermelon.

197
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,680
Wake up and eat.

198
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,120
The sun's baking your bottom.

199
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,280
Little lazybones.

200
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,560
Get up.

201
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,400
Jin?

202
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,720
Jin?

203
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,000
Jin!

204
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,880
Jin!

205
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
How is she?

206
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,120
Gao Fu?

207
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,040
It seems like poisoning.

208
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,120
Seems like poisoning?

209
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,080
This is beyond my expertise.

210
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,120
I can't identify the poison now.

211
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,680
A'man,

212
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,400
did Jin eat anything unusual lately?

213
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,160
I asked her to only eat what I give her

214
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,640
and never take food from others.

215
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,160
She wouldn't disobey.

216
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,560
If it's a food-borne poison,

217
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
this antidote will work.

218
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
If not...

219
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,400
What then?

220
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,480
The physicians have all left.

221
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,680
I wonder if Jin's awake.

222
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,120
A'man.

223
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,960
Stay calm.

224
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,760
Have some water.

225
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,160
How is it? Is she awake?

226
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,000
Jin hasn't woken.

227
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,840
Based on multiple diagnoses,

228
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,920
Jin was poisoned.

229
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,160
Could it be

230
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,480
that someone tried to harm her?

231
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,480
Who'd be so cruel?

232
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,840
She's just a child.

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,560
Gao Fu,

234
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,040
is there a way to detoxify her?

235
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,280
I've used antidote pills.

236
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,096
The physicians also prepared potions.

237
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
Please rest assured.

238
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,200
Jin is safe for now.

239
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,800
No.

240
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,320
I must check on her.

241
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,080
She won't return.

242
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:40,128
Finish what you were saying.

243
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,080
I'm sorry, my lord.

244
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,360
This poison is too vile.

245
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,880
I truly can't identify its origin.

246
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,000
Moreover, it has
a long incubation period.

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,744
It doesn't seem
to be administered recently.

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,040
The necrotic bruises on Jin's skin
are caused by blood stasis.

249
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,160
Besides,

250
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,240
the cruelty

251
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,680
of this poison

252
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,480
lies in gradually congesting
all blood flow,

253
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,360
until...

254
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
Is there still hope?

255
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,560
My master once mentioned

256
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,320
in sinister detox methods,

257
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,080
leeches engorged with fresh blood
can be medicinal.

258
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,760
Okay. I'll go find some now.

259
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,000
- I'll go with you.
- No need.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,880
You stay here and watch over them.

261
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,720
- Don't tell her yet.
- Understood.

It's enough.

What are you doing?

277
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,184
Didn't you say it needs fresh blood?

278
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,560
It must be blood from immediate family.

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
In other words, Master Lu's blood.

280
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,280
Then take this to Lu Shi'an immediately.

281
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,000

it must be used immediately.

just have someone bring Lu Shi'an over.

285
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,000
Remember.
