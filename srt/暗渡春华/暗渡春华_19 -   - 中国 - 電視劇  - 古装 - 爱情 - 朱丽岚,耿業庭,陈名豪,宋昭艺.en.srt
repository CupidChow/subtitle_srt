2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,896
Grandmother, watch your steps.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,960
Everyone,

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,080
these past few days,

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,920
the Lu family's worried you all.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm very grateful to you all.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,800
- No need for that, Madam Lu.
- No need for that, Madam Lu.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,840
- Congratulations, Madam Lu.
- Congratulations, Madam Lu.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,720
Okay.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,600
Well, it's been hard for you these days.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,400
Fortunately, it's all over now.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,960
I declare Hongzhu Port
officially reopened!

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,440
- Great!
- Great!

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,840
- Great!
- Great!

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,080
Great!

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,120
Everyone,

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,640
to celebrate
overcoming this trial together,

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,920
please spread the word.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,640
My grandmother
will distribute lucky coins!

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,560
- Great!
- Great!

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,240
That's mine!

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,120
Watch your head!

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,600
Hurry, hurry!

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,720
- Don't drop it!
- Let me get that!

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,520
No pushing!

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Stop shoving!

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,200
Toss it here!

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,440
That's mine!

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,880
Relax. There's plenty.

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,840
You can go now.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,040
The Lu family is safe.

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,360
You have to release me.

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,200
Enough nonsense. Get lost!

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,040
Hmph!

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,640
My lord, was my divination accurate?

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,240
15 days, not one day more

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
and not one day less.

38
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,480
You have to release me.

39
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,840
Why are you so confident?

40
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,560
You're just a mere Governor-General.

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,120
I've met

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,840
even higher-ranked officials.

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,600
My fate is bound to Ningzhou's.

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,560
Your paltry authority can't touch me.

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,240
You said your fate
is bound to Ningzhou's?

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,360
No. You're bound
to Prefect Xia and the Lu family,

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,960
not Ningzhou's people.

48
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,400
But the people trust me.

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,960
They trust you

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,560
so you deceive and exploit them?

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,320
The Imperial Court levied pearls
from Ningzhou,

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,760
stipulating that five taels of silver
be given to pearlers per pearl.

53
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:47,680
But they only paid
half a string of coins,

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,320
less than a tenth of that.

55
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,560
The rest lined their pockets.

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,040
Yet even so,

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,880
when the court allocated
hundreds of taels

58
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,360
of silver yearly for diving equipment,

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
they also embezzled funds.

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,360
Pearlers could only dive
with hemp ropes,

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,000
causing countless deaths.

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,320
The Imperial Court grants
15 taels of silver

63
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
to each deceased pearler,

64
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,440
which they also stole.

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,600
In Ningzhou,

66
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,160
is a pearler's life worth
2 measly taels of silver?

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What you just said
has nothing to do with me?

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,120
Nothing to do with you?

69
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,080
All funds sent to Ningzhou

70
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,960
filled Prefect Xia and the Lus' coffers.

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,320
But what's strange is,

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,800
the people remain ignorant

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,240
and even sing their praises.

74
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,200
They willingly slave away for them.

75
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,360
Thanks largely to you.

76
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,600
Immortal Song, how many of them

77
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
were sent to their deaths

78
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
through your witchcraft?

79
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,440
And how many people,

80
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,680
who nearly exposed
their schemes just like Lady Ye,

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,400
were killed by your magic?

82
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,120
Don't you deserve death?

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
You dare not kill me.

84
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,400
I know

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
the imperial decree arrived.

86
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,400
You even released the Lus.

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,120
You must release me too.

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,360
But here's what you don't know.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,760
Imperial decrees

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
can have light and shadow versions.

91
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,320
Gao Fu.

92
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,840
Yes.

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,120
Take a good look.

94
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
You can't escape.

95
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,720
Prefect Xia and the Lus won't, either.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,440
No.

97
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,880
This can't be true!

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
If it were true,

99
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,320
you'd fear me revealing it.

100
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
You wouldn't let me see it!

101
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,320
You won't get out of here alive.

102
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
I've said it before.

103
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,640
Sunlight will mean your death.

104
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:43,008
(Prefect's Mansion)

105
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,880
My lord, he's gone to the prison.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,880
Immortal Song is dead.

107
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
Let him be.

108
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,600
At this point,

109
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,360
he can only vent his anger
on that old hag.

110
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,120
My lord,

111
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,440
these fruits

112
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,960
are local specialties of Ningzhou,
gifted by the people to the Lu family.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,760
Though humble in value,

114
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,720
they carry sincere goodwill.

115
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Please try some, my lord.

116
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,800
No need.

117
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,400
I only hope you won't betray
Ningzhou's people.

118
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
After all, wealth has its limits.

119
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,040
But hearts cannot be deceived.

120
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,240
We invited you here

121
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
to request that you return

122
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,000
Concubine Ye and her daughter

123
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,280
to their rightful home.

124
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,400
No, I can't.

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,480
Why?

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,880
His Majesty has declared
the Lu family innocent.

127
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,760
Yet you still hold our members captive.

128
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,640
Aren't you inviting criticism?

129
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,720
If this is your concern,

130
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
there's nothing more to discuss.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Jin was poisoned under your roof.

132
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,800
I fear her return

133
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,400
would be unsafe.

134
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,000
After all that's happened,

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,640
you should know one thing.

136
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,440
Ningzhou stands forever,

137
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,280
while Governor-Generals will change.

138
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,880
Wouldn't staying with you
endanger them further?

139
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,400
It's true that Ningzhou
will stand forever.

140
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,280
But it belongs to all, not a select few.

141
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,200
I'll see for myself

142
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,120
whether the Lu family
will also stand forever.

143
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:40,256
(Duting Station)

144
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,200
Why looking at me like that?

145
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,520
As if I've suffered great injustice.

146
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,760
I'm fine.

147
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,360
Drink alone in misery when you're fine?

148
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,520
Storm the Lu residence when you're fine?

149
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,760
I want to eradicate
the Lu family completely.

150
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,080
But I never imagined
their roots ran so deep

151
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,048
with connections reaching the heavens.

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,880
What a pity. This chance is wasted.

153
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,280
They say a powerful outsider
can't beat the local tyrant.

154
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,280
What kind of place did you choose?

155
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,960
Another chance will come.

156
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,120
Do you think me useless?

157
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,040
I did.

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
When we first met,

159
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,840
I thought you were just another official
profiteering in Ningzhou.

160
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,000
But after getting to know you,

161
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,440
I saw a responsible, principled man

162
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,200
with a hint of charm.

163
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,000
You could've stayed uninvolved.

164
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,960
Yet you pursued
Princess Anhe's case diligently.

165
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,000
The Young Lord must mean
much to you, right?

166
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Yes.

167
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,320
We survived life-and-death together.

168
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,640
Tell me.

169
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,320
Is he truly as they said?

170
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,320
What did they say about him?

171
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,120
They said that he guards the northwest,

172
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,880
stands eight feet tall,

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,360
dark as coal,

174
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,600
and built like a tower.

175
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,560
What nonsense is this?

176
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,240
The Young Lord is handsome.

177
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,480
Much like myself.

178
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,040
I don't believe it.

179
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,680
Mark my words.

180
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,960
When you meet him,

181
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,840
you'll be enchanted.

182
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,560
Maybe

183
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,040
you will even marry him.

184
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
I'd never wed a tower.

185
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,160
I'd rather marry you

186
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
than some human tower.

187
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,960
Come one. Another drink.

Marry me?

190
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,680

What a coincidence.

194
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,560

(Shen Que,)

(I can't let you risk yourself alone.)

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,960
You're awake?
You drank heavily last night.

214
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,040
Come eat.

215
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,640
You...

216
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,280
You can really drink a lot.

217
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,720
Let's eat.

218
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,920
I've given this careful thought.

219
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,040
I still need to go back.

220
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,240
Why? It's not good here?

221
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,680
Why insist on going back?

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,320
Your place is good.

223
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,480
But because of their dirty schemes,

224
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,080
I've narrowly
escaped death several times.

225
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
And they got Mu killed.

226
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,440
Now even Jin and you
are caught up in this.

227
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,160
Though the Lu family's troubles
seem settled,

228
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,440
your position in Ningzhou
will become extremely precarious.

229
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
If I insist on staying here,

230
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
it'll give our enemies
ammunition against you.

231
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:52,352
They'll accuse you of detaining
a merchant's concubine,

232
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,560
ruining your reputation.

233
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,840
I don't care.

234
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,160
But I do.

235
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,440
You have more important things to do.

236
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Don't risk losing the greater
for my sake.

237
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,280
And I think

238
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,880
you should plant an informant
within the Lu family.

239
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm the perfect candidate.

240
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,640
A'man, I don't need you
to risk yourself for me.

241
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,920
Listen to me, Shen Que.

242
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,400
This case concerns my family too.

243
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,800
I can't just sit idle
while others do the work.

244
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,440
Just promise me one thing.

245
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,720
Please take Jin to somewhere safe.

246
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,040
Get her far from this den of vipers.

247
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,480
Shen Que,

248
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
you're the only one I can trust now.

249
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,320
Okay.

250
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:46,752
I wouldn't feel at ease
if Jin is back to the Lu family, either.

251
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,240
You can go back,

252
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
but don't act recklessly.

253
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,560
Don't worry.

254
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,400
Even if you unsheathe your blade,
I'll be the hand that wields the blade.

255
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,800
Strike wherever needed.
I'll handle the consequences.

256
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,480
Okay.

257
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,280
Let's eat.

258
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:03,960
My lord,

259
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,640
you've been studying
the decree for hours.

260
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,000
Is there a problem?

261
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,160
Something feels off.

262
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,200
I can't shake this uneasy feeling.

263
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,280
Any movements at Duting Station?

264
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Lord Shen has taken men and departed.
They say he'll be gone for two days.

265
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,440
Good.

266
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
You go there tonight.

267
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,160
Understood.

268
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,480
A'man, I thought you'd leave with Jin.

269
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,480
I'm glad you stayed.

270
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,960
You said the antidote
came from your grandmother.

271
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,280
Let me ask you.

272
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,320
How did she obtain the antidote?

273
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
What's her connection
to Jin's poisoning?

274
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,120
You know

275
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,640
that Chenghuan knows
some shamanic healing skills.

276
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,360
I originally asked Chenghuan
to prepare medicine.

277
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,160
But Grandmother feared
shamanic remedies were too potent

278
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,840
and might harm Jin.

279
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:11,120
So she didn't give it to me.

280
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,680
And I-I took it without permission.

281
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Jin's recovered anyway.
Can't we drop this matter?

282
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,640
Jin is your daughter.

283
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,600
How could you tolerate
someone harming her?

284
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,000
I want to find the culprit.

285
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,080
Will you help me?

286
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,360
Jin is our child.

287
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,280
How could I remain idle?

288
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,640
But A'man,

289
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,240
let's plan this carefully, okay?

290
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,720
Your words are comfort enough.

291
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,320
