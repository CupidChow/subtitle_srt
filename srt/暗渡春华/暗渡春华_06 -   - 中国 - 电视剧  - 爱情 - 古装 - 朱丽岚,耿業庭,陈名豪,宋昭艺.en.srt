2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,600
Dead twice in half a month.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,680
Take it one day at a time.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,480
Live differently.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,480
At least,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,320
you won't compromise yourself,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,200
expecting a coward to protect you.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,640
In these woods,

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,640
are ghosts watching us?

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,520
They are not ghosts.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,800
They're wolves.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,920
Wolves?

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,600
We just emerged from the graveyard.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
They smell the scent of death.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,760
The scent of death?

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,360
Exactly.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,960
They wait for your strength to fade.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,280
Then they'll strike immediately.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,920
Even if

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,400
we yielded

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,960
and humbled ourselves at every turn,
it is all in vain.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,120
It only reminds them

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,480
that you

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,320
are easy prey.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,200
Against them,

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
this is what works.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,720
I can't.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,000
Keep your wrist steady.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,120
Your aim must be true.

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,360
Killing wolves is like killing men.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,440
The one who shoots first

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,120
gets to live.

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,480
Three.

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,320
Two.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,280
One.

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,440
My lord.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,080
My lord.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,800
Are you using me as bait
or hunting wolves?

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,520
Hunting wolves.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,080
Well, thanks a lot.

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,080
Lady Ye.

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,680
These are...

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,800
Proper clothes.

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,840
Since you're returning,

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,000
return with dignity.

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,880
I will survive

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,600
for Jin to call me mother.

48
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,240
I will survive

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,400
for those

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,680
who tried to kill me.

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,560
I'll make them pay.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
Xia Jinzhi caused your death.

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,240
Don't haunt us.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,960
I'll burn more joss paper.

55
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,200
Move on to the afterlife.

56
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
Please don't come after us.

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,720
I'll burn more joss paper.

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,120
Shi'an, come over here.

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,720
What?

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,240
Wear this.

61
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,480
No. I'm not wearing it.

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,240
Be good.

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,440
It's for protection.

64
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,240
If Concubine Ye returns...

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,120
What?

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,760
Sh-She's back!

67
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,320
What?

68
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,200
She's back!

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,880
What?

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,920
Right there!

71
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,680
She's there!

72
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,320
No one's there.

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,640
Truly no one, mother.

74
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,160
No one?

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,800
She was here moments ago.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,600
Master Shi'an.

77
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,360
Wh-What's the shouting?

78
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,640
You saw the ghost too?

79
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,080
No.

80
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,720
Lord Shen's here to make arrests.

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,640
A-Arrests?

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,240
My lord,

83
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,680
why arrest my maid?

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Indeed, my lord.

85
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,680
Look.

86
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,240
If the maid made a mistake,

87
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,400
just send her to the office.

88
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,000
No need to trouble yourself

89
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,360
with judgment here.

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,480
My lord, you mean...

91
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,800
The art of being an official

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
lies in the play

93
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,680
between reality and illusion.

94
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,720
Sometimes, real actions are needed.

95
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,800
Lord Xia, am I

96
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,080
right?

97
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,560
Yes! Absolutely right!

98
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,400
Danxiang,

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,200
by imperial law,

100
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,880
the purchase of toxic medicines

101
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,600
requires prescriptions, limited amounts,
and real-name registration.

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,480
If conducted without authorization,

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,200
both buyer and seller
shall receive 100 strokes.

104
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Yet you

105
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,280
used forged prescriptions
to purchase arsenic

106
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,440
in small quantities
at multiple pharmacies.

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,200
Little by little, it adds up.

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,640
Who were you planning to harm

109
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,440
with all this arsenic?

110
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,360
Shi'an.

111
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,520
Shi'an!

112
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,400
It wasn't my son.

113
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
She told my son
that it was regular safflower.

114
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Whether that's true or not,

115
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,280
my son knew nothing of this.

116
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,280
Look at you.

117
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
M-My lord,

118
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,400
I-I did buy arsenic,

119
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,520
but only to poison rats
in the courtyard.

120
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,400
P-Please don't falsely accuse me.

121
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,120
Poison rats in the courtyard?

122
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
Did you use it elsewhere?

123
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,880
I feared harming Lady Jinzhi,

124
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,320
so I never used it.

125
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Really?

126
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,360
Maybe you should think harder?

127
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
No, I didn't.

128
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,040
Gao Fu.

129
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
My lord.

130
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,080
Bring your treasure in.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
My lord.

132
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,680
My lord, this is...

133
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,520
Since she can't recall,

134
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,920
let the dog jog her memory.

135
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,000
Go.

136
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Go away.

137
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Lord Xia.

138
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,600
A good dog. It doesn't bite.

139
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,480
Smell.

140
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,960
Smell.

141
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,120
My lord,

142
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,760
something's wrong here.

143
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,200
Isn't this where Concubine Ye collapsed?

144
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,840
Collect evidence and investigate.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,560
Understood.

146
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,960
My lord,

147
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,440
there's poison.

148
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,920
Madam Lu claimed

149
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,920
Concubine Ye collapsed in your chamber,

150
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,400
and we found

151
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,120
bloodstains and residue on the floor.

152
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,560
The dogs also detected arsenic.

153
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,080
What?

154
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you still plan to brush this off

155
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,520
as coincidence?

156
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,760
My lord,

157
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,800
look.

158
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Ye Qinglan is already dead.

159
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,800
No plaintiff, and no evidence remains.

160
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,920
Maybe

161
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,320
we should drop the case?

162
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,200
Who says there's no plaintiff?

163
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,160
I am the plaintiff.

164
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,040
Ghost!

165
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,560
Ghost!

166
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,880
Sh-She's back!

167
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,800
Shi'an.

168
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,320
A'man?

169
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,800
Shi'an.

170
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,720
Are you a human or ghost?

171
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,720
That depends on whether
some wish me a human

172
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,720
or ghost.

173
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,360
Ghost! You must be a ghost!

174
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,880
Stay back! Don't come closer!

175
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,400
Madam?

176
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,160
Don't come any closer!

177
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,560
Go find Xia Jinzhi.

178
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
It wasn't us.

179
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,720
Lu...

180
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,040
Shi...

181
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,680
An.

182
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,680
Mother.

183
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,160
Mother.

184
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,240
You took arsenic.

185
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,160
You shouldn't be alive.

186
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,400
Lady Jinzhi,

187
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,640
long time no see.

188
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,080
I did it.

189
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,480
Who told you
to kill Lady Jinzhi's child?

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,560
I wanted you dead.

191
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,400
Danxiang,

192
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,280
you'd better think carefully

193
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,600
who truly ordered this?

194
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,160
Danxiang, your actions

195
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
make me appear dishonorable.

196
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,800
