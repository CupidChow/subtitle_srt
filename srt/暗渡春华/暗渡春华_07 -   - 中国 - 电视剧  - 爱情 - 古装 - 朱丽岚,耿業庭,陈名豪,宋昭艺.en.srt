2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,960
Danxiang died in prison.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,440
Okay.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,240
Not surprised?

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,280
Did she reveal anything?

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,960
She didn't say a word.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,320
Just as before,

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,040
she took all the blame herself.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,760
Never thought someone like Xia Jinzhi

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,320
would have such a loyal servant.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,200
Not convinced?

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,200
Convinced?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,840
Loyalty is a noble virtue.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,240
What a pity.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,400
A noble person takes revenge

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,880
without hesitation.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,800
You've learned well.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,640
A good blade needs a strong hand

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,760
to charge forward.

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,800
Where to strike next?

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,960
People's hearts.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,760
Uncle.

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,320
Yes?

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Uncle. Uncle.

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,800
Lady Jin, what's wrong?

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,840
Uncle, here's some candy for you.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,440
Thank you, Lady Jin.

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,120
I brought you a little toy too.

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,160
Thank you, uncle. You're amazing!

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,320
Just tell me what you want next time.

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Okay.

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,320
You've grown taller.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Jin.

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,040
Mother, look.
This uncle made me a toy ox.

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,880
So pretty. Did you thank him?

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,080
Yes.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,400
You spend too much each time.
Don't bring her gifts next time.

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,120
Just a simple craft from the mountains.

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,080
As long as Lady Jin likes it.

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,880
Look at you, all sweaty from running.

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,240
(You're okay.)

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
(That's good.)

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,360
Mother, didn't you promise
to take me back?

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,320
When will that be?

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,920
Jin, be patient for a few more days.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,520
How much longer?

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,160
Come here.

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,240
Hey.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,320
When you can

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,320
eat properly and sleep on time.

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,200
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,320
Get out!

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,480
Madam, you haven't been well.

54
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,760
To avoid disturbing your peace,

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,520
I'll take Jin to live with me.

56
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,560
What did you say?

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,720
Do you fear I'd harm
my own granddaughter?

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,480
Nonsense!

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,720
I've raised her with the finest care.

60
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,000
If you take her away at will,

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,920
what about my dignity?

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,680
My daughter is safest with me.

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,360
I'd never harm her,

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,560
nor use her as leverage.

65
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,880
What are you implying?

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,160
Are you accusing me of harming Jin?

67
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,800
Of course not.

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,240
You're being paranoid, Jinzhi.

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,760
I believe you would never harm Jin.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Though Jin is your blood,

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,880
the matriarch is still the matriarch.

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,320
Jinzhi is her rightful mother.

73
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,080
By our presence,

74
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
this household doesn't answer to you.

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
Then who does this household answer to?

76
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,040
- Madam.
- Madam.

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,720
Mother, why come personally?

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
I heard of the commotion.

79
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,064
So I came to see for myself.

80
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,000
But I found chaos before entering.

81
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,480
These days,

82
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,880
I've been offering incense
at the ancestral hall.

83
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,400
For three days,

84
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
the incense kept breaking.

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,120
It's the ancestors

86
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,960
blaming you for throwing the household

87
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
into chaos.

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,600
It was all this concubine's fault.

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,000
It was her.

90
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,360
Enough.

91
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,160
When the wife is virtuous,
the husband suffers less.

92
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,480
When the son is filial,
the father feels at ease.

93
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,040
As mothers, as wives, and as concubines,

94
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,840
you must never let the quarrels
of the inner quarters

95
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,600
disturb the fortune of the Lu family.

96
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,200
After all,

97
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,440
it is the men who must bear

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,880
the weight of the Lu family's legacy.

99
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Madam,

100
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
I just want my daughter back.

101
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,320
Please grant me this wish.

102
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
Ye Qinglan,

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
given your current status,

104
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,480
keeping Jin by your side,

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
if words get out,

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,320
when she grows up,

107
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,000
she'll struggle
to find a decent marriage.

108
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,560
If you

109
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,680
don't trust them to raise her,

110
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,920
I'll take her with me.

111
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,280
What?

112
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,720
You don't even trust me?

113
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,800
Thank you for your kindness.

114
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:06,112
(Prefect's Mansion)

115
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
Useless!

116
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,400
You run crying to us
over a little grievance?

117
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,760
After all I've taught you,

118
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,000
you still can't handle
that shameless woman?

119
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,800
Father,

120
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,960
Danxiang is dead.

121
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,680
No one can help me now.

122
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,320
You...

123
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,120
No.

124
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
If used properly,

125
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,480
even the dead can be useful.

126
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,320
Is everyone in this house dead asleep?

127
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,960
Can't you hear this racket?

128
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,880
My lady.

129
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,960
Worthless fools.

130
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,160
Who cares about their numbers?

131
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,560
Open this gate now!

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,480
Drive these troublemakers out!

133
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,160
Who's the fool

134
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,280
daring to disturb the Lu family's gates
in the dead of night?

135
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,640
Who touched me?

136
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,960
- My lady, it wasn't me.
- It wasn't me.

137
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,280
No peace at all.

138
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,456
My lady, behind you...

139
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,800
What's wrong?

140
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:44,560
My lady, what's wrong?

141
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,080
What's wrong?

142
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
Ghost!

143
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,280
Ghost!

144
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,120
Mother.

145
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Mother.

146
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,088
Mother, what's wrong?

147
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,160
Mother.

148
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
What happened?

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Mother.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,480
Ghost!

151
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,040
Mother!

152
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,080
Mother!

153
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,120
Wake up!

154
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,760
What's happening here?

155
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,000
Madam Lu

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,200
seems possessed.

157
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,040
Why are you here?

158
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,400
My neighbors are making
such a commotion.

159
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,320
How could I be excluded from this?

160
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,400
What's going on here?

161
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,040
Prefect Xia

162
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,360
invited Immortal Song
to exorcise the Lu family.

163
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,760
W-What immortal?

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,896
Invite the immortal?

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
Yes, invite the immortal.

166
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,200
Those by the sea live by the sea.

167
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,160
Half of Ningzhou's fate
lies in the ocean,

168
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,640
half in the winds.

169
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,120
The more unpredictable fortune is,

170
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,480
the firmer their belief
in spirits grows.

171
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,960
Like Prefect Xia,

172
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,480
Immortal Song has won
the people's hearts in Ningzhou.

173
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,920
They don't worship Buddha or Mazu,

174
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,120
but some backwater immortal?

175
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,840
How can Buddha and Mazu

176
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,280
compare to this immortal

177
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,360
who plays it by ear?

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
I could play it by ear myself.

179
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,160
She's coming.

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,720
Look, it's Immortal Song.

181
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
Hush! Don't speak.

182
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:42,880
(Lu Residence)

183
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,120
(Looks like)

184
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,000
(they're after the poor soul
next to me again.)

185
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,560
Immortal Song arrives.

186
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,280
All evil begone.

187
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,600
Pray devoutly.

188
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,520
Banish misfortune.

189
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:15,757
♪Grind flesh between grit and stone♪

190
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:22,189
♪Sink into pain,
only then are pearls born♪

191
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:29,485
♪Wait until abyssal darkness
