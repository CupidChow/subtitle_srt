2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,160
I was healing at the temple.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,720
You shouted and drew my pursuers here,

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,800
making my poison flare up.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,000
So, you must take responsibility.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,280
If you had acted faster

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,880
against those two hooligans,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,080
I wouldn't have drawn them here.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,360
Why blame me?

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,872
Besides,

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,560
I have no money

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,840
or medical skills.
How can I take responsibility?

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,520
Suck my Gu poison out.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,776
You're shameless!

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,280
Shameless. Just kill me.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,240
Of course, I won't kill you.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,360
But I will certainly investigate

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,880
which family dares

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,120
harbor criminal slaves.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,768
Stop struggling.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,432
Just give in to me.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,440
Let go of me.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,200
According to the law,

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,160
harboring criminal slaves warrants

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,960
extermination of nine clans.

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Since we can't see each other now,

27
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,320
I won't blame you for your offense.

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,440
(I can't die yet.)

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,400
(Shi'an and Jin are waiting.
I must go home.)

Hey.

Hey. Wake up.

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,440
(Did he die?)

40
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,200
(Will the officials trace this to me?)

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,440
Hey.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,904
Hey.

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,880
Wake up.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
(Thank god. He's alive.)

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,136
Hey.

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,960
Are you okay?

47
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,000
Then I'll leave now.

48
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,120
(Why is he delirious?)

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,680
(Did I fail to fully remove
the love poison?)

50
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,816
Get off!

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,856
My lord.

52
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,920
Gao Fu.

53
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,200
You've finally awakened.

54
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,720
You were poisoned,

55
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,248
but luckily,

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,480
it was removed timely.

57
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,840
You're fine now.

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,520
When you arrived last night,

59
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,440
did I behave improperly?

60
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,720
(Gao Fu, Censor)
When I arrived,

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,360
corpses were everywhere.

62
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,320
When I found you,

63
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,600
this lady was calling out to you.

64
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,280
Fearing she was an assassin,
I detained her

65
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,560
and awaited your command.

66
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,960
So she and I...

67
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,560
Nothing happened between us.

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,120
Last night, you begged me
to detoxify you.

69
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,120
Then you suddenly went mad.

70
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,960
During the struggle,

71
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,520
you collapsed unconscious.

72
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,960
I thought you died,

73
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,640
so I kept calling out to you.

74
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
And then he arrived.

75
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:27,040
Right.

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,064
Good.

77
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,800
But why did you ask it, my lord?

78
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,056
No reason.

79
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,080
Have you identified those assassins?

80
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,760
We eliminated

81
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
all ambushers outside.

82
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,080
We kept one alive.

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,480
But I didn't expect he would kill
himself, leaving no information.

84
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,960
However, they all had a tattoo
on their hands.

85
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,440
Here's the pattern.

86
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,960
But no records match it in our archives.

87
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,000
It seems Ningzhou Prefecture
is really extraordinary.

88
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,920
Perhaps,

89
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
this tattoo could be our breakthrough.

90
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,720
Figure it out right away.

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,768
Yes.

92
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:14,848
My lord.

93
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,800
This lady...

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,480
- Silence her.
- Yes.

95
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
Wait.

96
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
You have last words?

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,520
I've seen this tattoo before.

98
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,880
Where did you see it?

99
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,480
I was framed.

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,680
Returning would be dangerous.

101
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,880
Only you can help me.

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,240
Resolve my problem at the Lu family
on Xiaowen Road tomorrow noon.

103
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,312
And I'll tell you.

104
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,400
You dare threaten me?

105
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,920
Consider your status first.

106
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,880
My status doesn't matter.

107
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
What matters is

108
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,360
that I know

109
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,920
what you want to know.

110
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,240
(As you wished, I'm here.)

111
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,120
(Imperial decree)

112
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,120
I'm Prefect of Ningzhou.

113
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,160
Greetings, my lord.

114
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,320
- Greetings, my lord.
- Greetings, my lord.

115
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,680
Your visit here is...

116
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Has the Young Lord
from the Duke Xuan's Mansion

117
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,400
already arrived in Ningzhou?

118
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Gao Fu.

119
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,440
Open it.

120
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,376
Watch out.

121
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,360
Lord Xia.

122
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,320
The Young Lord was returning
to Bianzhou to visit family

123
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,800
and stopped to rest
in Ningzhou Prefecture.

124
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,880
Before he'd even left the capital,

125
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,840
assassins were already lying in wait.

126
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,840
Had I not led the vanguard,

127
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,720
this blade would have been plunged
into his body.

128
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,720
Tell me,

129
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,800
who exactly is it

130
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,160
that wants the Young Lord dead
so desperately?

131
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,160
I will order
an investigation immediately.

132
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,320
I'll find out swiftly

133
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,600
and give you a full account.

134
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,640
Lord Xia.

135
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,760
I've searched all over Ningzhou

136
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,120
looking for you.

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
I'm exhausted now.

138
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,720
Conduct the investigation here.

139
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,360
I'll be waiting.

140
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,600
Yes.

141
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,800
You seem

142
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,160
somewhat familiar to me.

143
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
Lord Shen,

144
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
she is my concubine.

145
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
She rarely ventures out.

146
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,480
You must be mistaken.

147
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,080
What crime

148
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
has she committed?

149
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,960
My lord,

150
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,200
this vile woman committed adultery
at the Goddess Temple last night,

151
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,960
defiling the gods

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,640
and causing me to lose my child.

153
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,960
She deserves death!

154
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,520
Lan,

155
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't regret loving you sincerely.

156
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
We were just bound by longing,

157
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,400
but not by fate.

158
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,840
Then I wasn't mistaken.

159
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,040
When I was attacked
in the temple yesterday,

160
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,200
you were also there.

161
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,480
Yesterday, when assassins came for me

162
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,240
and chased me into the temple,

163
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
I saw her lighting lamps alone.

164
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,400
She got caught in the battle
because of me.

165
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,760
If I recall correctly,

166
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,600
all the assassins

167
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,560
should have been slain by me.

168
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
So I'd like to ask

169
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,040
how he got away unscathed?

170
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,408
Well...

171
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
My lord,

172
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,600
could it be

173
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,880
he's in league with the assassins?

174
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,240
Perfect.

175
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,640
We've got one empty cage left.

176
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,736
Exactly.

177
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
Lord Xia.

178
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,000
How about

179
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
I sever this escaped assassin's head

180
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,240
and deliver it to you?

181
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
How's that?

182
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,424
No.

183
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,000
My lord!

184
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,040
- I'm innocent, my lord!
- Shut up!

185
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,880
Guards! Take him away.

186
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,360
Lady Jinzhi, you promised me...

187
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,584
My lord.

188
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Xia Jinzhi believes

189
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,840
my failure to light her blessing lamp
in the temple

190
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,840
caused her child to die.

191
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,440
But I think

192
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,280
her child's death

193
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,040
has no connection
to whether I lit lamps or not.

194
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
My lord,

195
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,760
you know perfectly well

196
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,080
whether I committed adultery
last night, right?

197
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,400
Shut up!

198
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,720
You killed my son!

199
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,120
Whether you committed adultery

200
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,640
is certainly clear to me.

201
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,480
However,

202
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,200
the notion that lamp-lighting

203
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,520
harmed a fetus is pure nonsense.

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,240
In my judgment,

205
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,840
the deceased should be autopsied,
and the living one has check-up.

206
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,240
We'll get to the bottom of it today.
