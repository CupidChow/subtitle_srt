=Spring Fever=
=Episode 4=

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,160
If you touch me again,

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,280
I'll kill you.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,920
What happened yesterday
was just an accident.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,080
Don't misunderstand.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
I've seen plenty of women.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,680
But I rarely encounter

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
living criminal slaves.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,880
If you tell me

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,960
what crime you committed

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,400
and how you escaped execution,

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,664
I'll spare you.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,456
A'man.

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,352
What are you doing?

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,696
Let go of me.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,136
Getting desperate?

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,240
Then speak the truth.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,720
Or else,

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,480
I won't mind playing the adulterer.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,040
Three.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,240
Two.

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,240
A'man, are you there?

23
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:38,120
One.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,800
I was adopted by the Lu family
as a child.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,600
Later, I fell gravely ill

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,160
and lost all my memories.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,320
You liar.

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,192
I'm coming in.

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,048
Qinglan,

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,648
what are you...

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,048
Shi'an.

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,840
What brings you here?

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,600
My concubine is injured.

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,200
I came to show my concern.

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,160
- Concern?
- Exactly.

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,440
Did you bring any food?

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,208
No.

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,480
Any medicine?

39
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:37,360
No.

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,760
Then what did you bring?

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,200
I brought premium

42
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:42,320
pearl powder.

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,280
Where is it?

44
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,520
You just smashed it.

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,480
So you brought nothing.

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,400
You claim to show your concern,

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,840
yet bring no food

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,792
nor medicine.

49
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,360
Are you here to spy

50
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,880
on my interrogation records?

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,880
In-Interrogation?

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,200
You came for an interrogation?

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,240
What else?

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,120
Want to hear more?

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,120
No.

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
Please go ahead, my lord.

57
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,936
Shi'an.

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,240
(Prosperity Blessed by Heaven)
(He's too dangerous. Don't provoke him.)

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,920
Wait. This is my house.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
He sneaked in at night,

61
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,400
and secluded himself with my concubine.

62
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Close the door.

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,336
Alright.

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,200
Shi'an, is there something
you need to say?

65
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,960
A'man, please understand my predicament.

66
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,072
(Prosperity Blessed by Heaven)

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,200
I don't know if his predicament is real,

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,520
but my interrogation

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,040
is real.

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,480
Let go of me.

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,360
Or I'll scream.

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Scream?

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,480
Who would care?

74
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,320
Who else in the Lu family
would care about you?

75
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,880
It seems you need motivation

76
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,360
to start talking.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,040
What are you doing?

78
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,280
What did you apply on me?

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Poison for interrogating criminals.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,160
On open wounds, it burns like blades.

81
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,200
Will you talk?

82
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,320
Stubborn fool.

83
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,600
I truly remember nothing.

84
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,600
Nothing at all.

85
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,360
It's okay.

86
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,720
Madam. Madam.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,216
Jin,

88
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:14,840
why are you here?

89
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,560
(Lu Jin'er, Ye Qinglan's daughter)
I heard you were hurt.

90
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
I'm fine.

91
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
I just had a fall.

92
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,120
Let's go. Let me take you out.

93
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,416
Okay.

94
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,640
Didn't I ask you to stay
in your father's room for a while?

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,240
It felt wrong.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,472
Come here.

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,040
This is all my fault.

98
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,640
You're the best.

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,280
Look! The woodcutter uncle
gave me a horse.

100
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,280
He keeps bringing you trinkets?

101
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,560
He taught me a rhyme too.

102
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,840
Ox hooves, horse feet...

103
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,096
It's South Mountain high,
North Dipper in the sky.

104
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
The master buys a cow to tie.

105
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,360
Right.

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Come on.

107
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,600
Iron feet go, stamping the ground.

108
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,560
Over South Mountain, stepping around.

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,760
South Mountain high,
North Dipper in the sky.

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,440
The master buys a cow to tie.

111
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
(There's something here
I can't let go of.)

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
(You can't let go of your man,
or the wealth and glory?)

113
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
(So what she truly
can't let go of is her daughter.)

114
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,960
Iron feet go, stamping the ground.

115
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,240
Over South Mountain, stepping around.

116
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,880
South Mountain high,
North Dipper in the sky.

117
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,200
The master buys a cow to tie.

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,520
Ox hooves, horse feet...

119
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,680
Madam, when can I call you Mother?

120
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,592
Soon.

121
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,928
Very soon.

122
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
(I must...)

123
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,160
(I must get the civilian registration)

124
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,480
(and take you away.)

125
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:32,128
(Golden Trauma Ointment)

126
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
(Why am I here?)

127
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
You're awake.

128
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
The new rouge is good.

129
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,880
Why didn't you send it to me?

130
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Jinzhi?

131
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Why are you here?

132
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:03,240
Not just me.

133
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,000
Your mother is also here.

134
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,000
Danxiang.

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,160
Mother, what's happening?

136
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,640
You must save me!

137
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,560
Save you? How can he save you?

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
If he had that ability,

139
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,320
would I be cleaning up your mess?

140
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,760
Jinzhi, direct your anger at me.

141
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,240
Don't trouble my mother.

142
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600
Trouble?

143
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
Ask her yourself.

144
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,240
Did I say anything wrong?

145
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,680
If the Dowager knows about this...

146
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,040
Mother.

147
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,800
Mother, what have you done?

148
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,960
Speak now!

149
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:57,344
I...

150
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,488
I...

151
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,496
Fine.

152
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,040
If you won't talk,

153
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,160
I'll do it.

154
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,168
Shi'an,

155
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,920
you probably don't know yet.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,280
Master Lu, your father,

157
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
was poisoned by your mother.

158
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,960
No! I didn't!

159
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
Xia Jinzhi, do you realize

160
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120
what you are talking about?

161
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,560
I know very well.

162
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,000
Back then, Madam Lu used
the Lu family's fortune

163
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,480
to pay her own family's gambling debts.

164
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,880
Later, the deficit grew too large,

165
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,320
and Master Lu discovered it.

166
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,360
He threatened to divorce her
during the confrontation.

167
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,760
So she went all the way,

168
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,320
murdering her husband

169
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,520
to silence him.

170
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,984
That's not true!

171
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,800
It wasn't like that!

172
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,280
I... I just wanted him bedridden
for a few days.

173
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,320
I...

174
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
If I repaid the debt,

175
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,840
he wouldn't divorce me.

176
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,880
I never expected...

177
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,920
You never expected

178
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,400
that your medicine would kill him.

179
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,080
I didn't mean to kill him.

180
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,520
Shi'an.

181
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,400
Shi'an, you're my son.

182
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
You must trust me.

183
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,320
Trust me.

184
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,480
How do you know this?

185
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,080
The Xia and Lu families
were longtime allies.

186
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,640
My father also investigated the case.

187
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,880
The truth wasn't hard to uncover.

188
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,560
So your mother begged my father,

189
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,040
seeking to unite our families
through marriage,

190
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,640
and promising me

191
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
to become Lu family's matriarch.

192
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,600
I never expected

193
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,280
that after finding I cannot conceive,

194
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,440
she would let
shameless woman bear your child.

195
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Mother,

196
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
is what she says true?

197
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,680
I did promise you

198
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,120
to make you
the Lu family's future matriarch.

199
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,800
But who is to blame

200
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,960
when you cannot conceive?

201
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,896
You...

202
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,040
Xia Jinzhi!

203
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,112
Ridiculous!

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
Who made me target Ye Qinglan
at every turn,

205
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,000
claiming that eliminating Ye Qinglan

206
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,640
would make me the Lu family matriarch?

207
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,120
And who gave me
the anti-miscarriage medicine,

208
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,400
making me delay the baby's birth

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,480
to please the Dowager?

210
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,240
It was you, Madam Lu.

211
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,600
Not me.

212
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,600
It's your own greed

213
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,840
that kept stalling.

214
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,856
Shut up!

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,280
I want you dead

216
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,040
to accompany my deceased son.

217
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,880
Xia Jinzhi!

218
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,760
My son!

219
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,880
Save...

220
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,800
Shi'an,

221
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,264
will you sacrifice a concubine's child

222
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,160
or ignore your mother's life?

223
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,400
The choice is yours.

224
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,520
You and Concubine Ye already have Jin.

225
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
She will understand.

226
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,560
Xia Jinzhi is coming for you.

227
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,400
Her dirty tricks are just harem schemes.

228
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,360
She won't move against me openly.

229
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,040
And I'll guard against her tricks.

230
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,800
What if Lu Shi'an

231
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,680
helps her?

232
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,520
Impossible.

233
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
Shi'an wouldn't do that.

234
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,120
I don't believe he'd do this to me.

235
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,240
You won't repent

236
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
until the last minute.

237
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
(Will you sacrifice a concubine's child)

238
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,920
(or ignore your mother's life?
The choice is yours.)

239
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,920
Lord Shen, A'man.

240
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,640
An emergency!

241
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,240
Shi'an, what's wrong?

242
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,360
It's Jin. She...

243
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,360
What happened to her?

244
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,720
Jin suddenly collapsed

245
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,280
in Jinzhi's chamber.

246
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,232
Jin.

247
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,504
Jin.

248
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,280
Jin.

249
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,080
Jin.

250
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,720
How dare you, a lowly concubine,

251
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
make noise in my chamber?

252
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,720
This is outrageous!

253
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,960
Where's Jin?

254
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,680
Where's my daughter?

255
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Ask him.

256
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:37,984
Shi'an,

257
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,040
you promised me

258
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,920
no one would lay a finger on Jin.

259
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,240
Jin isn't here.

260
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,920
But I swear, she's safe.

261
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,040
Xia Jinzhi, I tolerated you before,

262
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,720
because you lost your child.

263
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,480
If you harm my child,

264
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,520
I'll not let you off.

265
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,352
Shi'an,

266
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,720
take me to Jin.

267
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,680
Let's go find her.

268
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,104
Shi'an.

269
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,760
Shi'an, what are you doing?

270
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,800
I'm going after my child.
