=Episode 3=

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,200
Madam.

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,400
Speak.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,560
The Governor-General
surnamed Shen claimed

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,920
the Young Lord has campaigned
in the southwest for years

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,320
and now returns victorious.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,040
He sought the Emperor's decree

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,200
to come to Ningzhou

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,600
to pay respects at the cenotaph
of Princess He'an

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,600
(Chenghuan, Dowager Lu's Maid)
and renovate the Duting Station.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,600
(Dowager Lu)
Duting Station again.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,680
What did Xia Ciyi say?

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,000
Prefect Xia said when Princess He'an,
the late mother of the Young Lord,

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,800
returned to Bianzhou to visit relatives

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,080
and passed Ningzhou,

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,280
she was poisoned by the postmaster
at Duting Station.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,920
He has regretted that.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,160
Enough.

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
Isn't it the same old excuses

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,680
to shift the blame?

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,200
Madam, would you like to check it out?

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,440
No.

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm old

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
and tired.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,000
Let the younger ones

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,280
handle domestic affairs.

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,928
My lord.

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
I've examined the fetus.

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,280
The fetus had already died

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,680
inside the womb days prior.

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,640
What?

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,000
Jinzhi,

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,080
is what he says true?

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
Were you aware?

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,384
Impossible!

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,240
It must be this vile woman's doing!

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,520
I was carrying the child.

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,720
How could I not know his condition?

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,840
Well said.

40
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,640
Since you were carrying the child,

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,160
that means

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
you must have known the truth.

43
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,040
It wasn't a misunderstanding,
but deliberate slander.

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,760
In that case,

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,440
those two ruffians at the temple

46
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,640
must have been accomplices your hired.

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
What ruffians?

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,640
(He might not sincerely help me.)

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,880
(If we openly clash now and he leaves,)

50
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
(I might suffer a lot.)

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,936
My lord,

52
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,600
there were no ruffians.

53
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,040
It was merely those assassins

54
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,040
fighting among themselves.

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
My lady,

56
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,800
you didn't frame me.

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,680
There must be some misunderstanding.

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Right, a misunderstanding.

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,880
Very well.

60
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,280
Since the victim makes no accusation,

61
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,040
then I

62
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,640
shall not press further.

63
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,560
However, Lord Xia,

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,160
you nearly took a life

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,520
over a mere misunderstanding.

66
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,880
If this reaches the Imperial Court,

67
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
people might praise Ningzhou Prefecture

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,160
for its exemplary law enforcement.

69
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,360
Then

70
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,480
per your suggestion,

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,600
how should I resolve this?

72
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,520
I have no demands.

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
But

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,240
with so many witnesses today

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
and tongues wagging,

76
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,520
it'll be hard to silence them all.

77
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,432
Especially Lord Gao.

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,640
We have numerous subordinates.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,440
I'll have someone take boxes back,

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
clean thoroughly,

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,080
and return them to you.

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,040
Then I'll trouble you with this.

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,760
My duty.

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,240
Protect this woman.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
As the sole eyewitness
to the assassination attempt,

86
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,320
for the Young Lord's safety,

87
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,160
I need constant access
to interrogate her.

88
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,200
Yes.

89
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:05,312
(Prefect's Mansion)

90
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,120
My lord, he accepted everything
in the carriage.

91
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,040
(Jia Wu, Prefect's confidant)
This Governor-General is quite greedy.

92
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,240
The fact that he dares show such greed

93
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,600
actually reassures me.

94
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,240
My lord, Princess He'an
has been dead for years.

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
Why would the Young Lord
come to mourn now?

96
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,320
Set aside the Young Lord's matters.

97
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,960
We need to get to know more

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,000
about the Governor-General first.

99
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,120
Inform our contacts

100
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,200
to behave themselves these days.

101
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,104
Understood.

102
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:48,120
My lord, the Duting Station connects
to the Lu Residence's back door.

103
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,280
It's accessible
through Lady Ye's courtyard.

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
I see.

105
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,184
Whoa.

106
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:54,656
(Duting Station)

107
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,680
My lord, we're here.

108
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,696
(Duting Station)

109
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,240
- Greetings, Young Lord.
- Greetings, Young Lord.

110
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,960
Remember. Don't call him
Young Lord in Ningzhou.

111
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,520
(Duting Station)
Call him Lord Shen,

112
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,400
the Governor-General.

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,800
- Yes, Lord Shen.
- Yes, Lord Shen.

114
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,480
(Lu Residence)
(Mother, I'll uncover how you died.)

115
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,760
- Shut up! Get out!
- Dr. Leng is the best in Ningzhou.

116
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,720
Best? He's just a quack!

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,360
Find me the real best one!

118
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
Or ask my father to find
imperial physicians from the capital.

119
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
All of you, get out!

120
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:47,280
Dr. Leng, what happened?

121
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,600
How did you injure your head?

122
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,320
I got beaten by Lady Jinzhi.

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,448
Dr. Leng.

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,720
Dr. Leng.

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,640
Dr. Leng, Jinzhi just miscarried.
Her temper is understandable.

126
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
Please bear with her.

127
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,680
Here's all your payment.

128
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,160
Don't take offense.

129
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,680
Thank you, Madam Lu.

130
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,040
Madam Lu, I need to verify something.

131
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,200
Speak freely.

132
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,960
In your household,

133
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,064
was there any specific requirement
regarding the child's birthdate?

134
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,640
It might be

135
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,760
that the Dowager deeply misses her son,

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,200
my late husband.

137
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,480
Since Jinzhi's due date

138
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,560
coincided with his birthdate,

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
the Dowager has often wished

140
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,800
her grandson could share his birthdate.

141
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,840
Lady Jinzhi's miscarriage

142
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,840
was caused
by an anti-miscarriage medicine.

143
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,040
Anti-miscarriage?

144
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,120
Exactly. This type of medicine

145
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,600
can induce labor
through dosage adjustments

146
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,600
or delay delivery.

147
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,440
Used properly, it prevents miscarriage.

148
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,600
If used improperly,

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
it becomes poison.

150
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,480
Moreover, the misuse of medicine
damaged her body.

151
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,720
She may never conceive again.

152
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
What?

153
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,840
Never conceive again?

154
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,400
Precisely.

155
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,416
Otherwise,

156
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,920
why would she have driven me out?

157
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
Enough, Dr. Leng.

158
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
This concerns
the Lu family's reputation.

159
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,800
Consider you never come.

160
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,680
You'll be generously compensated.

161
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,480
Rest assured.

162
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,600
I'll take my leave now.

163
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,960
- Be careful, Dr. Leng.
- Okay.

164
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,720
I am busy. I won't see you out.

165
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,680
Okay.

166
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,440
(My good intentions backfired.)

167
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,640
(But the Lu lineage must continue.)

168
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,680
(Maybe Shi'an and Ye Qinglan should...)

169
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,800
(My child, I failed to protect you.)

170
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,320
(But)

171
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,600
(I won't let your death be in vain.)

172
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,760
(Those people will pay the price.)

173
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:12,992
(Lu Residence)

174
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,760
Why are you here?

175
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,120
I've fulfilled

176
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,760
the favor you asked.

177
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,680
Now, tell me

178
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,960
about the tattoo.

179
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,200
Two months ago,

180
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
at the docks...

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
Hurry! Hurry up!

182
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,696
- After him!
- Help!

183
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,840
Don't chase!

184
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,920
- Help!
- Stop!

185
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,304
Don't run!

186
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,696
Stop.

187
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,744
Step aside.

188
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
As a pearler,

189
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,840
you can't take payment
without fulfilling your duty.

190
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,552
Sir, I'll return the money.
I don't want to die.

191
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:40,480
I don't want the money.

192
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,120
I want what's mine!

193
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,680
You dare take my things.

194
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,808
You court death!

195
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Let's go.

196
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,280
In Ningzhou,

197
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
those engaging in the pearl trade

198
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,280
are called pearlers.

199
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,240
Killing people in public.

200
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,760
What about the corpse?

201
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,560
None dare investigate.

202
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,760
And no one dares to say it.

203
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,160
The rest

204
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,560
depends on whether

205
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,240
you have the courage to investigate.

206
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,120
Today, I was there.

207
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
Why didn't you tell them

208
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,080
that the lecher

209
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
was framing you?

210
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,600
You won't stay in Ningzhou forever.

211
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,560
If I take advantage of this matter

212
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
and offend Xia Jinzhi,

213
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,720
after you leave,

214
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
she'll retaliate.

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,120
Admitting there was a lecher
in the temple

216
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,480
only adds another stain
to my reputation.

217
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,680
Moreover,

218
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,560
you were not truly
helping me seek justice.

219
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,600
You were just exploiting this leverage

220
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,240
to extort money from Prefect Xia.

221
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,040
What exactly is the stain

222
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,400
you mentioned earlier?

223
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,640
When women face such situations,

224
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,640
though completely innocent,

225
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,360
they become more despised

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,760
than the actual wrongdoers.

227
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
Then why don't you leave this place?

228
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,400
There's something here
I can't let go of.

229
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,760
You can't let go of your man,

230
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,480
or the wealth and glory?

231
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,960
You're a mere slave.
If you keep spouting lies,

232
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,952
I'll make sure
you don't survive tonight.

233
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,080
Stay back!

234
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
If you touch me again,

235
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,680
I'll kill you.
