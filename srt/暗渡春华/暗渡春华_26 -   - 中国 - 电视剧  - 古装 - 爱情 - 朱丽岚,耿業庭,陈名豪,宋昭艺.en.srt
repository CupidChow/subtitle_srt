=Episode 26=

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,760
Old Drillmaster?

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Lady Ye?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,360
You're actually alive?

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,920
What truly happened back then?

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,360
Old Drillmaster, Lady Ye and I
are on the same side.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,000
Don't worry.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,440
You don't need to hide anything
from either of us.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,600
Sit and explain.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,880
Old Drillmaster, my father maintained
good relations with Princess Anhe.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,360
Why would he poison her?

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,880
Didn't you find that suspicious?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,440
Lord Shen makes a valid point.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,200
Princess Anhe discovered
the postmaster colluded

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
with the Lu family

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,200
and harbored pirates.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,840
So they need to silence her.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,880
If my father intended this,

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,600
he could've found a scapegoat,

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,720
instead of implicating himself.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,680
Old Drillmaster, think carefully.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,520
Perhaps we can uncover new leads.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,960
Your Highness,

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,200
we must leave now!

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,360
Let me take one last look.

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,120
Just one last look.

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,880
If you don't leave now,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,080
since you noticed
the pearl smuggling and pirates.

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,200
They won't let you leave Ningzhou alive.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,320
Your Highness.

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,640
Please send the child to the capital.

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,120
They want me dead.

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,200
I can't escape with the child.

34
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:38,976
Postmaster Sang!

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,320
The child's name is Yin Ruxing.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Old Drillmaster,
ensure Princess Anhe escapes too.

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay.

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,720
My lady, let's go.

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,360
Hurry up.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,360
Or it'll be too late.

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,080
That day was chaotic.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,240
My father carried Princess Anhe's child,

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,360
urging my brother and me to flee.

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
He kept apologizing.

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,280
We didn't know what happened.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
We just obeyed him.

47
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,160
Even now, the reason eludes us.

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,520
Kids, listen. Once you pass this gate,

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,160
Nanny Chen awaits at Lianqiao Alley.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,520
Just run. Don't look back.

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
Father, where are we going?

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Ye, there's money and provisions
in this bundle.

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,480
And a crucial letter too.

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,440
Take Mu with you

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,800
and hide at the rural estate.

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,400
Wait for me to retrieve you.

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,680
If I don't return,

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,840
(Duting Station)
live well with Mu.

59
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,320
Someday,

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,920
deliver this letter
to the Duke Xuan's Mansion.

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,720
Did you get that?

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,240
Yes. Go to the countryside
without looking back,

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,720
and give the letter
to Princess Anhe's family.

64
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,600
Go! Hurry!

65
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,320
Run! Don't look back!

66
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,480
Hurry!

67
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,400
Later,

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,160
the assassins found us.

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,520
And I gave the bundle to Mu,

70
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,840
diverting the assassins myself.

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,960
Then I was captured.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,320
Where's Master Mu now?

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,320
Passed away recently.

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,800
I hid for too long.

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
I was terrified then.

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
Princess Anhe died in the carriage.

78
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,360
After her death,

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,840
I... I fled.

80
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,720
If my father intended
to silence witnesses,

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,760
why did he ask me and my brother to run,

82
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,720
yet sent you to escort Princess Anhe?

83
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
Doesn't that contradict his motive?

84
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,240
It's really weird.

85
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,160
They didn't act all these years.

86
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,760
Why suddenly target you now?

87
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,160
We previous co-workers

88
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,320
hid for survival all these years.

89
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,960
Burdened by guilt,

90
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,320
we tried sending accusations
to the capital.

91
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,280
But they were all intercepted
by Madam Lu.

92
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,600
How do you know it was Madam Lu?

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,696
The Lus are imperial merchants.

94
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,320
Pearl shipments and courier routes

95
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,200
were the same.

96
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,200
The inspectors

97
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,760
were all from the Lu family
and the capital.

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,920
Intercepting accusations

99
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,560
would be effortless for them.

100
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,200
No wonder.

101
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,800
If your brother's letter
to the Duke Xuan's Mansion

102
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,440
hadn't been sent from Taodu,

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,880
it would've surely been intercepted too.

104
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,040
(Late Brother, Sang Xiaomu)

105
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,120
Earlier, I had Gao Fu

106
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,520
bury your brother

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
temporarily here,

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,720
waiting for you
to select a proper burial site.

109
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,720
When Mu was young, he told me

110
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,120
he'd rather die

111
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,080
than coexist with worms and ants.

112
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,920
He wanted to become an eagle,

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,720
soaring to the sky.

114
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,160
Sister,

115
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,640
do you believe

116
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,680
I'll grow this tall someday.

117
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Then I'll protect you.

118
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,440
Mu.

119
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,360
(Late Brother, Sang Xiaomu)

120
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
You've made it now.

121
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,840
(Don't worry.)

122
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,520
(I'll take your place in protecting her)

123
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,760
(and spare her from further harm.)

124
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
How cruel he was.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
All these years,

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,480
he stayed by my side

127
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,920
protecting Jin and me,

128
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,160
yet never revealed his identity.

129
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,080
Not until I recognized him

130
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
did we even

131
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,480
get to properly talk,

132
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,080
and he...

133
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,760
(Your sister doesn't truly resent you.)

134
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,160
(If possible,
visit her dreams more often)

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,880
(to keep her company)

136
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,280
(and make up for lost time.)

137
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,680
(If your spirit still watches over us,)

138
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,960
(help me tell her)

139
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,600
(that in this world,)

140
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
(someone still loves her
as you and your parents did.)

141
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,304
With this treatment,

142
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,400
if he wakes within three days,

143
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
he'll survive the crisis.

144
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Thank you, Lord Gao.

145
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,560
Farewell, my lady.

146
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,960
Lord Gao.

147
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,320
Lord Shen has given me an order.

148
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,320
Didn't they claim

149
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,920
your family and Master Lu
killed Princess Anhe?

150
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,520
Then let Madam Lu confirm herself

151
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,560
if it's true or not.

152
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,880
Farewell, my lady.

153
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,720
They said this to Shi'an
when he was sick?

154
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,160
I never expected Prefect Xia
would shift blame

155
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,920
onto the deceased Master Lu.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,680
I told him to say that.

157
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
How could a dead son's reputation

158
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,960
compare to a functional ally?

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,960
It's a pity.

160
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,880
This allay proves useless now.

161
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,760
How?

162
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,640
He hid the groom's involvement from me.

163
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
He wanted the groom

164
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,760
to tell Shen Que how Princess Anhe died.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Who in Ningzhou Prefecture

166
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,600
surpasses me in poisoncraft?

167
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,760
He used these petty tricks

168
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,320
to redirect Shen Que's suspicions
toward you,

169
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,080
slaying with borrowed blades

170
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,640
to get rid of the Lu family?

171
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,160
This ally

172
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,680
must be severed.

173
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,560
Get down!

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,360
This seat isn't meant for you.

175
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,280
Get down.

176
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,960
Has my deference made you forget

177
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,720
who I serve?

178
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,320
We're both just

179
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,080
Madam Lu's lapdogs.

180
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,240
Madam.

181
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,200
Scholar Dong.

182
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Had I not

183
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,720
engineered your rise,

184
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,400
would you enjoy your glory
in Ningzhou today?

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,200
I was drunk.

186
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
Xia boasted about passing
the imperial exams.

187
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
I didn't know what was wrong.

188
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,040
In a rage,

189
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,320
I-I struck him dead accidentally.

190
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,960
Madam Lu treated you both as her own.

191
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,880
She funded your studies,

192
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,480
and even visited you.

193
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,920
Who could foresee this tragedy?

194
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:14,200
Let's report this.

195
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,480
Nanny Song, plead
with Madam Lu for mercy.

196
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,960
I beg you.

197
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,440
I'll kowtow.

198
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,600
Please, Nanny Song.

199
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,320
I'll kowtow.

200
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,080
Xia had no family,

201
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,360
only you as his friend.

202
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,520
You stole his identity

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,120
and transformed yourself,

204
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,920
becoming a doubly-listed scholar.

205
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,280
I pitied you

206
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,920
and made arrangements everywhere

207
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,600
to ensure your identity

208
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,280
remained protected.

209
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,000
Did you help me out of genuine pity,

210
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,560
or to groom a Prefect

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
to be your Lu family's workhorse?

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,800
How dare you!

213
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:04,096
You've lived thirty years
longer than you should have.

214
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,240
It's enough.

215
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,960
Today's situation is irreversible.

216
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,480
Do not let momentary cowardice

217
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,920
condemn more kin to death.

218
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,320
I've arranged everything that follows.

219
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,320
Now just go in peace.

220
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:07,168
(Prefect's Mansion)

221
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,440
(All aforementioned matters)

222
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,240
(stemed from my insatiable greed.)

223
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
(As Prefect governing this region,)

224
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,360
(I allowed pirates to harm civilians,
murdered Princess Anhe,)

225
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,200
(and framed innocents
as well as the Governor-General.)

226
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,200
(Each crime warrants
ten thousand deaths.)

227
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,040
(Now that the truth is revealed,)

228
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,520
(I dare not shamelessly cling to life.)

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,440
(Only death can atone my sins.)

230
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,640
