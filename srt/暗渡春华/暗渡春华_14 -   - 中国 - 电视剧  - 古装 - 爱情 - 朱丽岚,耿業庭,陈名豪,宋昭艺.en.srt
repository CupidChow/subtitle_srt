00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,896
=Spring Fever=
=Episode 14=

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,480
So you named the Young Lord?

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,880
He actually used that name?

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,400
What kind of person is he?

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,080
Is he like his mother?

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,480
I'm not entirely sure about that.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,360
But I heard his mother died
in delivering him.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,960
After his mother's death, his father

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,400
never recovered from grief.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,640
So he cultivated himself in a temple.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,240
I was never close to him.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,040
He never spoke of his mother.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,000
Well then. You can tell him
what I shared with you today

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,000
when you return to the capital.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,440
This is very important to him.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,040
Thank you, A'man.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,320
Actually, that's all I know.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,440
After dinner that night,

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,240
my father escorted Princess Anhe away.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,280
So that means

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Princess Anhe's last night in Ningzhou

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,400
was spent with you?

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,016
What happened next?

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,960
Next...

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,280
Oh, right.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,680
The night before she left,

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,360
she said when she returns
to Ningzhou again,

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,920
she'll take me, Mu,

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,200
and the Young Lord

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,920
to set off fireworks together.

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,000
But as for what happened afterward...

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,160
I truly don't know about it.

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,880
Set off fireworks...

34
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:09,728
♪The mountains are green,
and the lake is like a mirror♪

35
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,544

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,072

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,480
Is it good?

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
It's so good.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,920
You have a bite too.

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,280
I won't eat any.

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,800
These are all for you.

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,720
After finishing, when you go back home,

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,000
don't make a fuss
at your grandmother's place, okay?

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,920
What if I could stay with you
for a few days each month

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,080
and eat this delicious brown rice.

48
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:43,296

53

Lady Ye.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,520
Lord Shen says you may stay
in the west wing temporarily.

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
It will be repaired soon.

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,720
Tomorrow, you...

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,640
Is it ready?

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,320
Not yet?

59
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,040
I don't know.

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,640
Then it's not ready.

61
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,640
Then how about you make do staying
in Lord Shen's heated chamber

62
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,440
for a few days?

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,520
This will make
tending his wounds easier.

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,480
That's fine.

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,840
Then I'll trouble Lord Gao

66
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,720
to deliver Jin's meals.

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
Sure.

68
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,800
Jin's been free these days.

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,280
You'll see her soon.

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,640
Really?

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,400
I trust you.

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,120
I-I'll take this to Jin.

73
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,000
A'man, you must be hungry.

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,440
After Gao Fu returns,
I'll take you to eat.

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,680
Okay.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,720
I won't say anything!

77
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,280
Gao Fu.

78
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,000
My lord.

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,280
Any more brains left?

80
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,720
My lord, the brains...

81
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,080
There's none left.

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,000
I haven't had enough.

83
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,520
What should we do?

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,520
Don't we have three fresh ones here?

85
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,040
My lord, which one do you want first?

86
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,760
- That one.
- The one at the edge?

87
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,760
What are you doing?

88
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,080
Can't you tell?

89
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,600
Eating human brains.

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,320
- Eating human brains?
- Human brains?

91
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:47,320
You don't understand?

92
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
Human brains are the tenderest.

93
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,120
Especially fresh from living people.

94
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,840
Gently secure the head like this.

95
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,840
Don't move.

96
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,320
My lord, shouldn't we use
a sharper blade?

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,120
Whatever.

98
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
As long as it's edible.

99
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,280
Cut slowly along the cranial suture.

100
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,560
The incision must be small.

101
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,640
Pry open a piece of skull

102
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
to reveal the creamy brain.

103
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,240
Now you have to hold your breath.

104
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,120
I must act
while the brain's still pulsating,

105
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,160
scooping it out quickly with a spoon.

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,840
I'll talk!

107
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,040
Stop! I'll talk!

108
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,040
I'll talk!

109
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,160
He'll tell everything. He won't tell.

110
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,800
- I'll eat his brain.
- Alright then.

111
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,240
No. Stop it.

112
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
I'll talk. I'll talk.

113
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,120
You'll also talk?

114
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,240
Immortal Song, they agreed to talk.
What about you?

115
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm just a woman who reads fortunes.

116
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,160
I don't understand
what you're saying, my lord.

117
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,600
Then read the fortune
for yourself and the Lu family.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,240
My lord, this scheme of yours
will come to nothing.

119
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,760
Within 15 days,

120
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,680
I'll surely walk free under the sun.

121
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
Then I'll offer you a divination.

122
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,320
Sunlight will mean your death.

123
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,760
We'll see about that.

124
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,720
I never imagined they'd use
living humans to smuggle pearls.

125
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,840
Days ago, when I investigated
in the market,

126
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,520
I heard rumors
of frequent disappearances.

127
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,200
But in Ningzhou,

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,480
pearlers vanishing at sea is common.

129
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,304
Even the authorities turn a blind eye.

130
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,920
I didn't expect it.

131
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,040
The Lu family must be involved in this.

132
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:53,720
It's time to deal with them.

133
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,760
My lord.

134
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,000
The Lu family are imperial merchants.

135
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,440
We need royal decree
to act against them.

136
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,880
We're overstepping our authority.

137
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,040
I'll draft a memorial
to request the decree.

138
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,080
This won't stop us acting first.

139
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
Take men and surround them first.

140
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:14,000
Understood.

141
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,840
Grandmother.

142
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:41,920
The Inner Bureau is investigating.

143
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Resisters will be executed!

144
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,240
Lord Shen? Weren't you rescuing A'man?

145
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,600
What is this for?

146
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,080
Just because I rescued someone,
I discovered murderous intentions.

147
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,000
The Lu family is suspected
of pearl smuggling with pirates.

148
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,600
From this moment,
during our investigation,

149
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
no Lu family member may leave.

150
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,800
Resisters will be executed.

151
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,320
Slander.

152
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,600
This is slander.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,880
Do you have evidence?

154
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,120
I am the evidence!

155
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,280
My lord, please take a seat.

156
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,800
My lord.

157
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,760
My lord,

158
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,120
I appreciate your daring rescue

159
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,120
of Concubine Ye from pirates.

160
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,240
But pirates are desperate criminals.

161
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,760
Their words carry no credibility.

162
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,400
Don't fall for their scheme
to sow discord.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
Madam,

164
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,720
I never mentioned pirates,

165
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,120
yet you're already distancing yourself.

166
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,160
My lord,

167
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,040
we are imperial merchants.

168
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,720
Searching our premises
requires royal decree.

169
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,400
Do you have one?

170
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,640
The decree will arrive within days.

171
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,360
Moreover, the Inner Bureau operates
with imperial authority

172
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,520
to act first and report later.

173
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,280
Young man,

174
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,880
your fiery vigor

175
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,680
may lead to misguided decisions.

176
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,400
Don't say I didn't warn you.

177
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,920
In life and actions,

178
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,880
one must bear consequences
of impulsiveness.

179
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,160
Then I shall thank you for your warning.

180
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,120
No thanks needed.

181
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,360
You've blocked us in,

182
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,560
so where's A'man?

183
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,800
She's at Duting Station.

184
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,760
Again, your family colluded with pirates

185
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
and tried to silence her.

186
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,760
So, as a key witness,

187
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,240
she needs to be protected first.

188
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,480
Silence her?

189
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,240
How could it be?

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,800
Master Lu, you know her status
better than I.

191
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,040
Shouldn't your questions
be directed elsewhere?

192
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,320
My lord, since you've made your decision

193
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,080
I'll press no further.

194
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,840
Oh, right. I'm taking Jin with me.

195
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,680
My lord, Jin is part of the Lu family.

196
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,200
Lord Gao just said

197
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,080
no Lu family member may leave.

198
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Resisters will be executed.

199
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,000
Jin is my foster daughter.

200
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Moreover, your family registry

201
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,640
lists no record of her existence.

202
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,360
My lord,

203
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,520
though her mother's status

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,480
delayed Jin's registration,

205
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,440
she remains my blood daughter

206
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,400
and the Lu family's young lady.

207
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,960
Really? Then ask around.

208
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,840
In this Lu family, apart from her mother

209
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,720
and you,

210
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
as for the rest, each and every one,

211
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,160
who truly cares for Jin?

212
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,000
You couldn't share joys before,

213
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,000
so future hardships
need not be shared, either.

214
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,160
My lord.

215
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,720
Shi'an, hold your tongue.

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
He is right.

217
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,040
Children naturally cling
to their birth mothers.

218
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,160
Chenghuan,

219
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,120
take Jin to Lord Shen.

220
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,840
By the way,

221
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,120
bring along her favorite sweets.

222
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,080
Go.

223
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,360
