2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,280
I just left for two days.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,960
And you caused such chaos at home?

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,000
Shi'an.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,680
I'm not scolding you,

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,600
but our family is facing calamity now.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,680
You should focus more
on the family business.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,280
You can't leave everything to me.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,920
I've always hoped

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
you'd grow strong enough
to lead our family soon.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,440
Grandmother,

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,280
I know I was wrong.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,840
And you,

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,560
calm your temper too.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,440
Shi'an is still in mourning.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,080
He can't take concubines,

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,880
and his relationship
with Jinzhi is strained.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,640
You're the only one

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,880
who truly understands him now.

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,720
He momentarily lost his judgment.

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,080
Just scold him a bit
and let this pass, alright?

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,280
Grandmother,

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,520
don't pin it on me.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,240
It really wasn't me.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,960
Madam, Master Shi'an,

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,160
I mean no offense.

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,440
The culprit isn't hard

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,640
to identify.

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,320
Just see who benefited most from this.

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,640
The servants say

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,440
Lady Jinzhi emerged
from the study at dawn.

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,560
What?

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,120
It wasn't you last night?

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,920
Xia Jinzhi,

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,200
was it truly you who drugged us?

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,080
You made me lose composure before A'man,

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,440
and appear heartless.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,680
It wasn't me, Shi'an.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,160
You dared make A'man
drink safflower potion.

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,480
What won't you stoop to?

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,200
Go explain for me.

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,640
Go.

43
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,520
Go no!

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
You talk about A'man all the time.

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,880
Do I not exist in your eyes?

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,240
I've never been worthy of your gaze.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,120
Isn't it laughable you ask this now?

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,400
Shi'an.

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,520
Please listen to me, Shi'an.

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,880
I admit

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,640
that when my father forced this marriage

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,960
and you favored Concubine Ye,

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,880
I felt wronged.

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,400
That's why I treated you coldly.

55
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,280
But I'll change.

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,160
I won't treat you as I did before.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Don't you prefer Ye Qinglan's demeanor?

58
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,440
I can do as she did.

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,160
Give me one more chance, please?

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,520
After all the harm you caused A'man,

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,320
how could I ever trust you?

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,680
Step aside.

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,240
Lu Shi'an!

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,120
Is there not a shred of love for me
in your heart?

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,160
Not at all.

66
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,000
Not at all...

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Not at all?

68
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,360
This is for you.

69
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,880
For me?

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,720
My pearl.

71
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,960
Lady.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,400
Put the drug in the fireworks.

73
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,760
You may leave.

74
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,520
I don't understand.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,120
Prefect Xia bribed the maid
to drug me and Lu Shi'an.

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,280
What does he gain from this?

77
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,400
He learned about the decree I possess

78
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,000
and feared I'll show mercy
to the Lus because of you.

79
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,000
So he wanted to use
your entanglement with Lu Shi'an

80
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,960
to drive a wedge
between me and the Lu family.

81
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,240
Why such convoluted schemes?

82
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,920
If the Lus were truly involved,

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,440
he could've informed you directly.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,280
He wanted plausible deniability,

85
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,640
avoiding being seen as their accomplice.

86
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,320
His fear of Madam Lu runs deep.

87
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,040
You've overreached into my affairs.

88
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,840
How has the Lu family offended you?

89
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,200
Madam,

90
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,440
I wouldn't dare.

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,560
I-I meant to drug Shen Que
and that concubine.

92
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,640
The plan went awry.

93
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,360
My deepest apologies.

94
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,720
When our family faced crisis before,

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,520
your external negotiations

96
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,240
saved us.

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,840
I appreciate your kindness.

98
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,680
But now, with the Governor-General
targeting us,

99
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,920
unity is more crucial than ever.

100
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,640
Yes, yes. You're right.

101
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,440
Ciyi,

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,160
you were the good child I chose myself.

103
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
Don't disappoint me.

104
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,120
The kindness you showed to me

105
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
has never been forgotten.

106
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Good.

107
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
Thank you, Madam.

108
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,040
So...

109
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,800
Should Madam Lu be informed

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,920
that Prefect Xia isn't aligned with her?

111
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,000
She already knows.

112
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,200
When you arrived just now,

113
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,320
she had just left with Chenghuan.

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,520
Where do you think

115
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
she'd go at this late hour?

116
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,000
Shen Que.

117
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,440
Something feels off about her chamber.

118
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:10,600
Are you sure something's off here?

119
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,720
Yes.

120
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,280
These are illicit ledgers
for pearl smuggling.

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Look.

122
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,200
It records payments

123
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,320
sent every three months

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,960
to the Dong family.

125
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,440
Why record this?

126
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,480
Someone's here.

127
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,000
Madam, you've worked
through half the night.

128
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
You should rest now.

129
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,680
Every day,

130
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,560
there's no peace to be found.

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,640
I can't sleep.

132
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,640
There's rice cakes
Concubine Ye brought today.

133
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,760
Want some?

134
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,720
No.

135
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,240
My stomach's been unsettled
since dinner.

136
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,040
Madam,

137
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,200
Concubine Ye has been hovering
around you lately.

138
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,160
Could she know Jin was poisoned here?

139
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,720
Whether she knows or not,

140
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,240
entrusting Jin to Shen Que

141
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,800
proves she's no longer loyal
to the Lu family.

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,200
Then why keep her close?

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,480
Someone's been here.

144
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,840
Could it be Ye Qinglan?

145
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,360
Whether it's her or not,

146
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,640
she can't live.

147
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:20,440
Use this to investigate.

148
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,760
(Dong)
Find his connection to Madam Lu.

149
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
We've gathered enough evidence.

150
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,880
Now let them tear each other apart.

151
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,760
I'll leave.

152
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,960
A'man.

153
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,320
You should leave the Lu family too.

154
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,840
Let me take you away.

155
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
We'll find Jin together.

156
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,480
Okay.

157
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,680
Meet me tomorrow night
in Duting Station's back alley.

158
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,840
Okay.

159
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,880
Open up!

160
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,960
Who is it?

161
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,520
Need your boat to transport goods.

162
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:18,680
Which household do you...

163
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,280
What's the...

164
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,520
Come with us.

165
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,320
Where to?

166
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,800
Go!

167
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,680
Kneel!

168
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,160
Does this place look familiar?

169
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,440
I-I don't know.

170
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,920
I've never been here.

171
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,000
Listen, old man.

172
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,720
Get this straight.

173
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,200
Those men outside want you dead.

174
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,640
I just have several questions.

175
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,000
Why fear me?

176
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,320
My lord,

177
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,160
I-I truly know nothing.

178
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,520
You'll stay here until your pursuers

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,040
are caught.

180
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,440
Our lord has ordered

181
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,280
to ensure your safety.

182
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,960
Who is your lord?

183
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
An old friend of Princess Anhe.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,760
Could I get some food?

185
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,600
I haven't eaten in days.

186
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,640
Send her to the dock now.

187
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,920
What about the child?

188
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,680
Already evacuated. Rest easy.

189
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,520
Hyah!

190
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,920
Whoa!

191
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,480
My lady, a household ahead.

192
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,080
Dismount for water and rest.

193
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,240
My lady?

194
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,520
My lady?

195
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,840
Did Princess Anhe reside
at Duting Station previously?

196
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,440
Wh-Who is this official?

197
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,840
Ask no unnecessary questions.

198
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,480
Speak.

199
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,920
Yes.

200
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,720
Who delivered the last meal

201
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,760
served to Princess Anhe?

202
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:02,800
It was the postmaster.

203
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,280
Sang Huai...

204
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,880
Yes.

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,680
Princess Anhe's meals were all handled
by the postmaster.

206
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,440
Do you know the consequences
of lying to me?

207
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,920
My lord, my life rests in your hands.

208
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,880
How would I dare deceive you?

209
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,160
Gao Fu.

210
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,960
Yes.

211
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,680
Investigate all clinics and pharmacies.

212
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,920
Verify Duting Station's purchase records
before Princess Anhe's death.

213
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,680
