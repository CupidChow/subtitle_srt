00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,640
Let me go!

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,400
Let me go!

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,120
Let me go!

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,760
Let me go!

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,040
Let me go!

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,560
Mother.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,080
Mother, don't do this.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,000
Please cooperate.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,840
Immortal Song is performing an exorcism.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,600
It's been over a decade.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,600
Why haven't you reincarnated yet?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,240
I didn't harm you.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,640
You were carrying a child.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,520
I would never hurt you.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,320
Big-headed ghost.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,320
Big-headed ghost!

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,600
Wicked woman!

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,560
Release her.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
With me here,

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
the entity possessing her
won't dare act recklessly.

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,320
It actually worked.

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
Indeed. How impressive.

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,680
The mouth spews sacred water.

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,720
The eyes radiate solar brilliance.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,520
Celestial guardians capture spirits.

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
Vajra deities purge ailments.

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,600
By this sacred decree,

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,160
reveal the truth in detail.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
Immortal Song,

31
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
how's everything going?

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,160
The spectral gate opens
at the southeastern chastity arch.

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,520
The spectral disturbance
stems from the Lu residence.

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,960
A low-status woman in this household

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,360
must have dallied with a noble.

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,120
She violated feminine virtues,
disrupting moral order,

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,960
causing this chaos.

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,640
If it isn't properly resolved,

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,280
Ningzhou will never know peace.

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
Violating feminine virtues?

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,080
Who is it?

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
I know who it is.

43
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,360
Stop your baseless accusations.

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,520
Immortal Song, please enlighten us.

45
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,680
Who exactly is this concubine?

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,960
Don't make us commoners speculate wildly

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,720
and wrong innocent people.

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,800
The Prefect
considers matters thoroughly.

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,320
With my aged and ailing body,

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,880
I'll invite deities to reveal the truth.

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,160
Who's there?

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,760
How dare you damage sacred objects!

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,320
It slipped.

55
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,000
It's her!

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,640
Just as the Zhang family's
chaste widow from West District,

57
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,800
you must collect the rootless water
to clean the chastity arch.

58
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,440
If you're innocent,

59
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
heaven will send sufficient rain

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
and manifest divine signs.

61
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,680
This is absurd!

62
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,960
Lord Shen, please don't be angry.

63
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,720
You may not know this.

64
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,320
Concubine Ye

65
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,120
must do as Widow Zhang did before,

66
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,960
walking the main street
and collecting rainwater

67
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,520
to clean the chastity arch.

68
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,160
If miracles appear on the arch,

69
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,040
it proves her innocence.

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,720
This is Ningzhou's
longstanding tradition.

71
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,560
Lord Shen, you should
refrain from interfering.

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,240
You hold blind faith in spirits

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,320
and disregard human life.

74
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,960
Have you found your faith

75
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,480
or become possessed?

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,760
Get up.

77
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,080
Let's go.

78
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
My lord, don't intervene.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
If you interfere,

80
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,000
you'll confirm you're the nobleman
I had an affair with.

81
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,960
My innocence
will become harder to prove.

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,016
So what if there's an affair?

83
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,760
I'll just take you back to the capital.

84
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,800
Mind your words, my lord.

85
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,520
Your words will only
get me killed by gossip.

86
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,680
I'm willing

87
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
to collect the rootless water

88
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,000
to prove my innocence.

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,760
I swear

90
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,040
that besides Lu Shi'an,

91
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,240
I've never had improper relations
with any man.

92
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,120
Not in the past,

93
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,600
nor in the present.

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,360
Fine.

95
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,240
I won't interfere.

96
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
(Sorry, Lord Shen.)

97
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,880
(I have my own plan.)

98
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
The sun's blazing. Rain is impossible.

99
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,360
This is heaven punishing her.

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,440
Exactly.

101
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,760
(Jin.)

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,960
(Soon, I'll bring you back to my side.)

103
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,040
(All these years,
I thought pushing you away)

104
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,360
(and sending you
into Xia Jinzhi's chamber)

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,160
(would keep you safe from harm.)

106
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,680
(I was wrong.)

107
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,600
(I must bring you back to me.)

108
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
(No matter who I use,
no matter the cost.)

109
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,640
(In Ningzhou, everyone blindly believes
in divine will.)

110
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,520
(The Lu family parrots
morality and virtue.)

111
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,080
(Very well.
I'll play this farce with you.)

How dare they defy Immortal Song
to protect this evil woman?

119
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Are they crazy?

My lord,

141
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,760
your blatant favoritism is astonishing.

142
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
Aren't you worried about scandal?

146
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,080
What's the problem?

147
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,440
So you just
blocked off the entire street?

148
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Well, well.

149
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,440
Really.

150
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,200
Wherever Concubine Ye kneels,

151
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,680
that's where you drink.

152
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,080
Wherever you drink,

153
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,080
you raise shade for her.

154
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,040
My lord,

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,000
if you truly fancy her,

156
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,080
I could help fulfill your desires,

157
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,320
helping you return to the capital
with beauty and wealth.

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,080
Then I'll submit memorials

Wouldn't that be ideal?

162
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,600
Are you rushing to expel me,

163
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,600
or probing my intentions?

164
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,600
My lord,

165
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,520
you're still young

166
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,320
and inexperienced in affairs.

167
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,720
Let me impart some wisdom.

168
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
The art of governance

169

There's no need to court danger.

171
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,160
Danger?

172
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,720
Where's the danger?

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,120
Enlighten me.

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
It's raining.

175
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,440
Wrap it up.

No one's watching.)

178
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,520

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,640
Moreover,

189
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,000
this is your play.

190
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,120
Adjust the umbrella.

191
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,640
It's blocking me.

192
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,600
Madam Lu's gone mad.

193
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,200
Did you drug her?

194
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,120
It was really not me.

195
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,960
But the poisoner shared my thoughts.

196
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,000
If it were truly

197
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,160
my play,

198
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,440
I wouldn't make you suffer.

199
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,720
Nor would I hide it.

200
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,840
Doesn't this seem odd?

201
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
This doesn't feel like
Xia Jinzhi's work.

202
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,880
Could it be

203
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,600
that due to the ghost incident,

204
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,440
the mastermind

205
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,560
is trying to test you?

206
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,880
So this whole act was intentional?

207
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,280
You will not hide things from me,

208
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,440
yet I've kept secrets.

209
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,920
I'm sorry, my lord.

210
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,480
My lord.

211
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,680
A'man,

212
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,320
how are you?

213
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,456
Let me take you home.

214
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,440
I must wait for the divine signs
to manifest first.

215
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,680
You come at the right time.

216
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,000
How could there be a divine sign?

217
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,440
You've come

218
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,160
and the divine sign follows.

219
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,200
Otherwise, Lord Shen's mere presence

220
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,280
won't convince others.

221
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,920
Lu Shi'an,

222
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,600
you must tell them

223
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,320
this is the divine sign.

224
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,600
(Lord Gao predicted
tonight's heavy rain accurately.)

225
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,880
(The red phosphorus
hidden in the calligraphy also worked.)

226
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,200
(Everything rests on tomorrow.)

227
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,280
Go back and recount
every detail to them.

228
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,320
This is the divine sign.
