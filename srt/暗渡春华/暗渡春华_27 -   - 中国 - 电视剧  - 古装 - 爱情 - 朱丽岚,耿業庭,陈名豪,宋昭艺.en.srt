2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Lord Xia.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,400
How could it be you?

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,520
Over a dozen of my family members
were wrongfully executed.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
Even now,

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,320
you still try to pin false charges

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,440
on my family.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,480
Why couldn't I be here?

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,280
Are you satisfied now?

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,120
Not enough.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,560
What more do you want from me?

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,840
I want you to die with full clarity.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,960
Dong Kui.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,680
Scholar Dong.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,280
What you truly wanted to protect

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,640
are your family members
back in Yingzhou,

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,440
right?

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,440
You fear they'd end up
as slaves like me.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,520
Your essays were no worse
than Xia Ciyi's.

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,800
You merely lacked fortune.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,040
But jealousy drove you
to kill your sworn brother.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,400
N-No. I don't know
what you are talking about.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,120
Dong Kui died long ago.

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
I-I am Xia Ciyi.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
I have two versions
of that past incident.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
Do you want to hear them?

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,480
Lord Gao.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,880
You...

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,160
Y-You are that attendant back then?

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,600
Your memory serves well.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,400
Had I not known your identity,

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,800
I might not have recognized you.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,600
Every detail and every person

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,400
from that night

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,960
are all burned into my memory.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,120
I'll never forget them
as long as I live.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
What you and I witnessed that night

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,360
were indeed different.

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,000
Stop talking! You...

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,880
Y-You dare hit me?

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,640
(So from the very beginning,
I was being used.)

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's go.

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,800
You thought it was jealousy,

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,120
but you didn't know there was a poison

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,560
that when mixed in wine,

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,400
could make even saints

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,000
fly into rage.

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,840
Otherwise, how could someone

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,160
wait outside the window in advance?

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,680
Dong Kui.

51
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
Dong Kui.

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm giving you the chance
to overthrow Madam Lu.

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
Choose wisely.

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,400
But why should I do this?

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,920
You won't spare me either, will you?

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,440
Yes. Compared to established families
like the Lus,

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,840
you're easier to handle.

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,240
The public outrage
you stirred remains unresolved.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,320
If you die,

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,520
Madam Lu will create greater chaos.

61
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,480
Countless will perish in Ningzhou.

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,480
I see.

63
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,680
You want me

64
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,800
to eliminate Madam Lu first.

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,320
Because I hold more authority here
than Shen Que,

66
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,880
and know more Lu family secrets.

67
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Yes.

68
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,160
But if you take blame
for Madam Lu today,

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,480
and she falls to Shen Que later,

70
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,160
your crimes will still be exposed.

71
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,520
You'll drag your family
into this as well.

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,640
But if you handle Madam Lu first,

73
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,960
you'll not only avenge yourself,

74
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,360
but also secure your family's survival.

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,760
Two options ahead.

76
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,480
Choose wisely.

77
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,200
Were you scared just now?

78
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,920
Of what?

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm one step closer

80
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,360
to avenging my father,

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,800
my mother, and Mu.

82
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,920
There's only excitement. No fear.

83
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
But now,

84
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,120
I feel some concern.

85
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,400
Concern about what?

86
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,640
As the book says,
don't corner the desperate.

87
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,520
We've driven Prefect Xia to desperation,

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,040
and set this desperate man
against a tiger.

89
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,320
Men like him

90
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,760
will do anything

91
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
for survival.

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,520
As long as he stops preying on people,

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,520
I'll counter any scheme.

94
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,920
Let's hope his choice
doesn't disappoint us.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's strange. This bougainvillea

96
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,600
only bloomed sparsely this year.

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
Have it chopped down.

98
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,760
Yes.

99
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,560
Transplant a better one next year.

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,840
Understood.

101
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,760
There's been no movement
from the Prefect's Mansion yet?

102
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,120
No, there hasn't been any movement yet.

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,560
You may leave now.

104
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,880
Understood.

105
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,840
Ciyi,

106
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,760
you still don't understand?

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
It seems

108
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,720
you no longer remember the kindness
I showed you in the past.

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Madam.

110
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,800
Last night, I heard of a poisonous herb
called Leigong.

111
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,240
Brewed in wine,
it could drive even saints to madness.

112
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,080
I could have had my own life.

113
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,880
I could have been a good man.
It was all your fault.

114
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,640
You schemed against me step by step.

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,320
My hands are stained with blood.

116
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
There's no turning back now.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,040
All of this is thanks to you.

118
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,760
Today,

119
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,520
I'll properly repay your kindness.

120
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,800
Dong Kui, regarding what happened
back then,

121
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,680
neither of us is innocent.

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
That pirate who killed people
with throwing daggers

123
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,240
outside the window

124
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,680
has already been imprisoned.

125
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,400
As for me,

126
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,640
I am just a pitiful fool

127
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,160
you coerced and deceived.

128
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,000
My crimes aren't grave enough
to exterminate my entire clan.

129
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,600
But you...

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,400
You're different.

131
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,520
You want mutual destruction?

132
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,920
I only want you destructed,

133
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,240
not me.

134
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
In your dreams!

135
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,160
Seize him!

136
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,800
You...

137
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,760
Madam, don't blame him.

138
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,600
Dogs naturally follow

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,360
whoever feeds them,

140
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,200
right?

141
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,320
Good.

142
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,560
Very well.

143
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,560
Xia Ciyi,

144
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,640
well played.

145
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,200
You flatter me.

146
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,600
You taught me well, Madam.

147
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,560
(Confession Letter)
I wrote this confession last night.

148
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,160
And you

149
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,000
just need to copy it

150
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
word for word

151
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,600
and replace the name with yours.

152
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,040
Only in this way

153
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,160
will the Lu family remain standing.

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,360
Your grandson will remain
head of the Lu family.

155
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,000
Madam, please be careful.

156
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,160
Shi'an.

157
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,360
I know you're awake.

158
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,760
You're just holding resentment,

159
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
ignoring me, aren't you?

160
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,920
Fine.

161
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,160
Then you just listen.

162
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,720
Xia Ciyi can't defeat Shen Que.

163
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,520
If he troubles the Lu family
after my death,

164
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,800
don't be afraid.

165
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,960
Concubine Ye has a conscience.

166
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,320
Last time, you saved Jin.

167
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,080
This time, you took poison for her.

168
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,080
As long as she and Shen Que are here,

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,880
they'll protect you.

170
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Drink this.

171
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,360
Drink it all.

172
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,280
You

173
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,200
will fully recover.

174
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,520
Madam Lu made this herself last night.

175
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,120
Master Shi'an, please drink it.

176
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,680
From now on,

177
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,800
you can do

178
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,280
whatever you want.

179
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,040
I'll be gone.

180
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,040
From now on,

181
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,600
you must obtain

182
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,920
what you desire yourself.

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,680
Madam!

184
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,680
Grandmother.

185
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,000
Grandmother!

186
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,240
Grandmother!

187
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:53,709
♪Grind flesh between grit and stone♪

188
00:14:55,821 --> 00:15:00,141
♪Sink into pain,
only then are pearls born♪

189
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:07,437
♪Wait until abyssal darkness
stains every inch of skin♪
