2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,200
(Father, where are you going?
Don't abandon me!)

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,920
(Father, don't leave! Father!)

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,160
(Princess He'an died
giving birth to the Young Lord.)

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,920
(His birth caused her death.)

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,480
(I'm setting off on my cultivation path.
Take good care of the Young Lord.)

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,520
(Mother,)

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,160
(all my life, I believed)

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,320
(you died while giving birth to me.)

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,920
(But that accusation letter claims)

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,480
(your death wasn't an accident.)

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,840
(This time, I've come)

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,360
(to uncover the truth.)

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,880
Shi'an,

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,872
your mother's life remains at stake.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,000
Aren't you concerned?

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,720
Jin is truly unharmed.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,600
Take this potion.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,600
I'll take you to her.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,080
Potion?

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
What kind of potion?

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,800
It's the sterility potion.

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,960
Your failed lamp offering,

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,048
angering the deities
and causing Jinzhi's miscarriage.

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
She may never conceive again.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,280
This cannot escape family rules.
I couldn't ignore it.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,880
Lord Shen already proved
my innocence that day.

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,520
And I offered her a way to save face.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,680
Yet in the end,

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,600
the one who doubts me

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,680
turns out to be you.

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,960
I do believe you, but...

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,240
What?

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,560
Mother.

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,240
Mother.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,120
What are you doing?

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,720
Let me go!

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,160
Shi'an.

39
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,560
A'man.

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,280
Let me go!

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,400
Be gentle with her!

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,280
Let me go!

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,840
What?

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,560
Hurry, Shi'an!

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,240
Let me go!

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,960
Hurry, Shi'an!

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,200
Do it now!

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,000
Shi'an.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,320
My life remains in her hands.

50
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,040
Shi'an.

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,000
A'man.

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,840
Shi'an.

53
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,560
We already have Jin.

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,920
Even if you never conceive,

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,040
I'll protect you both.

56
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,920
(I'm sorry.)

57
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,920
(Beat me or curse me
after taking it. I'll accept it all.)

58
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,480
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,400
A'man.

60
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,800
A'man.

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,160
Jinzhi promised

62
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:55,200
that as long as you never conceive,

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
she'll stop tormenting you.

64
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
Is this what you meant

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,320
by treating me well?

66
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,840
I had no choice.

67
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,280
You always have choices.

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,720
You just never choose me.

69
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,560
It's just that

70
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,920
when trouble comes,

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
you always discard me.

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,680
That's not true.

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,320
A'man.

74
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,920
A'man.

75
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,760
A'man, what's wrong?

76
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,240
A'man.

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,320
A'man, what's happening?

78
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,000
A'man.

79
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,640
A'man, what's happening?

80
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,960
A'man.

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,720
A'man.

82
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,600
W-What's happening?

83
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,560
A'man, what's wrong?

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,720
A'man.

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,080
A'man!

86
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,320
A'man!

87
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,960
A'man!

88
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,880
Get the physician!

89
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,680
Hurry, get the physician!

90
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Wait. Wasn't it a sterility potion?

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,760
A'man.

92
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,920
She's been poisoned.

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
She's dead.

94
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,600
Bury her.

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,560
You lied.

96
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,760
You lied!

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,560
Why?

98
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,320
Why did you kill her?

99
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
I killed her?

100
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,600
What have I done?

101
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Wasn't it you who fed her the potion?

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,240
You...

103
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,160
I'll get the physician.

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,360
Mother, watch over her.

105
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,280
It's too late.

106
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,200
And if this gets out,

107
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,400
you will be the murderer, not me.

108
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,840
Now that I'm satisfied.

109
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,480
Your mother will remain unharmed.

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,800
The funds your mother embezzled...

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,200
I've reimbursed them with my dowry.

112
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,040
Shi'an,

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,080
Concubine Ye has...

114
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,520
She's already... Just bury her, okay?

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,760
Shi'an.

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,000
Shi'an.

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,560
What are you doing?

118
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,560
Don't you keep
having the same nightmare?

119
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,720
I tell the nightmare
to this brocade box.

120
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,880
Lock it inside and bury it.

121
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,320
Then you'll never
have the same nightmare again.

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,320
Really?

123
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,040
Yes.

124
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,640
My grandmother taught me that. It works.

125
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,720
Well...

126
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,520
I'll trust you for now.

127
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,680
A'man,

128
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,040
whenever you're sad

129
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,040
scared,

130
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,720
or in danger, just tell me.

131
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,920
I'll protect you.

132
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,120
Always.

133
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,720
♪Wine like steel, steel with wine♪

134
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,240
Okay.

135
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,560
Shi'an.

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,080
Shi'an.

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,000
Shi'an.

138
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Shi'an.

139
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
I'll bury it then.

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Bury it.

141
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,680
Bury it all.

142
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,280
Mother.

143
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,400
Mother.

144
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,280
Mother.

145
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
Mother.

146
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,440
Mother.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,440
Wake up.

148
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,560
Wake up, please.

149
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,720
Jin.

150
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,256
A penal slave begets a criminal slave.

151
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,680
Take them and sell them off.

152
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,960
Mother.

153
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Jin.

154
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,920
She's not a criminal slave.

155
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
She's not my daughter.

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,480
Mother.

157
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,680
She's not a criminal slave.

158
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
Let her go!

159
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,440
Jin.

160
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,000
Mother.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Jin.

162
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,240
Mother.

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,880
Jin.

164
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,800
(How am I still alive?)

165
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,240
(Where am I?)

166
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
I can't die.

167
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,920
I can't die.

168
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,640
(I can't die.)

169
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,360
(Can't die...)

170
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,720
What?

171
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,960
Reluctant to come out?

172
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,920
How do you know I am here?

173
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,560
You're a crucial lead
in my investigation.

174
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,760
I know

175
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,560
your every move.

176
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,920
Jin isn't with Xia Jinzhi.

177
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,800
The potion Lu Shi'an gave me
was poisoned.

178
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
You knew all this.

179
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,840
Did you come to mock me?

180
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
I told you before.

181
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,440
You

182
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,920
won't yield until you hit the end.

183
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,072
Under the guise of drug primer,

184
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,440
Xia Jinzhi's maid

185
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,920
purchased arsenic
from several pharmacies.

186
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,160
The potion Lu Shi'an gave you

187
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,560
was originally poisoned.

188
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,600
I swapped it.

189
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,040
I'm your savior.

190
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,400
Is this how you treat me?

191
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,720
Watching me drown in misery,

192
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,120
while you stand by idly.

193
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,040
If you enjoy spectacles so much,

194
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
why bother saving me at all?

195
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,560
You're heartless.

196
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,200
You're meddlesome.

197
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,640
Self-righteous!

198
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
Opportunistic!

199
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,120
Cruel!

200
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Despicable!

201
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,760
Stupid.

202
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,960
Stupid?

203
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,480
Yes.

204
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,480
I'm stupid.

205
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,800
Stupid enough to be sheltered
by the Lu family all these years

206
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,680
and meekly endured everything.

207
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:28,440
Stupid enough to believe
that even though Lu Shi'an

208
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,600
didn't register me
under civilian registration,

209
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,080
he'd take good care of Jin.

210
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Stupid enough to follow him knowingly

211
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
into this trap,

212
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,520
trying to prove he hadn't deceived me.

213
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,320
Stupid enough to believe
sincerity begets sincerity.

214
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,840
Yet in this world,
sincerity is the cheapest commodity.

215
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,360
Just now,

217
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,080
I shouldn't have

218
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,840
spoken to you that way.

219
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,640
You were right.

220
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,840
I was deluded.

221
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,200
Being scolded into awareness is better.

222
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,320
Some people

223
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,600
never wake up

224
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,640
before they die.

225
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Come on.

226
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,560
To survival.

227
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,480
Come on.

228
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,040
To survival.

229
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,000
Gao Fu.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,400
My lord.

231
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,440
The fire seems not strong enough.

232
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,720
Fetch more firewood.

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,560
This fire's strong. Enough firewood.

234
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,200
There is plenty.

235
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,680
Not enough.

236
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,160
Alright then.

237
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,000
Lord Shen,

238
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,760
I accept the partnership

239
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,040
you proposed earlier.

240
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,760
Let's make a deal.

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,480
I'll protect you and your daughter
from mistreatment in the Lu family.

242
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,040
And you tell me

243
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,080
everything you know about the Lu family

244
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,088
and Ningzhou Prefecture.

245
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
How do I know your intentions?

246
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
Why should I trust you?

247
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
They treated you so poorly.

248
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,800
Yet you still care
about their interests?

249
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
You can't truly love
that spineless man, right?

250
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,440
Listen.

251
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,200
The Lu family took me in,
for better or worse.

252
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,920
Shi'an might be weak,
but he's my daughter's father.

253
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,720
You're just an outsider.

254
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,800
Why should I trust you?

255
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,200
Xia Jinzhi will never conceive again.

256
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,000
What do you mean?

257
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Nothing specific.

258
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,800
Just testing if any affection remains

259
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,840
between you and Lu Shi'an.

260
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,280
What do you think?

261
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,120
Some remains.

262
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,880
But not much.

263
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,080
Fine. When you regret this,

264
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,520
come find me.

265
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,920
Okay.

266
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,200
So,

267
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
what are you going to do next?

268
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,496
