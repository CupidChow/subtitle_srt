2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,880
Lanterns here!

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,520
Lanterns here!

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,600
Lanterns for sale!

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,920
I heard you want to go find your Madam?

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,440
I'll take you there.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,440
Madam told me not to go with strangers.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,240
But I'm not a stranger.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
I'm your foster father.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,840
What's a foster father?

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,720
Well... It means a father

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,040
who didn't birth you

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
and doesn't share your surname.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,480
I already have a father.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,600
Did your father buy you this?

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,200
You bought the fish lantern.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,080
Now will you come
find your Madam with me?

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,160
Why are you more eager than me
to find my Madam?

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
If you want to go, why not go alone?

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,200
I don't want to.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,960
Kid, don't talk nonsense.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,520
I'm just trying to help you.

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,200
You're not being honest.

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
I won't go with you.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,560
Then I won't give you this lantern.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,160
Slow down. Don't get lost.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,080
Keep up. Don't fall behind.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,600
Jin.

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,600
Madam. Madam.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,160
Why did you come out alone?

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,760
She insisted on seeing you.

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,120
I couldn't refuse.

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,800
So I brought her here.

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,360
That's not true.

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,000
I bought you the lantern, right?

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
Who would've thought
the cold-faced Lord Shen

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
has such a childish side?

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,200
There's been no gang activity
at the docks recently.

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,440
I wonder what they're plotting now.

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,440
The street kneeling protest
didn't go as they planned.

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,120
Their next move will be significant.

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,760
Be cautious with it.

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,240
Ningzhou has been
under their tight control for years.

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,400
I actually hope they'll take action.

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,520
That way, they might
reveal their weaknesses.

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,440
Let's go home.

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,520
Madam,

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,560
I want to take a look over there.

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,280
No, it's too late.

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,720
Let's go.

51
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,120
Maybe we should go there.

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,640
I'd like to see
Ningzhou's local customs too.

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,680
This way, you can spend time with Jin.

54
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Jin, want to go?

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,240
Yes.

56
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,720
Let's go.

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,080
No wandering off.

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,520
Okay.

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,560
I found the person
I asked you to locate.

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,880
Where?

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,840
The day that Lu family's concubine
was poisoned,

62
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,640
someone sneaked
into the Lu residence at midnight.

63
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,320
The Lu family guards spotted him.

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,760
During pursuit, they found this boot.

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,200
This belongs to Tao Dushan's crew.

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,480
The witness is hiding among our people.

67
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,400
I'll go find him.

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,920
Come back.

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,880
Don't be reckless.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,560
You want to strike once and gain thrice.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm on it right away.

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,000
This is Ningzhou's most famous snack,

73
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,600
called Lard Rice Dumpling.

74
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,480
Try it, my lord.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
It sounds greasy.

76
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Not at all.

77
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,880
Just try it.

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,680
Pinwheels and clay figures! Take a look!

79
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,960
Pinwheels and clay figures! Take a look!

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
Father, I want a pinwheel.

81
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,400
Pinwheels and clay figures!

82
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,120
Give me a pinwheel.

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
I want that one.

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,800
Pinwheels and clay figures!

85
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,080
Jin.

86
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Father, I want this.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,960
Want it?

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,216
Yes.

89
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,440
Which one do you like?

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,600
Call me father.

91
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,440
- I want this one.
- I'll buy it for you.

92
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,560
Want one?

93
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,560
Okay.

94
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,960
Which style do you want?

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,920
If you don't call me that,
you can just look.

96
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Just look then.

97
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,560
Just this one.

98
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,000
These are for boys.

99
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
How could girls play?

100
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,120
Merchant!

101
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,280
Hello, there.

102
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,600
Which one do you want?

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,440
I'll take them all.

104
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,120
Great, great! Thank you.

105
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,400
- Thank you.
- Deliver these to Duting Station.

106
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,600
Absolutely, no problem.

107
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,160
Don't buy so much. It's wasteful.

108
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,360
Jin,

109
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
if you want something in the future,
just say it.

110
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,600
If you like it, you like it.

111
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,160
Never let yourself endure hardships.

112
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,560
There's no difference
between boys and girls. Understand?

113
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,160
Yes.

114
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Do you understand?

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,760
Yes.

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,840
Hurry. Say thank you
to your foster father.

117
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,520
Thank you,

118
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,240
Father.

119
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,160
What did you say? I didn't catch that.

120
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,760
Beautiful flower boats!

121
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
Would you like to ride a flower boat?

122
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,200
This is the last trip.

123
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,200
You'll regret it
if you don't take a look.

124
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
- We won't ride.
- We will.

It's fine. I'll escort you inside.

143

If people see us,

144
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,640
it wouldn't be proper. Come on.

(Lu Residence)

147
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Thank you for tonight.

148
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,800
My daughter has never

149
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,760
been this happy before.

150
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,680
Think nothing of it.

151
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,920
This is all part
of being her foster father.

152
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll leave.

153
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,000
(Thanks to you both.
I'm very happy too.)

154
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,640
Madam.

155
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,600
You little rascal. Pretending to sleep?

156
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,280
I was very happy today.

157
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,480
It felt like a dream.

158
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,400
I don't want to sleep.

159
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,040
I fear the dream will end.

160
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,880
From now on,

161
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,800
I won't let you live in fear anymore.

162
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,720
Is it because father is protecting us?

163
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,640
Jin, you must remember this.

164
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,400
Never pin your hopes on anyone else.

165
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,240
Except me, of course.

166
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,200
You've changed so much
since father came.

167
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
Why when he's not around,

168
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,520
you agree to call him father?

169
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,440
Actually, I'm willing to call him father
in my heart.

170
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,680
But the more he wants me to say it,

171
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,600
the less I'll call him that.

172
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm just teasing him on purpose.

173
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,640
You little imp!

174
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,720
You're the only person in the world
who dares tease him.

175
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,160
Let's go.

176
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
My lord, this is the place.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
My lord.

178
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,560
There's no sign of anyone living here.

179
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,960
Perhaps we get the wrong place?

180
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,720
The mark on that letter

181
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,400
indicates this person
has met Princess Anhe

182
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,960
and the pirates.

183
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,680
He also knows about the slave mark
on Ye Qinglan's back.

184
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,920
The only possibility is
that he was once from Duting Station

185
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,200
and has long lingered
around the Lu family.

186
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
But in our investigation,

187
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,840
only Firewood Workshop's
Chai Er was suspicious.

188
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,640
He used a fake identity

189
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,000
providing firewood
to the Lus for three years.

190
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,480
But when I started to investigate,

191
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,440
he vanished.

192
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,360
Looks like this.

193
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,800
We haven't come openly for the old case.

194
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,960
So he won't trust us.

195
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,600
Yes.

196
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,000
He's hiding.

197
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,520
Gao Fu.

198
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,080
My lord.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
Get me some water.

200
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,480
Understood.

201
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,680
Here's the water.

202
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:07,520
(The Sang family is innocent)

203
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,200
The Sang family is innocent.

204
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,904
(Duting Station)

205
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,080
Lord Shen.

206
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,280
Master Lu.

207
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,880
Where have you been?

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,800
You've been hard to find.

209
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,440
What brings you here?

210
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,280
Here's the thing.

211
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,240
You have repeatedly saved
my concubine from danger

212
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,840
and recognized my daughter
as your foster child.

213
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,680
I haven't thanked you properly yet.

214
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,360
So I've prepared a feast.
Please honor us with your presence.

215
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,640
It's nothing.

216
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,520
No need for such formalities.

217
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,000
My lord, I come with sincere intentions.

218
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,640
I hope you won't decline my offer.

219
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,720
Very well. Since you are so generous,

220
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,880
I shall not stand on ceremony.

221
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,760
Please, my lord.

222
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,840
My lord.

223
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,560
I know you must feel lonely
traveling away from the capital.

224
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,640
I've arranged some young ladies
to keep you entertained.

225
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,840
Rest assured.

226
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,520
They've been instructed

227
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,280
to maintain discretion
and protect your reputation.

228
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,840
Your consideration is commendable.

229
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,120
You're an honored guest.

230
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Ordinary wine

231
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,440
won't suffice.

232
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,560
Coming.

233
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,400
Ladies, come here.

234
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,200
Hurry up.

235
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,440
Come here.

236
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,400
Serve these gentlemen well.

237
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,520
Put it down.

238
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,440
Cease your anger.

239
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,160
My apologies, Master Lu.

240
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,880
These aren't to my taste.

241
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,640
Go. Let's go.

242
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,880
So you prefer...

243
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,760
What do you think?

244
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,880
Not a problem. I understand.

245
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,280
Okay. I'll bring her immediately.

246
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,240
Here she is.

247
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,360
She's new here. Untouched.

248
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,360
Untouched?

249
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,480
That means she's never
entertained clients.

250
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,360
Surely she suits your preferences?

251
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,720
Come here.

252
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,320
Go on. Move!

253
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,920
How old are you?

254
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,880
Sixteen.

255
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,680
Sixteen?

256
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,840
Why would you come to Duchun House
at such a young age?

257
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,760
Your family got troubles?

258
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,480
My lord,

259
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,600
if this fledgling doesn't please you,

260
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,800
I'll find another. Let's go.

261
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,960
Please, my lord. Save me.

262
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,040
My father lost in gambling.

263
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,232
So he sold me to this place.

264
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:52,520
- I don't want to stay here!
- Let's go.

265
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,480
Please, my lord!

266
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:54,880
Let's go!

267
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,040
- My lord!
- Wait!

268
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,200
My lord,

269
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,880
this transaction is already paid for.

270
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,640
We'd better not interfere.

271
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,680
Indeed, my lord.

272
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,680
Right.

273
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,480
Master Lu is hosting
this banquet, after all.

274
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,640
I shouldn't burden
your generosity further.

275
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
What are you talking about?
If it pleases you,

276
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,880
I'll spare no expense tonight.

277
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,600
Go get her indenture.

278
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,960
Okay.

279
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,000
