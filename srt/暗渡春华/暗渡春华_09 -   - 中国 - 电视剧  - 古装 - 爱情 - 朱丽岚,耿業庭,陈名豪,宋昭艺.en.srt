2
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:10,624
(Lu Residence)

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
What's going on here?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,680
The immortal said

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,840
mugwort needs to be burned here
to dispel bad luck.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,360
You actually believe what she said?

7
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:26,976
Given my mother's condition,
how could I not believe it?

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,960
Just a while.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,000
Lord Shen?

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,000
Why are you here?

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,440
I came to burn mugwort too,

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,880
to dispel bad luck.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,840
A'man,

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,440
drink some ginger soup to warm up.

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,800
Let me feed you.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480
No need, my lord. I'll do it.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,080
Come on.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,440
A'man,

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,320
let me feed you.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,560
Come on, A'man.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,760
My lord.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,920
I should handle this.

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,280
I'll do it.

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,120
Why keep fanning like this?

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
Why not just open the door?

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,200
See? Fanning like this is more...

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,280
Ghost!

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,280
Stop.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,240
My lord.

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
I meant to eavesdrop,

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,800
but he unexpectedly opened the door.

32
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,280
Good work.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,760
How's the investigation
into the recent ghost sightings?

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,280
The Lu family has so many secrets.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,280
After Master Lu returned
from Duting Station years ago,

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,520
he changed a lot,

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,000
having constant nightmares

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,120
and forbidding mention
of Duting Station.

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,480
He also ordered Prefect Xia
to seal Duting Station.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Then he died?

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,680
Exactly.

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh.

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,840
I heard Madam Lu say
she didn't administer any poison.

44
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,400
It sounded genuine.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,160
It's plausible.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,640
Yes.

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
We've switched medications before.

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,040
Our substitutions were righteous.

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,080
Then I'll spread more rumors outside.

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,560
Lady Ye, pardon the intrusion.

51
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:57,480
- What's wrong?
- Hand it over.

52
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,880
Wait.

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,480
Give it to me.

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,880
Wait, hey!

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,880
You...

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,056
- Trying to run?
- Don't...

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,880
Close the door.

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,520
You do it yourself.

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,960
This is Gao Fu's secret remedy,

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,640
best for treating sprains and bruises.

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,880
Apply it today,

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
and your knee will improve tomorrow.

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,680
Thank you.

64
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,760
When the ghost stories
about the Lus and Duting Station spread,

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
clues even officials couldn't obtain

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,880
are got effortlessly
by supernatural forces.

67
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,720
I thought this would implicate you,

68
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,640
but instead, it's benefited you.

69
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
Benefited me how?

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
When was the red phosphorus taken out?

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,840
That was a divine sign.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,560
Well, fine.

73
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,760
Whatever you say.

74
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Tomorrow will be eventful.

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,720
What are you doing?

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,560
The interrogation's finished,

77
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
and I'm scared of ghosts too.

78
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,840
I'll sleep here tonight.

79
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,640
Move aside.

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,480
Fine, I'll sleep over there then.

81
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,840
I need to act alongside you tomorrow,

82
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,080
which is exhausting.

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,280
Lady Ye, you are so considerate.

84
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
Extremely comfortable.

85
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,440
Close the spectral gate,
Lu family scion.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
Noble protection, calamity dispelled.

87
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,440
Concubine Ye truly manifested
a divine sign.

88
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,680
Seems she was framed.

89
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,920
But what does this message mean?

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,960
Madam said

91
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
you have been in Ningzhou for days,

92
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,720
but unfortunately, she's unwell

93
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,080
and cannot attend today.

94
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,000
We hope for your understanding.

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,320
I understand.

96
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,280
Let's begin then.

97
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,880
(They believe such shoddy tricks?)

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Wait,

99
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,640
that wasn't a divine sign.

100
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
Someone orchestrated it.

101
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,280
That day, you made me kneel
in the streets like Widow Zhang.

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,240
If my sincerity moved Heaven,

103
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,760
the rain would fall, right?

104
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,400
Exactly.

105
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,160
I didn't believe it at first.

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,720
Yet you insisted Immortal Song

107
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
held boundless power in Ningzhou,

108
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,800
with unfailing accuracy.

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,680
Now, you're denying your own words now?

110
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,680
It's not that I deny them.

111
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,640
B-But there's something strange here.

112
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,960
Immortal Song, you make claims
which others have to accept.

113
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,160
Yet when others speak of you,

114
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,240
you refuse to acknowledge.

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,040
I knelt on the main street,

116
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
and the rains did fall.

117
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,480
Everything was done as you said.

118
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
What's strange about that?

119
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,920
Exactly.

120
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,160
She doesn't commune with gods.

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
How could she command the elements?

122
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,880
This is the divine sign you mentioned.

123
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,080
What? Will you now claim

124
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,480
you were spouting nonsense that day?

125
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,880
I've heard a saying.

126
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,120
True divine signs will vanish
once fulfilled.

127
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
Isn't that so?

128
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,920
Yes.

129
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,600
The divine sign states:

130
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,800
Close the spectral gate,
Lu family scion.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,360
Noble protection, calamity dispelled.

132
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,600
It means to seal
your so-called spectral gate,

133
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,560
we must select a Lu family descendant

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,480
to be fostered by a noble person

135
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,960
and thus avert disaster.

136
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,240
The most distinguished person present

137
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,080
is Lord Shen.

138
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,960
As the court-appointed Governor-General

139
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,720
sent from the capital,

140
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,760
he carries the North Star's protection.

141
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,160
Don't you agree?

142
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,960
Yes.

143
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,800
Then let Lord Shen
choose a Lu descendant

144
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,240
to establish a foster bond.

145
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,440
A foster bond?

146
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,600
Shouldn't Madam be present for this?

147
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,280
Please, my lord.

148
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
After you, Madam.

149
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,240
Chenghuan, why wasn't I informed
of Lord Shen's arrival?

150
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,320
Even I'm in poor health,

151
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,880
proper courtesy must be observed.

152
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,920
It's fine.

153
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,920
But Lady Ye insists

154
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,160
I must establish a foster bond
with the Lu family.

155
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,440
So I think

156
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,360
since this concerns a foster bond,

157
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,120
your presence seemed appropriate.

158
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,840
Concubine Ye,

159
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,200
is this foster bond truly necessary?

160
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,920
Madam,

161
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,760
only with a foster bond

162
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,200
will the divine sign vanish.

163
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:52,640
If the foster bond is unavoidable,

164
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,240
among all the Lu family descendants,

165
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,400
Shi'an shall be my foster son.

166
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,960
No.

167
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,800
Why?

168
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,720
Shi'an is nearly your age.

169
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,000
Making him as your foster son would make

170
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,320
the Lu family a laughingstock.

171
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,040
Then you mean...

172
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,480
Well...

173
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,920
Only Jin remains suitable.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
Jin's age fits perfectly.

175
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,440
Then let Jin perform the tea ceremony.

176
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,520
What do you think, Madam?

177
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,360
Okay.

178
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,160
Chenghuan,

179
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,840
fetch Jin here.

180
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,040
(You've got some nerve.)

181
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,080
(I taught you to strike emotionally,
yet you scheme against me?)

182
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,360
Madam.

183
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,320
Jin.

184
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,520
Go. Present tea to your foster father.

185
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,360
Go.

186
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Father, your tea.

187
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,600
A concubine-born daughter

188
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
isn't worthy to bear Lord Shen's name.

189
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,760
This adoption's merely
a ritual necessity.

190
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,040
Lord Shen wouldn't take it seriously.

191
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,400
Jin, from now on,

192
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,520
within the Lu residence,

193
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,680
none but Lady Ye

194
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,280
may lay a finger on you.

195
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,400
Understand?

196
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,280
Go. Find your mother now.

197
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,520
Madam.

198
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,400
My lord,

199
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,280
Jin is under your blessed fortune.

200
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
Who would dare bully her?

201
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,640
If no one's bullying her,

202
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,520
that would be for the best.

203
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,264
(Adoption Letter)

204
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:24,440
(Father: Lu Shi'an; Foster Father:
Shen Que; Foster Child: Jin)

205
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,920
This is truly peculiar.

206
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,024
Once the foster bond was established,
the divine sign actually vanished.

207
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,400
I never expected

208
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,720
that Concubine Ye has the skill
to turn situations to her advantage.

209
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,440
This show was well played.

210
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,520
It began as expected,

211
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
but ended beyond expectations.

212
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,080
Ghostly disturbances first,
then kneeling in the streets.

213
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,960
Now this adoption scheme emerges.

214
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,920
They made the Lu family restless.

215
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,760
Why don't you intervene?

216
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,200
I can't stop it.

217
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,960
Public opinion is a raging beast.

218
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,200
Let the floodwaters rise.

219
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,240
Then we'll remain secure,

220
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,040
watching them battle with each other.

221
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:21,248
(Prefect's Mansion)

222
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,320
My lord, I failed in my duty,

223
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,680
leaving a loophole.

224
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,880
I shall be punished.

225
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,480
Never mind.

226
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,200
I never expected

227
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,520
you local bosses to suppress him.

228
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
It's okay.

229
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,040
Let him win this first round.

230
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,680
So his guard will lower.

231
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,440
My lord, you have other lethal moves?

232
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,160
You talk too much. Just leave.

233
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,240
Understood.

234
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,040
Lady Ye, wait.

235
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,760
The formal adoption banquet
for Lady Jin will be held in two days.

236
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,080
Madam ordered Yunxiang Clothier

237
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
to select two batches of premium Lu silk

238
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
for her garments.

239
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,400
You know her measurements
and preferences best.

240
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,960
Assist the craftsmen with the selection.

241
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,280
Madam is really thoughtful.

242
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,648
(Lu Residence)

243
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,600
Come here.

244
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,520
Master Lu, as you requested.

245
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,240
Poria cocos and angelica root
are premium additives for pearl cream.

246
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,760
Pastries from Baihe House.

247
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:44,640
As usual, additives aren't charged
to the Lu family.

248
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,240
Pastries and errand fees paid in cash.

249
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,000
- Okay.
- Go.

250
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Jin?

251
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,640
Why are you here?

252
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,680
It's dark. Madam hasn't returned.

253
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,440
She went to the clothier
and will return later.

254
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,120
Don't tell your great-grandmother
I bought ingredients for pearl powder.

255
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,760
Understood?

256
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,280
Yes.

257
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,800
Take this.

258
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,960
Don't let others see. Be good.

259
