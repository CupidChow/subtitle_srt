(Duting Station)

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,040
Shen Que.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,640
Shen Que!

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,040
Is Lord Shen at home?

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,040
He moved away long ago.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,440
He's no longer at Duting Station.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,240
Where did he go?

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,920
I dare not ask

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,160
where he went.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,280
Shen Que.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,120
Shen Que! Shen Que! Shen Que!

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,680
Shen Que!

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
Shen Que!

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,920
Can you hear me?

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840

Lady Ye came to seek medicine
for Lu Shi'an.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Should I go there?

33
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,040
No need.

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,040
You were looking for me, Lady Ye?

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,680
Lord Gao.

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,600
Why is Shen Que avoiding me?

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,160
These past few days,
he has been in a bad mood.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Bad mood?

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,320
Yes.

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,360
Why is he in a bad mood?

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,960
What happened?

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,280
We've found the person
who poisoned Princess Anhe.

43
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,320
Who?

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,760
Speak!

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,560
It was Postmaster Sang, your father.

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,400
Wh-Where is Shen Que?

47
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,440
He won't see you.

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,400
Tell me where he is!

49
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,440
Duchun House.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,840
Lady Ye.

51
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,160
Lady Ye.

52
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,560
Farewell, my lord.

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
Do visit again, my lord.

54
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,360
Come have fun next time.

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,040
Young lady.

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,560
You're annoying.

57
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,680
Lady,

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
Duchun House is reserved
by a lord today.

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,880
You may not enter.

60
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,280
Step aside.

61
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,080
A woman coming to a place like this...

62
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,080
Are you looking to sell yourself?

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,928
How much should I pay to get in?

64
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,680
Is this enough?

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,280
This isn't nearly enough.

66
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,760
Take off your clothes.

67
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,760
Take them off.

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,880
- Take them off.
- Take them off.

69
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,200
Shen Que!

70
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,120
I know you're inside.

71
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,760
I didn't break our promise.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,040
I waited for you in the back alley.

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,240
I waited for hours and you never came.

74
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
Lu Shi'an drank the poison

75
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,440
Madam Lu prepared for me.

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
His life hangs by a thread now.

77
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
I can't let him die in my place.

78
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,160
I really want to leave with you.

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
But I don't want to owe him any debts.

80
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,480
My heart belongs only
to you and Jin now.

81
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Shen Que!

82
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
The lord says to let the lady enter.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,560
Please.

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
- Go in.
- Go in.

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
(Who delivered the last meal)

86
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,440
(served to Princess Anhe?)

87
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
It was the postmaster.

88
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,720
Before she died, Postmaster Sang Huai

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,840
(did purchase curare plants.)

90
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,800
(Master Fei's bone analysis
confirms this.)

91
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,280
(That postmaster colluded
with the Lu family,)

92
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,560
(harboring pirates
and sustaining bandits.)

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
(When Princess Anhe learned this,)

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,000
(she couldn't possibly
leave Ningzhou alive.)

Who knows what trickery he's up to

103

with that medicine?

104
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,280
And you believed him?

105
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,800
Your heart softened?

106
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,480
This is a matter of life.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,280
No room for jokes.

108
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,840
Only Lord Gao can save him now.

109
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,720
You know I've always hated him

110
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,000
and always loathed the Lu family.

111
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,320
Why should I make Gao Fu save him?

112
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,040
I beg you.

113
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,360
Just... Just consider it
helping me repay a debt, alright?

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,360
Repay a debt for you?

115
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,400
Who do you think you are?

116
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,080
Ye Qinglan.

117
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,472
Just now at the entrance,

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,000
they told me to take off my clothes.

119
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,640
Was that your order?

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,200
What?

121
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040
Can't take them off?

122
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,560
I can take them off.

123
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,880
Haven't I taken them all off?

124
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,720
If you wish to look,

125
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,160
you may look

126
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,240
whenever you want.

127
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,080
You really think
I wouldn't dare to take you?

128
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,360
If you show mercy,

129
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,680
I'll offer myself every day

130
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
and every night,

131
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,080
until you are satisfied.

132
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,680
Ye Qinglan.

133
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
To save him,

134
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,520
you'd go to such lengths?

135
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,280
What?

136
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,400
Why have you stopped?

137
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Don't you know how?

138
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,800

Why didn't you avoid it?

144
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,000
It was too dark.

145
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
I didn't see it at first.

146
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,000
Later, I thought you meant to punish me.

147
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,560
I know others could save him.

148
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:12,768
But I don't want to owe him anything.

149
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,720
You don't want to owe him,
yet you'd owe me?

150
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,440
Don't move.

151
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,440
If it hurts, you may scream.

152
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,920
Thank you, my lord.

153
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,880
Gao Fu will tend to his poison.

154
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,680
Don't worry.

155
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,520
After returning, don't seek me again.

156
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,040
Why don't you ask me

157
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,240
what you truly wish to ask.

158
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,480
I'll investigate it myself.

159
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,640
My father would never
harm Princess Anhe.

160
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,240
Okay.

161
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,840
Then prove it to me.

162
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,400
