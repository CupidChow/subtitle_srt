2
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,480
I came too late.

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,160
It's not your fault.

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,600
It's them.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,960
You've also risked your life

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
to get here.

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,120
Uncle, here's some candy for you.

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,680
Thank you, Lady Jin.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,600
Jin.

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
Mother, look.
This uncle made me a toy ox.

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,160
So pretty. Did you thank him?

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,200
You spend money on her every time.

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,840
No need to bring gifts next time.

15
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,760
Just a simple craft from the mountains.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,560
As long as Lady Jin likes it.

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,320
I'm sorry about your brother.

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,120
When we return,

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,080
I'll have Gao Fu retrieve his remains.

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,240
I'll give him a proper burial.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,800
Thank you.

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,160
(Mu, wait here for me.)

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,680
Can you accompany me
to the Baiyi Alley textile shop?

24
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,080
Okay.

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,752
(Baiyi Alley textile shop)

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,640
The letter.

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,560
What are you doing?

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,720
The letter's inside.

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,560
The letter's inside!

30
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:20,896
(Duting Station)

31
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Mu.

32
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Mu.

33
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,440
Mu.

34
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,760
Why are you so reckless?

35
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,480
You didn't ask anything,

36
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
and didn't know my plan,

37
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,720
yet you charged in anyway.

38
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,280
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

39
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,920
Lord Shen is alive and well.

40
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,520
Don't jinx him, Lady Ye.

41
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:28,576
He's breathing, right?

42
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
My lord,

43
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,320
was anything left
in Baiyi Alley textile shop

44
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
yesterday?

45
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,800
When I arrived,

46
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,640
the shop had collapsed.

47
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,800
Most items inside were burnt to ash.

48
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,560
Nothing remained?

49
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,000
I searched the ruins thoroughly,

50
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,480
but found nothing.

51
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,280
Were nearby households affected?

52
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,680
Several houses next to it
were completely burned.

53
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,080
Over ten people injured,

54
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,800
three fatalities.

55
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
Lady Ye, you...

56
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,840
I'm fine.

57
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,040
Are you alright?

58
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,440
Stop worrying about other matters.

59
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,280
Focus on recovering first.

60
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,680
Last night, I dispatched people
to handle the aftermath.

61
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,680
In the eyes of nobility,

62
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,240
someone like me

63
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,320
doesn't even deserve

64
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,120
a coffin when dead.

65
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,280
Whether you deserve it or not
has nothing to do with others.

66
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,040
But since they treat human life
as nothing,

67
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,680
we must seek justice
for the wrongfully killed.

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,400
Don't worry,

69
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,920
I'm tough to kill.

70
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,560
As for your brother's death,

71
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,120
I came too late. I'm sorry.

72
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,720
It was not your fault.

73
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,920
I...

74
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,520
Let's exchange secrets.

75
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,320
I'll reveal my identity,

76
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,720
and you tell me yours.

77
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,480
Lady Ye,

78
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
what do you mean?

79
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,120
That letter was indeed
sent by my brother,

80
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,920
but it was a secret missive
for Duke Xuan's heir.

81
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,840
Yet now, it's in your hand.

82
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,800
Either you serve the Young Lord,

83
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,240
or

84
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,120
you're the enemy who intercepted it.

85
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,120
Lady Ye.

86
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,400
Listen.

87
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,920
The Inner Bureau
is under the Royal Bureau.

88
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,920
By ancestral law,
it answers to the Emperor alone,

89
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,320
immune to external oversight.

90
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,040
I serve the royal family.

91
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,800
That letter is in my hands.

92
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,920
Naturally, there's a reason for it.

93
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,600
But I can tell you

94
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,040
I

95
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,520
am not the Young Lord's enemy.

96
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,280
I trust you.

97
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,520
You...

98
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm the daughter of Postmaster Sang Kui
from Duting Station.

99
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,200
My lord, please redress
my family's injustice.

100
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,600
Get up.

101
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,360
I knew what you just said

102
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
long ago.

103
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,320
You knew?

104
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,280
Then...

105
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,160
Then why did you...

106
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,920
Princess Anhe's death
has always been suspicious.

107
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,880
But your father truly
was in charge of Duting Station.

108
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,040
So he can't escape accountability.

109
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,840
Unless we find the real killer.

110
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,280
My lord,

111
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,880
Master Lu is here
asking about Lady Ye again.

112
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,600
Are you that eager to see him?

113
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,480
Because I want to know
who killed my parents

114
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,560
and my brother.

115
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,920
That's exactly why

116
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
we can't let them know

117
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,560
we've returned.

118
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,720
Listen to me. Rest here for a few days.

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,240
I'll keep investigating,

120
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,480
seek justice for you,

121
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,280
and bring Jin back.

122
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,400
You'll both be free
from the Lu family for good.

123
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:08,384
(Prefect's Mansion)

124
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:09,200
(Verses, wine, and arms breed new burdens.
Plum as wife, crane as son, all past karma.)

125
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Verses, wine, and arms
breed new burdens.

126
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,640
Plum as wife, crane as son,
all past karma.

127
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,240
My lord.

128
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,520
What is it?

129
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,600
Those pirates botched the job.

130
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,320
Shen Que has come back again.

131
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,520
Let him be.

132
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Officials and citizens in Ningzhou
has always stood united.

133
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,720
He's just a lowly Governor-General.

134
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,160
Can he really overturn
our entire system?

135
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,520
My lord,

136
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,880
I remember you never applied medicine
for minor wounds like this.

137
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,960
But now, you...

138
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,320
Stop all that nonsense.

139
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:47,960
Wait...

140
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,480
- Apply the medicine.
- Out.

141
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,400
- Apply the medicine.
- Get out! Hurry.

142
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,208
Apply the medicine.

143
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,840
It heals without the medicine?
Am I a miracle physician?

144
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,400
Lord Gao.

145
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,920
Well, I see.

146
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,960
Lady Ye, you're here.

147
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,440
Lord Shen is inside.

148
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,440
Thank you.

149
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,120
My lord,

150
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,400
you want me here
for the Young Lord's matter, right?

151
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,880
I'll turn my back on you.
As for the Young Lord,

152
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,400
I think we should...

153
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,520
Why does my wound hurt so much?

154
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,640
Could it be infected or something?

155
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,280
Never mind.
Let me help you apply the medicine.

156
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,720
Okay.

157
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,280
Your help is appreciated.

158
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,160
You needn't trouble yourself like this.

159
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,880
It's okay. It will be easier this way.

160
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,000
I won't look if that's better.

161
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,360
No. Even if you won't look,
I need to look...

162
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,120
Who's been applying medicine for you
all these years?

163
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,480
Well... I grew accustomed
to the battlefield.

164
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,160
Such minor wounds
aren't worth fussing over.

165
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,080
It feels m-much better.

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,920
How strange.

167
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
I have something for you.

168
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:18,320
(The Lu family poisoning case
in Ningzhou 18 years ago)

169
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,240
This letter...

170
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,880
Normally, I should let you keep this
as a memento.

171
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,160
But under current circumstances,

172
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,960
it's best burned.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
Mu kept such a heavy secret

174
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,120
for me for so many years.

175
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,080
Turns out

176
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,960
they let me live

177
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,440
only to hook him.

178
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,880
How much do you remember from back then?

179
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,760
I was young.

180
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,320
I only remember

181
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,440
a beautiful lady came to the station.

182
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,120
She treated us so kindly.

183
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,480
Come on.

184
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,480
Eat well,

185
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,720
so you can grow up strong.

186
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,680
It's so delicious.

187
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,640
Make a guess.
Is it a boy or girl in my belly?

188
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,640
I think it's a girl.

189
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,840
What do you think, Sangye?

190
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,240
I want to hear it.

191
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,080
Come on.

192
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,600
He's kicking me.

193
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,040
It must be a boy.

194
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Will you name him then?

195
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,600
My father taught me a poem.

196
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,800
Silver saddle illuminates white steed,
galloping swift as meteors speed.

197
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Let's name him Yin Ruxing. How's that?

198
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,080
Yin Ruxing, the wandering knight.

199
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,640
Okay.

200
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,080
