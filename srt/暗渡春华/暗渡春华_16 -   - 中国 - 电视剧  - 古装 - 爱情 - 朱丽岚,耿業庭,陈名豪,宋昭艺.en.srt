2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,920
Lord Gao,

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,880
can I see Jin today?

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,480
She's my daughter.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,960
I won't rest until I see her.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,000
Jin hasn't woken up yet.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,160
Seeing her won't help.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,080
Cooperate properly first.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Wait until she wakes up.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,920
Leave now.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:38,960
Master Lu.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,880
Why are you here?

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,560
I made you five-red soup.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,480
It's the best
for replenishing your energy.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,880
I-I'm fine.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,920
You call this fine?

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,280
Look how pale you've become.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,080
Come on. Sit down.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,800
If there's anything you want to eat

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,320
or drink these days, let me know.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,664
I'll make it all for you.

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,720
Come on.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,720
How is it?

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,480
What's wrong?

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,920
It's too sweet.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,480
Then I-I'll get you...

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,560
It's okay. This way.

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,120
I happen to like sweet things.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,800
Let's go.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Where's the carriage?

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,760
Master Lu...

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,120
A'man.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,160
Why did Master Lu faint here?

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,720
- A'man.
- I'll take him back now.

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,920
A'man.

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,520
Lu Shi'an?

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,688
Master Lu, you should leave.

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,800
A'man, I finally found you.

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,600
Time to go.

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,200
- Is Jin alright?
- Yes, yes.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,840
Did my blood help?

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,120
Your blood?

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,640
You should leave now.

44
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,640
Stop!

45
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,200
Lady Ye.

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,960
You've been feeding
the leeches these days?

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,520
Why didn't you tell me?

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,840
A'man,

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,520
don't blame Lord Shen.

50
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,000
Jin was already ill.

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,440
He didn't want to distract you.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,960
Besides, the Lu residence
has been surrounded.

53
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,440
It's inconvenient for me
to visit openly.

54
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,800
So I let Lord Gao
escort me in each time,

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,168
and then escort me out,

56
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,880
regarding it an interrogation.

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,160
Well...

58
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,040
Don't worry.

59
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,080
I'm fine.

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,440
As long as it saves Jin,

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,720
take as much blood as needed.

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,880
This is what a husband
and father should do.

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,040
Don't you agree, my lord?

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,000
You've said it all.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,080
What could Lord Shen say?

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,320
My lord, I have another request.

67
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,560
May I see Jin again?

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,040
If your health can't bear it,

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,760
just return and rest.

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,120
It's fine, A'man.

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,240
I failed to protect you before.

72
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,240
That's why all this happened.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,040
Don't worry about me.

74
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,080
Thank you for saving Jin.

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,680
She's my own daughter.

76
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Who else can save her but me?

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,320
He feeds only five leeches daily.

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,040
That little blood

79
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,320
wouldn't make him this listless.

80
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,800
Look at his feeble appearance.

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,360
Who's he acting for?

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,160
My lord, if you can't bear this,

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,480
I'll storm in as the villain
and drive him away.

84
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,360
A'man's distressed enough already.

85
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
I won't add to her troubles.

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:15,840
What?

87
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm not blaming you.

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,840
But you should learn from him.

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,800
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

90
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
I don't like his theatrics.

91
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,720
I'm here to massage Jin
and improve her circulation.

92
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:37,320
This will help her recover faster.

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
Thank you for your concern.

94
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,320
Let me handle it.

95
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,520
She's my foster daughter.

96
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,240
This is my duty.

97
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Master Lu, you should return home early.

98
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
- I'll handle this.
- No need. I can take care of it.

99
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,920
Let me do it.

100
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,040
Give it back.

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,680
- I'll handle this.
- This belongs to me.

102
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,840
I'll do it.

103
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,080
My lord,

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,720
the Lu residence remains sealed.

105
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,320
And you handled the case yourself.

106
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,760
I believe you don't need
to show partiality toward my daughter.

107
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
Though this is your domain,

108
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,080
you should avoid impropriety.

109
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
When upholding justice, what's to avoid?

110
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,960
Dare you claim
to be completely impartial?

111
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,360
Master Lu, dare you say
your conscience is clear?

112
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,360
Jin needs rest.

113
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,920
My lord, please escort Lu Shi'an back.

114
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,080
After you. Hurry.

115
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,120
Go, go, go. Let's go.

116
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,200
My lord.

117
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,200
You still have matters to address?

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,240
I cannot give A'man status.

119
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,400
But it doesn't mean
she's not part of Lu.

120
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,520
How intriguing, Master Lu.

121
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,280
No status.

122
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
No household registration.

123
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,760
Except for being Jin's mother,

124
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
she belongs to no one.

125
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,120
If I may venture to say,

126
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
I am Jin's biological father.

127
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,800
That fact cannot be altered, can it?

128
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,680
Who says bearing someone's child
makes her his property?

129
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,320
The title of mother
was never meant to be shackles.

130
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,640
Don't you care about her reputation?

131
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,720
I care more about her well-being.

132
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:55,328
(Lu Residence)

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,160
Madam,

134
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,920
during these days of siege,

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,120
no fresh provisions could be delivered.

136
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,040
These tea cakes are all that remain.

137
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,760
Please make do with them.

138
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,960
Got it.

139
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,920
An,

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,040
don't be afraid, okay?

141
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,200
I've found a solution.

142
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,480
- Why is she making trouble again?
- An.

143
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,520
- Didn't Shi'an watch over her?
- Where are you?

144
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,600
Master Shi'an keeps visiting
the clinic these days.

145
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,240
He's too busy.

146
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,880
An.

147
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Bring her in.

148
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
An,

149
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,840
where are you?

150
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,200
Is it tasty?

151
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,600
Yes.

152
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,360
Eat slowly.

153
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,520
What's wrong?

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Why did you stop eating?

155
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,120
My An is going through a growth spurt.

156
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,520
He gets hungry quickly.

157
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,440
I'll take these back for him.

158
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,960
No need.

159
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,800
You eat this one.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
As for these,

161
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,760
you'll bring all these to Shi'an
when you leave.

162
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
So many.

163
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,640
So many.

164
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,120
So many.

165
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Your hands...

166
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,320
Wipe your hands.

167
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,640
Madam,

168
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,120
the guards keep blocking Master Shi'an
at the gate.

169
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
They won't let him in.

170
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,720
He has been starving for days.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
Madam, no matter what,

172
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,480
you must deliver these tea cakes
to Master Shi'an personally.

173
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,960
An...

174
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,520
An's hungry. So hungry.

175
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,320
Since you enjoy grand gestures,

176
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,760
let the entire Ningzhou play your game.

177
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:32,920
(Lu Residence)

178
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,240
An, I brought you snacks. Good boy.

179
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,040
Stop!

180
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,720
You're the ones blocking my son

181
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,320
and keeping him from coming home?

182
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Step aside.

183
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,720
Stand down!

184
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,120
No.

185
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,720
An is only six.

186
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,560
He's starving.

187
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,480
What if he gets kidnapped?

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,360
Let me through.

189
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,920
My son likes fishing at the riverbank.

190
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,560
Go back.

191
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,480
It's dangerous.

192
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,080
They won't let you out.

193
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
An.

194
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,200
Don't harm An. I'm here to save you, An.

195
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm here to save you.

196
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,160
Murder!

197
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,960
Murder!

198
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,360
Murder! Murder!

199
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,760
Mother!

200
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,840
Mother!

201
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,120
Mother.

202
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,240
Mother.

203
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,760
Mother. Mother.

204
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,360
Don't die.

205
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,440
Murder.

206
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,640
Mother.

207
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,720
An.

208
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,800
Don't scare me.

209
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,480
Eat this.

210
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,800
Mother.

211
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,840
Mother. Mother.

212
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,440
Call for help!

213
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,240
Get help! Someone help her!

214
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,840
