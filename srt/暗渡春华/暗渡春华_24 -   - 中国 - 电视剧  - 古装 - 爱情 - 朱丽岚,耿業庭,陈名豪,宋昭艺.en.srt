2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,680
Shi'an.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,480
Shi'an. Shi'an.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,280
You... Don't scare me.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,680
I've loved A'man since childhood.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,840
I promised to protect her all my life.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,160
But my cowardice

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
keeps causing her more pain.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,320
This time,

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,200
things will change.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,240
You sentimental coward!

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,880
I...

13
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
I am a coward.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,320
When I learned you killed Father

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,320
and watched Mother kneel before me,

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,680
I tried to avenge them.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,320
But I couldn't.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
Because in this world,

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,400
apart from them,

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,360
you loved me most.

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,840
Yet I don't understand.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
Since you loved me most,

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,040
why couldn't you spare

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,240
my parents?

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,560
Shi'an. Shi'an. Shi'an.

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
Your father was exhausted and terrified.

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,920
He took his own life.

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,400
My child,

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,800
when you reach my age

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,800
and become family head,

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,480
you'll realize that many things
are beyond your control,

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,720
and many choices
aren't really yours to make.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,920
Shi'an, do you know that?

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,200
When you grew this tall,

35
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,800
calling me "Grandmother" in your arms,

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
I regretted everything.

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,040
But it was too late.

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,640
I spoiled you,

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,040
trying to compensate through you.

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,200
I knew

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,200
you weren't cut out
to be the family head.

42
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,600
But I couldn't harden my heart

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,800
like your father.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Sometimes, when I saw your face,

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,880
I saw myself,

46
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,760
your grandfather,

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,520
and that foolish father of yours.

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
Then I thought,

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,280
your existence alone

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,280
would make my entire life

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,520
meaningful.

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,240
Grandmother,

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,160
I'm not threatening you.

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
I truly

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,960
want to end my life.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,320
No.

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,240
Not just for A'man.

58
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,600
I hate you,

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,600
but I can't kill you.

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,400
So I have to kill myself instead.

61
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,840
I'll let you experience

62
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,640
losing your dearest kin, like I did.

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,800
I'll let you feel your beloved grandson

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
die before your eyes.

65
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,200
Shi'an. Shi'an.

66
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,320
My child.

67
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,960
Grandmother,

68
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,360
you can't

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,160
kill A'man after I'm gone.

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,400
I've left a suicide note.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,920
If she dies or disappears,

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,480
someone will give it to Shen Que

73
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,080
and deliver it to the capital.

74
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
The whole world will know

75
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,280
you murdered your own grandson.

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,760
Why are you doing this?

77
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
From now on,

78
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
in this world,

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,200
you'll only have Jin left.

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
I... I beg you.

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Don't

82
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,280
kill her mother

83
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,720
too.

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,720
I promise.

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,520
I... Someone!

86
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Shi'an!

87
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
My Shi'an!

88
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,320
Shi'an!

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Shi'an!

90
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,640
Say something.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,920
Shi'an.

92
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,880
Shi'an.

Madam, he is stable for now.
