[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,610
Someone is entering the factory.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,500
Can't you see?

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:04,820
Are you blind or deaf?

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,380
We're poor in this round.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,150
We still have to play.

7
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,000
Don't be a coward.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,920
You guys go kill yourself.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:19,800
Quit!

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,780
Let's start another round.

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,260
We're still playing.

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,230
Just quit.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,020
Jump off the airport.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,340
Give me the high power lens.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,780
There are two teams in this building.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,820
Be careful.

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,000
Go kill them.

18
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,360
Let them fight first.

19
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,010
No.

20
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,420
Don't lose any points.

21
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,800
But I haven't found the gun yet.

22
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,130
I don't have a scope.

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,170
I'm going to go there.

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,100
Cover me.

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,750
Shoot route and cover me!

26
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,310
Where's the smoke bomb?

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,290
Not yet.

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,050
How did you cooperate?

29
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,190
Do you know how to play?

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,850
You didn't give us time to cooperate.

31
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,190
What are you doing?

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,710
Aren't you tired of training?

33
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,600
There's only one week left until the game.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,650
Focus on training.

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,580
As long as you can get a place in the final,

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,960
I won't treat you badly.

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,850
What I want

38
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,450
can't be bought with money.

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,740
I just mentioned the bonus.

40
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,490
Everyone is training hard now.

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,190
As long as they can get a place in the final,

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,950
the bonus will not be less.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,410
But if they don't get the place,

44
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:37,910
this team

45
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,329
will become worthless.

46
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,660
I will never spend money on them.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,280
I understand.

48
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,670
What I want is 100% confidence.

49
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,610
Do you have confidence

50
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,930
in their abilities?

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,880
I...

52
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,420
No.

53
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,940
Then you have to find a way.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,140
[Out with a BANG]

55
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,010
[Episode 18]

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,840
In the international game,

57
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,530
you're playing against veteran professionals

58
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,280
with years of experience from all over the world.

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,910
You can't underestimate these teams.

60
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,590
Korean teams such as

61
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,240
JO and UB Team

62
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,860
are the teams Chuan has played against

63
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,950
many times over the years.

64
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,640
They are known for caution.

65
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,620
They are very executive

66
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,820
and good at transferring.

67
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,010
Their ranking points are almost perfect.

68
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,430
European and American strong teams,

69
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,130
such as Mars,

70
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,700
Lime,

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,620
Black Dragon

72
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,230
and Fox,

73
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,519
not only highlight the comprehensive strength of the team,

74
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,390
the individual ability

75
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,140
of each player is top,

76
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,660
During the battle,

77
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,500
a team

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,780
can pull out four shots.

79
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,140
Many extreme operations

80
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,060
are easy for them.

81
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,390
Canada's

82
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,190
MW Team

83
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,530
is not outstanding in comprehensive strength,

84
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,390
but its strength lies in its fierceness and sturdiness.

85
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,520
They dare to fight.

86
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,290
We've already played against domestic

87
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,909
SIK and ON Team in the play-in match.

88
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,530
So we're familiar with them.

89
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,680
So,

90
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,870
if we want to stand out,

91
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,460
we need to improve not only

92
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,720
everyone's individual skills and awareness,

93
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,740
but also

94
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,510
the team's

95
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,490
cooperation and overall pacing.

96
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,990
The game is coming.

97
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,170
Persistence

98
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,380
will pay off.

99
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,660
In this position,

100
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,880
Hong Yang and Chu Tian didn't lead the way.

101
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,570
So Chuan will face more pressure

102
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,480
from the enemy.

103
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,540
Hong Yang, come here.

104
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,610
Chu Tian, come here.

[Shi Ya]

106
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,470
In this way,

107
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,220
you can just break it.

108
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,110
Then Chuan will go this way.

109
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,270
Hello.

110
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,510
At the door?

111
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,130
Chuan,

112
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,780
Auntie made you some food.

113
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,040
She asked me to bring it to you.

114
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,140
She said you haven't been home for a long time.

115
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,100
Shi Ya.

116
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,640
This is the last time I come to you.

117
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,180
I won't come again.

118
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,420
I was wrong

119
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,200
that day at your home.

120
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,530
I don't like

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,860
being in a mess.

122
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,500
You're right.

123
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,130
I don't want to waste time

124
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,340
on you.

125
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,460
I visited auntie today

126
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,750
to made things clear to her.

127
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,030
Xiao Yichuan,

128
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,280
I don't like you anymore.

129
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:49,980
All right.

130
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,300
Take your things.

131
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,490
Where did you go in the middle of the night?

132
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,910
I went to the door and got something

133
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,650
made by your mother-in-law.

134
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:20,620
Oh.

Hey.

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,520
Why didn't you ask her to come up?

137
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,090
My mom asked Shi Ya to send it here.

138
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:29,920
Why didn't you ask

139
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,350
Shi Ya to come up?

140
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,430
Why?

141
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,350
Our base is not big.

142
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,820
We can't accommodate so many people.

143
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,170
So you mean

144
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,450
I embarrassed you?

145
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,420
What?

146
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,080
Are you jealous?

147

Don't worry.

148
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,030

she doesn't like me anymore.

150
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,610
What a pity.

151
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,420
She's beautiful and kind

152
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,350
and has a good personality.

153
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,940
She is known as a fairy in the E-sports circle.

154
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
If she is a fairy,

155
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,410
you'll be the Queen Mother.

156
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,030
She is so infatuated.

157
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,970
Don't you have

158
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,180
a little

159
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,480

No.

161
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,100
No way.

162
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,020
Is there anyone who doesn't like

163
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,250
a girl like Shi Ya?

164
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,020
I don't like her.

165

Oh.

What kind of girl do you like?

167
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,110
The one who likes pouting prettily?

168
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,180
You don't have a fever.

169
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,310
Drink more hot water.

170

girls who pout prettily.

172
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,470
Am I right?

173
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,610
Am I right?

174
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,760
Am I right?

175
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,580
What kind of girl

176
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,100
do you like?

177
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,850
Look in the mirror

178
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,030
and you'll know.

179
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,340
What?

180
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,790
I'll reluctantly

181
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,910
forgive you once today.

182
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,720
Hey.

183
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,860
Eat less later.

184
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,120
We need to shoot an advertisement tomorrow.

185
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:18,880
Okay.

186
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,200
No problem.

187
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,060
We're here.

188
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,540
Okay.

189
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,620
Hello.

190
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,420
Please come with me.

191
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,460
Okay.

192
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,230
Let's go.

193
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,220
The clothes are ironed.

194
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,780
This is the size you sent me.

195
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,940
And according to your requirements,

196
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,820
we also prepared other sizes.

197
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,660
Okay.

198
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,420
We'll be right there.

199
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,060
Okay.

200
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,540
Thank you.

201
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,130
What do you think of my sneakers?

202
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,020
I have a few pairs in my trunk.

203
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,350
How about matching them?

204
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,350
I think this pair

205
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,120
is very beautiful.

206
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,890
Right?

207
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,420
Yes.

208
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,620
Hurry up.

209
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,840
Go get changed.

210
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,610
Are you sure?

211
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,450
This is for commercials.

212
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,650
Xiong Jiujiu.

213
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,400
You need to give me an explanation.

214
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,710
I'll wait for you at the studio.

215
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,790
Xiong Jiujiu.

216
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,180
Come back!

217
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:58,730
Xiong Jiujiu.

218
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,840
Okay, nice.

219
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,400
Come on.

220
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,000
Turn around.

221
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,460
Okay.

222
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,580
Okay.

223
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,030
Put your hand on your chest.

224
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,580
Okay, then on your shoulder.

225
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:20,940
Good.

226
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,100
Let's change the side.

227
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,620
Very good.

228
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,110
Be handsome.

229
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,110
OK. Sit down.

230
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:33,900
OK.

231
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,690
Smile.

232
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,340
Okay, stop smiling.

233
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,360
Be natural.

234
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,850
The last pose.

235
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:50,820
Come on.

236
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
Walk.

237
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,390
Good.

238
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,780
Very good.

239
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,740
It's good to show the logo.

240
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,020
Good.

241
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:06,750
OK.

242
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,170
Thank you.

243
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,830
That's all for today.

244
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,560
Done?

245
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,150
Ah!

246
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,100
Put on your

247
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,130
beautiful sneakers.

248
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,210
Don't...

249
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,480
I won't tell anyone about what happened today.

250
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,680
Go get changed.

251
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,530
I'm waiting for you.

252
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,330
Xiao Yichuan.

253
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,250
No.

254
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:04,860
No.

255
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,760
I'm not.

256
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,880
I'm not.

257
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,340
Li Xiaofeng.

258
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,920
Yes, I am.

259
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,010
Your outfit is quite unique.

260
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,330
Your home is nearby?

261
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,720
Did you just get up?

262
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,780
No, I'm shooting an ad.

263
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,130
I don't usually dress like this.

264
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,970
I watched your game two days ago.

265
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:27,860
Pretty handsome.

266
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,840
You played well.

267
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,840
Thanks.

268
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,830
You played well too.

269
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,540
Thank you.

270
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,530
No.

271
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,620
I mean

272
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,620
you are the Prince Charming of E-sports

273
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,970
and my most respected senior.

274
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,430
Can I...

275
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:45,900
Take a photo.

276
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,610
Let's take a photo first.

277
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,120
Ah.

278
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:49,810
Here.

279
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,040
The knockout match is coming.

280
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,410
Do your best.

281
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,510
If you can't get to the final,

282
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,190
I'll post this photo

283
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,300
on Weibo.

284
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,490
No.

285
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,220
What are you doing?

286
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:03,980
So slow.

287
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,700
Li Xiaofeng.

288
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,010
Wow.

289
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,650
You're really something.

290
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,560
You met a star behind my back.

291
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,040
Well.

292
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,470
Do you still invest in teams?

293
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,650
Have you heard of JR Team?

294
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,380
Little dark horse.

295
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:16,910
Diamond in the rough.

296
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,870
Everyone can fight against five.

297
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,460
We're leaving now.

298
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,410
Go ahead.

299
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,400
It depends on your performance.

300
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,770
Keep in touch.

301
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,530
Bye.

302
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,210
Bye.

303
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,810
Why did you stop me?

304
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,170
I was seeking sponsorship.

305
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:28,980
He is

306
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Li Xiaofeng,

307
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,220
the founder of

308
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,790
WEG Club,

309
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,060
our potential investor.

310
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,030
That's enough.

311
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,540
He

312
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,860
is also an Olympic torchbearer.

313
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,700
He's handsome.

314
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:39,980
Handsome?

315
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,490
Where?

316
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,980
Eyes or nose?

317
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,900
Month or ears?

318
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,660
More handsome than me?

319
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,530
Are...are you jealous?

320
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,540
No.

321
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,140
I just want to know which part is handsome.

322
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,460
Tell me more.

323
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,380
You're the most handsome.

324
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,220
You're the most handsome in the universe.

325
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,360
You're handsome in down pants.

326
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:05,910
Yeah.

327
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,150
I think this one is good.

328
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,850
This one is also pretty.

329
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,550
Take away the ugly thing in your hand.

330
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,300
How can you say that about yourself?

331
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,810
You're obviously handsome.

332
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,380
Put your thermal top in your thermal pants.

333
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,820
Then put pants in your socks.

334
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,420
How handsome you are.

335
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,430
Xiong Jiujiu.

336
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,050
I'm controlling the steering wheel.

337
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,270
Watch your mouth.

338
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,400
Where did you get plastic surgery?

339
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,550
What?

340
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,810
I'm natural.

341
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,950
You're an angel.

342
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,810
Why is there no trace of

343
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,670
taking off your wings?

344
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,720
Do you know why

345
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,790
the tyrannosaurus died out?

346
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,819
Why?

347
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,349
Because their front limbs were too short.

348
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,210
They couldn't

349
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,700
applaud for your charisma.

350
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,230
They were so sad that they died.

351
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,069
Do you know why people send you ads

352
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,270
when you're walking in the park or on the road?

353
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,250
Because you're so handsome.

354
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,320
I'm sorry about today.

355
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,400
To make it up to you,

356
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,490
I'll take you to a place.

357
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:50,600
Let's go.

358
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,990
We finally climbed up.

359
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:03,910
What do you

360
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,370
think of this place?

361
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,130
Why did you bring me here?

362
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,540
You brought me here to see the stars, didn't you?

363
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,250
Are you sure I'm not making it up to you?

364
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,240
I'm here today

365
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,450
to give you a chance

366
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,470
to write down

367
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,540
your dissatisfaction with me.

368
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,600
Then fold them into paper planes and fly them out.

369
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:27,660
In this way,

370
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,080
we'll wipe the slate clean

371
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,060
and patch up.

372
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,620
Xiong Jiujiu,

373
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:34,830
is this how you were with your friends

374
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,230
when you were a kid?

375
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,190
Do you know how much time

376
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,740
a sanitation worker spends cleaning every day?

377
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,610
Besides,

378
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,920
I don't dare to complain.

379
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,750
It's now or never.

380
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,330
You won't have a chance if you don't write today.

381
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,170
Besides,

382
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,170
if you don't write,

383
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,960
I'll write.

384
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,250
Come on.

385
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,570
There's not much to complain about.

386
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,660
Don't peek.

387
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,620
I'll see.

388
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,100
There's nothing to complain about

389
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,380
a great boyfriend like me.

390
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,530
You...

391
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,260
Give it back!

392
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,300
May Xiao Yichuan be pure and bright

393
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,860
and do what he wants to do.

394
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,240
Don't be tired by others' views.

395
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,940
My unhappiness flew away.

396
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,150
My unhappiness flew away too.

397
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,870
So are you going to write?

398
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,050
Let's wipe the slate clean

399
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:15,980
and patch things up.

400
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,510
I'm not going to write.

401
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,180
I express it with my actions.

402
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,640
So...

403
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,010
Like this?

404
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,160
Actually, I'm very happy

405
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,860
to be with you every day.

406
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,950
Even if I do something I don't want to do,

407
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,890
I never have any resentment.

408
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,630
Childish.

409
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,030
The official stamp of the Xiong Jiujiu Couple.

410
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:32,920
The couple I ship

411
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,840
will never break up.

412
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,250
-And they must get married. -Li Xiaofeng is here too.

413
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,330
Thank you for your comfort.

414
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,190
Welcome fans of Boyi brothers

415
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,550
to the big family of Tian&Wang Brothers.

416
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,660
Tonight, we are all the fans of Tian&Wang Brothers.

417
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,270
Tearfully wish you good luck.

418
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,830
You're still up?

419
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm waiting to congratulate you in person.

420
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,120
Only verbal blessing?

421
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,770
I can also prepare

422
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,270
2,000 firecrackers for you.

423
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,250
Forget it.

424
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,340
Cheers.

425
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,750
Good morning.

426
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,340
What do you want to do

427
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,060
in this dress?

428
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,430
To take the promotional photos of the league.

429
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,720
You'll win

430
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,310
if you can walk out of the house like this.

431
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:31,950
You...

432
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,030
How could you say that?

433
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,050
This outfit is not suitable for work.

434
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,240
Go back and change.

435
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,860
No.

436
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,470
I just want to

437
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,660
look nice.

438
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,190
Humph.

439
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,230
Talk normally.

440
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,290
Humph!

441
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,890
You're so fierce.

442
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,430
Get changed.

443
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:22,830
What?

444
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,400
Excuse me.

445
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,140
Tearfully wish you.

446
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,680
Be strong.

447
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,180
Please come in.

448
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,750
Oh.

449
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,510
Look who's here.

450
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,410
This is the Xiong Jiujiu Couple's first appearance.

451
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,030
The red envelope is for you or for him?

452
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,530
Hey.

453
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,910
The Xiong Jiujiu Couple

454
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,380
is our company's official couple.

455
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,790
Pay me.

456
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,230
Chuan's girlfriend fans

457
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,850
cried under his Weibo.

458
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,130
Do you want to comfort them?

459
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,380
What girlfriend fans?

460
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,190
Don't talk nonsense.

461
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,260
No, no, no.

462
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,550
This is my first time surfing the Internet.

463
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,610
I saw it wrong.

464
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,260
Congratulations.

465
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,300
May you a happy marriage and have a baby soon.

466
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,810
All right.

467
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,800
Let's discuss the details with the organizing committee.

468
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,340
Let's go.

469
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,290
Let's go.

470
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:08,930
Hong Yang,

471
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,220
why are your eyes so swollen?

472
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,570
It's a long story.

473
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,090
In short,

474
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,510
the couple I shipped broke up.

475
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,260
Have you ever shipped the couple?

476
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,080
Do you know what it's like

477
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,240
to ship the wrong couple?

478
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,340
Why are you looking at me?

479
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,310
Hong Yang.

480
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,260
Are you possessed by Wang Boyu?

481
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,060
He sang sad love songs

482
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,600
in the room all night.

483
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,160
Their sadness is different.

484
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:54,900
Anyway,

485
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,030
don't believe in love, suffer less.

486
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,140
But I believe

487
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,050
Hong Yang will cheer up

488
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,410
in the future.

489
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,690
Me too.

490
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,690
I'll force myself to cheer up.

491
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,980
There's no chance to fight in the play-in match.

492
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,220
So in the knockout match,

493
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,680
please give me a chance.

494
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,360
Just defeat me first.

495
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,440
What?

496
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,460
Hey.

497
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,320
Forget it.

498
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,200
Let's go.

499
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,130
Wen is waiting.

500
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,340
Tian,

501
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,700
don't protect your captain.

502
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,710
Look at this.

503
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,340
The captain of SIK

504
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,530
needs your protection too.

505
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,080
I'm leaving.

506
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,900
Hey.

507
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,460
Captain,

508
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,710
there are plenty of people in the world.

509
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,110
Why do you have a crush on Chu Tian?

510
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,010
Go wherever you want.

511
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,840
All right.

512
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,310
That's all for today.

513
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,130
Thank you.

514
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,610
Thank you.

515
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,270
Thank you.

516
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,670
Let's ask them out for dinner after work.

517
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,580
OK. Let’s eat.

518
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,860
Chuan,

519
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,270
let's have dinner together.

520
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,130
Okay, go ahead.

521
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,340
I'll go back to practice.

522
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,360
It took me the whole afternoon.

523
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,540
It seems that

524
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,000
we're not shortlisted.

525
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,740
Yeah.

526
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,810
Don't be so tense.

527
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,920
Otherwise, how can I send you home?

528
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,200
You are

529
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,360
young and reckless.

530
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,560
Chu Tian, you are so arrogant.

531
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,580
You can't learn anything from Xiao Yichuan.

532
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,760
Now that you mention it, I don't feel like eating.

533
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,780
Let's compete.

534
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,970
Train foursome.

535
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,330
Let's do it.

536
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,640
Which map?

537
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,710
Let them choose.

538
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,260
OK.

539
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,120
Then we won't go easy on you.

540
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,440
Choose

541
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,450
a map with the least domestic guns.

542
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,780
Then you have no choice.

543
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,660
It's okay.

544
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,580
Unlike you,

545
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,940
you can't even play with a gun.

546
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,180
Are you provoking me?

547
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,420
Then...

548
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,080
how about

549
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,690
the latest

550
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,580
I'm sure Hong Yang hasn't had time to study it.

551
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,580
The old city map.

552
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,130
There are 30 blind spots.

553
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,930
The location of the car

554
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,790
is quite remote.

555
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,020
Do you want me to show you the way?

556
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,700
Our SIK is good at lane battle.

557
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,110
It doesn't matter if

558
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,010
we don't have a car.

559
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,140
Lane battle.

560
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,230
A street runs through the city from south to north.

561
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,860
Find out who is the father.

562
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,650
Mr. Dong, you're so arrogant.

563
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,660
You don't respect us at all.

564
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,230
Then ask other teams to join us.

565
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,870
Let's play a practice game.

566
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,480
Let's

567
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,610
widen their vision.

568
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,160
Old people,

569
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,610
times have changed.

570
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,740
Who taught

571
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,620
you that?

572
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,080
You.

573
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,120
Let's play a big game.

574
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,290
Let's draw lots to form a team.

575
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,450
Chu Tian will take the lead position.

576
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,510
Do you do a live stream?

577
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,880
We want to see you fight too.

578
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:29,560
Yeah.

579
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,020
It's much more interesting

580
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,940
than the official competition.

581
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,620
OK.

582
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,540
Ask someone out.

583
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,690
Ask someone out.

584
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,150
Hey.

585
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,620
Where are they going?

586
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,390
Are you really going to train Chu Tian to be the commander?

587
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,050
Is your hand injured again?

588
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,060
It has nothing to do with my hand.

589
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,060
I'm not the only one in JR Team.

590
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,050
Chu is 20 years old.

591
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,330
He has the ability.

592
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,160
What about you?

593
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,460
In this world,

594
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,000
Xiao Yichuan is not the only one.

595
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,260
Don't be pretentious.

596
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,400
You've arranged the rest

597
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,200
of JR Team.

598
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,640
In that case,

599
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,990
why did you risk your life?

600
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,300
I saw your training time.

601
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,390
It's more than ten hours.

602
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,960
You forgot the pain after you recovered, right?

603
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,440
The competition is coming up.

604
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,170
At least I have to

605
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,140
play this league with them.

606
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,740
Come on.

607
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,250
Have you finished your whisper?

608
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,460
We've made an appointment.

609
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,500
The teams are almost arranged.

610
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,710
So,

611
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,030
are you still participating?

612
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,180
Of course.

613
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,750
Who are you teaming up with?

614
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,650
Tian.

615
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,320
Are we

616
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,100
destiny?

617
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,170
A beautiful dream.

618
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,440
It feels like flying

619
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,810
in the sky of destiny.

620
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,620
A beautiful dream.

621
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,920
The world is different because of you.

[Laughing]

623
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,770
Is there any suspense?

624
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,560
The Tian&Wang Brothers will definitely win.

625
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,310
This is fate.

626
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,960
Wonderful.

627
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,310
Right?

628
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,469
Trash.

[Allen]

633
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,739
Allen.

634
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,550
You are in the same team with Chu Tian and Wang Boyu.

635
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,469
Why are you still nervous?

636
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,350
We may lose points at the beginning.

637
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,870
Stop talking.

638
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,060
It's more nervous

639
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,070
than being with you guys.

640
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,290
Chuan and I are compatible.

641
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,400
We promote each other.

642
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,570
You are born to be invincible.

643
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,409
Than you.

644
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,380
Let's begin.

645
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,010
Jump into City F.

646
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,410
Jump into the port.

647
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,690
A container in direction 255.

648
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,440
400 meters.

649
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,650
Xiao Yichuan has a sniper.

650
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,050
Chu Tian and Wang Boyu are

651
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,550
in the unfinished building 155.

652
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,000
Chu Tian is so tough.

653
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,260
Wang Boyu,

654
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,390
follow my mark

655
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,250
into the safe zone.

656
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,600
Hide behind the grass.

657
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,690
Don't attack unless I tell you to shoot.

658
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,660
I will

659
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,140
meet you after searching.

660
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,060
Allen, enter the circle.

661
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,260
When you enter the circle,

662
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,400
you only throw bombs and smoke bombs.

663
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,700
Don't leave any shooting information.

664
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,110
Captain Zhou,

665
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,140
drive a car and

666
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,050
follow me closely.

667
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:44,840
Just report the points.

668
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,460
Don't shoot.

669
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,550
Okay.

670
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,820
Chu Tian is good.

671
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,500
Others won't know

672
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
our strategy of entering the circle.

673
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,320
Did you learn this from Xiao Yichuan?

674
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,980
If you want to learn,

675
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,050
you can pay me.

676
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,160
Chu Tian's team is still a full team.

677
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,330
Chu Tian has been trained well by

678
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,190
random matching on the Internet.

679
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,890
Now, it's easier for him

680
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,910
to direct stronger teammates.

681
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,840
Although Dong Shi and Hong Yang are not as good as Wang Boyu,

682
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,270
they work well with Chu Tian.

683
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,390
In this case,

684
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,400
our team is very comprehensive.

685
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,060
Did you see the elimination message?

686
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,180
Xiao Yichuan is like a small bulldozer.

687
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,410
Who can stand him?

688
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,260
Let's review the video later.

689
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,230
Nan and Xiao Yichuan are in the same team.

690
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,840
I'll ask him for the voice message.

691
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,830
Nan is so lucky.

692
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,320
I wonder if he has learned anything

693
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,310
from Chuan.

694
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,970
You've learned to play tricks on your teammate?

695
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,210
Nan, you shot well.

696
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,560
Next, we should deal with Chu Tian,

697
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,010
Wang Boyu and Zhou.

698
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,700
The three people I love the most

699
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,490
are going to be in the same frame again.

700
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,130
But I just want to see them in the same frame.

701
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,930
I don't want them to kill each other.

702
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,830
What should I do?

703
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,440
If they don't fight in the same frame,

704
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,040
will they play cards?

705
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,200
Are Boyi brothers

706
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,910
officially breaking up today?

707
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,940
Let me cry alone for a while.

708
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:16,920
The final round is coming.

709
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,230
Who do you think will win?

710
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,450
Chuan and Nan,

711
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,440
or Tian, Captain Wang and Captain Zhou?

712
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,130
I bet on the latter.

713
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,370
After all, there are three of them.

714
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,080
It must be Chuan.

715
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,460
I bet on Chuan too.

716
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,170
Family vote is invalid.

717
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,570
It's the sound of Xiong Jiujiu.

718
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,350
Gosh.

719
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,630
Don't change the subject, okay?

720
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,830
We're still making a bet.

721
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,700
I bet on Xiao Yichuan too.

722
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,140
Will the winning team give gifts to fans today?

723
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,330
This is so unfair

724
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,450
to our JR Team.

725
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,880
Both commanders

726
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,060
are from our team.

727
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,530
The other team didn't get the elimination message.

728
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,840
I suspect it's 500 meters on the right.

729
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,300
There's one inside the house with red roof.

730
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,300
Nan.

731
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,100
Go to the location I said and seduce him.

732
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,950
OK.

733
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,340
Chuan,

734
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,660
a man with M24.

735
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:08,420
Hurry up.

736
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,720
Observe Xiao Yichuan from his teammate's perspective.

737
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,610
Wonderful snipe.

738
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,580
At this speed,

739
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,110
I didn't even get to see him shoot.

740
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,390
Even Captain Zhou couldn't fight back.

741
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,070
Xiao Yichuan is really something.

742
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,530
The final circle.

743
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,790
He has located me,

744
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,150
but he doesn't know where you are yet.

745
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,200
So he doesn't dare to shoot.

746
00:38:59,230 --> 00:38:59,950
You lure him out.

747
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,900
I'll take this point.

748
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,590
No.

749
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,930
You get up and rush.

750
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,090
OK.

751
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,050
Nice!

752
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,290
It's a peak battle.

753
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,390
Each team lost a player.

754
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,510
Congratulations, Tian and Captain Wang.

755
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,200
Chu Tian shot so well.

756
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,670
He's really good.

757
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,910
So cool.

758
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,000
Congratulations to Tian and Captain Wang.

759
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,050
Those comments just now

760
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,670
said they want to send a plane. Don't be shameless.

761
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,490
[Wang Boyu]

762
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,770
Brother-in-law, come here.

763
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,380
Netizens want you to give a speech.

764
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,540
Come on.

765
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,020
I'm going to turn my grief into power.

766
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,780
Grit my teeth and run.

767
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,770
What's wrong?

768
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,520
How are you?

769
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,790
What do you mean?

770
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,400
Stop pretending.

771
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,690
Where were you shooting

772
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,520
in the game with me?

773
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,600
Is this your level of gun-forcing, Xiao Yichuan?

774
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,420
Don't think too much.

775
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,140
Bye.

776
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:13,870
Hey.

777
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,720
Five days until the game.

778
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,710
Don't slack off.

779
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,680
Don't worry, Capt. Qin.

780
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,670
I've seen the calendar of the competition.

781
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,500
It's good to travel.

782
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,240
It's better to focus on skills than the calendar.

783
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,280
I think there's room for improvement.

784
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,170
Thank you for your hard work.

785
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,800
What do you want to eat? I'll make supper.

786

[Bonus scenes ahead]

787
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,800
Think about what you need in your base.

788
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,610
Just help yourself.

789
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,030
I don't know what they lack,

790
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,610
but you're the only one I need.

791
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,080
I think you're not smart enough.

792
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,860
Why do you take so many?

793
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,730
There are so many of you.

794
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,950
Everyone needs one.

795
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,240
You're becoming more and more like the landlady now.

796
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,860
Cut the crap.

797
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,510
When we get the place in the play-in match,

798
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,460
it's proud

799
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,760
to be the landlady.

800
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,320
Don't you think about it?

801
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,980
Now that you mention it,

802
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,450
it sounds quite tempting.

803
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,650
You agreed to be the landlady?

00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,340
It depends on your future performance.
