The reason for their rise in the ranking

127

There are many freshmen in that game.

I don't think killing 29 people

it will be listed in the core business of the company next year.

153

ON's valuation

155
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,220

157
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,860
Go and see how other teams do live stream.

158
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,070
Although ON Team was established not long ago,

159

their comprehensive strength

160
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,430
is not worse than that of old teams.

161
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,960
It must be

162
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,220
a win-win cooperation between Green Stone Live and ON Sports.

163

Of course.

164

Our company takes the first live stream seriously.

172
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,909
We'll also give some publicity expenses

173
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,030
to purchase external resources.

174
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,060
Don't worry.

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,790
I'll ask my subordinates

176
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,830
to talk to you about the plan and resources.

177
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,880
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

178
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,750
Not at all.

179
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,140
Oh.

180
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,920
A few days ago,

181
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,550
an anchor broadcast a game

182
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,810
on your platform.

183
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,820
And many people watched it.

184
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,730
The anchor's name is X99.

185
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,340
Yes.

186
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,900
I remember it too.

187
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,400
It seems to

188
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,260
have a good date.

189
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,780
After all, Xiao Yichuan

190
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,840
was in that game.

191
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,510
The anchor herself

192
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,890
is also

193
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,300
an E-sports team manager.

194
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,930
Manager?

195
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,690
Trainee manager?

196
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,750
Besides,

197
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,130
she used to do mukbang.

198
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,610
Mr. Feng.

199
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,830
Isn't this against the rules?

200
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,600
You mean...

201
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,600
We've confirmed the intention of cooperation.

202
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,630
But there are other teams

203
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,630
competing with us on the same platform.

204
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,290
Oh.

205
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,980
Don't worry.

206
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,710
We will be strict with E-sports live streaming.

207
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,260
We're finally rich.

208
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,880
Thank you, hero.

209
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,870
Isn't it because you came to the office

210
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,420
at a propitious time today

211
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,810
and forced me to wear

212
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,080
yellow clothes to attract money with you?

213
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,910
Of course it has a lot to do with that.

214
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,890
But you're still the biggest contributor.

215
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
If we get the budget, we must keep moving forward steadily.

216
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,330
Don't make any mistakes.

217
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,370
The live stream can't stop.

218
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,150
Consider it as a publicity for the team.

219
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,220
No problem.

220
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,020
I'm happy.

221
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,480
Hello.

222
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,700
Okay.

223
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,430
Boss,

224
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,730
I need to take a leave this afternoon.

225
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,830
What's wrong?

226
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,020
What's the problem?

227
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,210
It's personal.

228
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,990
I'll go back to the base after I solve it.

229
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,090
OK.

230
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,080
Hello, Chu Tian.

231
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,400
Are you free this afternoon?

232
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,810
Can you go to Green Stone Live with me?

233
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,890
They said I broke the contract

234
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,370
and asked me to pay the penalty.

235
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,840
Your live streaming

236
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,100
doesn't match the label of mukbang.

237
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,360
It's already a violation.

238
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,340
You can discuss with me.

239
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,210
Why did you just fine me?

240
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,870
It's written in the contract you signed.

241
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,230
Can't a eating anchor broadcast something else?

242
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,140
You know clearly how much money

243
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,460
Xiong Jiujiu has brought

244
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,750
to the platform.

245
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,530
Look.

246
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,200
You can broadcast something else,

247
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,430
but there's a time limit.

248
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,900
And your mukbang time is not enough.

249
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,770
I didn't read it carefully when I signed it.

250
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,460
Is there really no room for discussion?

251
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,370
This is your punishment document.

252
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,770
I have to do mukbang

253
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,140
at least five hours a day.

254
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,530
And during this period,

255
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,570
you don't have any live streaming income.

256
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:15,820
Or

257
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,200
you can also choose to

258
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,740
pay liquidated damages directly.

259
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,780
It's all about money, right?

260
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,650
If you think the anchor broke the rules,

261
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,820
the platform can terminate the contract.

262
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,330
Now you want the popularity of the anchor,

263
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,600
but you're exploiting her.

264
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,740
It means we have to lose money

265
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,440
and work hard.

266
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,460
Do you think this is a contract of selling herself?

267
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,290
She broke the rules first.

268
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,170
We're just following the rules.

269
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,060
Think about how to solve it.

270
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,900
-No need to think. Compensate. -Make up for the length of time.

271
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,520
What are you thinking?

272
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,740
Five hours a day.

273
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,530
Aren't you afraid of choking yourself?

274
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,910
I have a lot of team stuffs

275
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,180
to deal with.

276
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,230
Let's quickly solve it and leave.

277
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,700
From tonight,

278
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,280
I'll make up for my live stream time.

279
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,390
You can monitor my live stream room.

280
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,180
Okay, Chu Tian, let's go.

281
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,500
What are you doing?

282
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,770
I have something to do.

283
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,880
Let's talk later.

284
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,790
Do you have to work overtime at this hour?

285
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,220
Don't carry it yourself.

286
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
Boss may help you.

287
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,150
You can ask him for help.

288
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,540
You suddenly dressed up so grandly.

289
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,250
It's actually...

290
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,860
Shut up.

291
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,030
I'm going to start the live stream.

292
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,500
Hello.

293
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,990
Good evening, babies.

294
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,410
Welcome to today's Bear's live room.

295
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,250
Today,

296
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,980
I'm recommending a common food,

297
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,270
Liuzhou river snails rice noodles.

298
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,140
I believe many babies

299
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,540
like river snails rice noodles very much.

300
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,020
Are friends in Guangxi familiar with this?

301
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,140
So how to cook it?

302
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,300
Today, Xiong will recommend you a way

303
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,620
to cook river snails rice noodles well.

304
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,390
What is it?

305
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,470
Add noodles with fried tofu and a pickled egg.

306
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,180
Of course, we have to add chitterlings.

307
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,570
Are there any sisters who like chitterlings too?

308
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,840
Crab sticks or chitterlings

309
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,940
are actually fine.

310
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,970
Open it and let's have a taste.

311
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,400
Wow.

312
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,690
It smells so good.

313
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,550
You can make it at home.

314
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,810
It smells good.

315
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,350
It stinks.

316
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,210
The flavoring bags inside

317
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,040
are really rich.

318
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,410
What's that smell?

319
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,150
Don't make my sneakers stink.

320
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,310
I heard a man talking.

321
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,510
You heard a man talking?

322
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,100
No, no, no.

323
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,020
I was watching TV.

324
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,960
I think it's Xiao Yichuan's voice.

325
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,290
-You can add more vinegar if you like. -Xiao Yichuan is around.

326
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,360
It's awesome.

327
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:39,980
It stinks.

328
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,660
Anchor lives with Xiao Yichuan.

329
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,420
Hey, what are you doing?

330
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,310
Xiao Yichuan, what are you doing?

331
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,100
Put it down.

332
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,920
Do you use my perfume as air fresher?

333
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,760
If you don't put it down,

334
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,270
I'll pour noodles on your bed.

335
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,450
I'll sleep with you after you pour it.

336
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,890
Are you a devil, Xiao Yichuan?

337
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,790
It's just a bottle of perfume.

338
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,620
I'll give you a box of it later.

339
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
A box for me?

340
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,020
Men are always liars.

341
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,950
Who would believe you?

342
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,160
Gosh.

343
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,760
Xiao Yichuan really has a girlfriend and they live together.

344
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,180
I broke up.

345
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,300
I'm sorry.

346
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,850
Bear's live stream will pause for a moment.

347
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,340
What?

348
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,910
I want to sign live stream contract

349
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,380
for our team.

350
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,050
Fine.

351
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,650
That's what most E-sports teams

352
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,540
have done.

353
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,750
So I want to ask you

354
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,210
if you have any recommended live streaming platforms.

355
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,250
Don't you already have one?

356
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,890
I don't want to sign with them.

357
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,930
Why?

358
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,780
Forget it.

359
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,250
I'll figure it out myself.

360
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,410
Where are you going?

361
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,950
Don't forget the team schedule.

362
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,590
Hello, everyone.

363
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,730
I'm back.

364
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Next, I'll recommend instant noodles to you.

365
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,250
If Chuan's team

366
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,490
can join our platform,

367
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,740
I will definitely

368
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,490
get the best publicity resources for you.

369
00:16:59,490 --> 00:16:59,850
Thank you.

370
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,810
But don't just use resources or create topics.

371
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,609
Many E-sports teams have been destroyed by live streaming.

372
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,069
Don't worry. I know it.

373
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,910
You hate commercial hype the most.

374
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:10,930
As for the details,

375
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,500
contact our team manager later.

376
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,980
But don't mention me.

377
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,660
Just say Wang Boyu recommended you.

378
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,230
Have you asked for Wang Boyu's permission

379
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,650
when you used his name?

380
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:24,569
Come on.

381
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,660
Cheers.

382
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,550
I need to take this call.

383
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,130
You're going to be an anchor?

384
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,130
Xiao Yichuan,

385
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,760
you've changed.

386
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,320
Wang Boyu.

387
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,270
Do you know what love is?

388
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,340
What?

389
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,030
She has always liked me.

390
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,060
I already felt it.

391
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,650
It's useless for her to pretend.

392
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,540
I saw it through.

393
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,400
She said so many harsh words to me

394
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,900
just to get my attention

395
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,760
to get my attention.

396
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,820
She thought I couldn't understand.

397
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,430
She asked me to accompany her when she went out.

398
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,930
Every time she had eye contact with me,

399
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,570
she quickly turned away.

400
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,570
In order to beg me today,

401
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,960
she even made up.

402
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,340
Well.

403
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,780
She did so much for me.

404
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,350
I should help her.

405
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,820
Forget it.

406
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,560
You've never been in a relationship.

407
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,050
You don't understand.

408
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,900
Love is not something

409
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,800
you can buy.

410
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,880
Xiao Yichuan,

411
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,940
you're amazing.

412
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,230
Hey, have you been home?

413
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,800
Why do you ask this?

414
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,440
Why do I ask?

415
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,750
Tell me the truth.

416
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Did you take away

417
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,710
the bank card of your scholarship?

418
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,300
Why did you take it?

419
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,150
Are you going to pay the liquidated damage for Xiong Jiujiu?

420
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,120
Liquidated damage?

421
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,790
Stop pretending.

422
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,970
The liquidated damage of live stream is very high.

423
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,000
Your money...

424
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,860
Chu Tian.

425
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,630
Xiong Jiujiu.

426
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,090
Xiong Jiujiu.

427
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,320
Xiong Jiujiu.

428
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,240
What's wrong?

429
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,970
Give me your hand.

430
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,420
Stop!

431
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,390
Stop!

432
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,830
Taxi!

433
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,400
Doctor!

434
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,870
Doctor!

435
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,870
Doctor!

436
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,940
Check on her.

437
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,980
One would rather die to make up for the time,

438
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,450
and the other is willing to starve to death.

439
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,700
I thought that stupid boss was a pushover.

440
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,360
I didn't expect him to be like Huang Shiren.

441
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,620
Hello.

442
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,620
Who is it?

443
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:17,930
Hello.

444
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,540
It's late.

445
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,130
Neither of them is here.

446
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,020
Where did they go?

447
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,770
[Xiong Jiujiu]

448
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,230
Hello?

449
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,150
She's in the hospital.

450
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,760
How is she?

451
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,040
Acute gastroenteritis.

452
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,420
Is it serious?

453
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,660
White cells are high.

454
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,650
She is severely dehydrated.

455
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,000
She needs to be hospitalized for observation.

456
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,540
Please let her rest.

457
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,030
Okay.

458
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,460
Okay.

459
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,940
There are two more IV bottles after this one.

460
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,540
Okay.

461
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,930
After finishing this, ring the bell next to her.

462
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,310
Okay.

463
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,610
We can leave an escort here.

464
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,730
Who can sign here?

465
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,530
I'll stay.

The Dragon King wanted a son-in-law

517
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,920
who weighed 100 grams.

518
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,820
There was a turtle.

519
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,580
He weighed 99.8 grams

520
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,450
in the first time..

521
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,990
He came out of the Dragon Palace in disappointment.

522
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,750
The turtle met a shrimp.

523
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,200
Shrimp said I weighed 0.2 grams.

524
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,150
It's exactly 100 grams when I'm in your ears.

525
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:55,830
The turtle was very happy.

526
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,860
So he went there again.

527
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,460
Fine.

528
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,440

I've never seen a boss

It's my fault.

578

I shouldn't have left what Chu Tian bought.

But I've made up all the money

580

he spent on buying things

581
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,730
into his next month's salary.

582

You're not talking about this?

585
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,660
It's just some peripheral devices.

586
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,540
They are really expensive.

587
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,180
You asked your employees to buy devices.

592

just now?

603

It's about Xiong Jiujiu.

604
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,900
Because she broadcast your team's game,

605
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,530
she was fined by the live-streaming platform she signed.

According to her personality,

607
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,530
she won't tell anyone about this.

608
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,940
So as a boss,

609
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,860
you'd better care about employees' personal life.

610

00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,070
Why can't I find him?

687
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,970
Leave it to me.

688
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,730
Let Xing Ziyi and the last teammate

689
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,330
live for a while.

690
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,250
Why?

691
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,300
Just finish it quickly.

692
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,460
We can defeat Xing Ziyi repeatedly.

693
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,580
After his teammate helping him,

694
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,200
let's defeat him again.

695
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,140
Let him experience the repeated transition between life and death.

696
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,450
Xiao Yichuan,

697
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,110
you're really disgusting.

698
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,470
But

699
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,850
I like it.

700
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,400
Captain Xing.

701
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,900
Is it fun to plank?

702
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,070
You said you would get the first place.

703
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,030
A man should act humbly.

704
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,960
Otherwise, you'll have plenty of chances to get beaten.

705
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,250
He was held.

706
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,350
Captain Xing.

707
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,610
Why are you down again?

708
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,540
Is there thunder?

709
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,100
Blow me up!

710
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:25,740
Hurry up.

711
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,670
No.

712
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,240
Don't help me. Let me lose bleed.

713
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,690
It's live. Don't talk nonsense.

714
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:31,940
Why don't you do it?

715
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,430
Xiao Yichuan.

716
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,290
What kind of man shoots behind one's back?

717
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,950
Do it again if you dare.

718
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,030
Let's compete.

719
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,900
I'll say it again. This is a live streaming.

720
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,850
The audience is watching you.

721
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,210
Are you still going to play?

722
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,940
Xiao Yichuan was targeting me from the beginning.

723
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,740
This is not the way to play the game.

724
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,060
If I had known Xiao Yichuan

725
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,540
would join this game against me,

726
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,340
I wouldn't have played like this.

727
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,390
If you are so impatient,

728
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,080
the netizens will think you're afraid of him.

729
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,620
I'm afraid of him?

730
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,740
Isn't it embarrassing enough?

731
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,700
The live stream is over tonight.

732
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,110
Wenwen, come out with me.

733
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,080
Xiao Yichuan and Tian

734
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,370
are here to pick a fight.

735
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,270
Don't worry.

736
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,740
I'll contact the platform right away

737
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,600
and handle it quickly.

738
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,640
-And Xing... -I want Xiao Yichuan's information all these years.

739
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,120
What?

740
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,050
Don't miss the information

741
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,930
before his officially joining the pro team.

742
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,320
Find someone to get it done as soon as possible.

743
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,670
These two

744
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,250
seem to be on bad terms,

745
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,860
but now they work well together.

746
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,990
Just cut to the chase.

747
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,660
You and Chu Tian were so handsome yesterday.

748
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,260
Just praise me.

749
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,380
No need to add him.

750
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,660
I think

751
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,830
you really have

752
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,000
a sense of group honor.

753
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,260
Have some porridge.

754
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,000
He always teases you,

755
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,230
maybe...

756
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,050
it's because you're very special to him,

757
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,400
he doesn't know how to treat you.

758
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,560
Xiong Jiujiu.

759
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:58,420
How are you?

760
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,260
Are you feeling better?

761
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,260
Much better.

762
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,980
The doctor said I can be discharged today.

763
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,710
Ah, this is the manager of Red Ant Live

764
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,450
our SIK Team cooperate with.

765
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,380
He really wants to sign with you.

766
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,020
This is his name card.

767
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,730
Thank you.

768
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,260
You're welcome.

769
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,800
Chuan's matter is my business.

770
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,500
Wang Boyu, you can leave now.

771
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,800
Have you seen the live ranking today?

772
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,540
Your team has improved a lot.

773
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,520
I saw it.

774
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,310
It’s because

775
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,290
Xiao Yichuan and Chu Tian went to

776
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,070
the live stream room of ON Team.

777
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,080
I don’t agree with

778
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,210
making trouble in other’s live stream room.

779
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,010
But

780
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,930
I'm very happy.

781
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,340
His name is Chu Tian.

782
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,380
Nice name. Simple and generous.

783
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,950
I heard you and Chu Tian grew up together.

784
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,140
He, his sister and me,

785
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,770
the three of us grew up together.

786
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,430
What does he like?

787
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,030
He?

788
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,110
He likes...

789
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,340
Wang Boyu.

790
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,950
You can't poach him.

791
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,480
Chuan

792
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,390
always makes people embarrassed.

793
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,760
Let's change the subject.

794
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,460
Change the subject.

795
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,840
Don’t look at me like that.

796
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,110
I won't poach your team members.

797
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,650
Xiao Yichuan bought this for you?

798
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,610
He got up so early

799
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,170
to buy breakfast for you.

800
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,500
Are you touched?

801
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,660
At the base, I

802
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,570
get up early to buy him breakfast every day.

803
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:19,900
That's different.

804
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,300
You should cherish

805
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,580
a simple boy like Chuan.

806
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,620
Simple?

807
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,840
Do you have any misunderstanding about simplicity?

808
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,740
He was cheated by his online lover.

809
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,230
It's been three years and he still hasn't recovered.

810
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:33,310
Isn't he simple?.

811
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,710
Sometimes I really don't understand him.

812
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,230
Online relationship is unreliable.

813
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,130
They knew each other

814
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,580
on Tree Sports Forum.

815
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,860
Such an old way of knowing each other.

816
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,860
He even asked someone to watch the game.

817
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,000
But she didn't come.

818
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,620
Wang Boyu is still here.

819
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,910
What? I'm trying to help you.

820
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,700
Shut up!

821
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,940
[Bonus scenes ahead]

822
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:40,880
Xiao Yichuan,

823
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,790
you're really disgusting.

824
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,160
Xiao Yichuan.

825
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,790
Disgusting?

826
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,990
But I like it.

827
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,150
I think I know something.

828
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,810
Do you guys

829
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,370
know what love is?

830
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:37,940
Forget it.

831
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,360
You don't understand.

832
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,050
Love is not something

833
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,930
you can buy.
