Xiong Jiujiu, get up.

6
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Good morning.

7
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,460
Your hair is so soft.

8
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,140
Your skin looks so smooth.

9
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,820
You fairies do look different from mortals

10
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,579
after a good night's sleep.

11
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,460
What?

12
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,560
Are you afraid I will kiss off your foundation?

13
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,860
Xiao Yichuan.

14
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,810
Why are you so unromantic?

15
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,329
Do you think I don't know?

16
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,360
You got your hair done this morning, didn't you?

17
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,470
And you're wearing such a showy outfit.

18
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,170
I just didn't expose it.

19
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,450
I'm telling you.

20
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,680
I can see it all.

21
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,460
Come out for breakfast.

[Episode 17]

24
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,550
It's finally done.

25
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,690
There's still money left.

26
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,350
We can find a new base someday.

27
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,089
We still have to train before the game.

28
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,510
Okay.

29
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,940
Thanks to Chuan this time.

30
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
He's my blessing,

31
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,740
my luck

32
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,660
and my idol.

33
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,900
I simply want to give my life in return.

34
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,760
I can inform Miss. Chu Tian of that.

35
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,970
No, no.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,600
It's not necessary.

37
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,660
Please.

38
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,540
I'm going back to the base in the next few days.

39
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,000
The competition is in two weeks.

40
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,420
I've missed a lot of time lately.

41
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,210
I need to make up for it.

42
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,010
My parents asked several days ago

43
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,620
about why you've taken so much time off lately.

44
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,500
I said you were training online.

45
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,610
Mom.

46
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,240
Why are you here so early in the morning?

47
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,700
The vegetable is fresher in the morning.

48
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,180
I brought you some on the way.

49
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,530
I'll soon leave.

50
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,370
Auntie.

51
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,270
Qin is still on vacation?

52
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,490
It's almost over.

53
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,140
We're preparing for the competition.

54
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,440
What time are you going to see the house today?

55
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,530
Do you have enough money?

56
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,120
If not, your dad and I can lend you some.

57
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,220
We have enough money for the down payment.

58
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,210
It's not easy for you to save money.

59
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,540
You should keep it.

60
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,420
We are

61
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,530
going to leave now.

62
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,860
Now that you've made the down payment,

63
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,890
do you still have enough money you two have saved

64
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,540
for decoration?

65
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,740
We've discussed it.

66
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,020
We're not in a hurry to decorate.

67
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,090
It's not too late to decorate

68
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,409
if I get the prize money from the competition.

69
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,480
Can you move in before the wedding then?

70
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,750
It's a tight schedule before the wedding.

71
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,240
How can you do without a new house?

72
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,300
What if you don't get the prize money?

73
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,659
Do you have to delay it again?

74
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,300
Qin Zheng.

75
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,980
You are not a child anymore.

76
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,690
How can you

77
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,200
live off a bonus by playing games

78
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,150
instead of finding a good job?

79
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,670
Sorry, auntie.

80
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,830
I...

81
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,640
I haven't been able to provide Meng

82
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,230
with a good life.

83
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,610
Mom.

84
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,930
I've told you many times.

85
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,150
It's not a game.

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
E-sports is a sport.

87
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,050
Why do you always disrespect his work?

88
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,440
Let's go.

89
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,970
We're going to the sales office.

90
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,870
Mom.

91
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,030
Why don't you go home now?

92
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
Number 672.

93
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,780
Mr. Qin, right?

94
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,730
Yes.

95
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,530
Is it my turn?

96
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,060
Yes.

97
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,030
These are the house types

98
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,860
that are still available.

99
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,640
Their floors and locations are here.

100
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,460
You can take a look.

101
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,090
Um.

102
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,220
Are there no more C units?

103
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:02,720
Yes.

104
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,020
It's already sold out.

105
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,140
There are not many small units in this opening.

106
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,220
The remaining ones are good too.

107
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,010
Take a look.

108
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,300
We'll go with the C units.

109
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,150
The rest are too big.

110
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,310
It's a waste for the two of us.

111
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,140
Then why don't you take a look at this?

112
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,680
It's not too big.

113
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,400
Capt. Qin?

114
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,659
Long time no see.

115
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,260
Hello, Mr. Huo.

116
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,930
This is our VIP client.

117
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,290
I'll personally receive them.

118
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:38,950
Go to work.

119
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:39,940
Yes, sir.

120
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
This must be your fiancée.

121
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,520
What?

122
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,170
Does she like this property?

123
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,100
Do you want me

124
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,680
to give you some advice?

125
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,950
He is…

126
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,560
A peer in the industry.

127
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,060
Capt. Qin.

128
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,410
It sounds like we're unfamiliar

129
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,300
with your introduction of me.

130
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,340
I offered to hire you with a high salary

131
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,640
to be our ON Team's coach.

132
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,130
Even if you don't want to come,

133
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,260
you don't have to be so aloof.

134
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,900
Wait.

135
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,150
Capt. Qin,

136
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,940
bring Xiao Yichuan to meet me.

137
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,590
I'll help you

138
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,430
settle the house thing.

139
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,220
That guy is from the ON Team?

140
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,550
Does he want to hire you?

141
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,410
Isn't that a good opportunity?

142
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,950
Why did you refuse?

143
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,130
I think that man is quite sincere.

144
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,880
-He even offered to help us solve our housing problem. 
-Don't think about it.

145
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,070
I know you have high self-esteem.

146
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,830
But I'm saying this for your sake.

147
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't want my parents to always say

148
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,460
that playing games is not a job.

149
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,800
Do you know how sad I am

150
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,440
every time they say that?

151
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,940
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,620
Now that the houses we can afford

153
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,410
are sold out,

154
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,790
not to mention decoration,

155
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,190
even buying a house has become a problem for us.

156
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,540
What should we do next?

157
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,580
For so many years,

158
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,620
I understand,

159
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,940
and I support you.

160
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,540
But can you

161
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,460
think for our little family,

162
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,980
and for me?

163
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,880
Didn't that man say

164
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,860
that he just wanted to see Xiao Yichuan?

165
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,760
You're in the zone.

166
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,790
Are you pumped with adrenalin?

167
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,380
You're in the top five in the China network server.

168
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,940
Because I've confessed my love to Xiong Jiujiu.

169
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,140
I feel so relaxed.

170
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,160
Now all I've got on my mind

171
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,990
is the competition.

172
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,570
What a coincidence.

173
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,410
I confessed too.

174
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:11,930
Oh.

175
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,350
Bless you.

176
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,020
That sounds official.

177
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,660
Otherwise, I can

178
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,790
send you firecrackers

179
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,580
for an enthusiastic celebration.

180
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,270
Xiong Jiujiu has waited for you for so long.

181
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,670
Don't let her down.

182
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,730
Don't worry.

183
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,110
You'll be around

184
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,580
watching over me.

185
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,880
It's good that you know.

186
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,820
If you don't treat her well,

187
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,380
I won't spare you.

188
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:40,890
By the way,

189
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,280
are you free in the next few days?

190
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,950
I've had a problem during the training games

191
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,130
and need you to review it.

192
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,870
Sure.

193
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,790
Come see me tomorrow.

194
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,090
I'll bring Capt. Qin with me.

195
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,120
Okay.

196
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,850
I'll be there later then.

197
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:52,610
Okay.

198
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:53,700
Bye-bye.

199
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,100
Capt. Qin.

200
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,600
Why can't we talk about it at my place?

201
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,070
Chu Tian will be here later to review the game.

202
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,860
Go in first.

203
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,740
Let's go.

204
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,220
It's really hard to see you.

205
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,330
You've paid so much effort to see me.

206
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,780
Are you giving up the training

207
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,730
and getting prepared for a complete failure in the competition?

208
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,870
JR Team had to scrape together

209
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,860
to pay the deposit on the last day.

210
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,810
I asked you here today

211
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,110
to give you a new chance.

212
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,970
You can ask for whatever you want.

213
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,420
Then you'll be disappointed.

214
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,320
I'm not short of money.

215
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,620
And I despise

216
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,530
people like you who measure everything by money.

217
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,500
ON Team

218
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,800
qualifies for the competition

219
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,150
fair and square.

220
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,770
You think I don't know

221
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,810
why you're joining the competition?

222
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,860
You poached the veteran players of the Fish Team with high salaries

223
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,100
and secretly buy people off

224
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,560
from the youth training camp.

225
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,370
Don't you think it's despicable?

226
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,310
Have you really thought about

227
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,580
these players' careers?

228
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,390
Before the competition, you were busy voting for Xing Ziyi

229
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,660
as the Novice King.

230
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,180
You grind them down when they do well

231
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,830
and cancel the contract at any time if they don't.

232
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,460
I just want to ask you,

233
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,580
are they professional players

234
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,010
or your tools to make money?

235
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,620
Professionals are also human beings,

236
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,760
not a commodity.

237
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,740
If you don't like this,

238
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,340
I won't force you.

239
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,360
But I would like to remind you,

240
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,980
be careful you'd end up with nothing

241
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,190
from what you've put your heart and soul to.

242
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,950
Before talking to me,

243
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,830
you should learn how to spell “E-sports” first.

244
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,880
I gotta go.

245
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,700
Even if you don't think for yourself,

246
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,810
you should think for your old captain.

247
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,180
If you join the ON Team,

248
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,020
Qin Zheng can still be a coach here.

249
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,090
He's not like you.

250
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,060
He can't afford to waste time

251
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,500
on a scratch team.

252
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,380
What do you say?

253
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,370
Capt. Qin.

254
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,490
Come with me.

255
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:00,580
Chuan.

256
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,500
Chuan.

257
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,010
Chuan.

258
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,820
Do you know what you're doing?

259
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,580
What did he offer you?

260
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,840
You heard what I just said, right?

261
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,930
You're going to go to

262
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,720
a team like ON Team?

263
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,300
Answer me!

264
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,480
Chuan.

265
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,570
People don't always

266
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,180
have the right and opportunity to make a choice.

267
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,230
So?

268
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,980
You told me

269
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,620
playing E-sports is not for money.

270
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,780
And now?

271
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,860
I brought you to see him today

272
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,150
with the only hope

273
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,380
that you can take the chance

274
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,580
when you can still make a choice.

275
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,090
Your hand injury…

276
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,650
I just want to make my own choice.

277
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,150
From the day we lost the first game

278
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,580
and you abandoned us,

279
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,780
I've been telling myself

280
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,000
that I want to make my own choices.

281
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,430
It's really because of me.

282
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,770
All the teams you've played for over the years

283
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,140
have said you've been negative

284
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,990
and dictatorial.

285
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,420
I always wondered

286
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,490
how could the most hardworking

287
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,880
and obedient kid on the team

288
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,250
abandon the team

289
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,140
and close himself off?

290
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,530
I always thought

291
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,060
at least you were the one

292
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,380
I could trust.

293
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,290
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,730
Where have you been?

295
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,860
I've been waiting for you for so long.

296
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,780
Come in first.

297
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,040
Where's Capt. Qin?

298
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,120
I'll give him a call.

299
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,610
No need to call him.

300
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,650
He's not coming.

301
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:56,940
What do you want to drink?

302
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,820
A drink or a beer?

303
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,430
Did you forget

304
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,540
why am I coming to see you today?

305
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:06,850
I didn't.

306
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,660
I thought we were going to review the last few days of training.

307
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,210
Come on.

308
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,590
Look at this.

309
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,620
I asked Beast

310
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,100
to go on a solo match practice yesterday with me.

311
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,540
There are a few problems you can take a look at.

312
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,500
You see?

313
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,260
When the safe area

314
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,230
is mostly water,

315
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,210
it'll become very passive for us

316
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,980
to move from the other side of the water.

317
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,370
So I wondered if there was

318
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,280
a possibility that…

319
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,540
Are you listening to me?

320
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:45,960
Yes.

321
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,960
It can be passive for us to move in the water.

322
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,260
Are you hungry?

323
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,430
I can get you something to eat.

324
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,020
No, I'm not.

325
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,460
I thought you don't eat

326
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,400
in a review.

327
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:58,870
What's wrong?

328
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:01,950
Nothing.

329
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,260
Forget about the review.

330
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,380
Let's go.

331
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,060
What?

332
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,580
Change your shoes.

333
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,010
It's a small business.

334
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,270
I'm going to lose money with you playing like this.

335
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,430
I'm not done yet.

336
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,560
20 rounds each.

337
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,610
I'm counting them.

338
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,680
I still have the last one in my gun.

339
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,860
Do you believe it?

340
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,790
You have no bullets in your gun.

341
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,860
Then stand there.

342
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,750
Open your eyes and see it.

343
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,250
Hey!

344
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,490
The bullets shouldn't be pointed at his eyes.

345
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,300
He can get hurt.

346
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,620
Are you feeling better?

347
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,400
It's all right.

348
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,030
So what's wrong today?

349
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,240
You don't trust me, do you?

350
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,580
It's not that I don't trust you,

351
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:52,970
it's just...

352
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,950
You don't trust anyone.

353
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,230
You kid.

354
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,750
Don't talk like an adult.

355
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,100
You're a little kid.

356
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,820
Okay.

357
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,220
You're not a kid.

358
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,180
I am.

359
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:06,970
You are.

360
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,590
You told me to stop holding everything in.

361
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,590
Isn't it the same case for you?

362
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,510
I had a fight with Capt. Qin.

363
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,100
I know you're childish.

364
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,160
But Capt. Qin is not like you.

365
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,440
Do you know him well?

366
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,060
Although I don't know

367
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
what you fought about,

368
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,770
he's still your captain,

369
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,220
just like you are my captain.

370
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,180
How many times have we quarreled?

371
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,570
I still trust you, don't I?

372
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,220
Why do you trust me?

373
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,170
Then why didn't you

374
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,160
dodge my gun?

375
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,100
Because what you believed

376
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,960
was not whether there was a bullet in my gun,

377
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,350
but even if there was,

378
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,420
you knew I wouldn't hurt you.

379
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,490
It's not hard to trust someone.

380
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,190
At least you've done that

381
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,050
with me.

382
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,310
So try someone else, too.

383
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,720
The water's boiling.

384
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,270
Hurry up.

385
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,930
It says online

386
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,900
that two times of adding cold water will do.

387
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,510
What do you mean by adding cold water?

388
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,310
What?

389
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,930
Can you do it?

390
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,840
I'll do it if you can't.

391
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,860
-We can! 
-We can!

392
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,650
The taste is not bad.

393
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,010
It doesn't look so good though.

394
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,800
Really?

395
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,560
I'll try it.

396
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,540
Let me help you.

397
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,010
I think I see an unbroken one.

398
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,270
Look.

399
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,050
You're like the dumpling filling,

400
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,470
and I'm like the dumpling wrapper.

401
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,190
If I didn't have you,

402
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,790
my life would be so

403
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,690
dull and tasteless.

404
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,490
Here comes the corny pick-up line again.

405
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,340
I think you feel as good as new.

406
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,740
If you want to hear it, I can say it every day.

407
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,220
Why am I here?

408
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,230
By the way,

409
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,160
how's the new base viewing going?

410
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,310
Have you signed the contract?

411
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,850
Don't worry, it's all done.

412
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,420
We'll clean it up in the morning.

413
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,500
Do you want me to come with you tomorrow?

414
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:14,920
No, I don't.

415
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,130
We two will do.

416
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,370
What does the new base look like?

417
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,730
It's kind of

418
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,460
simple.

419
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,930
I mean,

420
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,160
it's good that we're back together.

421
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,390
We won't care so much.

422
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,240
Besides,

423
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,410
you can still

424
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,020
convince them

425
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,850
with feng shui.

426
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,370
I've made it clear

427
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,460
through what's happened lately

428
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,760
that trusting yourself is the only right thing.

429
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,720
Trust Dong Shi, and do great things.

430
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,350
Trust Dong Shi, and accomplish great things.

431
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,120
The budget is really limited.

432
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,920
This is all we can get.

433
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,380
But you can trust me,

434
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,170
it'll definitely get better

435
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,360
-in the future. 
-It's quite good.

436
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,950
It's good to let Chu Tian suffer a bit,

437
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,340
so that he wouldn't be ungrateful

438
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,350
and unwilling to live at my house again.

439
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,540
You

440
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,080
really don't blame me

441
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,060
for not taking good care of your brother?

442
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,500
No one can blame you.

443
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,680
All right.

444
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,690
The problem is solved.

445
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,850
Don't look so sad.

446
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,250
I can't even get used to it.

447
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,030
Then, Miss Chu Tian,

448
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,240
if you're going to buy a house,

449
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,870
what type do you like?

450
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,650
I'm such a realistic person.

451
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,070
Of course, I like the super large house.

452
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,580
I'm not like that.

453
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,990
You

454
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,570
are my type.

455
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,410
Here we go again.

456
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,850
If you're going to buy a house,

457
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,560
what will you consider?

458
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,920
Whether the house will increase in value.

459
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,580
Won't you think about

460
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,460
me?

461
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,080
You're not going to stop, are you?

462
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,910
I don't want to talk to you, I'm leaving.

463
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,270
Do you know

464
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,500
what increases in value than a house?

465
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,480
Stop it.

466
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,700
I don't want to know.

467
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,260
It's my love for you.

468
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,650
Let me escort you there.

469
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,530
I don't want to hear it.

470
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,040
Contact this person about the thing I promised you.

471
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,940
About Xiao Yichuan,

472
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,170
you go and convince him.

473
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,730
The address of the new base.

474
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,790
Let's meet tomorrow.

475
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,090
I'll get it.

476
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,930
Come on.

477
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,240
Our new base

478
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,940
doesn't have a good environment.

479
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,220
But we're only staying here temporarily.

480
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,460
And this house is surrounded by mountains and water

481
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,250
And the light from the north to the south is long-lasting.

482
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,180
It can also solve all the bane.

483
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,630
The direction of the main door…

484
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,780
That's it, Mr. Dong.

485
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,460
You're getting guilty.

486
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,110
The place is very good.

487
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,470
Thank you for your hard work.

488
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,220
I also like it.

489
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,030
I'll go in and check the computer.

490
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,110
Thank you for your hard work.

491
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,680
Hey,

492
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,490
the light is really good.

493
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,150
If there is no other use for this wall,

494
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,420
I'll put the game map here.

495
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,580
Hmmm.

496
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,620
I've made some new labels these days.

497
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,630
Have you finished your paper?

498
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,790
It's been submitted.

499
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,410
“On E-sports products' accuracy of real-world reproduction

500
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,610
over the generations”.

501
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,180
Would you be interested in reading it?

502
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,060
I don't think anyone but you and I

503
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,250
can read it.

504
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,560
Are you looking down on me?

505
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:11,720
Give it to me.

506
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,610
I'll tell you what.

507
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,350
I've studied more deeply on

508
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,500
iterative development method

509
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,430
of prototype

510
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,220
and playtest

511
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,000
where paper prototyping is…

512
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,570
I think what Xiao Yichuan said makes sense.

513
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,550
Let me tell you one more thing.

514
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,220
There are only four rooms in this house.

515
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,860
So we may need two people to live in one room.

516
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,470
We'll live together.

517
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,730
Then I'll share one room with Hong Yang.

518
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,960
There's only one big bed in that room.

519
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,940
Let's leave it to Capt. Qin.

520
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,760
He didn't answer my call yesterday.

521
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,850
And he didn't message me back in the group chat.

522
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,820
Maybe he's busy.

523
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,500
Call him later.

524
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:09,840
Okay.

525
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,220
Let's go.

526
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,810
Pack it up.

527
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,570
Let me show you the house.

528
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,860
Capt. Qin will be here.

529
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,270
Hmmm.

530
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:28,910
Let's go.

531
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,420
Go get it.

532
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,700
I will answer you

533
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,090
the question you asked me now.

534
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,170
I used to be your captain.

535
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,210
Now I am your coach.

536
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,300
In the future…

537
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,100
I'm sorry.

538
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,090
I hope I won't lose

539
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,949
you as a good brother.

540
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,370
I'm almost done packing.

541
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,660
I'll take the bottom bunk.

542
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,410
You'll take the top bunk.

543
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,510
Hey!

544
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,690
Why do I have to climb up and down as a senior?

545
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,670
Hmmm.

546
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,540
Caring for the elderly starts with me.

547
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,630
It's called caring?

548
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,770
The competition is in ten days.

549
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,060
Are you ready?

550
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,100
What about you?

551
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,520
I can't wait.

552
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,470
Xing…

553
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,160
I just can't avoid my enemy.

554
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,410
Hey.

555
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,100
What are you doing?

556
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,010
Captain.

557
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,530
Chu Tian has made it to No. 1 on solo match on the China internet server.

558
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,290
I thought you were still the fifth several days ago?

559
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,280
Now you're the No. 1?

560
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,500
Luckily, you focus on the Asian internet server, Wang Boyu.

561
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,510
Otherwise

562
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,460
you might also be crushed by Chu Tian.

563
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,230
Hello?

564
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,420
The NO. 1 player on the China internet server, Tian.

565
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,310
Give me the address. I have a gift for you.

566
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:05,480
You guys.

567
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,530
JR Team has moved.

568
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,180
Get your gifts

569
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,810
ready.

570
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,500
Do you hear me?

571
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,490
What?

572
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,130
What is this custom?

573
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,650
We once moved too.

574
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,830
We've never received anyone's gift.

575
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,770
Do

576
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,330
what I tell you.

577
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,610
What's all this nonsense?

578
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,140
Okay, okay.

579
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,270
We'll prepare it.

580
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,610
Where is Xing?

581
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,750
Why isn't he on Livestream?

582
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,660
He lost to Chu Tian last night.

583
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,830
He's probably hiding under the covers crying

584
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,150
from the embarrassment.

585
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,030
You know it's embarrassing?

586
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,790
Why don't you look at your recent results?

587
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,610
The competition is only a few days away.

588
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,400
If you don't make it to the final,

589
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,440
get out of here.

590
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:52,960
When Xing comes back,

591
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,220
tell him to make up for his live hours.

592
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,590
It's not easy

593
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,780
to lose to the paranoid in JR Team, is it?

594
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,790
Sorry, boss.

595
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,660
I recruited you into ON Team

596
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,870
not to hear

597
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,920
your apologies.

598
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,540
Remember what it's like to lose.

599
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,440
On the field of play,

600
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,920
you can only win.

601
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,820
Otherwise,

602
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:37,890
this would be

603
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,030
your last time on the field.

604
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,760
According to the budget you provide,

605
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,890
this house is the most suitable for your requirements

606
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,320
and most cost-effective

607
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,310
with a guaranteed square footage.

608
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,000
It's quite nice.

609
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,020
This is the most suitable one among what we've seen.

610
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,910
This house is for your wedding?

611
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:40,940
What?

612
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,440
This house

613
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,540
is enough for a couple.

614
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,710
And there is enough room for a second child.

615
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,950
Your wife said it's nice.

616
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,980
What are you waiting for?

617
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,080
Wait.

618
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,450
-We're not… 
-Then let's do the paperwork first.

619
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,920
Come on, let's talk over here.
