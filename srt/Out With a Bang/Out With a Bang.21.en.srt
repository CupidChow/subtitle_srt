How about this?

Let me be the commander.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,490
Currently, Chu Tian pays too much

00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,560
attention on confronting.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,490
If we don't lower the risk of depleting players,

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,910
we might lose

The elimination game is fierce.

If JR Team loses,

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,350
we will be under great stress

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,890
and even get scolded.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,120
As a newcomer,

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,590
Chu Tian shouldn't bear this.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,810
But I'm different.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,700
If it happens,

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,940
I'll take the responsibility.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,660
After all,

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,810
I have experienced things like this.

Capt. Qin, you shouldn't...

What are you talking about?

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,550
Have you been scolded more times than me?

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,780
We share weal and woe together.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,360
That's right. We're like brothers or fathers and sons in war.

25
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,900
No, well...

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,870
I mean we're a family.

I'll be careful.

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll go to the hospital as soon as the game is over tomorrow.

Okay.

34

Where did you go?

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,100
I just checked with the organizing committee on

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,460
the rules of tomorrow's competition.

The hospital bed has been arranged.

Am I not wearing shoes?

46

I shouldn't have agreed to have dinner with you.

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,440
Many people feel sorry for it,

178
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,210
but Qin Zheng, the substitute,

179
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,320
is also an experienced

180
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,090
player.

181
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,330
Qin Zheng once led ULT

182
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,820
and won twice.

183
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,010
In terms of experience,

184
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,550
he is Xiao Yichuan's master.

185
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,140
He came back this time on behalf of JR.

186
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,350
We're looking forward to his performance.

187
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,860
I also believe that JR

188
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,260
will get good results.

189
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,170
So I don't know if

190
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,650
this refreshes the audience's memory

191
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,730
of E-sports.

192
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,150
Do you think

193
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,380
a trivial elimination game is more important?

194
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,000
Or a brother

195
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,810
who has trusted you for so many years is more important?

196
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,900
The game is about to begin.

197
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,290
Contestants, please get ready.

198
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,290
Jump at the place I've marked.

199
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,670
JR jumps quickly

200
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,350
and chooses an area with less supplies.

201
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,400
Looks like they are planning to do it steadily.

202
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,880
In the beginning, they won't get points

203
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,230
nor lose points.

204
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Capt. Qin is too conservative in choosing the location to jump.

205
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,540
Chu Tian will be in a passive position if he can't get a gun.

206
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,610
Does Capt. Qin think

207
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,030
our team is not mature enough

208
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,220
to fight against these international strong teams?

209
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,100
So...

210
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,040
Maybe.

211
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,410
Jim from the Korean GO Team got the first kill.

212
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,370
Three points.

213
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,330
Xing from ON Team

214
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,190
also got three points right after.

215
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,190
Xing is really a brave newbie.

216
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,480
In front of the world's top teams,

217
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,150
he is valiant.

218
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,100
As we can see,

219
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,950
JR didn't get many supplies.

220
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,860
Fortunately, there are no people around.

221
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,700
There's no risk of fighting.

222
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,160
Chu Tian,

223
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,130
I got the 95 Rifle.

224
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:40,820
Okay.

225
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,880
Tian finally got a domestic gun.

226
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,260
As we can see,

227
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,020
they meet ON now.

228
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,010
Capt. Qin.

229
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,860
There's a team on the opposite.

230
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,610
Go to where I've marked.

231
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,430
Dong Shi, you go first.

232
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,590
Hong Yang and Chu Tian, go and drive.

233
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,290
Retreat?

234
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,890
If we fight with them,

235
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,100
there may be a team behind us coming to stop the fight.

236
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,150
So I asked Dong Shi to go to the marked place to get some information first.

237
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,620
Don't shoot.

238
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,570
I'll cover you.

239
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:17,880
Roger!

240
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,290
Direction 20.

241
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,110
A sniper.

242
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,480
The opponent is ON. I'll help Dong Shi.

243
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,840
Hong Yang, cover me.

244
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,290
Okay.

245
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,260
You can't help him.

246
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,070
Our position is not good.

247
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,430
They're on higher ground now.

248
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,500
It's not safe here.

249
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,050
You two, go and drive.

250
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,090
And leave from behind.

251
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,000
Is JR going to

252
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,260
give up CEO?

253
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,470
But if Ranger and Tian

254
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
cover him together,

255
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,220
there's still hope to help him.

256
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,910
As we can see, CEO keeps bleeding.

257
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,180
JR may still want to be conservative.

258
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,220
They may not help him.

259
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,330
At this position,

260
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,800
Xing will definitely have a gun standoff with them.

261
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,100
In this way, both teams will lose members.

262
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,190
Yes, Yu Dan has just been helped.

263
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,090
His position is not good.

264
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,870
Fortunately, the commander of JR is cautious,

265
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,660
so they didn't fight.

266
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,130
Otherwise, we'll suffer losses.

267
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,540
Capt. Qin could have sniped them.

268
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,650
Hong Yang could have driven to coordinate.

269
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,480
Chu Tian could have shot to suppress the left flank.

270
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,090
They could have helped CEO by maneuvering.

271
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,650
It's okay.

272
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,670
It's just the first round.

273
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,580
GO and Lime

274
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,540
have also lost their members.

275
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,250
But it will be a loss if Dong Shi is eliminated from this round.

276
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,960
The transferring point was too hasty.

277
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,920
Actually, they could have waited

278
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,380
until ON and KL finished fighting.

279
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,730
Why did they attack from this position?

280
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,260
If they are discovered,

281
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
there will be no chance of winning.

282
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,230
Just attack.

283
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,690
Chuan, go from the left.

284
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,010
The rest go from the front after him.

285
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,500
I'll cover the rear.

286
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,060
There are many parachutes in Ice Team.

287
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,150
I'm afraid there's an ambush.

288
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,510
There's no time to wait.

289
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,280
The side terrain is complicated.

290
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,780
-Once spotted, we won't have a chance... -Just do it.

291
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,490
Don't waste time.

292
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,390
Go!

293
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,400
What's wrong?

294
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,860
Don't be greedy.

295
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,170
Leave this to me.

296
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,450
You and Hong Yang enter the zone first.

297
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,190
On the third floor's rooftop ahead of me.

298
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,260
Roger!

299
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,980
It's okay.

300
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,600
This is only the first round.

301
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,440
We got some points.

302
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:33,670
Okay.

303
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,290
A new round has begun.

304
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,680
I'm ready to go to the room.

305
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,620
Come here.

306
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,590
Coming.

307
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,540
But the shape of the zone is not favorable to JR.

308
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,340
Xing hit two people in a row.

309
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,780
ON is very aggressive.

310
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,230
Okay. Let’s see

311
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,200
the points of two Chinese teams.

312
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,330
[Ranking According to the Points]

313
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
ON ranks fifth.

314
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,820
JR ranks seventh.

315
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,750
Now ON ranks fourth.

316
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,230
JR ranks sixth.

317
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,100
Only the top four can be qualified for the final.

318
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,710
There's only one round left in the first half.

319
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,290
Given the points JR has gained, it's a bit dangerous.

320
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,020
15 points away from fourth.

321
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,140
I didn't expect ON to be performing so good.

322
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,580
I think their routes for transferring

323
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,740
were designed by their coach before the game.

324
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,300
They controlled the rhythm well under the points rule.

325
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,240
They're very active in getting the elimination points.

326
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,150
It's mainly because they are lucky.

327
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,280
They got ranking points

328
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,750
by surviving several times.

329
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,170
As for JR,

330
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,580
the absence of Chuan

331
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,440
may affect their tactics.

332
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,210
They were too conservative at the beginning.

333
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,170
The number of players joining the fight was not enough.

334
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,510
And they always acted separately.

335
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,750
If they still perform like this in the second half,

336
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,829
it may be difficult for JR

337
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,500
to reach the final.

338
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,040
JR and Blue meet each other.

339
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,910
Given JR's ability,

340
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,619
they should be able to score a few points.

341
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,770
Tian defeated the opponent.

342
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,720
Tian shot again quickly.

343
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,680
JR takes down the opponent first.

344
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,619
Okay.

345
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,619
ON, who is next to JR,

346
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,609
is coming right after hearing the gunshots.

347
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,930
Looks like ON is here to stop the fight.

348
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,380
Xing starts to shoot!

349
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,590
He didn't wait for the opponents to attack first.

350
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,820
Yu Dan, come with me to attack JR.

351
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,050
Block those losers of Blue.

352
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,870
Roger!

353
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,680
-OK. -OK.

354
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,490
The opponent is ON.

355
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,800
I can charge first,

356
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,450
defeat the two players of Blue,

357
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,190
and then attack ON.

358
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:40,690
Retreat.

359
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,700
Dong Shi, drive and leave first.

360
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,550
Hong Yang and Chu Tian, separate.

361
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,410
Give the motorcycle to Chu Tian.

362
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,180
It's a pity to retreat now.

363
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,050
The two opponents are in an unfavorable position.

364
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,020
And we're a full team.

365
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,220
If you defeat Blue now,

366
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,580
their unfavorable position will

367
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,660
become your unfavorable position.

368
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,940
If ON comes for us,

369
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,780
what should we do?

370
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,010
I can camp.

371
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,900
We should secure our ranking points.

372
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,540
Listen to me.

373
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:07,680
Retreat.

374
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,410
Capt. Qin, crawl forward.

375
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,370
The place ahead is a blind spot from the perspective of the second floor across.

376
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,100
Don't help me.

377
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,920
Continue.

378
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,190
Watch out for the second floor.

379
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,050
Dong Shi.

380
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,980
Drive the car

381
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,540
to cover us.

382
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,520
Blue and ON

383
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,510
are coming to attack us.

384
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,250
There's a SCAR behind the car.

385
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,840
There are two semi-auto rifles on the second floor.

386
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,040
There's a sniper behind the east wall.

387
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,090
I'll go and save Capt. Qin.

388
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,830
Cover me.

389
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,390
Roger!

390
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,610
Capt. Qin.

391
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,230
I'll give you my level 3 armor.

392
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,910
Capt. Qin.

393
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,300
Hong Yang.

394
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,440
Take Capt. Qin to the spot I've marked.

395
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,240
Dong Shi and I will finish them off.

396
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,820
Fighting against eight opponents, the four players of JR

397
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,280
all survived, and they even defeated

398
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,530
three players of Blue.

399
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,790
He didn't leave Capt. Qin behind.

400
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,420
Good job.

401
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,660
-Especially after Qin Zheng was defeated... -In terms of the ranking points,

402
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,770
-we rank fifth. -It was so aggressive.

403
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,710
It's only nine points behind ON, who ranks fourth.

404
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,940
If we surpass ON,

405
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,110
we can reach the final.

406
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,240
It's also very straightforward.

407
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,300
Yes, that's right.

408
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,040
I think it will be one of the highlights of this competition.

409
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,280
I used to be your leader,

410
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,280
and now I'm your coach.

411
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,670
From now on...

412
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,180
I'm sorry.

413
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,840
I hope I won't lose you anymore,

414
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,790
my brother.

415
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
There's another team

416
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,020
at the right rear of ON.

417
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,650
The zone will be refreshed soon.

418
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,280
We can't stay here anymore.

419
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,410
We must move now.

420
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:47,890
Capt. Qin.

421
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,540
What are you doing?

422
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,110
Pack up.

423
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,630
You go first.

424
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,220
I'll cover you.

425
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,130
Capt. Qin.

426
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,810
Cover Capt. Qin!

427
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,250
Retreat!

428
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,740
Ranger shot the vital part.

429
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,910
He is as brilliant as ever.

430
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,300
That shot was quick and clean.

431
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,630
-This is how the first-generation sharpshooter will play. -Beat them!

432
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,380
Besiege them!

433
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,940
They are trying to catch up with ON's points.

434
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,160
Ranger covers his teammates by himself

435
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,870
to gain precious time for them.

436
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,380
Yes.

437
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,020
Three years later, this first-generation idol returned to the competition

438
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,630
to protect our young people.

439
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,140
My youth is coming back to me!

440
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
We can see that the safe zone refreshed again.

441
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,740
JR caught up in such a short time.

442
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,580
The points are quite close.

443
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,630
We're now fourth,

444
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,560
and we're still behind third by a lot of points.

445
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,900
We'll be overtaken if we're not careful.

446
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,570
JR started to play actively.

447
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,370
Xing didn't stay calm.

448
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,340
The score of JR is still far behind.

449
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,660
It will be very difficult for them to reach the final.

450
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,900
There is a team at the left rear of the blindage,

451
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,090
and another team in the housing area on the right.

452
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
We can go around from here

453
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,450
and enter the safe zone from the right.

454
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,930
There are more blindages over there.

455
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,560
We can hide from the sniper.

456
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,600
Hide?

457
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,310
Then we may not get enough points.

458
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,100
Our equipment is not good enough

459
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,260
for us to fight against them directly.

460
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,090
Do you have enough bullets and grenades?

461
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,040
Barely enough for this round.

462
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,060
Hong Yang.

463
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,590
How many bullets do you have?

464
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,010
I have 150 5.56mm bullets.

465
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,970
and 60 7.62mm bullets.

466
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,610
You two go to the safe zone from behind.

467
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,770
Dong Shi, you sortie

468
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,900
and cover Hong Yang.

469
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:48,790
Hong Yang.

470
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,900
Give me

471
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,180
all your remaining 7.62mm bullets.

472
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,800
I'll go get the points.

473
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,700
Okay.

474
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,070
7.62mm?

475
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,840
Tian of JR didn't enter the safe zone.

476
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,410
He ran in the opposite direction instead.

477
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,500
What's Tian going to do?

478
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,030
Where is he going?

479
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,650
His teammates didn't even help him.

480
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,650
He's going to pick up airdrops.

481
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Airdrop is a target.

482
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,140
No one will pick up airdrops

483
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,940
in such a world-class competition.

484
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,180
Why did he pick up airdrops alone

485
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,740
at this time?

486
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,830
It's too risky.

487
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,020
-What is this young man thinking? -What is he gonna do?

488
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,780
He is eager to pick up airdrops at this moment.

489
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,790
Is he crazy?

490
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,200
Did he just give it a go?

491
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,320
He could have gone to the houses if he needed supplies.

492
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,190
Why did he act so recklessly?

493
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,100
If he picks up airdrops and gets equipment,

494
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,580
and then disguises himself as a target,

495
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,920
people around him will be attracted and be exposed.

496
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,010
Then he will fight them back.

497
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,860
No, no, no.

498
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,260
I think it is a

499
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,530
mission impossible.

500
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,740
Now we are watching from the perspective of

501
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,960
Tian of JR.

502
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,670
So Tian picked up airdrops

503
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,920
to change the gun?

504
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,860
Okay.

505
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,530
We can see that Chu Tian

506
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,110
got a new gun, MK14.

507
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,740
Yes.

508
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,290
Tian,

509
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,500
the player who only uses domestic guns...

510
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,400
Today,

511
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,110
in the game where Xiao Yichuan is absent,

512
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,500
he raised the gun

513
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,900
that only

514
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,060
Xiao Yichuan would use.

515
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,950
That's right.

516
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,140
This weapon is Xiao Yichuan's signature.

517
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,370
So the reason why Tian

518
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,560
tried so hard to get the MK14

519
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,910
is obvious.

520
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,950
In this game,

521
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,260
he will fight

522
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,770
with Xiao Yichuan's passion.

523
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,410
Tian,

524
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,910
with the MK14 in his hand,

525
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,370
replicated Xiao Yichuan's divine operation.

526
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,140
JR won the first place in this round.

527
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,690
In the first half,

528
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,180
JR's points surpass ON's.

529
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,700
Now JR is among the top four,

530
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,550
only seven points behind

531
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,210
GO, who ranks third.

532
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,320
My brother is so great!

533
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,510
My brother defeated ten of them alone!

534
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,540
Good job, Chu Tian!

535
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,570
From Ranger to Chuan and to today's Tian,

536
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,080
JR Team tells us that

537
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,810
even if the wood is burnt out,

538
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,550
the flame will keep burning endlessly.

539
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,030
This is E-sports!

540
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,220
This is sportsmanship!

541
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,090
Tian of JR

542
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,260
really got our adrenaline flowing

543
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,470
in the last round of the first half.

544
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,580
With the MK14,

545
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,240
he seemed to have brought

546
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,390
the passion of Xiao Yichuan,

547
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,780
who is absent from the game,

548
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,170
and turned the tide again and again

549
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,790
and finally won in adversity.

550
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,390
We rank first in this round alone.

551
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,410
We have surpassed ON Team,

552
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,040
and we can reach the final!

553
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,220
I know

554
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,100
what I'm doing.

555
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,700
As for what you want to do,

556
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,100
it doesn't matter.

557
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,630
JR will try their best next around.

558
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,850
Good luck.

559
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,720
The luggage you left at the base

560
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,340
has been packed up.

561
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,620
How to perform next

562
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,110
is up to you.

563
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,100
The second half is about to begin.

564
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,100
Please get ready.

565
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,860
Go, JR!

566
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,570
The second half starts.

567
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,730
Hong Yang, search for supplies.

568
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,570
Dong Shi and Chu Tian, clear the factory with me.

569
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,140
Jim of GO

570
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,220
was eliminated by Xing at the very beginning.

571
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,610
Xing was the first one to defeat others.

572
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,340
GO Team lost their main player.

573
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,060
I wonder if Jim underestimated his opponents.

574
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,180
As we can see on the screen,

575
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,340
he looks very surprised and frustrated.

576
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,870
After all, in the first zone, one defeat equals three points.

577
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,990
Everyone will try their best to get the points.

578
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,470
So they can't take it lightly.

579
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,570
Tian and Ranger of JR cooperated perfectly

580
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,560
and defeat one player of Dark.

581
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,740
Seems that JR and ON are trying their best.

582
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,020
Their points are very close.

583
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,330
I can't guess

584
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,610
which team

585
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,900
will be qualified for the final.

586
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,260
Xing scored again!

587
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,270
Even veterans have to

588
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,460
surrender themselves in front of

589
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,330
E-sports new stars.

590
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,060
Xing's performance in the second half

591
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,590
is so amazing.

592
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,699
His shooting is fast and accurate.

593
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,980
The opponents had no time to react.

594
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,850
As we can see,

595
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,630
JR is catching up.

596
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,110
They are in a good form today.

597
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,560
In this battle,

598
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,909
JR defeated three opponents.

599
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,580
Okay.

600
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,980
Xing scored one point after another.

601
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,940
This is the last round.

602
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,260
JR's points

603
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,150
will soon be catched up with ON's.

604
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,500
Today, these two Chinese teams

605
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,830
made this competition very enjoyable.

606
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
ON's Xing Ziyi

607
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,659
is too crazy.

608
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,659
He caught up

609
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,130
all by himself.

610
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,199
We've done so well.

611
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,070
But why are the scores still so close?

612
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,540
In terms of points, GO, MW and Lime

613
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,730
have been among the top three.

614
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,460
They will definitely reach the final.

615
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,900
We rank fourth now.

616
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,770
But we only have

617
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,670
two more points than ON.

618
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,260
Now it's the fourth zone.

619
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,270
Only Chu Tian and Xing Ziyi are left in the two teams.

620
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,890
Who defeats more players

621
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,110
and who stays alive longer

622
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,250
will decide the final result.

623
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,300
Okay. We can see that Tian of JR

624
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,790
and Xing of ON meet each other again.

625
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,710
Tian was defeated.

626
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,850
Actually, he has already located Xing.

627
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,490
It was so close!

628
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,850
Xing's last shot was so accurate.

629
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,340
It hit Chu Tian's head.

630
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,660
In the second half,

631
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,800
Xing has been in good form.

632
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,300
It seems that

633
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,590
JR has to end its championship journey here.

634
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,410
Given the current points that ON has got,

635
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,720
ON will definitely enter the final.

636
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,110
Okay, the game is over.

637
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,350
Let's take a look at the scoreboard.

638
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,390
Congratulations to GO, MW,

639
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,660
Lime, and ON.

640
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,930
With the outstanding performance in the second half,

641
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,110
ON got the last ticket

642
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,820
to the final.

643
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,630
Congratulations to ON

644
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,010
for being the first Chinese team

645
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,670
to reach the final.

646
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,410
I'm looking forward to their performance.

647
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,130
Hong yang, it's okay. Don't be sad.

648
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,660
About the final of

649
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,740
the National League Playoffs three years ago,

650
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,180
the one in which I led ULT,

651
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,240
Capt. Qin.

652
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,800
I have something

653
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,940
to say here.

654
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,960
I lost that game

655
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,690
on purpose.

656
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,170
I cheated.

657
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,790
Otherwise, ULT Team

658
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,140
would have won the championship.

659
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,100
I made an unforgivable mistake.

660
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,160
My request is simple.

661
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,420
Don't block Ice's way to win.

662
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,290
As for how to perform,

663
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,900
discuss with Coach Huang.

664
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,560
When the third safe zone is refreshed,

665
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,780
ambush at the southern part of the circle.

666
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,690
I'll bring ULT over

667
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,260
and give you points.

668
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,370
Besides that,

669
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,310
you need to get less points in the beginning.

670
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,570
You have to lose.

671
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,770
Got it.

672
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,140
It's easy to lose.

673
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,950
We've paid the medical expenses and hospitalization fees.

674
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,580
On the day of the final, after Ice win the championship,

675
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,200
the rest of the money for the surgery

676
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,040
will be given to you.

677
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,650
Mom.

678
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,840
I'll pay for the surgery today.

679
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,220
Don't worry.

680
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,380
It's time to play.

681
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,730
Let's go.

682
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,980
Just attack.

683
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,940
Chuan, go from the left.

684
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,760
The rest go from the front after me.

685
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,930
The defending champion, ULT Team

686
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,350
was annihilated unexpectedly.

687
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,420
It's the biggest unexpected defeat today!

688
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,470
I used my teammate,

689
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:51,870
Xiao Yichuan.

690
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,370
I used the trust of everyone in ULT.

691
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,200
E-sports

692
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,940
is sacred and pure.

693
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,330
It shouldn't be sullied

694
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,630
by anyone or anything.

695
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,010
I've been running away for three years.

696
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,020
Now I decide

697
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,130
to face my mistakes.

698
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,920
Here,

699
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,240
to my ULT Team,

700
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,720
to my old teammates,

701
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,570
to Xiao Yichuan,

702
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,020
I apologize.

703
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,380
Today,

704
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,350
I almost made the same mistake.

705
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,570
Fortunately, I didn't.

706
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,140
From now on,

707
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,390
I will leave JR Team

708
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,070
and quit the E-sports industry.
