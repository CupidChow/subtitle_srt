704
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,510
The person you asked me to investigate

705
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,050
went to our premises today.

706
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:20,970
Okay.

707
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,690
Got it.

708
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,500
[Registration Form]

709
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,480
[Qin Zheng]

710
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,190
Where is my shrimp paste?

711
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,490
It's been

712
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,880
in my stomach.

713
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,190
Can you leave some for Han?

714
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,540
He's the protagonist today.

715
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,990
I'm going to rip him off today.

716
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,520
You used to rip him off.

717
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,230
Yes.

718
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,060
Well,

719
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,570
enjoy yourselves.

720
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,240
What's wrong with you?

721
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,600
I'm trying to tell Chu Tian,

722
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,200
of all the captains

723
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,840
I

724
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,500
treat him better

725
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,210
and love him more.

726
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:35,720
Right?

727
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,830
Help yourself while eating hot pot.

728
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,830
Just

729
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,580
grab.

730
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,330
Yeah. Come on.

731
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,630
Everyone,

732
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,360
there's no denying that

733
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,890
I am the fastest.

734
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,000
Okay.

735
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,280
I'm convinced.

736
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,250
After all,

737
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,790
in order to practice speed,

738
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,840
you stayed up all night

739
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,120
and was taken away by the ambulance

740
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,260
Xiao Yichuan.

741
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:00,960
It's unkind

742
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,920
to show other people's faults.

743
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,300
Han,

744
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,300
don't laugh.

745
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,440
You have cataracts at a young age.

746
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,900
You're not better than Wang Boyu.

747
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,550
Why are you

748
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,050
so obsessed with

749
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,030
practicing waist shooting?

750
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,500
Isn't shoulder shooting good?

751
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:16,900
Why can't I

752
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,970
have some personal hobbies?

753
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,690
The more you doubt me,

754
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,200
the more I have to prove it to you.

755
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,060
Besides,

756
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,070
if I come second in waist shooting,

757
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,240
who dares to be No.1?

758
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:25,790
Yeah.

759
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,860
I'll give myself a nickname too.

760
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,640
It's called sharpshooter.

761
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,570
Don't ignore Chuan.

762
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,030
Come on.

763
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,060
If you don't agree, let's compete.

764
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,280
I'm on Wang Boyu's side this time.

765
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,380
Me too.

766
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:36,810
Hey.

767
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,480
And me.

768
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,830
Our SIK Team

769
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,290
can't be in the same side?

770
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,470
I'm on Chuan's side.

771
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,610
Fight if you don't agree.

772
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,640
The laptop is at the back.

773
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,740
Me too.

774
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,230
Come on.

775
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,000
Compete! Compete!

776
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,280
Come on.

777
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,670
Come on.

778
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,350
Come on.

779
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,470
Yes.

780
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,340
Yes.

781
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,520
Each team sends one player.

782
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,330
We send Chu Tian.

783
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,920
Such a small gap.

784
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,950
It's a draw

785
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,970
after rounding off.

786
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,070
Losing is losing.

787
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,490
But it doesn't mean you'll keep losing.

788
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,640
Aren't you happy to bring you out?

789
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,580
Stop putting on

790
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,490
a long face.

791
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,790
You took me out today

792
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,250
not just for fun, right?

793
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,490
You played well against Wang Boyu just now,

794
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,550
using a gun

795
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,300
you have never used before.

796
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,900
So,

797
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,720
is it about weapons

798
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,370
or people?

799
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,020
In order to practice waist shooting,

800
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,770
Han Peng didn't install double scope,

801
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,510
He practiced aiming with naked eyes

802
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,680
and hurt his eyes.

803
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,810
Wang Boyu insisted on practicing speed.

804
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,630
I don't know how many mice have been broken.

805
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,240
Being a genius,

806
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,820
a stubborn genius

807
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,260
is not that easy.

808
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,300
Besides,

809
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,470
you chose

810
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:58,990
a harder path of

811
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,900
being a professional E-sports player.

812
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:08,820
A professional

813
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,700
E-sports player.

814
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,360
Do you know

815
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,170
why you joined the team?

816
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,000
Do you know

817
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,910
what you are doing?

818
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,060
So we don't know

819
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,900
who the child is.

820
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,530
What do you want to say?

821
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,190
I want to say

822
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,860
you could have

823
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,800
gotten along

824
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,520
with your friends.

825
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,680
But why

826
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,550
you can't

827
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,260
do well in

828
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,590
team competition?

829
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,330
Everyone says you're a lone wolf

830
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,770
and lack team awareness.

831
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,370
But you did well

832
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,730
on the day of the competition.

833
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,130
It's not that hard

834
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,800
to blend into a group.

835
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,120
What are you doing

836
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:16,949
so late?

837
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,820
The car was borrowed from the sports department.

838
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,880
I'll clean up

839
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,219
and return it to them tomorrow.

840
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,440
Did you

841
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,880
take Chu Tian out?

842
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,440
Yes.

843
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,420
Take him to meet

844
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,630
other teams.

845
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,389
It's good to take him out

846
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,750
and relax.

847
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,670
Since he came back from the game

848
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,250
he has been down.

849
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,760
It's normal.

850
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,100
After the first competition,

851
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,800
there will be all kinds of voices.

852
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,880
Sometimes when you hear something bad,

853
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,400
you'll doubt yourself.

854
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,880
But don't worry.

855
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,130
He will recover soon.

856
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,440
You look

857
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,760
more and more

858
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,750
like a caption.

859
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,040
Why did you do it?

860
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,760
It's not appropriate

861
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,060
to return it like this.

862
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,060
Our team was questioned,

863
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,740
you must have suffered a lot in the company.

864
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,520
I'll make you proud.

865
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,640
I won't let you suffer anymore.

866
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,150
Thank you

867
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,080
for this competition.

868
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,480
Every time I win,

869
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,380
I heard congratulations,

870
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,000
amazing,

871
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,290
good job.

872
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,770
I've never heard of this before.

873
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,440
I know.

874
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,820
you're under

875
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,690
a lot of pressure.

876
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,220
Compared to the pressure of getting married,

877
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,980
this pressure

878
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,970
is nothing.

879
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,340
Manager.

880
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,060
Yes.

881
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,270
Will you help me?

882
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,820
Yes.

883
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,900
I can help you.

884
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,310
Really?

885
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:33,460
This is

886
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,240
my college classmate.

887
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,420
Isn't she pretty?

888
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,790
She's a goddess.

889
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,640
This...

890
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,340
This is my high school roommate.

891
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,560
She's your fan.

892
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,320
And this.

893
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,490
Isn't she pretty?

894
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,940
Since you told me last time

895
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,400
you have pressure of getting marry.

896
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,210
I found

897
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,480
many people.

898
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,190
Do you like them?

899
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,820
Xiong Jiujiu.

900
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,260
Yes.

901
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,560
Are you serious?

902
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,080
I'm serious.

903
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,400
Go to sleep.

904
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,960
Being a genius,

905
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,370
a stubborn genius

906
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,890
is not that easy.

907
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,000
Besides,

908
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,110
you chose

909
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,820
a harder path of

910
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,050
being a professional E-sports player.

911
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,750
The last sniper was good.

912
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,020
Capt. Qin.

913
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,580
If there are smoke bombs,

914
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,580
you can transfer to

915
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,930
the west side.

916
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,870
Play the video.

917
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,070
I'll review it for you.

918
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,430
Okay.

919
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,420
Hello.

920
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,650
[Bonus Scene]

921
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,360
Hello, everyone.

922
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,990
Wang Boyu.

923
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,940
Why do you always

924
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,090
come at dinner time?

925
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,030
You're even late for

926
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,670
Captain Han’s retirement party.

927
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,460
Aren't you embarrassed?

928
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
I went to pick up an important guest.

929
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,140
Come here.

930
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,870
Have a good chat with the bro

931
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
who shot you just now.

932
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,910
How long has he played?

933
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,780
How long have you played?

934
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,320
Don't you feel embarrassed?

935
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,240
Chuan!

936
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:50,430
Chu Tian.

937
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,230
I'm Ye Shou from SIK.

938
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,570
I know.

939
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,900
What's wrong, brother?

940
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,030
Aren't you happy to be here?

941
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm Han Peng.

942
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,500
I know.

943
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,790
I've always wanted to know

944
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:04,830
why you only use domestic guns.

945
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,750
Han.

946
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,710
Watch your mouth.

947
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,020
Nice shot.

948
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:13,940
Congratulations.

949
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,050
Captain, come here.

950
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,870
He retired at such a young age.

951
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,880
He's the same age as me.

952
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,310
Come, Tian.

953
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:35,940
Come and see.

954
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,650
What are you doing?

955
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,800
Stand here.

956
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,940
Han Peng's career

957
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,300
as an E-sport player.

958
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:42,290
Han Peng

959
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,790
officially joined

960
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,120
Over Power Club in 2017,

961
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,700
and has been there for 1550 days.

962
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,710
During these days in OP Team,

963
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:50,750
he gave himself,

964
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:51,570
gave us,

965
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,300
gave the team

966
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,120
and gave domestic and international

967
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,690
E-sports circle

968
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,620
countless

969
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,880
unforgettable memories.

970
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,620
Hey.

971
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,960
Stop being so sentimental.

972
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,410
I...

973
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,200
During training,

974
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,920
he privately changed the circuit

975
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,780
to steal electricity for training,

976
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,400
which caused the blackout of the whole building.

977
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,220
How do you remember that?

978
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,820
Of course I remember.

979
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,480
In order to help you

980
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,260
write review,

981
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,120
I stayed up all night.

982
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,320
As the captain,

983
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,800
in the first new members recruiting,

984
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,050
you were too enthusiastic

985
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,000
to be reported as a cheat.

986
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,320
That night,

987
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,720
the police raided.

988
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,040
I remember that.

989
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,590
I squatted in the stairs

990
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,920
without wearing clothes.

991
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:26,910
There are photos

992
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:27,870
on the Internet.

993
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,250
Humiliation of life.

994
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,340
That guy...

995
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,530
even thanked me.

996
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,780
Why didn't you write this in?

997
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,620
During your first international game,

998
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,170
you became famous accidentally

999
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,240
not for your skills or your face,

1000
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,120
but for your poor English.

1001
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:43,250
I'm Han Peng. I'll win.

1002
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,680
In 2018, Asian League,

1003
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,760
you were worried we would lose our passports,

1004
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,100
so you kept it for everyone.

1005
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:49,910
In the end,

1006
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,660
you lost them all.

1007
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,710
And we had been in Korea

1008
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,110
for a week.

1009
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,980
Captain did it on purpose.

1010
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,240
It's rare to go abroad.

1011
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,240
He wants us to enjoy

1012
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,210
a long vacation.

1013
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,350
He's very well meaning.

1014
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,820
In 2019,

1015
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,220
after the national league,

1016
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,190
you were blocked by fans

1017
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,830
and got into the wrong car

1018
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,690
and accidentally entered the Sunset Red Tourism Group.

1019
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,330
That's all.

1020
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,170
To our eternal captain.

1021
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,330
Happy retirement!

1022
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,830
Happy retirement.

1023
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,040
All right.

1024
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,320
Let's eat.

1025
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,830
Let's eat.

1026
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,050
Alright, let's go eat.

1027
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,720
Time to eat.

1028
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,700
Time to eat.

1029
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:31,790
Come here.
