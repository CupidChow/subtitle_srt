In the list,

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,530
Capt. Qin is both a coach and a substitute.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,340
So,

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,910
just let Capt. Qin

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,060
play for Chuan in the knockout match.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,870
I'll submit the list again

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,970
later.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,300
Chuan,

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,390
We didn't notice

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,830
your hand injury for so long.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,710
We were too careless.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,050
Don't worry.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,170
We'll do our best.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,990
Yes, Chuan.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,990
Your health is more important than anything.

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,360
We won't let you down.

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,900
OK.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,460
Don't be influenced by me.

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,890
Do what you do.

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,380
Maybe

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,880
without my unfortunate physique,

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,500
the team would be lucky.

24
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,100
Maybe

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,810
you'll be trapped by the blessed zone.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Don't force a smile

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,380
in front of us.

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,390
Don't worry.

29
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,550
We're all ready.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,450
So you can rest in peace.

31
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,289
How can I rest?

32
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,539
I have to work.

33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,780
Next,

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,120
I'll take over from Capt. Qin

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,560
as coach.

36
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,660
We're still competing together,

37
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,120
no one less.

38
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,690
Guys, they're back, they're back.

39

Speak of the devil.

40

Wow, this is amazing.

42
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,230
Pure gold?

43
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,310
He's the new guy?

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,870
Yes.

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,579
Xiao Yichuan.

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,620
What?

47
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,900
Has he been excluded?

48
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,980
Nonsense.

49
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,730
Our team doesn't have such a habit.

50
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,720
He was criticized by the coach because of the gun-forcing this afternoon.

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,180
He's probably holding his breath and training hard.

52
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,970
Grab the mouse.

53
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,870
Pay attention to the rhythm of the gun-forcing.

54
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,280
Actively feel the recoil force.

55
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,450
The dpi of your mouse

56
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,340
is a bit high.

57
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,120
The cursor will fly out when you aim.

58
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,640
I'll give you a new one.

59
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,180
Thank you, Capt. Qin.

60
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,570
Can you get up half an hour early tomorrow?

61
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,370
Don't you want to know

62
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,420
how to solve these problems?

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,760
Is half an hour enough?

64
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,420
I can get up an hour earlier.

65
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,390
This way.

66
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,630
Capt. Qin.

67
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,190
How long did it take you

68
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,530
to win the first champion cup?

69
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,180
Four years.

70
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,000

Hello.

75
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,120
The starting player, Qin Zheng

76
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,370
Yes.

77
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,840
Your personnel have changed a lot.

78
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,070
Sorry.

79
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,350
I'm here to change the personnel information so late.

80
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,140
Thank you.

81
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,980
I've submitted the content

in the system.

83
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,370
If you need anything,

84
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,520
just let me know.

85
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,530
You don't let Xiao Yichuan

86
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,680
but let Qin Zheng be the starting player.

87
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,700
Qin Zheng is not suitable to play

88
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,060
at this age.

89
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,810
Although Qin Zheng

90
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,230
is over the golden age of a professional player,

91
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,360
he has won two national champions.

92
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,620
This is rare in China.

93
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,960
His strength is still here.

94
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,800
Well,

95
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,610
I wish you good results.

96
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,120
Thank you.

97
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,640
OK.

98
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,040
I understand the condition.

99
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,250
We scheduled the surgery for Monday.

100
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,750
And I'll come over on Saturday.

101
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,880
Then we can prepare everything.

102
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,380
Does that sound okay?

103
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,690
OK, see you then.

104
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,740
OK.

Bye bye.

Dr. Chen,

107
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,290
we can have the surgery next Monday, right?

108
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,060
Yes.

109
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,550
Dr. William

110
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,700
will come to China this Saturday,

111
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,830
and arrange for surgery on Monday.

112
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,670
I have already communicated with him

113
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,010
about the specifics.

This is

116
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,780
a surgical plan formulated by Dr. William and me

117
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,940
after discussion.

118
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,390

123
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,840
This surgery

124
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,440
has a small wound.

125
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,220
The recovery period

126
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,510
is relatively short.

127
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,350
How's the recovery after the surgery?

128
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
I'm not sure.

129
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,220
We can't guarantee you would have some symptoms.

130
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,620
For example,

131
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,020
bleeding infection,

132
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,090
injury to the recurrent branch of the median nerve

133

Let's get through this first.

136
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,370
If the surgery goes well,

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,450
the next day,

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,950
we'll start rehabilitation.

139

The process of rehabilitation

140
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,350

Thank you, Dr. Chen.

143
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,950
We will cooperate with you.

145
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,570
Here are

146
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,430
some precautions before the surgery.

147
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,350
Take them back and take a good look.

you come to the hospital right away.

159
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,470
I'll think about it.

This time,

170
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,570
I will monitor you according to the doctor.

171

And I will keep an eye on you 24 hours a day.

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,910
But I think it'll be winter at most.

179
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,740
By then,

180
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,770
we will have another chance.

181
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,480
I really envy you.

182
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
You know so firmly

183
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,270
what you want.

184
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,210
You taught me well.

185
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,370
I didn't dare to face it before

186
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,680
until I heard what you said in the hospital that day.

187
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,670
In fact, accepting it calmly

188
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,140
and facing the reality

189
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,260
is also a victory.

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,010
I didn't give up.

191
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,730
Yeah.

192
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:11,820
Here.

193
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,660
Smile.

194
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,940
Let's go.

195
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,590
Let's go eat.

196
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,180
OK.

197
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,030
Behind the tree.

198
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:06,920
Nice!

199
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,800
Capt. Qin, your style of play is fast.

200
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,490
You can take the center first.

201
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,860
Your command consciousness is getting better and better now.

202
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,470
You couldn't say a word before.

203
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,430
Now I can say that

204
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,780
I have suffered too many burdens

205
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,280
that I should not have at this age.

206
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,090
Capt. Qin,

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,010
I found that you had some minor problems

208
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,320
when you threw the thunder.

209
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,220
I have some of your little problems

210
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,090
about the map too.

211
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,420
Don't do that.

212
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,390
I'm your teammate now.

213
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,740
If you have any problems,

214
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,820
just tell me.

215
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,740
Don't worry.

216
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,650
I'll tell you then.

217
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,670
Your geometric grenade problem is too big.

218
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,990
You've been looking for an angle for so long.

219
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,270
Are you a Sunset Red Demoman?

220
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,230
Thousands of thunder-throwing training.

221
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,050
Come on.

222
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,160
Let me take a rest first.

223
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,190
If you're tired, take a look at the map.

224
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,660
Read and recite the full map with emotions.

225
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,330
I'll check tonight.

226
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:50,990
Tonight.

227
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,100
I've practiced for half a day.

228
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,270
Let me rest for a while.

229
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,100
Have you sat for 12 hours today?

230
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,880
No.

231
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,820
-No.
-No.

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're already practising me?

233
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:10,960
Capt. Qin.

234
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,330
You'll pay back sooner or later.

235
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,680
You can't lose physical training.

236
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,490
We will supervise you.

237
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,710
[TLO Global Championship Knockout Match]

238
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,640
The JR Team submitted

239
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,130
the new list of starting players.

240
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,990
As we can see, Xiao Yichuan has been replaced,

241
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,160
and let Qin Zheng plays.

242
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,980
I don't know how many people

243
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,790
remember the name Qin Zheng in recent years.

244
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,820
Although he is the first generation of the master,

245
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,900
his state is probably not as good as it was in the past.

246
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,820
Xiao Yichuan doesn't play,

247
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,450
and most of the overseas players who were assigned to the same group as JR

248
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,890
in the knockout match expressed regret,

249
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,040
while some expressed relief.

250
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,140
After all, the name of Chuan

251
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,160
is a threat to many teams.

252
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,770
He can't even go up to the battlefield.

253
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,880
Why are you still analyzing his threat?

254
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,220
It's a waste of time.

255
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,290
I just went to the organizing committee

256
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,440
with Zhang to discuss

257
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,380
the team's room and board standards during the competition.

258
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,010
Let's continue.

259
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,260
The knockout match of ON

260
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,980
was divided into a group with GO and KL

261
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,690
of Korea this time.

262
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,420
These two teams are very competitive against Xing.

263
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,700
They are cautious.

264
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,780
They won't easily shoot.

265
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,700
In this way,

266
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,110
Xing's rhythm will be easily led away by them.

267
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,790
The MW and Lime

268
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,100
and Lime are also very strong teams.

269
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,350
The fighting qualities

270
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,000
of their entire team are also very high.

271
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,050
Once they run into each other,

272
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,060
ON has no chance of winning.

273
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,040
But Xing is always good at shooting.

274
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,880
We all know that.

275
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,480
Will it be better

276
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,350
if he is more cautious?

277
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,850
That's the problem.

278
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,630
Xing hasn't been doing well lately.

279
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,010
Since the play-in match,

280
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,250
his China network server have always been top five.

281
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,040
But recently, after JR's Tian

282
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,740
got the first place in the China network server,

283
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,520
he was obsessed with the gun.

284
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,470
Besides,

285
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,160
JR and SIK are growing in popularity.

286
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,420
Everyone has high expectations

287
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,020
for these two teams.

288
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,230
His mind

289
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,400
might be a little broken.

290
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,350
No way.

291
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,860
He has always been confident.

292
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,280
Why does he break his mind now?

293
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,270
I remind you repeatedly

294
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,140
to pay more attention to the team members.

295
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,200
I do.

296
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,390
I'm satisfied with

297
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,930
all their requests.

298
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,340
They just proposed to buy a car.

299
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,650
I contacted the car sales store immediately.

300
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,050
Do you just pay attention to these?

301
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,730
Do you think

302
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,680
doing this will ensure

303
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,530
their game is in good shape?

304
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,940
Now the main player is in this situation.

305
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,440
On one hand, it’s a mental problem.

306
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,160
On the other hand,

307
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,140
it also exposes that his ability has shortcomings.

308
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,760
The knockout match ON and JR

309
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,700
were placed in a group.

310
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,420
If Xiao Yichuan doesn't play,

311
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,120
JR is not much of a threat to us.

312
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,380
Coach Yi.

313
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,490
In these two days,

314
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,300
you need to focus on customizing the plan against other teams.

315
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,430
Also,

316
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,900
solve Xing's problem as soon as possible.

317
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,710
OK.

318
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,190
I don't expect you to win the championship,

319
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,700
but you have to enter the final.

320
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,590
I understand.

321
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,570
What's wrong with you?

322
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,130
You're so slow.

323
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,670
You were killed against a gun.

324
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
You didn't cover me,

325
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,150
Are you in such a hurry to get yourself killed?

326
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,770
I'm slow.

327
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,160
You don't know how to command.

328
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,800
You only know to move forward.

329
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,170
The bullet flew under your eyelid

330
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,230
and you think I didn't cover you?

331
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,600
Who do you think you are?

332
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,470
You have no right to judge me.

333
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,670
What are you doing?

334
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,920
The competition is the day after tomorrow.

335
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,250
Is this how you train?

336
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,150
Xing Ziyi, what's wrong with you?

337
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,660
There are many problems in training.

338
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,940
Do you still want to participate in the competition?

339
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,710
I don't think I have any problems.

340
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,400
Our opponents are very strong this time.

341
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,819
Three nominated teams in China.

342
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,119
SIK has extensive

343
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,060
world competition experience.

344
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,109
Xiao Yichuan from the JR

345
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,750
was also ranked in international competitions.

346
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,960
Not to mention the GO Team from Korea

347
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,869
and the Lime Team from Germany.

348
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,670
These are veteran players

349
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,890
on the battlefield for many years.

350
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,800
Only our ON is the first time

351
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,390
participating in such a level competition.

352
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:24,890
You have to be careful.

353
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,190
Be careful.

354
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,650
Are you so afraid of them?

355
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,130
It's OK to say the overseas teams.

356
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,490
You always talk about

357
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,150
Wang Boyu and Xiao Yichuan.

358
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,060
You guys are really boost other people's morale

359
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,130
and reduce your own courage.

360
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
Are you blind?

361
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,330
Can't you see that I'm working hard?

362
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,570
Can you give me some confidence?

363
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,380
Where am I not as good as them?

364
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,160
Come with me.

365
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,220
Open your mouth.

366
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,980
Now you know how good I am.

367
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,100
Yes.

368
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,240
Mother's love is boundless.

369
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,600
If it weren't for your hand injury,

370
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,740
I would have punched you.

371
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,840
Well,

372
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,710
you've worked hard for so long,

373
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,030
but you still have to leave.

374
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,690
I feel sorry for you.

375
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,630
Yo.

376
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,400
Didn't you persuade me to quit every day?

377
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,150
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

378
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,130
You know what?

379
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,060
When I handed over the peripherals

380
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,170
to Capt. Qin today,

381
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,950
I suddenly found that

382
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,890
the mouse

383
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,600
is as small as my palm,

384
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,920
but I couldn't catch it.

385
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,870
If I keep holding onto it,

386
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,550
I can't catch anything else.

387
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,600
I just put the mouse aside for a while.

388
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,110
When my hand recovers,

389
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,040
you'll be crushed by me.

390
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,890
I'm looking forward to it.

391
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,160
Then we will have a separate game.

392
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,380
That depends on how much you bet.

393
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:50,860
No.

394
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,900
The bet is too small.

395
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,250
It's getting boring.

396
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,730
Cookies?

397
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,070
Are you a three-year-old kid?

398
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,320
You usually don't talk,

399
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,140
so a bet so big?

400
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,410
How can you compete with me?

401
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,160
I think your keyboard is good.

402
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:19,770
That's it.

403
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
You have a purpose.

404
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,240
How do you plan to compete?

405
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,230
Make it simple.

406
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,760
Let's compare guns

407
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,300
and see who will be eliminated.

408
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,580
That's good.

409
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,420
-It's really good.
-Interesting.

410
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,330
That's good.

411
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,810
Yes.

412
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,120
We won.

413
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,180
Really?

414
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,590
You lose.

415
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,970
Oh.

416
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,020
Xiao Yichuan,

417
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,350
I applied to the logistics teacher several times

418
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,490
to move to the same dorm with you.

419
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,530
How can you be so cold to me?

420
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,120
There is only one defeat in the world,

421
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,110
and it is giving up.

422
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,090
I like what you said.

423
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,230
You...

424
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,740
What room are you in for

425
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,670
tomorrow's basic training and theory explanation?

426
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,570
I'll go find you.

427
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,860
How about we have lunch together

428
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,570
and come back together for a lunch break?

429
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,240
It's the trophy for today's training game.

430
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,900
Come and help me.

431
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,350
Are you going to the training game tomorrow?

432
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,630
We can ask those seniors out.

433
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,500
I'll introduce you to them.

434
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,670
OK.

435
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,340
Are you two going to open a supermarket

436
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,110
by betting in the youth training camp?

437
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,090
Listen,

438
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,720
you have to wash my socks for a month.

439
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,950
Otherwise, I can't be your brother anymore.

440
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,380
How can you joke about

441
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,140
our brotherhood?

442
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,180
I'm not joking.

443
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,210
Washing socks for a month

444
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,380
for a lifetime brother.

445
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,700
You won't lose this deal.

446
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:16,520
No.

447
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,470
Let's discuss.

448
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,610
Can you wear only one pair of socks a month?

449
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,680
I can't

450
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,020
just change my socks once a month.

451
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,830
You should be ready to wash my socks.

452
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,490
Keep your confidence on the battlefield.

453
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,120
Hong Yang, someone is looking for you.

454
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,620
Is it Chu Tian

455
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,180
or Chuan's fan this time?

456
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,650
Don't make the gift too big. I can't fit it in the box.

457
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,270
Hello, Hongyang.

458
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,220
I'm from the school TV station. I want to have an interview with you.

459
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,100
I can do that.

460
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,210
But I don't know if the rest of our team

461
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,910
are willing to do the interview.

462
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,690
I have to ask.

463
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,070
No one else.

464
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,170
I just want to interview you.

465
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,720
Why should I?

466
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,730
You are the only professional E-sports player

467
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,970
participating in the global league in our school.

468
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,320
Yes.

469
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,140
Everyone says that you are a scholarly player.

470
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,680
Not only did you participate in a professional competition,

471
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,280
but the thesis you published online

472
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,030
has also caused a lot of discussions.

473
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,710
It's interesting and professional.

474
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,080
We are also going to

475
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,060
discuss it in this interview.

476
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,940
Do you think it's okay?

477
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,780
Of course.

478
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,420
I'll add you to my contact list.

479
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,320
OK.

480
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,600
OK.

481
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,390
Let's keep in touch.

482
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,450
I didn't expect a nobody like me

483
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,230
to be invited to an interview.

484
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,200
You're not nobody anymore.

485
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:03,890
Wow.

486
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,220
Secretary Liu.

487
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,860
You came to the company so late.

488
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,130
I'm here to pack something.

489
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,340
My dad hasn't left yet.

490
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,300
He just had a meeting with a few business managers.

491
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,960
And he is still on the phone with a client now.

492
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,940
OK, I got it. Go ahead.

493
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,060
OK, Zhao.

494
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,370
Let's have tea another day.

495
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,180
OK.

496
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,700
It's a deal then.

497
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:54,660
OK.

498
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,860
OK.

499
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,050
OK.

500
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,580
Bye.

501
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,870
The competition is the day after tomorrow.

502
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,410
Why are you here?

503
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,780
I came to get something.

504
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,520
Dad.

505
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,610
Is there anything I can help?

506
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,380
Just do your own thing.

507
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,610
How's the preparation for the competition?

508
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,420
Not only the competition,

509
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,410
I've made the team's future plan.

510
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,030
If the team gets a good score

511
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,430
in this competition,

512
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,500
of course, it will proves the team's value.

513
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,440
It will also be a good improvement for

514
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,420
the team's future operation planning.

515
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,250
OK.

516
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,660
Like the SIK Team,

517
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,150
their annual profit can reach eight digits.

518
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,900
Now we are not as good as such

519
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,640
a veteran team.

520
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,900
But recently,

521
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,980
our results have been recognized.

522
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,870
If the result is not satisfactory...

523
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,100
The main player of your team

524
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,640
won't be able to play?

525
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,220
If the result is not satisfactory,

526
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,410
I will fully respect the members' wishes.

527
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:19,890
OK.

528
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,600
If they want to leave,

529
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,670
I will accept it.

530
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,640
And...

531
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,730
One more time.

532
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:32,570
OK.

533
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,250
This

534
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,560
is a sample brochure of the company's introduction

535
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,890
for the next quarter just made by the publicity department.

536
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,870
I have specially reserved a page for the departmental brochure,

537
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,700
waiting for you to come back and write it.

538
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,760
Dong Shi said he'll be here soon.

539
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:21,980
OK.

540
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,210
You can go back now.

541
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,040
I'll stay with you a little longer.

542
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,580
The competition is tomorrow.

543
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,920
I'm quite nervous.

544
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,360
Tell me if you want to wait for Dong Shi.

545
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,150
Stop pretending.

546
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,560
Brat.

547
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,710
How dare you talk to your sister like that?

548
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,940
Am I wrong?

549
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,520
He calls me brother-in-law

550
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,550
every day.

551
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,290
Does our parents know about this?

552
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,710
Don't talk nonsense.

553
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,670
I'll try my best.

554
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:47,590
Hello.

555
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,800
Let me do it.

556
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,980
Let me do it.

557
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,020
Let me do it.

558
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,820
Put it up.

559
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,950
Don't press it.

560
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:09,770
OK.

561
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,120
How dare you!

562
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,860
Isn't he my future brother-in-law?

563
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,600
Brother-in-law.

564
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,230
Look.

565
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,530
Chu Tian has agreed.

566
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,570
You should...

567
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,720
Focus on the competition.

568
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,070
OK.

569
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,010
I will definitely try my best

570
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,520
to make you the boss's wife of the championship team.

571
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,360
But I may be too busy to take care of you tomorrow.

572
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm an adult.

573
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,170
I don't need you to take care of me.

574
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,020
Alright.

575
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:40,960
Get in the car.

576
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,370
Actually, I support

577
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,820
you two to be together.

578
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,260
Thank you, brother-in-law.

579
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,770
I used to be at the bottom

580
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,680
of the biological chain in our family.

581
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,940
Now?

582
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,820
Come and drive.

583
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,660
We'll stay for a few days.

584
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,580
You don't have to bring so much.

585
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,220
What is this?

586
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,400
It was given to me by

587
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,900
the boss's assistant at the sales office last time.

588
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,810
He said you had a good chat.

589
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,460
This house is a fulfilled promise

590
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,620
with a great discount.

591
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,300
Our original budget

592
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,760
can be changed to a big apartment.

593
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,130
I already paid the down payment.

594
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,230
They also said

595
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,800
if you go to the ON Team as a coach,

596
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,200
they can give you this house.

597
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,180
You...

598
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,830
What are you doing?

599
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,060
Why did you

600
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,430
decide by yourself on such a big thing?

601
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,790
They said you had a deal.

602
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,890
I thought you knew it.

603
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,770
There is no such good thing in the world.

604
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,070
You couldn't think about it.

605
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,450
But you should have at least asked me.

606
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,460
Who gave you this?

607
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,850
Return the house.

608
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,160
What do you mean?

609
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,710
I've already paid the down payment.

610
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,760
Go now.

611
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,570
I'm not going.

612
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,340
I'll go if you don't.

613
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,660
Why are you so angry?

614
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,850
I did it for our family.

615
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,950
Qin Zheng, do you really think you are

616
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,810
a passionate young man in your early 20s?

617
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,540
Can dream feed you?

618
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,150
Sir.

619
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,430
Sorry, sir.

620
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,850
Sorry, Mr. Huo.

621
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,420
It's okay.

622
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,280
Go back to work.

623
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,980
What do you mean?

624
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,150
We had a deal.

625
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,460
Bring Xiao Yichuan to meet me.

626
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,090
I'll take care of the house for you.

627
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,630
Although Xiao Yichuan didn't make it,

628
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,130
I am more trustworthy.

629
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,900
I will do what I promised you.

630
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:09,960
I don't need it.

631
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,920
We are not the same.

632
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,610
Whether we are the same or not,

633
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,590
it's not up to you.

634
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,989
What do you want?

635
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,389
You've seen Xiao Yichuan.

636
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,840
He wouldn't come to ON Team.

637
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,060
I have no value

638
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:32,969
to you anymore.

639
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,820
How could it be?

640
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,090
I'm sure you've seen

641
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,400
the grouping results of the knockout matches.

642
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,889
The JR Team and the ON Team are in the same group.

643
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,070
Since you're in the competiton,

644
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,070
you have to let the ON Team win.

645
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:51,969
No way.

646
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,739
When the third safety zone is refreshed,

647
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,140
you'll lie in ambush at the south of the circle.

648
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,310
I'll give you points with the ULT team.

649
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,140
OK.

650
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,540
Not only will you give us points,

651
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,280
but also lose.

652
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,130
I know.

653
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,980
It's easy to lose.

654
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,140
I'm curious

655
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,310
how Xiao Yichuan would react

656
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,290
if he hears this?

657
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,230
ULT's fiasco

658
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,730
three years ago

659
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,040
wasn't because of mistakes at all.

660
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,280
It was because of you.

661
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,020
You betrayed your team

662
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,850
and all your brothers.

663
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,680
Do you think he will forgive you?

664
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,420
Do you say that

665
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,440
a trivial knockout is more important

666
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:53,490
or that a brother

667
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,510
who has trusted you for many years is more important?

668
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,080
That's right.

669
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,400
Why make it so embarrassing?

670
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,460
We can discuss it.

671
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,390
What do you think, Capt. Qin?

672
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,180
Don't worry.

673
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,730
As long as the ON Team can advance,

674
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,360
I promise

675
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,890
I won't mention a word about this thing.

676
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,930
I only got second place this time.

677
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,860
If we hadn't run into the opposite sight on the final lap,

678
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,080
we would have won.

679
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,860
I marked some places.

680
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,380
According to the circle, we can discuss it.

681
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,300
It was my fault.

682
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,660
In the last round,

683
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,660
we didn't have enough time.

684
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,140
When Dong Shi raided,

685
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,650
Hongyang and I didn't follow up in time.

686
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,610
Some accounts are familiar.

687
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,590
They should all be on the list of players on the US server.

688
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,650
So what?

689
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,780
Stop comforting us.

690
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,540
In the last round,

691
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,190
your timing of the hedge

692
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,210
is really not good enough.

693
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,040
You got good elimination scores.

694
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,380
But you're used to scoring points by fighting.

695
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,130
Deplete players in the early stage

696
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,570
reduces the chance of

697
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,310
getting ranking points in the later stage.

698
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,540
Chu Tian,

699
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,100
you're doing a good job of

700
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,310
coordinating the division of labor right now.

701
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,490
However,

702
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,300
the fighting rhythm for each member is still lacking.

703
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,220
In this case, once there is a battle,

704
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,750
the risk of depleting players will increase quickly.

705
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,470
Then,

706
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,190
how to overcome the rhythm coordination?

707
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,560
Comprehensively considering the rhythm of each member

708
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,310
is a difficult task.

709
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,130
There is no trick or speed method.

710
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,420
Only by accumulating experience

711
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,120
to support the changes of each operation

712
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,190
and predict in advance.

713
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,660
You can't master it in a day or two.

714
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,170
So don't feel pressured.

715
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,200
Don't blame yourself, brother-in-law.

716
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,510
Let's practice more when we have time.

717
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,660
How about this?

718
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,990
I'll be in charge.

719
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,280
I have written down everything

720
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,020
the doctor said.

721
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,610
Hey.

722
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,120
What are you looking at?

723
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,520
That man keeps looking at you.

724
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,870
Do you know him?

725
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,000
Isn't that the handsome senior of my high school?

726
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,500
He saw me just now.

727
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,880
You know him well?

728
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:37,570
What does he do?

729
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,260
A doctor?

730
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,610
So he's a doctor now.

731
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,030
He used to practice drums.

732
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,220
He had his own band

733
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,100
and went on a national tour.

734
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,260
Oh.

735
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,820
He can play basketball.

736
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,120
In the past, many girls crowded the stadium

737
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,000
to watch him play basketball.

738
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
You really like basketball.

739
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,780
When he was in high school,

740
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,740
he was the best player

741
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,610
in high school basketball league.

742
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,140
His hands are so pretty.

743
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,980
Picking up a scalpel with such a beautiful hand

744
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,830
is simply a work of art.

745
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,580
Xiong Jiujiu.

746
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,260
Long time no see.

747
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,140
Senior Hao Shuai.

748
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,260
Long time no see.

749
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,960
Are you really a doctor?

750
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,690
I'm really happy for you.

751
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,330
You're still so energetic.

752
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,320
Are you graduating soon?

753
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:17,760
Yes.

754
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,680
Don't feel pressured.

755
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,730
Hello.

756
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,550
I'm Xiong Jiujiu's boyfriend.

757
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,220
I'll get going then.

758
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,370
-OK.
-Take it slowly.

759
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,300
It's the temptation given by my husband.

760
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,090
What did the doctor say?

761
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,310
Why are you so strange?

762
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,590
Is there something wrong with your hand?

763
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,250
Do you think boys who play drums

764
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:12,990
are attractive?

765
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:17,770
Just so so.

766
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,280
It's no different from knocking on a pile of scrap metal.

767
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,780
Exactly.

768
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,820
So do you think there's something

769
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,070
that doesn't hurt the hand, that's quick, and that's right for my instrument?

770
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,100
You?

771
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,250
Yes.

772
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,900
Suona.

773
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,660
Do you think men who play basketball are handsome?

774
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,320
So tacky.

775
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,130
Who plays basketball these days?

776
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,660
The way they flirt with girls in the last century.

777
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,160
Exactly.

778
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,980
So do you think there's something

779
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,020
that doesn't hurt the hand, that's quick, and that's right for my sports?

780
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,790
Smash a rock on your chest.

781
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,570
You...

782
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,350
Do you think my hands are pretty?

783
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,620
Yes.

784
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,020
You've experienced the beautiful times.

785
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,710
It's full of glory.

786
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,330
You're good at saying that.

787
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,420
Tell me.

788
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,640
If my hands

789
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,160
is holding a scalpel,

790
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,950
isn't this beautiful?

791
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,130
Chuan,

792
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,510
Who bullied you?

793
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,000
I can beat him up for you.

794
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,110
Don't dissect him like in the movie.

795
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,050
Go fold your clothes.

796
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,050
You don't understand

797
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,390
my world.
