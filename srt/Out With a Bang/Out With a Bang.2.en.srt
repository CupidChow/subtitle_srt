00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,560
Wang Boyu asked me to come.

3
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,200
He said

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,250
you are the only one who can help me.

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
Help you fight?

6
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,710
Yes, help me fight.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,240
Wang Boyu said

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,460
this is a piece of cake for you.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,630
Wang Boyu. Wang Boyu.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,550
Why don't you ask Wang Boyu to help you?

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,320
He's not as good as you after all.

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,090
You see?

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,730
I've brought so many delicious food

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,420
to show my sincerity.

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,270
This is one month's snacks for me.

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,360
How about...

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,060
we talk about it?

18
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,000
Guru.

19
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,509
I was being ignorant before.

20
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,660
I'm fighting

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,530
the ON Team

22
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,990
which were managed by the weird couple at the airport yesterday.

23
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,270
Aren't you a fighter yourself?

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,070
You don't have enough fighters?

25
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,370
Don't make fun of me.

26
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,040
I'm talking about playing games.

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,050
Playing games.

28
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,490
Yesterday, I got drunk by accident

29
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,530
and made a fight appointment with their manager.

30
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,000
Guru.

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,600
You're such a good person.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,050
You won't do nothing about it, right?

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,030
Guru.

34
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,620
It's a great merit to save a life.

35
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,410
Now you are the only one who can help me.

36
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,150
I'm the only one, right?

37
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,740
Yes, yes.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,690
Good.

39
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,210
Is your house a garbage dump?

40
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,340
Why is there so much garbage?

41
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,150
One minute of anger

42
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,480
means 60 seconds of unhappiness.

43
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,329
An hour of anger

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,950
means 60 minutes of stupidity.

45
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,750
I'll pretend to be deaf if someone pisses me off.

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,670
Do not be angry, let him go.

47
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,160
Xiong…

48
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,580
What else can I do for you?

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,440
I can cook, take care of the kids and walk the dog.

50
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,470
You didn't go downstairs today.

51
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,600
Why don't I take you for a walk?

52
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,590
Walk me, right?

53
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,150
Get ready to pay for my appearance.

54
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,650
Guru, I was wrong.

55
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,140
I'm just a poor student.

56
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,650
My monthly living expenses will be gone right after I pay off my account.

57
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,490
I only earn some money from live streaming.

58
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,710
If I lose this battle,

59
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,900
I'll lose my job.

60
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,690
Listen.

61
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,700
This is my stomach crying

62
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,060
from starving.

63
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,020
But look at you.

64
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,520
A famous guru of the industry.

65
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,940
How about

66
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,790
you lend me a hand

67
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,140
and not charge me the money?

68
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,670
I've been out of business for six months.

69
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,760
As an unemployed person

70
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,070
depending on someone else for a living,

71
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,940
I have to clean Wang Boyu's house,

72
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,460
wash and cook to cover my debts

73
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,140
every day,

74
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,900
not knowing when I can return to the game.

75
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,420
I'm just living on my own fat now.

76
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,090
Look at those trophies.

77
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,800
Maybe they'll have to be sold for food money.

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,230
You said you were hungry.

79
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,880
I have instant noodles every day.

80
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,670
Listen.

81
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,050
That's the sound of me being so poor.

82
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,390
Fine.

83
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,700
How much do you want?

84
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,810
¥2,000?

85
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,560
I'll pay. I'll pay.

86
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,770
You're really expensive.

87
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,120
What are you waiting for?

88
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,080
Give me the QR code.

¥20,000.

90
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,280
You're this expensive to play a game?

91
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,240
You don't have to pay to admit defeat.

92
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,100
Go do it.

93
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,450
Don't.

94
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,030
My monthly living expenses are only ¥4,000 in total.

95
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,640
I'll give you my entire fortune.

¥4,396.77.

97
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,510
I'll write an IOU for the rest of the money,

98
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,710
do you think it's okay?

for the rest of the installment.

103
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,250
Every Monday,

104
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,650
you bring it to my house.

105
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,550
Got it.

Make an IOU.

107
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,640
The game is foursome.

it's just a matter of two games for you.

Really?

You can teach me how to play then.

114
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,160
You don't know how to play at all?

115

No.

116
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,660
How can I return this?

I want to have a good training.

Although you are helping me with this,

I still want to try hard.

I don't want to be underestimated.

Why don't you report to me?

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,430
ULT Team. The champion.

174
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,670
ULT Team. The champion.

175
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,380
ULT Team. The champion.

176
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,180
ULT Team. The champion.

177
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,390
ULT Team has been maintaining

178
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,600
the highest domestic level.

179
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,510
It's also one of the most popular

180
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,960
and appreciated teams in this season.

181
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,910
At the same time, this is also the newcomer Xiao Yichuan's first time

182
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,480
to participate in the league.

183
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,520
Although this youngster has not yet played on the field,

184
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,000
his personal data and some training videos

185
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,140
have already attracted abundant attention and discussion.

186
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,350
Many people claim to see

187
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,220
a potential future king.

188
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,180
Let's expect this dark horse to make his debut

189
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,590
and an impact.

190
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,500
Now the game officially begins.

191
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,000
In the first round we can see the ULT Team

192
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,490
chooses gun standoff.

193
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,000
But Xiao Yichuan is quickly eliminated.

194
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,790
The rest of the ULT Team

195
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,620
doesn't get any valid points either.

196
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,140
[Out]

197
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,420
The defending champion ULT Team

198
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,910
is surprisingly destroyed once again.

199
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,510
This is the biggest surprise of the day.

200
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,540
I hope ULT Team's

201
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,940
unexpected performance

202
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,190
can be improved in the second half.

203
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,540
It's been three years.

204
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,050
I never thought we'd meet again.

205
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,430
I'm almost at the internet café.

206
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,860
See you soon.

207
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,660
Xiao Yichuan.

208
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,770
Wait for me.

209
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,640
Your outfit is quite nice.

210
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,790
I want one.

211
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,600
Learn to walk first.

212
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,220
Here's an assault rifle for you.

213
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,980
Different guns

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,280
for different combat tactics.

215
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,640
Like this.

216
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:18,870
Fire the scope.

217
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,790
Aim.

218
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,110
Fire.

219
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,310
Amazing.

220
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,610
You hit them all.

221
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,990
It's called a headshot.

222
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:34,230
[Headshot]

223
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:34,230
[A game term means a hit to the head in a game.]

224
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,440
Hit in the head.

225
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,630
I am

226
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,680
the No.1 in all servers.

227
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,390
Pull down the mouse while firing.

228
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,630
This is called “forcing gun”.

229
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,260
The recoil of the firearm will make the muzzle raise.

230
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,930
You have to figure out the feeling and position yourself.

231
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,950
This seems a bit difficult.

232
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,060
How about

233
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,960
you teach me something a little easier?

234
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,260
Keep your hands on the mouse and keyboard.

235
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,390
It's the easiest.

236
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,920
That's not what I meant.

237
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,450
Then practice your aim.

238
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,950
Turn around and aim a thousand times.

239
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,070
Call me when you're done.

240
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,500
One thousand times?

241
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,370
That's a lot.

242
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,330
How about 50 times?

243
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,750
I think my eyesight is pretty good.

244
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:24,930
Then

245
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,810
how about

246
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,530
one hundred times?

247
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,860
Do you think you're bargaining at the grocery store?

248
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,260
Do you think I'm playing with you?

249
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,560
What did you say yourself?

250
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,850
You don't want to be underestimated.

251
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,900
But what are you doing now?

252
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,390
50 times?

253
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,300
Which e-sports player

254
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,970
can earn his performance by 50 times of practice?

255
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,100
As long as you call today's event

256
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,030
a competition,

257
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,950
it's not a playgame.

258
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,020
I'm a sports management student.

259
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,619
Although I've never played e-sports,

260
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,349
I do know

261
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,430
that gaming is like any other competition.

262
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,619
It's all about

263
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,730
hard work.

264
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,339
I've never taken this

265
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,150
as a playgame.

266
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,280
Wen.

267
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,780
Are you sure you're on?

268
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,200
Before I became a manager,

269
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,710
I was a game streamer.

270
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,010
I've played tens of thousands of live games.

271
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,600
How can't I even handle this little rookie?

272
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,580
Wen.

273
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,470
If we win today,

274
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,540
give us a week off.

275
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,340
I want to go out with my girlfriend for a few days.

276
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,780
Sure.

277
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,670
You've been training so hard lately.

278
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,190
If I win, I'll give you a week off.

279
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,340
Long live Wen!

280
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,060
Don't be angry.

281
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,930
Guru.

282
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,890
The best,

283
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,530
incomparable,

284
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,700
awe-inspiring,

285
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,480
brilliant guru.

286
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,580
Guru.

287
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,120
I have to start a livestream.

288
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,310
Yesterday, I promised the game in the livestream.

289
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,060
So…

290
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,650
I'll take that as a yes.

291
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,810
Don't shoot me.

292
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,160
Yes, sir.

293
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,430
It's finally time to start.

294
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,940
I'm looking forward to seeing Wen beating the aggressive streamer.

295
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,600
Women's fights are more interesting than men's.

296
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,120
Do you want to bet on who can win?

297
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,530
The user above me,

298
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,540
do you even know about

299
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,090
the strength of ON team and Wen?

300
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,300
Wen? More like a plague.

301
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,110
This fight is because of the woman at the airport?

302
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,790
Why do you still have to take this as a grownup?

303
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,580
Let's get started.

304
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,190
Keep running to the house.

305
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,730
The equipment is inside.

306
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,390
Why turn around?

307
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,610
There's someone next to me.

308
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,420
That person is much further away from the house than you are.

309
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm scared.

310
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,120
I'm here, what are you afraid of?

311
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,680
Ah!

312
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,940
Who hit me?

313
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,520
Help!

314
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,730
Let's go.

315
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,900
I dare not.

316
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm afraid.

317
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,840
I won't go. I don't want to move.

318
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,180
Are you going now?

319
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,500
Yes.

320
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,190
The left eyelid is jumping.

321
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,810
The left is good and the right is bad.

322
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,920
Something good is happening.

323
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,230
Food streamer challenges ON team.

324
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:50,970
Go!

325
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,440
Xiao Yichuan!

326
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,480
Xiao Yichuan, where are you?

327
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,270
Wow! Oh my God!

328
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,600
You eliminated Fang Wenwen!

329
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,530
Oh my God, the livestream has the biggest reaction.

330
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,220
This is amazing.

331
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,900
Every single frame is so charming.

332
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,210
Listen, 111.

333
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,510
It's illegal to be overly cool.

334
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,980
I've been set off by 111 and I'm in a heart attack alarm.

335
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,860
Today, I fell in love again because of 111.

336
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,490
The eight times gun-forcing

337
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,650
seems as skilled as if Chuan's.

338
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,290
May I ask who 111 is?

339
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,540
Who is 111?

340
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,830
It doesn't matter.

341
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,410
Thank you for the gifts.

342
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,700
The streamer's teammate

343
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,260
is so skillful at gun-forcing of

344
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,980
SITS eight times scope.

345
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,310
We won!

346
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,530
So fast!

347
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,670
If you ambushed one less time,

348
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,950
it could have been faster.

349
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,140
Win again in the next game and we'll win.

350
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,270
Thank you for the gift from CEO.

351
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,720
Thank you for the gift from Boss.

352
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,810
Taking a new love to fight a scumbag?

353
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,020
It's not decided whether it's new love or old love.

354
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,830
Hurry up on the second game.

355
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,980
Okay.

356
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,950
Get on.

357
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,330
Oh, okay.

358
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,020
Get off.

359
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,920
Xiong Jiujiu.

360
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,930
Don't keep hiding if you have the guts.

361
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,430
How can she talk to me?

362
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,300
She turned on the public mic.

363
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,830
Be careful, Wen.

364
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,540
That 111 is so fast.

365
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,160
Xiong Jiujiu, you can only rely on men, don't you?

366
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,260
Not only do you seduce other people's boyfriends behind their backs,

367
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,210
but also sneak around in the game.

368
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,220
It's a shame.

369
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
Where's the public mic key?

370
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,420
I found it.

371
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,970
Fang Wenwen, I'm telling you.

372
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,930
Wait for me.

373
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,780
You only need to listen to me now.

374
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,650
Stop it.

375
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,080
Xiao Yichuan.

376
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,860
Did you see that?

377
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,800
The man who just flashed by on the livestream.

378
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,310
He actually appeared.

379
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,030
Hurry up, send gifts.

380
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,290
Junior boss.

381
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,680
The last time Xiao Yichuan appeared

382
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,270
was when the contract was terminated six months ago.

383
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,520
That guy just flashed by.

384
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,540
I guess it's not necessarily him.

385
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,500
It must be him.

386
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,840
It looks like Chuan's skill.

387
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,720
Gun-forcing with eight times scope.

388
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,540
Is that an operation that anyone can do?

389
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,940
But why would he appear

390
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,660
in the livestream of a food streamer?

391
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,140
This CEO has money to burn.

392
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,730
He's been sending yacht gifts all the time.

393
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,660
Is this Boss sick?

394
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,830
He just followed my gift-sending.

395
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,170
Junior boss.

396
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,320
Can we get off work for today?

397
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,210
I know

398
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,110
you've been working overtime with me recently.

399
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,430
It's really hard.

400
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,730
It's okay.

401
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,850
I'll go see your department head tomorrow…

402
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,670
Wait.

403
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,000
I'll go directly to my father and tell him

404
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,190
to transfer you guys

405
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,730
to my gaming department.

406
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,540
No, no, no.

407
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,850
Don't bother the company.

408
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,500
I'll just stay in my basketball department.

409
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,490
That's the company's ace department.

410
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,550
If it were me, I wouldn't leave either.

411
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,670
Well... Gaming...

412
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,270
I'm too old to understand it.

413
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,190
You're old.

414
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,140
You're just a programmer in your 20s

415
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,500
with glasses.

416
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,020
All the interns the company just recruited this year

417
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,040
are here.

418
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,370
I secretly brought it from the HR.

419
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,850
Feel free to look.

420
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:47,910
I know.

421
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,950
Everyone in the company doesn't like my gaming department,

422
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,550
[Wang Qianhua]

423
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,080
thinking my dad set up the department to make me feel better.

424
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,090
But I've done the fortune-telling.

425
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,870
Gold is my element.

426
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,670
I'm made for the electronics industry.

427
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,030
Plus my office,

428
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,670
Nine Stars Astrology.

429
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,300
I…

430
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,570
Get out of work.

431
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,990
Junior boss, thank you for your hard work, goodbye.

432
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,370
You don't understand even if I tell you.

433
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,040
[Xiong Jiujiu]

434
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,460
Put on my level 3 armor.

435
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,920
I'll take you to revenge.

436
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,950
Wow, they are so weak.

437
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,540
We easily win.

438
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,810
Xiong Jiujiu.

439
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,220
Yeah.

440
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,680
Shouldn't you show me your gratitude?

441
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,170
Ah!

442
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,460
Thank you, Guru.

443
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,150
I will pay you back the money I owe you as soon as possible.

444
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,050
Don't worry.

445
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,310
Who asked you for money?

446
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,620
Then what do you want?

447
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,670
Did I say I want something?

448
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,760
Hello?

449
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,350
Who played the game for you?

450
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,550
Ah, I paid for it.

451
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,700
So, did you go home?

452
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,300
Let's talk about it at home.

453
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:25,780
I'm hanging up.

454
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,940
What do you want?

455
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:32,850
I'm hungry.

456
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,830
Dine with me.

457
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,040
Why do you leave all of a sudden?

458
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,360
Wait for me.

459
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,750
You helped me win the game.

460
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,200
I should treat you to dinner.

461
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,710
How about

462
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,860
we go to the night market across from our school?

463
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,800
If you don't have money, just say so.

464
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,940
You don't have to treat me, I'll pay.

465
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,130
You don't have a clue

466
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,880
about why I don't have money?

467
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,980
But it's okay.

468
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,740
Let's go somewhere else.

469
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,750
I can afford it.

470
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,700
Save your money to pay off the bills.

471
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,520
I said you don't have to pay.

472
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:26,940
Excuse me.

473
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,560
We can eat anywhere.

474
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,310
It can be paid by anyone.

475
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,310
Don't slap your face until it's swollen to look imposing, okay?

476
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,750
Who are you calling swollen?

477
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,260
That was just a description.

478
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,100
I am swollen and have no money, right?

479
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,740
You don't have money in the first place.

480
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,900
Who are you insulting?

481
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,620
Let me tell you something.

482
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,040
I've never seen someone

483
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,930
as arrogant as you.

484
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,250
I've put up with you all night today.

485
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,510
You can decide whether you'll have this meal or not.

486
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,620
I won't bother.

487
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,210
I've put up with you all night.

488
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,410
You turned your back after using me.

489
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,620
Since so many men called you,

490
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,600
go to them.

491
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,740
You must be paranoid.

492
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,990
I don't know what you're talking about.

493
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,830
One more word with you

494
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,380
is a waste of my life.

495
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,600
Don't talk to me for the rest of your life then.

496
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,600
Okay.

497
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,940
We'll never see each other again.

498
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,330
Come here, Chuan.

499
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:48,540
Hello.

500
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,960
I'm an intern here for orientation.

501
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,590
Hello, wait a minute.

502
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,570
Hello, this way please.

503
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,760
Our department head is waiting for you.

504
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,950
After our team came to 4th place in the domestic league

505
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,170
last year,

506
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,180
several old players have retired.

507
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,130
The new boss this year

508
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,710
sincerely hope

509
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,980
you can join us.

510
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,350
Not only does the team

511
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,500
plan to try out the international tournament,

512
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,830
but we want the team to

complete the transformation plan this year with you.

514
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,460
Transformation?

515
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,810
Gaming Department?

516
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,489
Hello.

517
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,880
I am the director,

518
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,719
a manager.

519
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,120
Gaming manager.

520
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:23,699
Hello.

521
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,620
But my entry form says basketball department.

522
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,300
[Basketball Department  New Employee Entry Form]

523
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,060
Never mind.

524
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,290
Plans don't change.

525
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,020
Let me introduce you to your position.

526
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,060
Manager

527
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,889
of Gaming Team.

528
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:38,370
But it does nothing to do with the team's position arrangement.

529
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,780
You're still the commander.

530
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,370
So what's the so-called

531
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,310
transformation plan?

532
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:43,500
Come on.

533
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,360
Drink some water first.

534
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:46,659
E-sports

535
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,139
is now becoming a new sports event.

536
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,350
Although just starting out,

537
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,500
it is quite popular

538
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,090
with a lot of money flowing in.

539
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,060
This is a golden opportunity for companies and teams to develop.

540

Chuan.

541
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,380
Don't rush.

542
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,700
Although the gaming department has just been established

543
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,950
and can't compare to the basketball department,

544
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,470
you shouldn't be so realistic.

545
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,700
Let's start from scratch with the gaming department.

546
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,050
Isn't it inspiring

547
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,510
and rewarding?

548
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,610
-But I... -But you don't have a good understanding

549
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,560
of e-sports, right?

550
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,450
Never mind.

551
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,710
I've prepared everything.

552
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,240
[A BRIEF HISTORY OF E-SPORTS]

553
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,010
This is a new supplemental agreement we drafted.

554
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,080
[Supplementary Agreement on E-sports Cooperation]

555
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,220
Read it first

556
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,730
and rethink about it.

557
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,420
Your transformation plan

558
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
really doesn't suit me.

559
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,380
Chuan.

560
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,260
Your endorsement fee alone

561
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,630
is worth a team's.

562
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,800
That's one of the reasons

563
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,100
why our new boss likes you.

564
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,930
After all, the team has to be fed.

565
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,810
The primary goal of the boss is to make money.

566
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,440
The gaming industry is becoming more and more competitive.

567
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,490
We're transforming to meet the market.

568
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,850
I never take endorsements.

569
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,160
I never thought I would be so valuable.

570
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,310
E-sports is a sports industry,

571
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,050
not a business.

572
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,870
There's no market for it.

573
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,850
Even if there is a lot of competition,

574
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,340
all the teams that survive

575
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,210
are not looking to make money.

576
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,940
E-sports

577
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,510
is a sacred and pure sports project.

578
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,800
I've learned that your major is sports industry management.

579
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,210
I believe you can understand and do this job.

580
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,370
There are so many interns in your company.

581
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,020
There must be people who like gaming.

582
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Why do you have to hire me?

583
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,300
Because I watched your live game yesterday.

584
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,520
It was pretty good.

585
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,220
I'm the CEO on the top of the live streaming gift list.

586
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,710
In return,

587
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,030
shouldn't you also show me some sincerity?

588
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,610
Why don't you tell me

589
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,110
the reason for rejecting our gaming department?

590
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,510
I didn't reject it.

591
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,120
I respect every profession.

592
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,740
It's just that

593
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,190
I'm a beginner in gaming myself.

594
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,700
Yesterday was also my first experience with gaming.

595
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,200
I said

596
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,020
you must have love and understanding

597
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,990
of a job.

598
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,710
I'd better go back to the basketball department

599
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,520
as a layman.

600
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,600
For this reason, I'm sure I'll hire you.

601
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,190
A lot of people fail at everything they do.

602
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,230
And you know why?

603
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,870
Because they have no fear.

604
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,830
But you do.

605
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,020
Resources, money, status.

606
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,030
None of those matters.

607
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,270
All love and passion

608
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,140
are born from the most primitive fear of things.

609
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,560
Not everyone can work in gaming industry.

610
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,100
In this industry, there are too many speculators

611
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,570
who want to cash in on the short-term business,

612
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,120
taking gaming

613
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,450
as a business opportunity,

614
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,110
ust like the ON team that you beat up

615
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,210
and their boss Huo Ran.

616
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,810
He looked for venture capital,

617
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,350
took financing, made data, and cashed out.

618
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,570
This is why the ON team was made.

619
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,970
They basically

620
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,890
want to take advantage of

621
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,580
the momentum of e-sports in our country to get rich and then leave.

622
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,720
What kind of behavior is this?

623
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,540
This is to get the best deal of socialism.

624
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,980
Can you tolerate this kind of behavior?

625
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,180
Can you watch them muddy the water?

626
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,500
Competitive sports should be loved and defended.

627
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,130
Gaming should not be tainted by such people.

628
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,680
Your team's development plan is nice.

629
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,100
It's just not for me.

630
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,550
E-sports is a new industry.

631
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,480
We all enter this field

632
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,240
with our own goals and hopes.

633
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,650
I hope that in the end

634
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,500
we all can get what we want.

635
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,830
E-sports is a new industry,

636
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,610
a new business.

637
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,160
There should be more hope and expectation.

638
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,790
I really felt the charm of e-sports

639
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,950
yesterday when I finished the game.

640
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,460
But there are too many uncertainties in this industry.

641
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,010
So for someone as mediocre as me,

642
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,040
I'd better go back to the basketball department.

643
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,400
I'll work hard.

644
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,800
In basketball department,

645
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,280
the most you can be is

646
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,780
event planner or department assistant.

647
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,150
But in my gaming department,

648
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,940
you can make your knowledge

649
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,590
play the best part.

650
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,100
It's only irresponsible to yourself

651
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,720
to put your career on

652
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,590
something stable.

653
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,300
You are so young.

654
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,020
Won't you regret

655
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,750
if you don't try your best?

656
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,780
Hey, Chuan, wait.

657
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,310
Our boss said your annual salary can still be increased.

658
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,860
We can also advance you

659
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,110
one season's bonus.

660
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,030
And

661
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,800
when your internship is over,

662
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,170
I will write you

663
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,150
an exceptionally good internship report,

664
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,180
so that if you ever want to change careers,

665
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,130
it will also help you well

666
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,960
in another field.

667
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,970
And a very good salary.

668
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,090
I don't sell

669
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:32,990
my career.

670
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,520
Can I really get a portion of my salary in advance?

671
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,460
Of course you can.

672
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,220
Come on, sign it.

673
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:57,990
Good.

674
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,860
As the only employee of the gaming department,

675
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,860
you'll be...

676
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,750
The only one?

677
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,420
Don't rush.

678
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,340
We will sign more people in the future.

679
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,540
Now there is

680
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,980
an imminent task in front of you,

681
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,560
that is, to sign players and form a team.

682
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,360
We're going to play in the TLO Global League.

683
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:13,990
I have a preliminary list of players

684
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,790
to be signed.

685
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,620
You can take a look at it.

686
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,840
How's that? Isn't that sweet?

687
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,070
Well, I'll form a team.

688
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,470
What are you doing then?

689
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,590
Of course I have

690
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,460
more important things to do.

691
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,350
You want me to sign him?

692
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,690
Captain Wang.

693
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,940
What are you doing

694
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,050
staying up so late?

695
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,970
I'm... I'm...

696
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,900
Is the training intensity not enough for you?

697
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,110
I'll talk to the coach tomorrow

698
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,460
and let him add three hours of training for you.

699
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,420
I mean, Su.

700
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,350
Captain Su, Boss Su.

701
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,470
I...

702
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,220
I'm observing the game and learning.

703
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,610
Observing and learning, right?

704
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,560
Let me see.

705
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,720
You're the captain of SIK Team.

706
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,240
You're observing and learning from

707
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,120
a food anchor's livestream?

708
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,140
Do you think anyone

709
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,360
will believe it?

710
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,800
Don't do that.

711
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,780
Go to sleep.

712
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,770
Sending gifts.
