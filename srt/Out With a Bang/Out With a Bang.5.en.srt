Is it because the products are only for men?

00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,100
That's why she didn't want to use them?

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,620
Hey bro, she...

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,410
She used this.

00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,170
So she likes cherry blossoms.

Cherry blossom scent?

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,250
Will she think I'm not manly enough?

Sir...

11
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,630
A tough man with tenderness.

Ah. No woman

Boss, your clothes are so green today.

The astrology show that wearing green today

19

will make me popular.

20

Especially

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,280
popular with Leos.

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,660
Xiao Yichuan is a Leo.

Yes.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,240
I really don't understand what you two are doing.

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,890
He's already here.

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,800
Let me introduce myself.

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,970
My name is Dong Shi.

35
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,480
The ID of my game account is CEO.

36

I'm Pisces. Blood type B.

I'm the first signed member of our team.

38

I remember it was an auspicious day.

39

Chuan and Xiong Jiujiu

40
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,900
are both fire signs.

41
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,610
They're complementary to me, a water sign.

42
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,860
When we are together,

43
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,260
we are the harmonization of fire and water.

there will be huge breakthroughs and changes this year.

I guess they will happen in our team.

50
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:09,770
Tian,

51
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,540

52
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,970
you will lucky enough to meet a great helper this year.

53

He might be one of you.

This is

my data for the past six months.

57

My Kill/Death Ratio is finally up to six.

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Almost the same as Hong Yang.

for listening.

61
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,650
So the reason why I had to work overtime every day

62
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,820
is that you were practicing single?

63
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,270
Boss,

64
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,060
are you

65
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,820
bullying an intern?

66
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,570
Why is my brand dirty?

67
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,100
Forget it.

68
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,030
Don't mind the cactus.

69
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,540
Today,

70
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,220

71

Applause!

73
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,820
Great! Great!

74

It's fate that bring us together.

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,630
I like to be with like-minded people.

76
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,470
Although the E-sports department has just been established,

77
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,740
and is still small,

78
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,780
I believe that if we bear in mind the spirit of sports

79
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,110
and our original intention of E-sports,

80
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,960
our team

81
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,550

Besides,

84
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,530
I'd like to thank Capt. Qin and Chuan for joining us.

85
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,900
With you guys,

86
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,159
the future of our team is full of hope.

88
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,280

89
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,420
has almost finished decoration.

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,210
I've consulted the lunar calendar.

91
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
Tomorrow is a very good day.

92
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,730
How about formally moving in tomorrow?

93
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,420
I can!

94
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,030
I can stay at the base.

95
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
But I might go home frequently.

96
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,770
Okay.

97
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,420
I'll pick you up at school tomorrow.

98
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,040
OK.

99
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,720
Chuan, are you okay with it?

100
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,420
Sure.

101
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,990
Come and help me pack up tomorrow.

102
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,520
Me?

103
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,320
Any problems?

104
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,500
No, no problem.

105
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,080
Thank you, manager.

106
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,030
That's all for today. Dismissed.

107
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,659
So did you find a team member

108
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
or a father?

109
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,460

113
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,350
Come early tomorrow.

114
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,900
Let's go.

115
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,170
It's been a long time

116
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,050
since we last drank together.

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,670
You really don't miss me?

118
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,540
I have lost contact

119
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,700
with the old friends.

120
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,470
After all, it was an unpleasant departure.

121
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,410
But you're always my captain.

122
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:49,150
Go ULT!

123
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,520
Team ULT is at the bottom of the mountain.

124
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,110
In order to get favorable terrain

125
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,120
and view advantage,

126
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,470
will they choose to take risks

127
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,120
for higher points?

128
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,330
We can see that Team Ice

129
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,260
is guarding against Team Wave with guns.

130
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,310
The ambush is good.

131
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,370
Their locations are not exposed.

132
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,820
Now Team ULT and Team Ice are in a stalemate.

133
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,820
The position of Team ULT is not favorable.

134
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,650
But they are strong enough

135
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,950
to battle against Team Ice on a one-to-one basis.

136
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,909
They still have hope to win this round.

137
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,880
But as we can see,

138
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,140
ULT doesn't seem to have noticed

139
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,530
Team Wave, who is ambushing on the side.

140
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,700
They should be careful.

141
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,190
Just attack.

142
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,980
Chuan, go from the left.

143
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,740
The rest will go from the front after him.

144
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,810
I'll cover at the rear.

145
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,040
There are many parachutes

146
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,970
in Team Ice.

147
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,020
I'm afraid there's an ambush.

148
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,200
There's no time to wait.

149
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,480
The side terrain is complicated.

150
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,460
-Once noticed, we don't have chance to... -Just go. Don't waste time.

151
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,940
Go!

152
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,910
Team Wave starts to take action.

153
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,580
Now Team ULT is going straight

154
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,650
to the middle of Team Ice and Team Wave.

155
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,460
Are they going to

156
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,520
be encircled?

157
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,710
The defending champion Team ULT

158
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,020
is annihilated unexpectedly.

159
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,270
It's the biggest unexpected defeat!

160
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,340
We won!

161
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,090
A three-time champion suffered a setback.

162
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,700
You had to take all the loss of the team.

163
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,500
I still regret

164
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,200
I didn't stay in the preparation room.

165
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,960
It was my fault.

166
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,190
We shouldn't have lost.

167
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,620
What are you talking about?

168
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,400
Forget about the past.

169
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,030
Now,

170
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,810
I'm happy

171
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,150
to reunite.

172
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:37,920
Cheers.

Capt. Qin was fired.

176
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,240
The boss said he didn't lead the team well.

177
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,450
Capt. Qin didn't even defend himself.

178
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,730
Where did you go?

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,840
Where were you

180
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,560
when the captain needs you?

181
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,270
Forget it.

182
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,770
Nothing will change even if Chuan is here.

183
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,460
Capt. Qin likes him the most.

184
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,650
What is he doing at the critical moment?

185
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,030
Did he say something for Capt. Qin?

186
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,810
Mr. Liu.

187
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,810
It's not fair to fire Capt. Qin

188
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,190
just because of a competition.

189
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,820
You think the performance of the last round

190
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,350
has no problem?

191
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,590
We are all to blame for it.

192
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,380
No, I'm the biggest problem.

193
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,100
I didn't do my best in sortie.

194
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,490
Why didn't you fire me?

195
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,090
Chuan,

196
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,290
we've listened to the recording within the team.

197
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,540
The decision to fire Qin Zheng

198
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,390
was made by

199
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,930
all managers of the company

200
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,150
after careful consideration.

201
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,540
Just do what you should do.

202
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,350
I still remember in ULT

203
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,660
you're the one who criticized me the most

204
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,820
and the one who treat me the best.

205
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,520
After you left,

206
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,250
no one has ever trained me like that.

207
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,220
So,

208
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,960
I came here

209
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,790
for only one reason.

210
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,220
I want to feel

211
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,970
the fear of being controlled by the devil captain.

212
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,750
Oh, no.

213
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,500
You are the devil coach now.

214
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,120
Now we are in the same team.

215
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,200
We can be together again.

216
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,660
Great.

217
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,370
Good.

218
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,000
We can

219
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,170
bring back another trophy.

220
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,120
But I'm curious.

221
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,320
If you want to come back,

222
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,220
you should have many choices.

223
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,760
Why did you choose this new team?

224
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,040
It's stressful to buy a house and get married.

225
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,940
Good wages and a coincidence.

226
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,490
No way.

227
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,610
Our first E-sports master

228
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,070
is still under pressure to buy a house?

229
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,740
It's a

230
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,190
Gunara dark magic reality.

231
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,690
Is this some game skill?

232
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,330
Balala the Fairies.

233
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,590
Well,

234
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,600
I'm just showing my girly side

235
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,000
in front of Capt. Qin.

236
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,790
Cheers.

237
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,030
You have three minutes

238
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,000
to pack your stuff and move out.

239
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,810
I don't want to eat.

240
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,080
I'm not thirsty.

241
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,470
Chuan,

242
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,190
this is the first time you clean up our house.

243
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,860
Did something happen?

244
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,640
Is today a special day?

245
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,920
What else do you want to do?

246
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,240
Let me do it.

247
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,940
You can't come.

248
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,190
You have to go.

249
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,380
You joined the team to mess with me,

250
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:57,910
right?

251
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,310
Do as promised.

252
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,770
It is

253
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,870
the only standard

254
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,980
to determine whether I will

255
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,200
stay in this team.

256
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
It should be strictly executed.

257
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,450
You've been trying to throw yourself on me.

258
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,880
Are you craving for my body?

259
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,740
Are you crazy?

260
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,940
Go away.

261
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,560
Handle with care.

262
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,820
Take these two pairs of shoes.

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,710
Enough?

264
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,760
Take all the shoes on the wall of my room.

265
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,130
Since you stay at the training base every day

266
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,920
and never go out,

267
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,620
why did you take so many shoes?

268
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,570
Sneakers are my sister.

269
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,599
You can work with your brother.

270
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,859
Why can't I work with my sisters?

271
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,550
Hey, handle with care, understand?

272
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,020
Pack all the books on the first layer

273
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:19,790
of the bookshelf in my study.

274
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,980
Are you going for training or on vacation?

275
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,430
Why do you bring so many comic books?

276
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,450
To read before bed.

277
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,950
Or can you coax me to sleep?

278
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,030
I think you're a big baby.

279
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,670
Then please be a good babysitter.

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,760
Don't step on my sister.

281
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,890
OK.

282
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,290
Come in.

283
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,960
Put your luggage here.

284
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,040
Let me show you.

285
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,790
Our base

286
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,900
is facing south.

287
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,840
It's square and full of yang energy.

288
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,250
It hides the wind and gathers the energy.

289
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,630
These designs

290
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,430
and decorations

291
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,610
were all checked by the feng shui master.

292
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,440
Very good.

293
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,260
The first floor is our training

294
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,220
and living area.

295
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
The second floor and third floor are your rooms.

296
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,610
Separating working and resting areas

297
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,950
is good for fortune.

298
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,300
And our house

299
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,860
is 16.6 meters tall,

300
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,190
which symbolizes the success

301
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,370
and prosperity of our team.

302
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,030
So professional.

303
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,950
Of course.

304
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,550
Capt. Qin, take a look.

305
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,250
What's the configuration of the computers?

306
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,290
I7-10700k CPU.

307
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,140
The graphics card is RTX 2080Ti.

308
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,330
Eight cores and 16 threads.

309
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,140
Standard configuration.

310
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,390
If we have enough budget,

311
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,750
we can upgrade the RAM.

312
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,290
OK.

313
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,300
As for the peripheral device,

314
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,390
I assembled it according to my preference.

315
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,530
It's not the top configuration,

316
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,500
but they are all good.

317
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,460
Because it depends on their habits.

318
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,580
I don't know if they will bring their own peripheral devices.

319
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,090
The peripheral device of a professional team,

320
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,050
from the displayer

321
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,200
to the mouse cushion, should be perfect.

322
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,190
I'll talk to them later.

323
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:48,820
Okay.

324
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,060
Look at the chair I bought.

325
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,900
The same chair as Team SIK.

326
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,220
The seat of the king.

327
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,180
As for the location of seats,

328
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,820
I imitated

329
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,060
Mars, the world champion.

330
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,880
That seat is mine.

331
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,940
I've tidied up.

332
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,430
You can choose the rest.

333
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,640
The SIK chair is really good.

334
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,100
This year,

335
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,340
our main task is

336
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,860
TLO Global League.

337
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,100
We can sign up next week.

338
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,670
The competition will be fierce this year.

339
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,340
During the play-in match,

340
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,490
these are our main opponents.

341
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,050
They are all veteran teams.

342
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,900
Of course, besides them,

343
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,500
there's one more.

344
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,080
ON.

345
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,180
This team

346
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:35,930
is

347
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,020
my least favorite team,

348
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,080
but this year,

349
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,880
they have four newcomers this year.

350
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,910
And they are all geniuses.

351
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,180
But it doesn't matter.

352
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,890
We also have the strongest player of the alliance, Xiao Yichuan.

353
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,440
So now,

354
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,230
our team's weakness is our newcomers.

355
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,700
We need to practice more

356
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,430
to keep up.

357
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,340
I've been studying

358
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,750
the gun-forcing video of Chuan.

359
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,850
If I can be half as good as him one day,

360
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,520
my life will be fulfilled.

361
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,870
Have some confidence in yourself.

362
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,420
Chuan is here.

363
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,000
Now I have confidence.

364
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:06,980
Take a look.

365
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,470
Do I need to add anything?

366
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,860
You did a good job.

367
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,480
But I'm not interested in studying others.

368
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,560
I'll sit here.

369
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,060
Please clean up, manager.

370
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,480
Alright.

371
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,790
It's okay. Go to clean up.

372
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,820
Listen to me, please.

373
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,650
There are six rooms

374
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,760
in our base.

375
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,990
The room on the third floor is the biggest.

376
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,030
That's my room.

377
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,610
There are five rooms with similar size on the second floor.

378
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,360
They all have fine decorations. Pick whatever you want.

379
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,220
Come on.

380
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,360
I'm the boss. Can't I have a privilege?

381
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
It's so awkward.

382
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,280
I'll just pick up a random room.

383
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,620
As for you guys,

384
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,620
since we are a team,

385
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,150
let's choose our rooms

386
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,080
in an E-sports way.

387
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,170
Is there a private bathroom in the big room?

388
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,110
Yes.

389
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,470
If I win,

390
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,460
I'll give you the room.

391
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,920
You don't need to participate.

392
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,460
OK.

393
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,740
If you don't participate, sleep in the kitchen.

394
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,220
There are no exceptions for E-sports competition.

395
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,640
I'll participate.

396
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,970
It's not embarrassing to lose anyway.

397
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,940
I think it works.

398
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,920
Come on, let's start a battle.

399
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,150
It doesn't matter which room I live in.

400
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,900
I just want to learn from you.

401
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,810
Xiong Jiujiu, sit there.

402
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,080
Okay.

403
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,670
Find a lawn next to the school, lie down and don't move.

404
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll be with you.

405
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,420
OK.

406
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,950
Keep alive for ten minutes.

407
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,110
It's not good to be blindly confident.

408
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,740
Come on.

410

It's so awkward.

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,240
Chu Tian has been using this gun.

415
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,550
It's his idiosyncrasy.

416
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,710
He only uses domestic guns.

417
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,040
The first time I saw his operating video,

418
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,750
he used a 95 Rifle to the last.

419
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,570
Eleven seconds to kick four out.

420
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,050
I thought it was a synthesized video.

421
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,380
Amazing.

anyone can play E-sports.

I've seen many people like you.

Don't take E-sports as a joke.

The one surviving to the end

is not necessarily the winner.

443
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,750
The result of a game depends on the data.

444
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,290
Before the game,

445

nobody made it a rule.

446
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,140
So, whoever survives to the end is the winner.

You said my brother is a bear!

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,060
I did something

521
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,390
wrong...

522
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,250
Calm down.

523
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,300
Calm down.

524
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,580
Don't do anything stupid for a room.

525
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,719
Even if you win, it'll be a Pyrrhic victory.

526
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,489
We'll both suffer.

527
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:20,860
Cut the crap.

528
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,100
I have nothing to say to you.

529
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,040
Give me the key.

530
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,690
No?

531
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:32,730
I'll count.

532
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,960
Three.

533
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,110
Two.

534
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,360
One.

535
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:41,830
I forgot a package.

536
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,780
Let go of me!

537
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:43,449
Let go of me!

538
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,450
Why is there no one in this room?

539
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,140
How can I sleep at night?

540
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,280
Am I going to play with my phone until dawn?

541
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,740
Are you okay?

542
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,510
[Three years ago]

543
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,240
I think there is an accident ahead.

544
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,810
The back is blocked too.

545
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,660
I think it will take a long time.

546
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,540
How much is it?

547
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,170
I'll give you the money.

548
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:39,860
I'll walk there myself.

549
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,230
It's quite far.

550
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,270
Fifty. Right.

551
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,980
Thank you.

552
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,610
Is that you?

553
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,160
I thought

554
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,450
you would never show up again.

555
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,970
Have you seen the message

556
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
I sent you?

557
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,300
It's my fault that I didn't show up that day.

558
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,810
You have disappeared for so long.

559
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,180
You're avoiding me on purpose, aren't you?

560
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,840
Why do you show up now?

561
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,440
Handle with care, understand?
