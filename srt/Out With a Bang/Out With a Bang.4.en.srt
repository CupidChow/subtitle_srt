serious?

00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,780
I like listening to firecrackers?

Chu Tian, you finally came back.

Where have you been?

16
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,940
I just made your bed.

17
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,300
You...

18
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,020
Hi.

19
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,390
So you went to kidnap a girl.

20
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,259
You just got off work?

21
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,910
Don't mention it.

22
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,380
It's better to be a student.

23
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,690
I'm exhausted.

24
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,220
How long has it been since you came to my home?

25
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,240
Try my design later. It will be launched next month.

26
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,890
The internship is totally different from what I thought.

Not to mention the intensity of work,

28
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,470
my boss is like a monk.

29
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,310
He keeps nagging every day.

30
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,210
which almost drives me crazy.

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,020
Do you expect to meet

32
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,450
such a considerate boss.

33
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,860
Here, have some water.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,320
Thank you.

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,180
Alright, Chu Tian, go take a shower.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,850
How many times have you stood me up?

37
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,170
Aren't you just an intern?

38
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,870
Are you busier than the boss?

39
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,160
You are right.

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,220
I'm the only employee in our E-sports department.

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,579
I have to do all the tough works.

42
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,829
Our boss does business due to his passion and enthusiasm.

43
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,400
He can generate power because of love.

44
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,740
It's rare to see such person.

45
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,160
But the problem is

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,660
there are only two people in your E-sports team.

47
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,860
What are you busy with every day?

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,980
I'm busy establishing a team,

49
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,700
and discovering proper teammates.

50
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,140
I don't know what my boss is thinking.

51
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,140
It's OK to establish a team.

52
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,080
But why did he have to call for a team-splitting freak?

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,110
What a coincidence.

54
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,900
I know this person.

55
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,770
Enemies are bound to meet.

56
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,550
Do you remember I livestreamed

57
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,420

58
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,060
Yes.

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,140
You're on the hot search.

60
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,910
Is he your rumored boyfriend

61
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,740
who helped you play games?

62
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,550
What? Rumored boyfriend? Are you crazy?

63
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,430
Didn't you tell me you were disparaged by his fans?

64
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,900
So I looked into it.

65
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,750
Guess what?

66
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,350
What?

67
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,340
He's handsome.

68
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,410
Chu Tian, do you have any sympathy?

69
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,260
My boss is weird.

70
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,050
He calls me 800 times a day.

71
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,130
I have a headache.

72
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,540
Do you see the inhibition I wear on my head?

73
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,660
The problem is

74
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,579
you don't major in E-sports.

75
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,780
Since it's so hard,

76
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,510
you can just change another company of your internship.

77
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,860
I've only been working for a few days. If I change my job now,

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,780
I will look like a coward and a loser.

79
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,440
I can't be a deserter.

80
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,460
But...

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,690
it's better to be at school.

82
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,370
At least there's a qualified line for everything I do.

83
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,180
Look, when I start to work,

84
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,350
I have a boss like a vampire.

85
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,940
And an opponent who is also a backstabber.

86
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,700
He's a real psycho.

87
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,960
All right.

101
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,909
The boss appointed one.

102
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,580
But he refused to join.

103

He's just out of his mind.

He has to listen to me.

Mr. Dong.

174
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,830
Where did you get the video?

175
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,910
Tell me.

176
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,750
Did you use high-tech technology

177
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,620
to edit the video and deceive me,

178
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,820
so that you don't need to find Xiao Yichuan.

179
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,430
Mr. Dong,

180
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,290
You can doubt my ability,

181
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,220
but please

182
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,820
don't question my moral standing.

183
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,090
I compared his data.

184
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,380
He only took 11 seconds

185
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,400
to eliminate four people with a 95 Rifle.

186
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,660
Wang Boyu still needs eight seconds.

187
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,460
It's so fake.

188
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,280
Who are you lying to?

189
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:17,890
I...

190
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,980
You can see it in person.

191
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:24,790
Let's go.

192
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,610
I'll send you to work.

193
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,550
Chu Tian, stop!

194
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,020
No one can control you, right?

195
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,090
Interesting.

196
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,810
There's a bug here.

197
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,210
Oh, no.

198
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,490
I don't know.

199
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,670
I'm afraid of it.

200
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,540
Oh.

201
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,860
No, I can't.

202
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,450
The lunar calendar said I'm lucky today.

203
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,740
I can't kill.

204
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,510
How can a man be afraid of bugs?

205
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,260
Heroine.

206
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,700
Let's be friends on WeChat.

207
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,190
No, thanks.

208
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,580
Please.

209
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,630
Be happy.

210
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,820
Let's squeeze in.

211
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,540
Hurry up.

212
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,200
One more.

213
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,260
Come on.

214
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,370
Come on.

215
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,870
You can get on too.

216
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,690
So awkward.

217
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,880
Hello.

218
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,630
Let's start.

219
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Please take a look at the base first,

220
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,670
and get familiar with the environment.

221
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,190
If there's anything you're not satisfied,

222
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,190
feel free to tell me.

223
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,430
I only care about training and competition.

224
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,330
I see.

225
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,030
Well,

226
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,540
let me introduce

227
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,730
our current team members,

228
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,270
and your future teammates.

229
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,830
The two sitting opposite were just

230
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,460
transferred from the Jump Team

231
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,410
to our Whelk Team this year.

232
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,930
They have been working as professional players for two years.

233
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,020
The other kids

234
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,020
are just recruited

235
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,270
from the youth training camp.

236
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,140
The ones with weaker ability will be the substitutes.

237
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,130
Here's what I think.

238
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,110
When the team is established,

239
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,390
Panda will be the commander.

240
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,140
He used to be the commander

241
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,560
for two years in Jump Team.

242
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,920
He's familiar with Seven next to him.

243
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,530
It's easier for them to cooperate.

244
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,570
When Seven attacked the building, he kept emphasizing output,

245
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,130
and blocked his teammate's shooting route.

246
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,300
But this commander Panda

247
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,500
didn't get the new output position in time,

248
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,470
and didn't arrange the remote suppression.

249
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,890
I'm afraid I can't cooperate with him

250
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,540
if he's the commander.

251
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,430
I know you are a player who have talents

252
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,490
and strong ability.

253
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,350
So I only obey commanders whose ability is stronger than mine.

254
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,110
Have some water.

255
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
The speed and shooting accuracy are not as good as his opponent.

256
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,430
The shooting route is failed to be stretched.

257
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,890
If they continue to play like this,

258
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,660
your four players

259
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,850
might be all killed

260
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,060
by the opposite side.

261
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,660
According to the calendar, I'll be so lucky today.

262
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,190
It's really accurate.

263
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,940
Boss,

264
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,520
someone is looking for Xiong Jiujiu at the reception.

265
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,910
She said she's Chu Tian's sister.

266
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,230
And you are Chu Tian's sister?

267
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,630
I'm Dong Shi.

268
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,570
I'm the manager here.

269
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,350
Thanks for your help downstairs.

270
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,780
You're the boss of Xiong Jiujiu?

271
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,610
Then I'll be honest with you.

272
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,580
I don't know much about this industry.

273
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,980
I don't want my brother to play games every day.

274
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,100
I understand how you feel as a sister.

275
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,730
But,

276
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,490
E-sports is not playing games.

277
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,780
Here.

278
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,780
E-sports is

279
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,100
the 78th national sports competition.

280
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,020
You should consider our industry the same as sports.

281
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,880
So Chu Tian will be an athlete.

282
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,620
It's objective if you think this way.

283
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,060
So you agree to accept me?

284
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,010
I didn't say "yes" yet.

285
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,630
How could you be so hasty?

286
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,680
You accepted him after watching him playing a game?

287
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,590
Although Chu Tian didn't practice much,

288
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,160
his data

289
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,230
is almost professional.

290
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,770
Besides, the account I logged in

291
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,440
for him

292
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,319
is an ex-professional player's.

293
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,099
Chu Tian joined the foursome alone.

294
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,420
Without a matching teammate, he defeated them all.

295
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,800
He's definitely qualified

296
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,349
to take it a try.

297
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,060
And he's good at shooting and his movement is rapid.

298
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,599
Most importantly, he's very active in the battle.

299
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,030
I don't understand what you're saying.

300
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,880
But my brother is not suitable for this industry.

301
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,079
Without the judge of talent, there's no a thorough-bred horse.

302
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,500
No matter how great his potential is,

303
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,000
it needs to be discovered and cultivated, right?

304
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,840
This is our application document of E-sports

305
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,280
and these are the relevant approval files.

306
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,530
This is the team members' contract.

307
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,340
The pay offer is on page nine.

308
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,260
The salary has nothing to do

309
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,850
with my permission.

310
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,040
I won't let my brother play games.

311
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,290
Let me emphasize again.

312
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,180
E-sports is not playing games.

313
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,430
Becoming an E-sports player can bring glory to the country.

314
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,930
I don't need him to bring glory to the country.

315
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,140
As long as he finds a reliable and stable job,

316
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,250
I'm relieved.

317
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,100
Being an E-sports player

318
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,320
is reliable and stable.

319
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,100
To be honest,

320
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,940
the team I want to establish

321
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,280
is a very professional and powerful team.

322
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,660
In the future, we'll win

323
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,930
all kinds of competitions.

324
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,100
-Besides, you know... -Excuse me, Mr. Dong.

325
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,060
Can I talk to my brother alone?

326
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,490
Sure.

327
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,540
Of course.

328
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,060
You can have my office.

329
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,140
You can talk here.

330
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,190
Take your time.

331
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,170
Talk it through.

332
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,280
Let's go.

333
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,770
What do you mean, Chu Tian?

334
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,860
You made such a big decision,

335
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,090
without discussing with me?

336
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,520
Did the family raise you up

337
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,270
to let you play games?

338
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,650
I'm a professional E-sports player.

339
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,190
Okay.

340
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,030
A professional E-sports player.

341
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,780
I don't know about this.

342
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,240
But you are my brother.

343
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,070
I know you well.

344
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,220
You didn't come here

345
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,410
because you like E-sports.

346
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,100
You came here because you like Xiong Jiujiu.

347
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,240
You never wanted to

348
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,990
to be a professional E-sports player.

349
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,070
Last night when Xiong Jiujiu mentioned it,

350
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,700
you came here today.

351
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,340
Chu Tian,

352
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,740
I won't allow you

353
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,440
to treat your future so casually.

354
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,910
And I need to talk to you

355
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,590
about Xiong Jiujiu.

356
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,730
She has someone else in her heart.

357
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,670
You knew it.

358
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,990
So I didn't take your affection for her

359
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,360
seriously.

360
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,590
But if you make such an important decision today,

361
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,620
I have to tell you...

362
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,660
It doesn't matter who she has in her heart.

363
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,860
Chu, the romance expert, let me tell you something.

364
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,390
There's should be a limit for one-sided love.

365
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,540
You regard her as your moonlight.

366
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,920
But she only treats you as her younger brother and friend.

367
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,340
Even if I ask you to confess her now,

368
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,400
can you say it out?

369
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,740
Xiong Jiujiu is my best friend.

370
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,540
You are my brother.

371
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,830
You are all my family.

372
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,380
So as for your affection for her,

373
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,370
I can only stay silent and stay out of it.

374
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,340
I respect you.

375
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,500
But I hope you can respect

376
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,580
your future.

377
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,830
I don't deny that I came here because of her,

378
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,100
but not only for her.

379
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,110
I did some research on Geek Sports.

380
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,750
I don't think this is

381
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,800
a valueless chance.

382
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,820
I don't want to live

383
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,220
within the frames and rules set by others.

384
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,740
Everyone's life is unique,

385
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,750
right?

386
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,580
When you decided to resign and start an online store,

387
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,000
our family didn't agree.

388
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,290
That's different.

389
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,500
Do you think

390
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,510
it's an ordinary job?

391
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,340
It's the job that ordinary people can't do.

392
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,540
If he's willing to sign me,

393
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,260
that means I'm capable

394
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,470
to do this job.

395
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,820
Let me try.

396
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,370
Okay?

397
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,510
But I still think...

398
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,770
I'll prove my ability within one sports competition season.

399
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,110
Okay?

400
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,070
We have to get Xiao Yichuan.

401
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,140
This is your KPI.

402
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,880
This is not my KPI.

403
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,150
You're killing me!

404
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,260
I'm leaving.

405
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,110
Let me see you off.

406
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,740
I'll see you off.

407
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,800
How can I

408
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,940
get Xiao Yichuan?

409
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,720
Qin Zheng.

410
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,840
The first master of Chinese E-sports history.

411
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,460
He led the ULT Team and won

412
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,160
two National Championships.

413
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,620
He also trained many excellent players

414
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,490
for the ULT Team,

415
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,050
for example, the well-known Xiao Yichuan.

416
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
Qin Zheng is Xiao Yichuan's most respected senior.

417
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,430
The two of them only competed once before.

418
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,370
Unfortunately, Qin Zheng lost the game.

419
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,250
This game made the ULT Team lose three consecutive champions.

420
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,990
Qin Zheng retired after the game.

421
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,510
Half a year later, Xiao Yichuan

422
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,080
took over the ULT Team and became the new generation of E-sports guru,

423
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,910
who took the path of splitting the team.

424
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,340
You're in charge of the article post

425
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,090
of our official account next month, right?

426
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,320
Yes.

427
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,730
Xiao Yichuan has been very popular recently.

428
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,250
Many users are gossiping about him.

429
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,920
Why don't we write about him too?

430
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,900
Let me think about it.

431
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,460
The theme of this topic can be

432
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,170
"Going across the sea just to regain love.

433
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,370
Xiao Yichuan is in deep love, with the disguise of his unrestrained appearance".

434
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,110
He has been back from aboard for a while.

435
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,320
It's not suitable.

436
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,670
Then how about this one.

437
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,900
"A sweet lover or an enemy?

438
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,700
Reveal of Xiao Yichuan's secret affair."

439
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,670
This is good.

440
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,080
There's a gimmick and an explosive point.

441
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,370
This gossip

442
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,410
has been clarified by the girl on Weibo.

443
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,300
No.

444
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,810
Who cares if she clarified it or not?

445
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,620
As long as Xiao Yichuan is still popular,

446
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,380
they are all writing about this topic.

447
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,300
Why don't we?

448
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,260
We have so many materials

449
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,790
to satisfy their imagination.

450
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,340
It'll be good.

451
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,310
Imagination is acceptable.

452
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,190
I'm afraid they'll make things up.

453
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,190
What do you mean?

454
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,380
The one Zhang wrote

455
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,150
"Why does Xiao Yichuan, the former E-sports guru,

456
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,040
attend a wild race?"

457
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,720
Do you remember?

458
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,350
It's over 100,000 views.

459
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:12,780
Qin,

460
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,290
we did that post

461
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,070
because we wanted you

462
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,340
to dig some materials

463
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,560
through your personal relationship with Xiao Yichuan.

464
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,780
But you told me

465
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,840
you were doing a topic

466
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,550
and couldn't spare time.

467
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,070
Do you think

468
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,190
you should

469
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,590
find Xiao Yichuan for some information this time?

470
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,200
I didn't contacted Chuan frequently these years.

471
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,720
And the life of an E-sports player is simple.

472
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,450
They train for more than ten hours a day.

473
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,540
They don't have time to do anything else.

474
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,720
I can't write

475
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,580
this report without any prove.

476
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,270
What?

477
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,440
Do you want to quit your job?

478
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,100
Since netizens like it,

479
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,920
we have to write it.

480
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,610
Understand?

481
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,110
Excuse me.

482
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,980
I need to answer a call.

483
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:05,750
Hello?

484
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,960
Geek Sports?

485
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,470
We are very determined

486
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,770
to establish the E-sports team.

487
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,560
Look, these are our related materials.

488
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,720
This page

489
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,150
is the future plan of our team.

490
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,700
Are you preparing for the Global League Tournament?

491
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,780
Yes.

492
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,590
This is our recent plan.

493
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,190
You can read the page 12.

494
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,920
It contains our potential team members,

495
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,180
which includes your acquaintance, Xiao Yichuan.

496
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,790
We're discussing the intention of cooperation with him.

497
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,430
If you can join our team,

498
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,960
it'll be a cooperation

499
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,390
between you and Xiao Yichuan three years later.

500
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,460
It's very meaningful.

501
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,030
Chuan hasn't attended any competition

502
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,170
for half a year, right?

503
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,600
Yes.

504
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,220
I know his temper.

505
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,180
He won't join

506
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,380
a team casually.

507
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,550
Can you tell me more?

508
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,020
Chuan cares about

509
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,740
whether the team focuses on E-sports itself.

510
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,180
And those teams

511
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,340
that only see his business value

It's a deal. Let's sign the contract with all these items in.

683
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,460
If you can join our team,

684
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,410
I'll listen to you on work too.

685
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,350
Look.

686
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,650
You are so professional.

687
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,920
You'll be the commander and team leader.

688
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,710
After I join the team,

689
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,880
if I just eat and drink without training,

690
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,110
is that okay?

691
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,820
This is too much.

692
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,360
You can skip training.

693
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,820
Yes, you can.

694
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,930
You just need to

695
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,980
attend the competition.

696
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,460
Have a seat.

697
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,090
You are the main player of our team.

698
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,980
The chief player. The most popular one.

699
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,720
Popular?

700
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,500
You mean

701
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,090
I have to make contribution

702
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,930
to the commercial value for the team?

703
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,390
No, no.

704
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,630
On the business cooperation and advertising endorsement of the team,

705
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,170
we respect your decision very much.

706
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,910
If you don't want to show up in public,

707
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,380
we won't force you.

708
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,120
The aim that we invite you here

709
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,960
is to compete.

710
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,230
That's the most important thing.

711
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,400
And our boss said

712
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,900
he didn't establish a team for making money,

713
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,180
but to show his love and respect

714
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,780
to E-sports.

715
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,940
Okay.

716
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,330
I'll think about it.

717
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,280
After all that I said,

718
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,660
you just want to think about it?

719
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,430
[Geek Sports Ltd]

720
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,430
[Coach Employment Contract]

721
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,040
Are you happy with it?

722
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,040
This is the coach the team hired for you.

723
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,120
Qin Zheng.

724
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,050
Didn't you say

725
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,040
that I wasn't sincere enough?

726
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,580
This time,

727
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,420
I came with my sincerity.

728
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,090
You asked me

729
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,290
why you should join our team.

730
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,980
Let me tell you now.

731
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,040
Because no matter how strong a lone wolf is,

732
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,270
it has to go back to the wolf pack

733
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,420
sooner or later.

734
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,100
We have the same goals.

735
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,010
We should keep going to achieve our goals.

736
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,760
The goal is firm and we are determined.

737
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,820
This is our team.

738
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,070
A manager can't achieve his goal by his smooth talking.

739
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,150
I've revised the proposal.

740
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,070
Please have a look.

741
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,110
Who is this?

742
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,600
Why is there no data?

743
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,150
My brother.

744
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,560
The one I mentioned before.

745
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,660
He's good at shooting.

746
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,090
The one who plays the balloon shooting?

747
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,200
What if I don't get along with him?

748
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,710
As his sister,

749
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,800
can you be fair?

750
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,950
My brother has a good temper.

751
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,280
He won't take it to heart.

752
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,330
You're the guru of our team.

753
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,490
We will all

754
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,190
love and respect you.

755
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,060
Will you?

756
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,140
It's my duty.

757
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,960
Am I that important to you?

758
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,720
Of course.

759
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,840
Do you want to have breakfast here?

760
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,410
I'll bring it to you now.

761
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,380
Wait a second.

762
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,170
I see.

763
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,280
Just wait.

764
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,530
She deliberately dirtied her clothes

765
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,230
and used my bathroom,

766
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,720
so that she can wear my clothes

767
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,450
and live in my room.

768
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,790
What an old plot of the idol drama.

769
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:14,460
Since you can't live without me,

770
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,550
let's give each other a chance.

771
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,540
What? I can't hold it anymore.

772
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,440
Xiong Jiujiu is inside.

773
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,890
You're efficient.

774
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,340
Hi.

775
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,060
Yellow makes you look fair.

776
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,060
Thank you, guru.

777
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,930
You didn't allow me to wear it before.

778
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,480
She wants to wear mine.

779
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,540
You're so intimate.

780
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,560
Hello, boss.

781
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,900
I really worked hard.

782
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,070
Not really.

783
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,830
I got Xiao Yichuan!
