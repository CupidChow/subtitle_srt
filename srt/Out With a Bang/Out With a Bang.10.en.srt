we planned to meet

202
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,900
was the day he lost the competition

in which he made his debut as a ULT Team member.

204

He had his reasons.

actually,

a computer

would open the live stream app by itself.

222
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,100
And that video

223
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,220
was maliciously edited.

224

It was not that serious.

You think you're a big shot now just after signing a live stream contract?

226

The company doesn't expect

349
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,940
try the shredded potato I made for you.

350
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,820
And your favorite

351
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,460
braised eggplant.

352
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,140
Enough, mom.

353
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,220
I'm so full.

354
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,420
A young man like you

355
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,020
shouldn't be full from just eating so little.

358

359
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,860
Son.

360
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,620
Yes?

361
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:45,820
Have you thought about

362
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,900

363
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,060
It's difficult to get an appointment

364
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060

Ya told me

368

370

371

402

The competition is coming.

414
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,339
If I they know about it,

415
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,820

I will try my best to communicate with him

I will persuade him.

431
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,460
Definitely.

432
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,540
The team

433
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,260
doesn't have much luck in money recently.

434
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,660

435
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,500
It's just fate.

436

I can't force it.

437

438
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,500
Still at the bottom.

439

440

Is anyone still reposting?

441
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:41,980
Yes.

442
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,140
But

443
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,620
it's much better than before.

444
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,130
It's not only because of bad luck in money.

445
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,660

Yes.

So you're interested in hiding in the room

696
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,740
and watching Wang Boyu's live stream?

697
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:18,810
OK.

698
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,780
I'll take it as you admire me.

699
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,860
You can learn anything from me,

700
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,500
but you just learned my disobedience.

701
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,340
Remember,

702
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,180
don't be emotional in training.

703
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,570
Otherwise,

704
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,410
an E-sports talent like you

705
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,820
will be ruined by me.

706
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,540
Are you two ready?

707
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,820
Hurry up.

708
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,460
It's just an apology.

709
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,340
So smug.

710
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,060
Be good today.

711
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,900
Do you hear me?

712
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,540
Our director is going to

713
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,500
a commercial shoot today.

714
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,540
Please wait

715
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,220
for him here.

716
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:00,900
Thank you.

717
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,940
We can wait here.

718
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,340
Okay.

719
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,810
I'll go check

720
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,700
if the director is done.

721
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,290
Thank you.

722
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,330
Thank you.

723

Wearing high heels

724
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,610

725
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,700
My legs ache so much.

726

Let me get you a chair.

727
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,420
Okay.

728
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,690
This place is really big.

729
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,900
Yeah.

730
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,130
Chu Tian, look.

731
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,660
Isn't that the E-sports commentator?

732
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,460
They had

733
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,620
a very popular variety show.

734
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,170
It's the one that Dong Shi and Hong Yang always watch.

735
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,980
Do you remember it?

736
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,730
No.

737
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,380
I watched it before.

738
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,100
What's her name?

739
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,780
I really like her.

740
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,540
She's looking at me.

741
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,490
She looked at me.

742
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,100
She just looked at me.

743
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,900
Give me the chair.

744
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,210
She is walking closer.

745
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,180
She is walking closer.

746
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,940
Sit on this.

747
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,340
Thank you.

748
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,900
Why are you here?

749

Aren't you looking for a chair?

750
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,980
Take mine.

751
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,500
Thanks.

752
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,140
You're welcome.

753
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,260
Have a seat.

754
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,740
Thank you.

755
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,260
You are

756
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,300

Yes.

You know me?

You've been on the trending topic more than once.

Chu Tian, right?

761
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,260
It seems that another Prince Charming is emerging

762
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,500
in the E-sports industry.

763

I’m also a fan of your team.

By the way,

I forgot to introduce myself.

Yes. Yes.

769

I've watched all your variety shows.

770
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,210
I really like you.

Let's take a photo over there.

783
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,100
OK.

Chuan,

I watched

789
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,460
your friendly competition last night.

790
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,450
I texted you in the game.

791
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,620
Why didn't you reply?

792
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
And on your alt account,

793
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,420
you didn't verify my friend request

794
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,300
or reply to my messages.

795
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,940
I don't want to chat.

796
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,810
After you returned to China,

797
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,340
so many clubs want to sign you.

798
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,370
Why did you choose

799
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,020
such an immature team?

800
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,380
Your decision is too hasty.

801
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,700
What's the level of

802
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,860
your previous team?

803

your competence and your dream.

thank you so much

called me so many times.

821

If I

822

keep refusing you,

823
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,020
it would be unreasonable.

If I'm strict with him,

He will jump up and bite me.

he might
