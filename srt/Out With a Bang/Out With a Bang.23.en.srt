1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,550
This is the place

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,420
where I first met you.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,290
It's also where I decided to be

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,710
a professional E-sports player.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,590
That night,

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,340
I received your reply,

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,310
sitting there.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,100
It was your words that encouraged me

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,900
and made me make up my mind.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,270
Xiong Jiujiu.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,340
Yes.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,140
To fight with them

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,820
is what I want to do most now.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,660
Even if

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,510
this may be my last game.

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,390
For all I know,

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,800
there are only three moments

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,950
when I'm possessed by the crazy desire to play.

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,500
Once was when I read your message on the internet café.

21
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,830
Once was when I was on stage

22
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,890
with ULT Team for the first time.

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,380
And the other time

24
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,420
is now.

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,340
Even if your hand will be badly hurt,

26
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,509
you still want to join the game?

27
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,860
Isn't the hand of a professional E-sports player

28
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,620
used for competition?

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,640
It's its mission.

30
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,690
It's also my mission.

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,820
After I met you,

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,680
I went to register at the youth training camp

33
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,300
where I met Wang Boyu.

34
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,540
We trained and studied together every day

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,240
for a few months.

36
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,340
Then I was selected by ULT Team,

37
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,540
and he went to SIK Team.

38
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,470
So why didn't you

39
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,900
go to the same team?

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,320
Of course, it's because he's not as good as me,

41
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,930
and ULT Team didn't want him.

42
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,710
That's a lie.

43
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,090
Because at that time we believed

44
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,579
that we chose different paths

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,190
to reunite better at the top.

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,220
That's a good point.

47
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,950
If it's good,

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,820
then why did you give up NESG?

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,500
It's just a job.

50
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,770
You mentioned that

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,140
you wanted to work for this company after graduation

52
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,780
when we first met.

53
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,280
It's not only because it's a multinational company

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,520
but also you want to understand the sports industry

55
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,170
on a broader platform

56
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,540
and work for it.

57
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,990
I... I don't remember.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,150
I do.

59
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,930
I remember everything you said before.

60
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,920
The future of JR Team

61
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,910
shouldn't be a stumbling block

62
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,220
to your career.

63
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,810
No, it's not.

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,450
I just want to stay…

65
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,540
Hear me out.

66
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,420
We all have dreams.

67
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,100
You do too.

68
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,990
And your dreams

69
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,280
shouldn't be traded for ours.

70
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,660
You fool.

71
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,770
There are many ways to be with us.

72
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,890
We are together because of love,

73
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,180
not the sacrifice for each other.

74
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,500
You need to think about it carefully.

75
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,700
Besides,

76
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,260
playing professionally and winning a championship

77
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,900
are not my ultimate goals in life.

78
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,960
Then what is your ultimate goal in life?

79
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,159
To live off a woman.

80
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,070
What are you talking about?

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,110
Let's go.

82
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,290
Stop walking around.

83
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,110
It's giving me a headache.

84
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,159
Xiao Yichuan, I haven't accused you yet.

85
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,710
You're the first I've seen

86
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,940
who ran down from the operating table.

87
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,190
You've been talking about it all night.

88
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,150
Can this stop here?

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,610
A lifelong hazard of playing with injuries.

90
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,970
A lifelong regret of withdrawing due to the injuries.

91
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,350
Are you finishing a couplet?

92
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,530
I'm not kidding with you.

93
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,460
How to play games with your injured hand?

94
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,340
This is a gift

95
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,220
from my doctor.

96
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,100
I'll make a gift of it for you.

97
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,620
What's this?

98
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,659
A cedar seed.

99
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,490
A cedar seed symbolizes

100
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,980
living from the dead.

101
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,140
This time,

102
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,670
I'm no longer alone.

103
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,080
[Out with a BANG]

104
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,890
[Episode 23]

105
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,090
The strongest overall teams in Group C are the Shark Team

106
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,760
and the UB Team.

107
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,659
But Shark Team is not as good as UB Team in close combat.

108
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,540
If they're poorly positioned in the final round,

109
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,220
they will lose their number advantage.

110
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,740
See?

111
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,659
Shark Team likes to take the first spot to ambush.

112
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,650
Very cautious.

113
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,450
While the Shark Team

114
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,380
is still preparing for a sneak attack,

115
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,740
the UB Team is going straight front.

116
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,740
Hello, Dad?

117
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,070
Here's the dinner.

118
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,340
Okay, I got it.

119
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,040
Come on.

120
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,240
No problem.

121
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:24,840
Ah?

122
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,170
Really?

123
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,740
Okay.

124
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,400
Okay. I'll see you Saturday then.

125
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,130
Tomorrow I'll have Xiong Jiujiu

126
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,860
send your and Secretary Liu's tickets to the office.

127
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,020
Okay.

128
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,940
Bye-bye.

129
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,820
Xiong Jiujiu, I'm telling you.

130
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,940
My dad told me

131
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,540
he was coming to see us play on Saturday.

132
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,390
-He also said… -Really?

133
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,060
-he's going to take back the E-sports department.
-Really?

134
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,640
He's also giving us extra staff in our department.

135
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,400
My prayers are answered.

136
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,140
You can be excited.

137
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,470
But please let go of my girlfriend.

138
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,700
She's a family woman.

139
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,260
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,920
I failed to control myself.

141
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,610
Time to eat.

142
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,750
Did you see the way Chuan looked?

143
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,550
I'm sweating for you.

144
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,860
My sister

145
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,900
can also get jealous like a crazy woman.

146
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,340
I mean, brother-in-law...

147
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,710
Pray for yourself.

148
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,140
Chuan.

149
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,860
Have meal, please.

150
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,460
You don't want it.

151
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:05,770
You don't want it.

152
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,420
You don't want it.

153
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,020
Let's go.

154
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,170
Let's not

155
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,150
share the same room with Chuan here.

156
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:14,890
Let's go.

157
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,530
What are you doing?

158
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,780
Dong Shi just hugged you.

159
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,020
For the sake of family harmony...

160
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,120
If you have nothing else to do,

161
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,310
I have to go.

162
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,220
What are you doing?

163
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,020
Please come in.

164
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,460
Mr. Dong.

165
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,700
Xiong Jiujiu.

166
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,180
Come on.

167
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,930
These are the tickets for Saturday's game

168
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,220
and the E-sports department's

169
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,370
post-game publicity program.

170
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,110
And this,

171
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,890
this is the schedule for the final.

172
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,660
Okay.

173
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,220
This is the approved working group information

174
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,260
for the E-sports department.

175
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,710
They are all veterans

176
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
who have worked in other business departments.

177
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,240
They're experienced,

178
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,180
who can also help you and Dong Shi.

179
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,960
I've read

180
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,660
the new plan for the E-sports department he sent me.

181
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,020
Although, there are some flaws,

182
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,140
it's still very good.

183
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,090
It's worth investing in.

184
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,920
Thank you, Mr. Dong.

185
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,850
I'll see you in the final.

186
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,550
Okay.

187
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,460
Xiong Jiujiu.

188
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,940
Tell Dong Shi

189
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,820
I'm proud of him.

190
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,330
I will.

191
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,590
[Sweetheart]

192
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,910
Hey, boss lady.

193
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,840
I'm packing to leave.

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,640
You're here?

195
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,620
Have you seen my dad?

196
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,010
[1030 preparation room]

197
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,540
I already gave you a numbing injection.

198
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,510
But I have to observe for 20 minutes.

199
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,250
Tell me

200
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,980
after the pain wears off.

201
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,650
I will instruct you

202
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,160
to try to apply force and movement.

203
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,540
Okay.

204
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,410
And

205
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,640
during the competition,

206
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,450
if there is any pain,

207
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,720
you have to tell me in time.

208
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,070
Don't worry.

209
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,190
Hmmm.

210
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,700
Have you three been warmed up

211
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,140
before watching me here like this?

212
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,900
What?

213
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,900
I'm too handsome for you to get tired of?

214
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,980
Where's my phone?

215
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,020
I have to send a message.

216
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,860
Auntie has arrived at the venue.

217
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,620
My sister is taking care of her.

218
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,400
I want to send it to Capt. Qin.

219
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,490
Here.

220
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,920
Chuan has been a professional player for four years.

221
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,390
This is my first time

222
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,780
to see him play live.

223
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,490
I wonder if he can hold out.

224
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,100
Chuan has been stubborn since he was a kid.

225
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,080
He doesn't even want to have the operation.

226
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,690
Auntie,

227
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,830
Xiong Jiujiu is there for him.

228
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,070
And there is a medical team

229
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,050
backstage.

230
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,570
You shouldn't worry too much.

231
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,390
The children have grown up.

232
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,870
They have their own ideas and judgments.

233
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,180
We just need to support

234
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,360
their choices.

235
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,140
Miss. Chu Tian.

236
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,570
Your team uniform looks nice.

237
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,140
I heard that you designed it yourself.

238
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,730
You're a fashion designer?

239
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,540
Actually, I'm not really a fashion designer.

240
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,710
I'm just running my own online store.

241
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,420
I'd like to

242
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,150
have one outfit too.

243
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,450
If other teams in the company

244
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,090
need custom uniforms in the future,

245
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,260
I'll just go to you.

246
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,100
Really?

247
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,630
No problem, Uncle.

248
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,470
Great.

249
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,140
Welcome to

250

Mars is coming.

276

that has won the championship four times.

278

This is a long-term TLO alliance.

280
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,540
The old team has won the championship four times.

281
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,600
They're not only very popular but also very capable.

282
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,300
They have rich experience in the competition,

283

00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,460
and won a number of championships.

297
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,180
They are the name of the international arena.

298
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,300
We wish them a good day,

299
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,780
achievements, a show, a king of style.

300

The next team on stage is JR.

307
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,240
The next team on stage is JR.

308
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,080
I treat every game

309
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,770
as if it was my last game.

310
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,130
As long as I am on this field,

311
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,280
I will stand to the end.

312
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,140
Some people start playing at the age of 20.

313
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,570
Some people win the world championship trophy

314
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,840
at the age of 20.

315
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,180
I want

316
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,210
them both.

317
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,580
Pathetic people justify their existence

318
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,540
with ambition and desire.

319
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,130
I just want to prove my original aspiration and love

320
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,340
through myself.

321
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,180
Many people say I have no talent.

322
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,360
I lost before I even started.

323
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,580
After today,

324
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,140
I will make everyone know

325
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,700
that life is about the finish line,

326
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,900
not the starting point.

327
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:57,570
Go JR Team!

328
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,830
The Chinese team that stumbled into the final

329
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,400

330
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,220
to proving themselves with strength again and again.

331
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,480
In desperate situations,

332
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,100
-Come on, son!
-today they're finally

333

world arena

335
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
as they made it.

336
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,020
The Chinese team that stumbled into the final

337
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,320

today they're finally reaching

341
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,450
the top

342
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,060
-world arena.
-Go, go!

343
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,500
Auntie, don't worry.

344
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:20,810
Don't worry.

345
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,490
We never heard of

346
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,750
Xiao Yichuan's injury before.

347
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,440
But his bandaged hand

348
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,620
has clearly told us

349
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,740
beyond any words

350
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,170
that the so-called young and fearless

351
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,700
is nothing but the endurance of pain to go forward.

352
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,540
Go, go!

353
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,290
This season,

354
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,390
let's remember this group of

355
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,780
young bloods at the pursuit of dreams.

356
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,610
Next, let's welcome Team Lime.

357
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,060
Next, let's welcome Team Lime.

358
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,250
All players are ready.

359
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,230
Let's light the season up.

360
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,980
let the summer battle

361
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,780
belong to them.

362
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,170
Let the summer battle belong to them.

363
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,370
This is the final of

364
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,450
TLO 2020.

365
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,270
The match has officially started.

366
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,750
This is a southwest-northeast course

367
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,660
that's basically diagonal.

368
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,260
Jump in the area I marked.

369
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,580
Chu Tian. Dong Shi.

370
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,750
Go to that two-story building to occupy the points.

371
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,900
I will go around to scout the points.

372
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,940
Hong Yang, observe from high above.

373
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:15,870
Then get the car

374
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,620
and search for supplies together.

375
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,530
We can see the JR Team has jumped out quickly,

376
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,900
together with

377
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,620
Team Mars, Team Lime, Team Blaze.

378
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,380
These four teams' landing direction very close to one another's.

379
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
I wonder if

380
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,190
they'll choose different landing points

381
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,820
during the descent.

382
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,650
Let's take a look at the specific location.

383
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,500
One team for the north garage.

384
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,220
One team for the houses.

385
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,430
One team for the east slope.

386
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,210
JR Team

387
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,080
lands in the center building of Watertown,

388
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,100
while Team Mars lands in the garage on the north side,

389
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,970
and Team Blaze in the building at the northeast corner.

390
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,170
The three teams

391
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,740
are only about two hundred meters away.

392
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,520
That's right.

393
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,300
They're very close to each other.

394
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,940
Next to the southeast side of the building

395
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,340
and behind the slope is Team Lime.

396
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,420
The three teams basically

397
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,980
surround the JR Team

398
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,960
from the north to the east.

399
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,020
It's not good for them.

400
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,650
There's gunfire around 32 meters north.

401
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,780
M416.

402
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:15,900
Fire from the Team Mars.

403
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,390
One of Team Blaze is shot down.

404
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,170
But we can also see

405
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,100
that Team Mars doesn't take any more shots.

406
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,430
The member of Team Blaze is helped.

407
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,840
To the north are Team Mars and Team Blaze.

408
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,370
Dong Shi, take the point first.

409
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,010
Chu Tian, cover Hong Yang to search for supplies now.

410
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,070
I'm coming to meet up with you.

411
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,120
With the view of the team behind the slope,

412
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,220
they should hit Team Blaze first.

413
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,800
Hurry up and search for supplies.

414
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,580
Let them fight first.

415
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,900
Telling from the shots, the team behind the slope

416
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,760
is fighting the opposite Team Blaze.

417
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,630
Let's hurry up.

418
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,530
Behind the slope, 250 meters in the direction of 85.

419
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,280
Team Mars and Team Blaze

420
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,210
are all shooting at us.

421
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:45,940
Watch out.

422
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,810
Three teams are coming at us together.

423
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:48,650
Dong Shi.

424
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,850
Hold off Team Mars and Team Blaze first.

425
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,530
Chu Tian.

426
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,930
I'll cover your retreat with the carrier.

427
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,570
Chu Tian.

428
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,060
Retreat.

429
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,140
Team Lime and Team Mars

430
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,790
each eliminated two members of the JR Team.

431
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,100
The JR Team is wiped out.

432
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,310
The rules of our competition points

433
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,170
will still follow the previous games.

434
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,150
Eliminate one person

435
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,860
during the first safe zone refreshing period,

436
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,760
three points will be awarded.

437
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
During the second safe zone refreshing period,

438
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,580
two points for eliminating one person.

439
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,300
From the third safe zone

440
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,740
to the final round,

441
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,380
one point for eliminating one person.

442
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,540
So Team Lime and Team Mars

443
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,680
have now each scored six points.

444
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,820
It's a pity.

445
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,570
Chuan didn't have time

446
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,570
to take more shots to get points.

447
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,060
Their game of this round

448
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,660
has come to a pitiful end.

449
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,660
That's right.

450
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,570
We were so unlucky as the game started.

451
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,460
They were clearly teaming up.

452
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,230
I didn't expect Team Lime to

453
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:30,980
fight us first

454
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,090
instead of Team Blaze available for their rifle.

455
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,920
Maybe they wanted to confirm our identity.

456
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,070
And compared to the Team Mars

457
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,660
and Team Blaze,

458
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,140
they had a better chance of winning to fight us.

459
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,720
But all three of their teams

460
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,340
teamed up to fight us.

461
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,880
It's much of a coincidence, isn't it?

462
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,410
SIK next door

463
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,200
also had a very tough time.

464
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,220
They were stuck in the position

465
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,060
by Team Fox and FAL.

466
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,720
They could only move

467
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,400
by breaking through the UB Team.

468
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,820
Now SIK has a view of…

469
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,750
-I wonder if they can manage to move.
The team at the end of the street is coming around.

470
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,440
They're about 190 south of us.

471
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:56,810
Report points.

472
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,570
100 meters in the direction of 230.

473
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,190
Team Fox still has three people left.

474
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,330
Two people are on the second floor.

475
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,300
One person is on the fence.

476
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,380
At 45 direction is FAL.

477
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,620
If we want to hit Team Fox and the team at the end of the street,

478
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,940
we can get attacked by FAL.

479
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,580
Any more smoke grenades?

480
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,460
No.

481
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:17,830
Neither do I.

482
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,210
We were harassed by the Alive Team and Team Fox

483
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,980
when we started searching for supplies.

484
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,840
We're poor now.

485
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:22,930
Ride or die.

486
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,820
I'll assault the team at the end of the street from the right flank.

487
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,290
Mantou, cover me.

488
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,600
Beast, Dahai. Hold back.

489
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,660
Once Team Fox and FAL

490
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,650
tear up from the end of the street,

491
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,240
let's quickly evacuate

492
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,100
to the south where I marked.

493
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:36,930
Okay.

494
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,890
Mantou, drive to pick up Beast.

495
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,270
Retreat.

496
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:23,790
Okay.

497
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,650
Watch out.

498
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,660
Captain, I'll cover you to move first.

499
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,450
Beast, retreat.

500
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,210
I'll wait for you.

501
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,110
Wang Boyu has eliminated two of the opposite team.

502
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,250
Now SIK

503
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,310
has finally reversed the situation with difficulty

504
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,780
and opened up a transfer route.

505
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,410
But unfortunately, they also lost two players.

506
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,470
Beast is being attacked by FAL and Team Fox

507
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,190
from both sides.

508
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,660
SIK has lost one more member.

509
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,610
Now only Wang Boyu is left alone.

510
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,440
SIK has suffered a lot in this game.

511
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,790
The winning team in this round is Team Mars.

512
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,600
They scored 21 points with 11 eliminations.

513

Oh my God.

This opening score is

very impressive.

520
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,310
This final game is a bit strange.

521
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,180
Team Mars, Team Fox, and FAL

522
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,540
were probably teaming up.

523
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,130
There is something wrong with Team Blaze and Team Lime too.

524

We failed to make a breakthrough

and couldn't get excited.

526

We are now in 7th place with 39 points.

527

It's not looking good.

528
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,200
I have to make a big change in the second half

to break the deadlock.

530

is even worse than ours.

532

The team that won this game

533
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,300
is Team Mars again.

they were just a little slow to get in the zone.

29 kills and 82 points.

It's a big gap with us.

Team Mars has the strength anyway.

If there is a lane battle,

563

We've been waiting for you.

570

I'll go make you some tea.

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,650

572

574
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,580
It's all right.

575
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,820
If it still hurts,

576
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,970
take a painkiller.

577
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,580

578
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,540

Good.

580
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,950
I'll fetch a towel for you.

581
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,380
Capt. Qin.

582
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,190
Is it because of the hand injury?

583
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,440
It's not an injury problem.

584
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,690
We jumped in the same place as Team Lime and the Team Mars

585
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,310
in the first two games.

586
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,640
I don't think it's a coincidence.

587
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,260
They were intentionally jumping with us.

588
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,290
We've studied these teams before.

589
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,270
They had a strange choice of

590
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,300
jumping positions today.

591
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,830
And

592
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,430
with their hand speed,

593
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,030
it's difficult to notice if they follow us on purpose.

594
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,960
We were indeed targeted by the group,

595
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,260
especially against Chuan.

596
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,330
Team Mars, Team Lime, Team Fox.

00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,230
FAL and Team Blaze.

598
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,950
Something wasn't right about these five teams.

599
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,370
In this way,

600
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,680
we wouldn't have enough time to search for supplies

601
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,580
and make more accurate transfer arrangements.

602
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
It's also hard for us to break the situation

603
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,700
and ambush them to get points.

604
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,260
So even if we broke through the encirclement,

605
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,340
we were still very passive.

606
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,150

607
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,250

611
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,200
In the middle and late stages when they suffered a loss,

612
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,130
they began to

613
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,660
consciously avoid combat

614
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,460
and help those in good positions to survive to the end.

615
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,660
Their strategy should be

616
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,380
to deliberately pressure the hopeful teams,

617
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,300
so that they and the relatively weaker teams can get points.

618
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,350
SIK is now ranked sixth in points.

619
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,000
There is no way they are at this ranking

620
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,310

To avoid being besieged,

632
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,670

642
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,760
These European and American teams

643
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,220
have never played with Chu Tian.

644
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,790
They are not familiar with Chu Tian.

645

Even if they have watched

646
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,710
the group match video replay,

647
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,500
they can in no way

648
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,880
master Chu Tian's command on short notice.

649
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,540
So

650
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,150
Chu Tian is the key to surprise.

651
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,000
Make them think

652
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,650
that Chuan is still the commander and the core of the team.

653
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:17,870
But the real leader of the team

654
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:18,970
will be you.

655
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,820
But I'm afraid…

656
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,680
Afraid of what?

657
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,110
You are the commander of the JR Team.

658
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,350
Believe in yourself.

659
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,350
I also believe in you.

660
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,990
Since you are willing to trust me

661
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,260
and make me the commander,

662
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,270
I'll also choose to trust your decision.

663
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,060
Come on.

664
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,480
JR Team.

665
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,660
Come on!

666
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,120
So

667
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,740
they must be teaming up.

No wonder

669
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,510
as long as we took an early jump, we'd get followed right away.

670
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,530
Team Fox didn't choose to fight Team Lime.

671
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,140
Instead, they hit GO Team in the back and us.

672
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,960
They're playing dirty.

673
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,820
We can no longer play like this.

674
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,720
Otherwise, we'll certainly get more passive in the second half.

675
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,060
Right.

676
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,840
In the second half, let's switch to

677
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,340
two-two split push or four-person flat push.

678
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,500
We can't land on the same spot

679
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,440
from the beginning of the jump.

680
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,460
I believe that the four of you

681
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,980
are all capable of fighting independently.

682
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:37,570
Hmmm.

683
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,450
As soon as we land in the second half,

684
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,690
we'll split up

685
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,890
and score by sneak attack.

686
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,390
Do unto others as they do unto us.

687
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,670
All this time,

688
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,230
everyone thinks

689
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,980
that SIK

690
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,260
is the strongest team in the country.

691
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,270
But we haven't won

692
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,170
a TLO championship even for once.

693
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,420
The match is held in China today.

694
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,410
How can we give up the championship

695
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,420
to others?

696
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,100
We are not only here to pursue our dreams today.

697
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,820
The best we can do

698
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,460
is also the best thing Chinese team

699
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,320
can show the world.

700
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,410
Okay.

701
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,060
Let's show them.

702
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,850
The champion is ours.

703
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,950
The champion is ours!

704
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,160
Group B is indeed the fearful group today.

705
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,000
Team Mars's score

706
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,870
is unbelievably high.

707
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,740
Now you know

708
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,490
how valuable SIK's ranking

709
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,470
as the top of the group is.

710
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,620
How do you feel?

711
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,760
Is your hand okay?

712
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,580
It's fine.

713
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:06,700
It's just

714
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,690
that I feel like killing some enemies.

715
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,650
That's cocky.

716
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,390
No matter what,

717
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,950
SIK will be the champion.

718
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,060
Don't you think

719
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,330
that we'll let you win on purpose

720
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,800
as our companion team.

721
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,650
How can you be so confident in front of me?

722
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,580
Hey, what's up, guys?

723
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,690
Everything is cool?

724
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,900
Are you ready to congratulate us like before?

725
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,900
I already forgot how many times I win you, guys.

726
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,020
But not this time.

727
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,350
Don't be too excited at this moment.

728
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,520
I'll tell you

729
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,980
what professional means.

730
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,670
Really?

731
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,560
China's E-sports starts too late.

732
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,130
These guys are just kids, man.

733
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,080
Exactly.

734
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,950
It seems you're afraid of us.

735
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,340
Be careful, dude.

736
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,710
I'll keep you in sight.

737
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,670
You too.

738
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,590
Let's see.

739
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,210
Are you ready to embarrass them?
