8
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,800
Get to the point.

00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,030
If I didn't run fast, I wouldn't be able to be here.

How can you be couple with someone else?

I'll pick out the clothes.

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,440
It's an honor for you

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,860
to give me an award.

26

can be selected as awards guests.

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,620
Don't we have a backup guest?

33
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,680
Let him do it.

It's not a commercial station.

for this woman?

54

Are you really giving up on your career?

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,780
You scared me.

56
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,490

still not give up?

96

For the uncontrolled teammate like Xiao Yichuan,

most mature teams don't choose him readily.

Yes.

Why didn't he reply to my message on Weibo?

110
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,710
I shouldn't have deleted him on Wechat.

111

You drive later.

Then call a designated driver.

I can't step on the gas either.

There's no signal in the stairs.

116
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,890
I suddenly remembered something.

117
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,160
Since we're driving,

118
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,800
we can take the elevator to the basement

It means he didn't see it.

But critically,

162
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,680
it also shows that he has an independent personality.

Let me ask you.

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,190
Do all girls like to speak one way and think another?

If a girl keeps scolding you,

she likes you?

243

This is the same as that how I always scold you.

348
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,730
I also want to share it

349
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,090
with you.

350
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,030
I'd like to take this opportunity to interview

351
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,810
the missing person who finally returned,

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,650
Xiao Yichuan.

353
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,020
Did you do some secret training

354
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,830
during the past six months?

355
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,120
Everything is possible.

356
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,350
Don't take me lightly.

357
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,920
Can I guess

358
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,020
you're back to sign a new team

359
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,850
and go back to the competition?

360
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,930
Can you tell us?

361
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,540
It seems that it's still confidential.

362
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,440
Whether we can see

363
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,690
Boyi brothers

364
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,130
competing on the same stage,

365
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,330
we all applaud

366
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,930
for the two chiefs of the year.

367
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:54,910
Thanks

368
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,650
for their efforts

369
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,740
for the development of E-sports and sports in China.

370
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,740
Chuan,

371
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,770
Which club are you going to sign this time?

372
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,620
The League Tournament will begin in two months.

373
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,580
Is it good?

374
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:14,960
Still looking.

375
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,460
Not decided.

376
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,440
Enough.

377
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,650
Su has urged me several times.

378
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,150
Let's go.

379
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:18,920
Let's go.

380
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,660
Go.

381
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,490
Bye.

382
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:21,980
Bye.

383
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,220
Go back by yourself.

384
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,140
I just leave you alone.

385
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,520
Go.

386
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,950
Look at you.

387
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,370
Get lost.

388
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,030
Cut the crap.

389
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,500
Hey.

390
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,520
It's not about money.

391
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,050
Find someone else.

392
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,420
Bye.

393
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,920
Give me five minutes.

394
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,620
Just give me five minutes.

395
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:11,940
I'm here

396
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,390
as the manager

397
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,500
of Geek Sports.

398
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,040
We want to establish an e-sports team.

399
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,680
-So... -You are not here to apologize.

400
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,810
You asked me to join your team.

401
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,950
You only think of me when you need me.

402
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,990
That's not what I meant.

403
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,290
This is my work card

404
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,360
and the proposal.

405
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,510
-I hope you can take a look. -Playing the game once,

406
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,600
you're so arrogant that you dare to do anything.

407
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,580
Do you know E-sports?

408
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,520
You look down on me again.

409
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,030
Although I don't understand E-sports,

410
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,700
I can learn.

411
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,950
Don't think E-sports is that simple.

412
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,860
Don't think I'm that simple.

413
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,930
Actually,

414
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,020
you want to go back to the competition more than anyone does,

415
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:56,750
right?

416
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,110
It's been so long.

417
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,030
You're more anxious than anyone else, aren't you?

418
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,850
Don't play tricks on me.

419
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,640
You think you know everything.

420
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,650
Why do you think I'll agree?

421
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,220
Anyway,

422
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,500
you need a team.

423
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,650
I need a team member.

424
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,260
So I'm just your choice, right?

425
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,030
Will you kick me away

426
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,980
after you achieve your goals?

427
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,750
You let me hand my passionate career

428
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,570
to you.

429
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,980
Can you keep your promise and make it?

430
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,060
Answer me.

431
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,790
You're still using me.

432
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,650
You're really something.

433
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,340
No.

434
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,540
That's not what I meant.

435
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,570
Let me explain.

436
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,630
Listen to me.

437
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,100
You should at least read my proposal.

438
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,870
You can't even talk.

439
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,770
What do you mean by that?

440
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
I'll be furious to die sooner or later because of her.

441
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,540
I shouldn't have wished for it.

442
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,170
Actually,

443
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,140
you want to go back to the competition more than anyone does,

444
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,990
right?

445
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,380
It's been so long.

446
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,520
You're more anxious than anyone else, aren't you?

447
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,580
Brother,

448
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,850
you're better than everyone I've seen.

449
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,420
Why don't you play professional games to make yourself famous,

450
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,580
but to waste time here?

451
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,300
Chuan, you are a genius.

452
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,260
You're top 50 in China network server when you just started.

453
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:13,980
Great!

454
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,100
Chuan is in top 30 in China network server.

455
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,820
A genius player like you

456
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,930
should be a professional player.

457
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,640
You're top 20 in China network server, Chuan.

458
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,950
When you reach top ten in China network server,

459
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,060
you should become a professional player.

460
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,770
Genius.

461
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,890
What a heavy and vague halo.

462
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,370
So what if I'm a genius?

463
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,400
Today is my 20th birthday.

464
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,470
I want to stick to what I want,

465
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,310
and become the person I want to be.

466
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,970
Every year passed.

467
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,250
I find that persistence is harder.

468
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,880
I'm afraid my persistence won't get results.

469
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,810
But I'm more afraid that my persistence

470
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,560
will come to an end one day.

471
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,350
Happy birthday to me.

472
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,070
Boss.

473
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,250
Give me a bowl of instant noodles

474
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,390
and a braised egg, please.

475
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,670
I made a wish on my 18th birthday.

476
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,310
I said

477
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,330
I wanted to get into an ideal university.

478
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,620
That's when I shared this koi.

479
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,560
Today,

480
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,160
I got the admission letter from my university.

481
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,940
I think God is fair.

482
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,510
As long as you persist,

483
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,490
your dream will come true.

484
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,540
Now,

485
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,120
I give you my koi.

486
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,530
Good luck.

487
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,640
I wish you are

488
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,710
full of energy in the future.

489
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,950
Love heart.

490
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,500
Thank you, bro.

491
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,300
You're making it up so seriously.

492
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,610
I'm your sister.

493
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,500
And let me tell you.

494
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,850
I'm not lying.

495
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,930
She's quite funny.

496
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,700
She's full of poisonous chicken soup for the soul,

497
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,080
just like my mom.

498
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,020
It's really a koi.

499
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,130
I thought it was a phishing site.

500
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,020
I misunderstood you.

501
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,570
The koi is not bad.

502
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,360
But your tone

503
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,520
resembles that of my mom.

504
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,290
You're really 18 years old?

505
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,580
Aren't you 38?

506
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,610
By the way, there are some sentences for you.

507
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,910
Don't be afraid of the unknown.

508
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,620
Only fools fear the future.

509
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,520
Do what you want.

510
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,670
Trust me.

511
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,110
Your future

512
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,790
is destined to be bright and colorful.

513
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,830
Let's be friends.

514
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,540
Hello, Mom.

515
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,700
I'm already packing.

516
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,210
I will go to the training base.

517
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,800
It's not easy to do anything.

518
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,860
Besides,

you shouldn't be afraid of those unknown things.

Let me save your phone number.

525
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,590
I don't know what gift I should give you,

526
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,460
so I sent you

527

my favorite chocolate.

528
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,840

I can't sleep?

532
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,810
Sorry.

533
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,910
It's mine.

534
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,340
Hey!

535
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,920
Who took pictures of me chasing the car

536
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,840
and scolded me?

537
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,880
Just let it go. Don't get angry.

538

You're depending on rich ones!

Have you made up your mind?

My boss has been praising you.

00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,920
He acknowledges you.

546
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,500
He really wants you to join us.

547
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,710
He thinks you're very creative.

548
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,610
You have a bright future.

and you will be the best tomorrow.

551
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,720
You'll be a big star in the E-sports career.

552
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,910
I'm telling the truth.

553
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,590
I've studied the data

554
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,600
you gave me carefully,

555
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,120
by horizontal and vertical comparison.

556
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,620
Many players' data

557
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,340
are similar to yours.

558
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,680
Some are worse than yours.

559
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,060
Didn't you say

560
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,940
you would fight for the E-sports career forever?

561
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,080
You're right.

562
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,000
But I'm not sure

563
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,290
if you let me play a professional game.

564
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,860
Have faith in yourself.

565
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,120
Besides,

566
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,460
maybe you can team up with

567
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,659
Xiao Yichuan.

568
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,460
Do you think I don't surf the internet?

569
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,790
You know I messed up Xiao Yichuan.

570
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,370
You can't just

571
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,449
do nothing to save me from ruin

572
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,389
and hit me when I'm down at this time?

573
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,659
But I'm major in theoretical research after all.

574
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,500
You have theories. You can also have practices.

575
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,690
When you were watching the Asian Games,

576
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,159
have you ever imagined

577
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,800
a seat on the stage belongs to you?

578
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,550
Okay.

579
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,330
I promise you.

580
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,490
I'll try.

581
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:02,950
Okay.

582
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,630
This meal is on me.

583
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,640
But don't give up Xiao Yichuan so easily.

584
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,390
My idol is unattainable.

585
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,680
Try again.

586
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,450
Sometimes, if you don't push yourself,

587
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,160
you won't know you will make things terrible.

588
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,420
But there is always a way out.

589
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,280
Yesterday, I found someone who blackened me

590
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,420
in Xiao Yichuan's fans

591
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,830
scolded him.

592
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,990
Retire athlete makes him popular with box news.

593
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,000
How could he do that!

594
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,930
He often posts data on Weibo.

595
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:38,980
He is strong.

596
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,050
I know him.

597
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,700
The kingdom of newbie, Wangxing Ziyi

598
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,150
has ranked top ten

599
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,200
in recent competition in the new network server.

600
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,230
Did he sign a team?

601
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,380
Probably not.

602
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,610
He's quite arrogant.

603
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,860
He won't yield to anyone.

604
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,190
It's okay.

605
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,870
I'll yield to him.

606
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,140
Who's Xiong Jiujiu?

607
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,420
Here.

608
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,430
Have a seat please.

609
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,530
We contacted on Weibo before.

610
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,750
-Do you want... -Let's get down to business.

611
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,010
Okay.

612
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,010
Our team is a member of the Geek Sports Ltd.

613
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,440
It's quite famous in the industry.

614
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,420
This is the proposal.

615
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,380
Yes.

616
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,320
I'm not interested in these.

617
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,900
Let's talk about something practical.

618
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,260
For example, the company's team plan.

619
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,950
Our team plan this year is

620
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,910
to participate in the World League.

621
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,030
-Why is Xiao Yichuan there? -Now...

622
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,270
A retired player whose condition is in a slump

623
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,740
has no reputation.

624
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,910
How can I win the championship with him?

625
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,450
Xiao Yichuan is just

626
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,970
one of our backup players.

627
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,300
We haven't signed the contract yet.

628
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,900
As a manager,

629
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,840
I really hope that there are some famous players

630
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,000
in the team.

631
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,770
But considering teamwork

632
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,840
and team operation,

633
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,620
I'll listen to

634
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,220
your opinions.

635
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,610
I suggest

636
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,690
you don't need to sign someone

637
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,870
like Xiao Yichuan.

638
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,320
Or you'll get into trouble.

639
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,450
Hey.

640
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,910
I know the scandal between you and Xiao Yichuan.

641
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,380
You're dating sometimes and breaking up sometimes.

642
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,530
Is it because you broke up with him

643
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,350
and he didn't hype up with you?

644
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,720
That's why you came to me, right?

645
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,740
It's a misunderstanding.

646
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,550
I'm not interested in gossip.

647
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,780
But to be honest,

648
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,030
his rate of continuous fire

649
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,310
is not as fast as mine.

650
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,810
That's really amazing.

651
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,810
So I really hope

652
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,240
I can see your performance face to face

653
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,810
and worship you.

654
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:04,960
Also,

655
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,180
I've studied

656
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,540
your data carefully.

657
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,890
Judging from the rate of winning as a single player,

658
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,870
your performance is better than a lot of veteran players.

659
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,580
Judging from the hit rate,

660
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,900
your proficiency and stability of shooting skill

661
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,250
are not reached by newbie

662
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,240
in ordinary industry.

663
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,560
Talent

664
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,980
is not something everyone can have.

665
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,230
You're right.

666
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,410
So I really hope

667
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,750
a talented player like you can be my working partner.

668
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,360
So my team must be the strongest.

669
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,930
Do you have the ability?

670
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,860
When you join our team,

671
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,460
can't we have the ability?

672
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,590
You're right.

673
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,310
I understand what you said.

674
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,890
I don't want to make it difficult for you.

675
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,720
-Let's talk about the salary of the players. -Ask your boss to come and talk to me.

676
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,590
Many people want to sign me.

677
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,790
Your boss should show his sincerity.

678
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,050
Hello, boss.

679
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:00,970
I made a deal with someone.

680
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,060
He is no worse than Xiao Yichuan.

681
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,090
I'll tell you when I'm back.

682
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,980
Boss, good news.

683
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,270
It won't be a good news

684
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,950
if Xiao Yichuan doesn't come.

685
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,590
Why is my luck getting worse every day?

686
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,900
I'm so worried.

687
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,280
I'll explain to you about Xiao Yichuan later.

688
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,950
The person I talked about today

689
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,620
is as good as Xiao Yichuan.

690
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,170
In my opinion, no one is better than Xiao Yichuan.

691
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,400
Then...

692
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,830
what about Xing Ziyi?

693
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,320
Look at his personal data.

694
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,070
He is in the top nine in the new network server.

695
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,800
The top eight are all pro-players.

696
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,500
Although there aren't many professional player

697
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,870
in new network server,

698
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,540
But

699
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,910
it also shows his strength.

700
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,480
Isn't he going to Ouen?

701
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,610
What's going on?

702
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,510
I just met him here.

703
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,100
Why did he meet Fang Wenwen again?

704
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,300
Do you think you find him

705
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,930
and have a cup of coffee with him,

706
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,790
That's settled, right?

707
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,400
Where is the contract?

708
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,300
He said he wanted to negotiate with the boss.

709
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,060
That's why I didn't sign the contract with him.

710
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,540
No, he promised me.

711
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,000
I'll go find them.

712
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,840
Don't go.

713
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,870
If Fang Wenwen posted this on Weibo,

714
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,310
it means Xing Ziyi

715
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,790
has decided to join Ouen.

716
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,700
Huo Ran establish a team for E-sports.

717
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,380
Ouen is supporting

718
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,680
We can't compare

719
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,150
what they offer.

720
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,880
I should have signed a contract of intention

721
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,520
with him.

722
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,130
Hello.

723
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,230
I'm the manager of the E-sports department in Geek.

724
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:37,980
Xiong Jiujiu.

725
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,190
May I ask...

726
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,570
♫ Believe the faith in your heart ♫

727
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,290
Hello.

728
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,680
♫ The dream is always in front of me ♫

729
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,900
I'm the manager of the E-sports department in Geek, Xiong Jiujiu.

730
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,620
Excuse me, have you joined the team?

731
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,790
♫ In a challenging world ♫

732
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,840
I'm sorry.

733
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,890
♫ Step is hot like a flame ♫

734
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,840
♫ Face the bright sun ♫

735
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,740
♫ Stick with the choice to swim upstream ♫

736
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,750
♫ Get everybody to see ♫

737
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,640
♫ Our charming youth ♫

738
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,660
♫ Let's set sail with passion ♫

739
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,640
♫ Feel the cool of the rain ♫

740
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,420
♫ Go up and down with the waves ♫

741
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,510
♫ This is our most memorable moment ♫

742
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:37,080
♫ No one can stop ♫

743
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,900
Why didn't they answer my calls?

744
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,310
They didn't even give me a chance to meet.

745
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,310
Do I really have to

746
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,470
deal with Xiao Yichuan?

747
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,500
It's been 27 hours.

748
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,300
I'm not mad anymore.

749
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,270
Why hasn't she come to cheer me up?

750
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,850
I have a gift for you.

751
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,110
Chu Tian?

752
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,190
Surprise!
