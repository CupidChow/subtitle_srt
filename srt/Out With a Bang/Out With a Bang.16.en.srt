Why are you still here?

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,220
I want to make sure you've arrived at your dorm by seeing the light on.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,800
The light won't be turned on.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,290
My dorm is out of power.

8

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:22,720
Yes.

It's dark.

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,610
You can't see anything.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,720
What if

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,450
your hand touch the plug?

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,480
What if you get an electric shock?

No.

You can't go back to your dorm.

19
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:39,890
It's too dangerous.

20

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,230
How can I get the electric shock?

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,340
I'll call Miss Chu Tian,

24
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,110
Why?

25
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,320
Chu Tian has a training.

26
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,220
Miss Chu needs to work too.

27
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,280
You'll bother them.

Don't go to hers.

29

You'll disturb them.

33

That's too much.

34

You can't stay in the inn.

35
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,200
Don't go.

36
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,980
That's ridiculous.

37
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,300

38
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,360
nagging now?

39
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,300
Alright, give me my phone.

Don't get me wrong.

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,500
I just don't want you to catch a cold.

Luckily, you're home.

109
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,590
Didn't I mention

110
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,990
some teams asked me to introduce you to them?

111
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,740
I brought their information.

112
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,560
Let's talk about it carefully.

113
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,490
I'm not interested in other teams.

114
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,780

I guess I'm bothering you.

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,500
Yes.

120

Chuan,

122
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,680
is this all you want?

123
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,740
You weren't like this before.

124
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,570
I told you

125
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,940
don't always think that you know me well.

126
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,980
Then tell me

127
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,480
what do you mean?

128
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,540
Go to a better team

129
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,000
and be a better man.

130
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,780
It's okay to be confused some time.

131
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,740
He's not doing charity.

132
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,880

133
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,560
Look before you leap.

134
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,070
You think what he is doing now

135
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,220
is due to the confusion?

136
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,880
No wonder you don't know him.

137
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,300
If you don't really know people,

138

145
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,580
Take these.

146
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,670
I won't be a third wheel here.

147
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,420
Breakfast is not here yet.

148
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,880
You must be hungry.

149
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,820
How about I take you

150
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,750
to have breakfast downstairs?

151
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:48,980
No need.

152
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,390
The breakfast is bought for you.

153
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,420
I have to deal with the endorsement today.

154
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,960
I'm running out of time.

155
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:56,960
I have to go now.

156
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,860
Jiujiu,

157
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,410
don't take her words seriously.

158
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,410
Aren't you going to promote me today?

159
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm so valuable.

160
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,320
Don't feel pressured.

161
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,340
Okay.

162
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,730
I'll pick you up tonight.

163
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,240
Got it.

164
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,630
Good morning, Chuan.

165
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,900
Looks like you've been obedient these days.

166

Try to move it.

168

Yes.

169
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,180
Much better.

170
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,060
There's no problem with daily activities.

171
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,230
Well,

172
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,700
can I start the training now?

173
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,380
No.

174
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,860
You're not a doctor.

175
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,730
No, you can't.

176
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,940
I haven't touched the mouse for almost a month.

00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,860
my mouse will grow mushrooms.

179
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,220
Let it grow then.

180
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,860
Let me tell you.

181
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,980
The swelling is gone,

182
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,150
but it doesn't mean you're fine.

183
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,760
If your previous symptom

184
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,690
is not completely eradicated,

185
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,860
it will become a time bomb.

186
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,420
Understand?

187
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,980
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

188
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,150
Remember to take it.

189
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,940
Doctor Chen.

190
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,900
Well,

191
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,380
is there

192
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,820
any magical treatment

193
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,140
that can take effect

194
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,680
in a short time?

195
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,180
Fine. Fine.

196
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,350
I see.

197
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,460
There isn't any.

198
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,420
Xiao Yichuan, you know,

199
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,960
people won't die if they don't commit suicide.

200
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,040
Relax, man.

201
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
You are always like this every time you come to the hospital.

202
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,400
Don't come again.

203
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,250
How dare you!

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,540
Magical treatment?

205
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:13,980
I know

206
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,180
what you're thinking about.

207
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,370
You'd better know it.

208
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,480
This is our secret.

209
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,590
This trick won't work on me anymore.

210
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,750
But...

211
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,530
"Burning yourself

212
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,270
to light up others",

213
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,740
I can't believe it can be used to describe you one day.

214
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,500
Yes.

215
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,220
I'm also very touched by myself.

216
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,530
I know I can't persuade you now.

217
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,820
But even if you think I'm nagging,

218
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,650
I still want to say.

219
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,740
You should consider your future for yourself.

220
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,140
Our industry

221
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,440
has short career lifespan.

222
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,390
Do you really want to sacrifice your health

223
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,390
for the next decades

224
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,570
just for a one single contest?

225
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,730
If you were me,

226
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,700
how would you choose?

227
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,140
It's none of my business.

228
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,220
I'm talking about you.

229
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,040
I know you well.

230
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,600
You'll do more exaggeratedly.

231
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,830
I'm going to pick up Xiong Jiujiu.

232
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,020
I can't control you.

233
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,090
Don't drink too much if you can't hold your liquor.

234
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,150
No one will take care of you next time.

235
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,300
Go back to your SIK.

236
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,050
♪ There are so many lonely people ♪

237
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,470
♪ Not many are happy ♪

238
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,040
You're here.

239
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,170
Yes.

240
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,970
I said

241
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,960
I would pick you up after work.

242
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,630
Whose home should we go?

243
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,470
Mine, of course.

244
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,790
Let's go.

245
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,330
It's delicious.

246
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,440
Are you angry

247
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,010
about what happened this morning?

248
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,150
No.

249
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,830
Shi Ya

250
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,070
is too persistent.

251
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,290
Did I say something wrong?

252
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,819
She's not persistent.

253
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:07,400
She's stubborn.

254
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,810
How can I make my Xiong Jiujiu jealous?

255
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,290
Don't flatter yourself.

256
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,490
Who's jealous?

257
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,609
I hate serving a princess like her.

258
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,660
Did I say something wrong again?

259
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,380
Stop.

260
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,690
Stop talking.

261
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:32,970
Let's dig in.

262
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,270
You went to negotiate about the endorsement today, didn't you?

263
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,720
Didn't the conversation go well?

264
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,430
No.

265
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,270
Everything is fine.

266
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,940
They

267
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,480
wanted to hire someone

268
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,460
for their new product endorsement.

269
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,020
Why aren't you happy?

270
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,370
We should celebrate.

271
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,900
You never do commercial endorsements.

272
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,410
I know that.

273
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,600
This time,

274
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,630
you've done so much

275
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,660
for the team and me.

276
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,110
Actually,

277
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,250
I feel sorry for you.

278
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,670
Actually,

279
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,060
Shi Ya is right.

280
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,160
Based on your personal value

281
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,310
and physical condition,

282
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,420
you shouldn't stay in our team anymore.

283
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,650
What are you talking about?

284
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,110
Don't think too much.

285
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,550
Isn't it a good start now?

286
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,950
If you have the energy,

287
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,530
why don't you think about

288
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,790
what to cook for the next meal.

289
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,980
By the way,

290
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,130
I went to see the doctor today.

291
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,990
The doctor said my hand is much better.

292
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,520
I don't need to take the medicine.

293
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,820
I just need to rest more.

294
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,720
Great.

295
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,600
I feel much relieved now.

296
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,490
If you're worried about me,

297
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,340
I'll give you something practical.

298
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,110
I'll give you the access card of my apartment.

299
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,350
Why?

300
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,660
I am afraid to stay at home

301
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,540
or eat meals alone.

302
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,430
Here.

303
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,310
Have more meat.

304
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:16,780
Hello.

305
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,070
Hello, Mr. Dong.

306
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,630
How was the negotiation today?

307
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,350
Even if we get this sponsor today,

308
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,890
we still can't make up for our financial shortage.

309
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,770
There's only a week left before the deadline of the deposit.

310
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,560
We really have to hurry.

311
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:42,860
Okay.

312
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,020
Don't worry.

313
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,470
The plans you wrote

314
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,240
and our team's proposal

315
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,220
have been given to those companies.

316
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,790
There should be replies tomorrow.

317
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:52,910
Thank you.

318
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,160
Rest early.

319
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,740
Okay.

320
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,860
You too.

321
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,540
Hello.

322
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,440
You are downstairs?

323
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,180
Why did you come here this late?

324
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,410
You haven't eaten anything the whole day, have you?

325
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,580
Your dark circles are like panda's.

326
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,830
You will collapse at this rate.

327
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:46,980
Okay.

328
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,990
Let's go upstairs.

329
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:03,980
Dad.

330
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,240
Why are you staying so late?

331
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,890
I came back to organize the contracts.

332
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,150
I met a few clients this afternoon.

333
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,940
They are willing to invest us.

334
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,510
Others

335
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,340
will tell us the result soon.

336
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,930
I'll improve the proposals later.

337
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,080
Well,

338
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,210
take more rest.

339
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,860
Okay.

340
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,680
I think your dad was very touched just now.

341
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,210
You don't know him.

342
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
We're not father and son in business.

343
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,980
He truly believe in this.

344
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,060
Actually, since the team got into trouble,

345
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,250
I can see your changes.

346
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,350
He can see them too.

347
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,970
By then,

348
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,830
I brought them to this team.

349
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,930
But now such a big problem happened.

350
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,940
I am not able to solve it.

351
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,610
I can only hide in this office and worry about it.

352
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,030
I feel sorry for them.

353
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,610
Haven't you made some progress?

354
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,890
The biggest order today

355
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,250
was introduced by Chuan.

356
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,810
Although Xiong Jiujiu and I got some investment,

357
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,540
it's still far from enough.

358
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,030
It's almost time.

359
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,930
I have to make the worst plan

360
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,490
for everyone.

361
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,340
You guys are so strange.

362
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,340
Xiong Jiujiu and Chu Tian,

363
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,270
one runs sponsorship with you every day,

364
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,860
and the other keeps training hard at home.

365
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,850
Xiao Yichuan

366
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,790
introduced clients to you to sign the advertisement.

367
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,490
But you, the boss,

368
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,510
are making the worst plan here.

369
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,940
If that's the case,

370
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,500
why didn't you agree

371
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,760
to disband the team back then?

372
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,890
We need to face the facts.

373
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,470
But don't be so pessimistic.

374
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,200
You have to eat bite by bite,

375
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,940
and do things one by one.

376
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,860
If you're tired,

377
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,010
go play the games

378
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,170
and find the feeling of training.

379
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,310
Take it as relaxing.

380
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:15,390
Oh.

381
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:15,870
By the way,

382
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,400
I also know

383
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,700
a boss of an e-commerce brand.

384
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,300
You can talk to him.

385
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,050
Chu Tian,

386
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,500
you are so nice.

387
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,680
Have the meal.

388
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,510
By the way,

389
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,990
I haven't been able to train lately.

390
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,010
Xiong Jiujiu told me

391
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,760
Chu Tian is live streaming every day.

392
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,450
Have you watched his live stream before?

393
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,300
Yes.

394
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,520
Others' live streams are videos,

395
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,430
but his are photos.

396
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,780
It's very unique.

397
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,800
Han Peng, help me stop the man in front.

398
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,400
I'll go behind and steal the car.

399
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,870
Hong Yang, cover me.

400
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,650
The car is here.

401
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,950
You two enter the circle first.

402
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,000
Got it.

403
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,350
In a few days,

404
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,240
Chu Tian is going to attend the Talent Contest

405
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,940
of Red Ant Live.

406
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,860
Those who are fans of Chu Tian,

407
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,840
don't forget to

408
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,260
go to the live room to cheer for Chu Tian.

[Late Spring Talent Contest]

411
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,420
Hello, everyone.

412
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,750
Welcome to watch our Red Ant Live.

413
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,130
Here's the Talent Contest at the end of spring.

414
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,400
Today, we have two commentators here with us,

415
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,280
Ka and Long.

416
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,140
Welcome.

417
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,400
Hello.

418
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,040
Hello, everyone.

419
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,700
Hello, everyone.

420
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,440
Today is the solo match.

421
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,180
There are 84 online contestants

422
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,530
today.

423
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,510
Have you read the list?

424
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,270
When the list was just released,

425
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,340
we have read it carefully.

426
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,970
Because there are many famous broadcasters,

427
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,710
the King Of Underdogs, right?

428
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
Yes.

429
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,090
Tian of the JR Team has also signed up.

430
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,020
He has made a lot of fancy operations

431
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,260
in recent live streamings.

432
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:51,900
But

433
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,100
I don't know whether we can

434
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,810
become war reporters

435
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,350
like we were in the qualifying stage?

436
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,110
Actually,

437
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,660
I'm also looking forward to Tian's performance this time.

438
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,710
Besides, teams like

439
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,140
24K, OP and AOE

440
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,880
all send their in service players

441
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,520
to attend this contest.

442
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,210
I believe this will be

443
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,740
a very attractive competition.

444
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,580
Okay,

445
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,210
I announce the game

446
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,470
starts now.

447
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,450
Tian is the first one to do skydiving.

448
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,260
But isn't it too early

449
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,800
to jump now?

450
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
I think this

451
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,190
is probably to buy time.

452
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,260
He wants to get the weapon first.

453
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,120
Nice!

454
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,820
Tian got three points first.

455
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,780
The rule of this game

456
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,370
is the same as our League.

457
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,730
The top four survivors

458
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,430
can get 10 to 4 points.

459
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,140
In the first round,

460
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,560
one can get three points to kill one.

461
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,530
Two points for killing each, in the second round.

462
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,360
One point, in the last round.

463
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,020
Although Tian scored,

464
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,980
he exposed his position.

465
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,860
I don't know why

466
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,180
he insisted on using that grenade.

467
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,970
This position is quite suitable for sniping.

468
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,180
I see.

469
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:29,840
Tian.

470
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,870
Can you show us

471
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,060
your marksmanship?

472
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,750
Grenade?

473
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,840
You didn't pick up the guns again, did you?

474
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,250
Oh.

475
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,190
So, Tian is here to fight.

476
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,520
He misled the people around him

477
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,900
by making them think he didn't pick up the guns.

478
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,410
The people surrounding him

479
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,510
are all dead.

480
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,510
Your thesis is interesting.

481
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,830
The degree of product recreation to the real world

482
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,850
will affect the users' intuitive feelings.

483
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,000
Let me take a closer look.

484
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,010
The research direction is good.

485
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,630
Maybe

486
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,300
all developers will be inspired.

487
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,500
Thank you.

488
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,950
Sir,

489
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,860
I have something urgent.

490
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,720
Can I leave earlier now?

491
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,670
After the revision,

492
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,580
I will send it to you at once.

493
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,780
Thank you.

494
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,050
Goodbye, teacher.

495
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,850
Quadra kill. Quadra kill.

496
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,150
Triple kill.

497
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,370
Quadra kill.

498
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,420
-Good. -Chu Tian can make it.

499
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:42,750
Good.

500
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,010
How is it?

501
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,120
He's in the top three now.

502
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,090
Total score ranks the second.

503
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,160
The former captain of the OP Team, Han Peng, is also here.

504
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,100
Otherwise, Chu Tian would be the overwhelming champion.

505
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,710
Now Chu Tian is six points behind Captain Han.

506
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,910
The third place is more than 30 points behind him.

507
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,610
The champion must be the cute Chu Tian.

508
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,140
He is indeed the genius boy.

509
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,500
He deserves his reputation.

510
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,240
He's really good at shooting.

511
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:01,930
Okay.

512
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,230
Now it's the final circle.

513
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:04,970
Okay.

514
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,460
Tian eliminated the

515
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,420
Luke and Simba of

516
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,020
the second-line AOE Team.

517
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
It's definitely overwhelming.

518
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,010
Okay, let's take a look.

519
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,230
Captain Han just got three points.

520
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,420
Now there're only two soldiers

521
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,970
on the battlefield.

522
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,410
Tian!

523
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,340
Tian!

524
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,810
Tian just eliminated Captain Han.

525
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,520
He won the first place in this round.

526
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:35,980
Okay.

527
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,470
Let's connect

528
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,750
the first place today, Tian.

529
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:42,790
Hello.

530
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,170
Xiao Yichuan, did you see the contest?

531
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,400
I got the first place.

532
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,750
Is he taking credit now?

533
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,370
I think he's acting cute.

534
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,320
I didn't expect that the first person he shared with

535
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,260
would be

536
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,460
his captain,

537
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,720
Tianyi.

538
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,700
He's quite considerate.

539
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:57,560
Yes.

540
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,560
You should wear your earphones when you're caring.

541
00:30:59,580 --> 00:30:59,940
Tian.

542
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:00,530
Can you hear me?

543
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,210
Hello?

544
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:05,760
Sorry.

545
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,420
-Chu Tian is so cute. -What are you talking about?

546
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,880
No wonder everyone loves him.

547
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,100
Don't hang up.

548
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,070
Let me listen to Chuan's voice again.

549
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,480
Captain Wang,

550
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,330
come and get him.

551
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,330
Congrates.

552
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,250
I knew our Chu Tian would be the champion.

553
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:30,790
Hey.

554
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,520
I just watched your live stream review.

555
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,820
Is your shooting accuracy

556
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,500
improved again?

557
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,700
What do you think?

558
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,190
Chu Tian has transferred the awards and bonus

559
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,340
of the Talent Contest.

560
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,020
With the one

561
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,360
we got before,

562
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,280
Xiao Yichuan's endorsement

563
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,830
and the earnings from the live streaming...

564
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,200
Is there still a big difference?

565
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,740
About one third.

566
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,400
It's mainly because it's the last three days.

567
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,820
Even if we can get the investment and cooperation,

568
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:10,810
the process

569
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,240
will also take a long time.

570
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,770
Unless they

571
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,020
open a green channel for us.

572
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,800
Meet the last client tomorrow.

573
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,490
It's introduced by Miss. Chu Tian.

574
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,320
Let's directly negotiate with them

575
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,180
based on the current funding gap.

576
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,370
It's our last chance.

577
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,000
This is a make or break moment.

578
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,060
Alright.

579
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,070
It's getting late.

580
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,410
Go back and rest early.

581
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:38,970
Okay.

582
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,120
Mr. Dong.

583
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,070
Jiujiu.

584
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,390
You're still here?

585
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,570
I came to

586
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,700
send the meal for Dong Shi.

587
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,320
Please deliver this to him.

588
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:57,660
Mr. Dong.

589
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,580
Aren't you going in to see him inside?

590
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,020
I don't want to

591
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,470
waste your time.

592
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,540
Take care.

593
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,200
Okay.

594
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,580
Hello, boss.

595
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,750
I'm downstairs.

596
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,630
I'll be there soon.

597
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,020
Okay.

598
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:33,990
I'm in the elevator now.

599
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,340
We meet again.

600
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,880
Yes.

601
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,620
What a coincidence.

602
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,060
You come here for business cooperation?

603
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,140
This floor seems to be a Taobao shop, right?

604
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,160
What do you want to say?

605
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,330
Have you read the team information

606
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,950
I gave Chuan last time?

607
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,850
The offers they provide to Chuan

608
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,150
can't be provided

609
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,460
by your JR Sports, right?

610
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,610
Even though we can't now,

611
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,060
it doesn't mean we can't in the future.

612
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,170
Can he wait?

613
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:21,580
That's his own business.

614
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,850
It has nothing to do with you.

615
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,159
Have you ever thought about it?

616
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,620
Stop lying to yourself.

617
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,120
We all know

618
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,460
you're wasting his time.

619
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,360
You can't give him anything,

620
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,420
but you still want him to

621
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,980
sacrifice his career for you.

622
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,820
This is between us.

623
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,580
You don't have to define it.

624
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,140
I know you like him.

625
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,240
But first of all,

626
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,670
he is a professional E-sports player.

627
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,050
Then he's the one you like.

628
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:09,930
Let him go.

629
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,180
We're too optimistic.

630
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,840
Hello?

631
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,710
I'm Xiong Jiujiu.

632
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,980
We'll pay the deposit

633
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,400
as soon as possible.

634
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,650
Thank you.

635
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,700
Did the organizing committee urge you again?

636
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,460
Yes.

637
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:52,860
Now,

638
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,070
it seems that

639
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,500
we are the last who didn't pay yet.

640
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,710
If we don't pay

641
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,940
before the day after tomorrow,

642
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,490
it may be considered as quitting.

643
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,830
Leave it alone.

644
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,030
It's meaningless to find to the sponsorship.

645
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,150
I'll try to borrow some.

646
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,910
Don't forget the steamed fish tonight.

647
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,230
But first of all,

648
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,630
he is a professional E-sports player.

649
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,060
Then he's the one you like.

650
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,450
Let him go.

651
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,770
Are we

652
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,600
quitting the competition?

653
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,300
Come in, Ya.

654
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,730
The meal is ready.

655
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,100
You can wash your hands and come to eat.

656
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,350
Who are you?

657
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,940
I...

658
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,100
You...

659
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,270
Are you the nanny?

660
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,620
A few days ago,

661
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,300
I asked Chuan

662
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,390
to find a nanny to cook for him.

663
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,610
Young people like you

664
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,020
eat takeouts all the time.

665
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,760
Son.

666
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,650
You're back.

667
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,170
Why

668
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,550
are all here?

669
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,190
I asked Ya to pick me up.

670
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,410
It's been a long time since you went home.

671
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,210
Let's go.

672
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,030
Let's dig in first.

673
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,100
Come here, son.

674
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:32,690
Come.

675
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,320
Sit here.

676
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,360
Here, Ya.

677
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,780
Auntie, I'll go get the chopsticks.

678
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,230
Okay.

679
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,300
Son, sit here.

680
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,940
You don't miss me.

681
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,930
So I came all the way to see you.

682
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,240
You have no conscience.

683
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,260
I didn't expect you

684
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,550
to pester him like this.

685
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,780
I told you

686
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,990
I'll be responsible for him.

687
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,140
Also,

688
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,970
don't act like you know him well.

689
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,390
Auntie.

690
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:06,780
Yes.

691
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,470
Have a seat.

692
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:07,890
Mom.

693
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,610
She is...

694
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,510
I'm not done yet.

695
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,960
Let me help you.

696
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:11,530
No need.

697
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,450
It'll be ready soon.

698
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,580
Ya.

699
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,180
Yes.

700
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,340
In future,

701
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,180
please visit Chuan with me often.

702
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,730
No problem.

703
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,900
As long as he's available.

704
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,740
It won't take him too long

705
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,110
to get along with his girlfriend.

706
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:28,900
Mom.

707
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,750
That's enough.

708
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,420
Shi Ya and I are just friends.

709
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,620
Don't worry for me.

710
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,570
Do you have to do this?

711
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,580
Auntie, the dishes are ready. Enjoy your meal.

712
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,430
Yes.

713
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,300
-Thank you. -Okay.

714
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,830
I'll get going then.

715
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,400
Okay.

716
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,070
Son.

717
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,010
The nanny is gone.

718
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,320
Where are you going?

719
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,180
Where are you going?

720
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,350
Enjoy your meal.

721
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,350
I'll come to you later.

722
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,580
Xiao Yichuan,

723
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,740
I've been sitting here for a long time.

724
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,110
Can you please look at me?

725
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Think for yourself.

726
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,630
Don't waste your time on me.

727
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,380
If you still want to

728
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,330
be friend with me.

729
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,510
And Mom.

730
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,020
Ah?

731
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,370
Her name is Xiong Jiujiu.

732
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,090
She's not a nanny.

733
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:14,990
She's my girlfriend.

734
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,800
What?

735
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:16,930
You...

736
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:25,690
Wait.

737
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,180
I didn't know my mom and Shi Ya would come.

738
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,290
Don't be angry.

739
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,930
I'm not angry.

740
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,980
Go back and eat dinner.

741
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,180
I'm already out.

742
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,040
Why should I go back?

743
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,170
Okay.

744
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,740
I'm here today

745
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,470
to tell you something.

746
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,620
Then I'll say it here.

747
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,360
Let's terminate the three-month contract.

748
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,020
Say that again.

749
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,350
You said you weren't angry?

750
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,390
I'm not.

751
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,120
The condition of our team

752
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,220
is totally bad.

753
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,670
We haven't pay the deposit

754
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,860
for the competition.

755
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,440
We have to pay for it no later than the day after tomorrow.

756
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,160
The organizing committee has been urging me.

757
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,730
I can't promise you

758
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,790
I can get the deposit in one day.

759
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,060
And I can't guarantee that

760
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,120
our team

761
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,510
can still participate in the League Tournament.

762
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,590
You should have come to me...

763
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,520
I brought you into the team,

764
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,410
so I should be responsible for you.

765
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,700
After the agreement is terminated,

766
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,230
please take good care of your health,

767
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,280
and think about going to another team.

768
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,850
You should spend your time

769
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,880
on something more meaningful.

770
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,500
I shouldn't drag you down.

771
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,750
I don't think you are holding me back.

772
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,910
Dong shi said

773
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,420
he felt sorry for you

774
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,530
if he couldn't get the deposit.

775
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,180
Actually, Shi Ya is right.

776
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,640
You deserve better.

777
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,250
I shouldn't be so selfish to hold you back.

778
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:14,980
Shi Ya...

779
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:15,840
She can introduce you

780
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,230
a better club.

781
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,230
As for Chu Tian,

782
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,450
if

783
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,150
he still wants to continue his career,

784
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,230
SIK has been poaching him.

785
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,620
At least in this season,

786
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,820
he can broaden his horizon

787
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,010
with them.

788
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,210
As for Hong Yang...

789
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,330
He just graduated.

790
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,590
-He has other options to choose. -Are you done?

791
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,550
You've arranged

792
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,550
for everyone.

793
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,470
But have you thought about what others think?

794
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,140
Let me take you to a place.

795
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,130
This is where

796
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,540
I first competed

797
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,470
as a professional E-sports player.

798
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,380
It's not a good memory,

799
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,590
but this stage

800
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,000
is my first step towards my dream.

801
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,980
In the past few years,

802
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,310
I've been in many teams.

803
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,250
But only JR Team gives me a sense of belonging.

804
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,060
The meaning of JR Team

805
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,700
is irreplaceable.

806
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,340
I may never told you

807
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,580
that I'd like to stay in JR.

808
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,620
But if I don't want to stay,

809
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,050
no one can keep me here.

810
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,320
During the time I spent with you guys,

811
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,210
I gradually regained

812
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,840
the passion of becoming a professional player.

813
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,280
I used to think

814
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,990
I had to rely on myself.

815
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,780
But now I realize

816
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,240
it's also fun to achieve goals

817
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,440
with everyone.

818
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,400
Have you forgotten

819
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,090
how much you promised me

820
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,600
when you came to me?

821
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,760
Why are you giving up now?

822
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,640
I don't want to give up either.

823
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,740
But to me,

824
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,070
you're not just a team member

825
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,620
or a partner.

826
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,300
You're still the one

827
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,260
I've kept in mind

828
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,170
and waited for a long time.

829
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,840
I was thinking

830
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,120
since God

831
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,890
let us meet again,

832
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,090
I hope this could be a happy ending.

833
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,230
You have your own path to go.

834
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,410
You also have your own dream to fulfill.

835
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,790
If I can't be your partner,

836
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,700
at least...

837
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,990
At least I shouldn't have held you back.

838
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,300
Xiong Jiujiu.

839
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,670
I find you are really stupid.

840
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,750
We are already on the same path.

841
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,180
Let's face the difficulties together.

842
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,290
You're not the only one

843
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,240
who loves the team.

844
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:30,810
During this period,

845
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,230
none of us let up.

846
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,540
Don't you understand?

847
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,770
Even if we don't want to leave the team,

848
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,590
-we only have one day left. -How much is the deposit?

849
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,140
I'll pay if it's not enough.

850
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,100
Is this enough?

851
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,730
Are you serious?

852
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,390
I can't watch us quit.

853
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,740
And like you said,

854
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,420
we are split by other teams?

855
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,180
And even let Chu Tian go to the SIK

856
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:11,700
as a substitute.

857
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,440
Do you want to see that?

858
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,600
Consider it a loan.

859
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,330
I'll let you pay me back by yourself this time.

860
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,320
Okay?

861
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,780
When I first came here,

862
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,210
I thought I was close to my dream,

863
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,040
close enough to reach out and grab it.

864
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:48,650
The following three years,

865
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,530
I came here for many competitions.

866
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,660
Every time,

867
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,180
I would subconsciously look at there,

868
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,270
hoping you would be there.

869
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,580
It's painful to miss you.

870
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,220
I don't want to experience it again.

871
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,440
Xiong Jiujiu.

872
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,280
I owe you a sentence for three years.

873
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,160
I like you.

874
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,230
Let's be together.
