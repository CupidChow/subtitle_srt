arranges Chuan

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,520
with this kind of advertising.

5
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,840
It's a miracle

00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,380
he didn't hit you.

7
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,930
Xiong Jiujiu is there to handle it.

8
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,300
Besides,

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,970
he probably doesn't even know

10
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,350
the ad has already been released.

11
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,390
Chuan's first ad.

12
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,330
It's unforgettable for a lifetime.

13
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm telling you.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,600
I will remember Chuan's favor on this

15

for the rest of my life.

Do I have something on my face?

17

I'll give you ten seconds to confess.

18

One, two, ten.

19

Chu Tian, you go ahead.

20
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,030
Your new ad

21
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,870
is very cool.

22

Stop there.

23
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,830
Is my Weibo account fun to run?

24
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,150
You gave me the account and password.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,310
I didn't allow you to post ads.

26
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:08,940
Delete it.

27
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,740

30
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,060
since you've shot the ad, you're not afraid to post it,

31

right?

32

What's wrong with you?

33
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,870
I guess I can forgive you.

34

Good luck with my buddy's endorsement sales.

Hahaha.

Remember to wear long underwear of Xiao Yichuan brand.

This spokesman looks familiar.

47
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,170
Kind of cool.

48
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,240
I'm going to create sales for Chuan.

You're not a true fan if you don't buy it.

-Yesterday, we just watched Chuan's amazing show for free.
-It's even an all-star show.

Boss said

61
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,220
if the team doesn't make it to the finals, we'll all be replaced.

62
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,430
But a team as strong as SIK

63
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,020
has only made it to the top 8

64

Are you afraid?

No.

68

If you make it to the final,

69
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,790
you won't even have to worry about your next life.

what I want

74

75
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,380
I want to be a strong

77
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,420
I just really want to win.

We share the same goal.

79
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,420
I'll talk to the coaches

80
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,050
and make them match your style of play.

81
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,370
After all, it's mainly all up to you

82
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,250
to score for the team.

83
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,620

Come on.

87
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,390
Your problem

88
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,020
is caused by high-intensity forced force

89
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,740
in a short period of time.

90
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,270
It's an acute inflammation

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,250
and is pretty serious.

92
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,380
The same thing happened last time.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,680
Do I just have to get an anti-inflammatory injection?

94
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,300
Do it now.

95
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,410
I have to go back to training.

96
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,000
Were you so stiff last time that you couldn't move?

97
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,840
Now move your finger.

98
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,380
If you can move it,

99
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,520
I'll let you go back to training right away.

100

If you don't want your hand to be disabled,

101
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,340
do as I say.

102
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,260
I still have a few reports unreleased.

103
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,660
I'll go check them out.

Be happy.

111

Maybe later.

112
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,790
I still need to practice my shooting accuracy,

113
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,390
so that I can reduce early fire mistakes.

114

The training game yesterday

132
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,030
is already considered all-star

133

134

The old masters Wang Boyu and Xiao Yichuan

continued their stable performance.

136

In fact, the biggest surprise for me was

Yang and CEO from the JR Team.

138
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,140

But this time, they've made up for it very well.

The overall strength of the JR Team now

174
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,370
Hurry over.

175
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,430
Go.

176
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,980
Go.

177
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,460
Why are you always looking at me?

178
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,600
Go on, go.

179
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,580
Hurry up and catch up with it.

180
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,370
Look at them.

181
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,430
Don't be a disgrace to me.

182
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,320
Go on.

183
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,160
[Dr. Chen]

184
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,700
Hello, Dr. Chen.

185
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,580
Chuan.

186
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,300
The report is out.

187
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,220
It's not very optimistic.

188
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,420
Well,

189
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,660
come to the hospital earlier.

190
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,500
I'll wait for you.

191
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,500
That's about it.

192
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,620
Let's pack up and go back.

193
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,140
Drink some water.

194
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,670
No, I don't want any.

195
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:42,860
I have an appointment with overseas teams

196
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,090
for an online training game tomorrow morning.

197
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,380
It's at 9:00.

198
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,600
Let's go.

199
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,630
I see.

200
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,060
You go back first.

201
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,790
What about you?

202
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,370
I have something else to do.

203
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,330
I'll be back later.

204
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,270
Something else?

205
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,540
What do you have to do?

206
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,160
I mean,

207
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,590
what have you been doing all day?

208
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,820
Don't worry about adults' business.

209
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,060
How about...

210
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,970
another round?

211
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,820
Come on.

212
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,320
Xiao Yichuan.

213
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,710
The knockout match is in four days.

214
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,870
Are you focusing on the match?

215
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,190
Enjoy it yourself.

216
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,920
Don't take it personally.

217
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,710
Chu Tian is just a child.

218
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,410
I think you are too.

219
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,860
I have followed

220
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,820
TLO Global league.

221
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,490
In fact, I've known about you for a long time.

222
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,460
I've heard a lot of

223
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,500
online criticism about you over the years.

224
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,220
But I can feel

225
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,150
that you're

226
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,170
not really like that.

227
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,820
But telling from how you've acted today…

228
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,300
Is there something on your mind?

229
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:24,820
Senior.

230
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,730
No need to tell me.

231
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,480
This is your secret.

232
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,430
I believe you know how to face it.

233
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,620
The match is around the corner.

234
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,950
Xiao Yichuan still asked Chu Tian to play basketball?

235
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,650
They even fought over this?

236
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,470
How old are they?

237
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,280
It's not that serious.

238
00:14:59,420 --> 00:14:59,980
Chuan

239
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,540
just wanted to give Chu Tian a change in mood.

240
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,130
But Chu Tian is very strict with himself.

241
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,450
They've been fighting like this

242
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,670
all the way.

243
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,900
Don't worry about it.

244
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,320
I know clearly of my brother.

245
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,660
Tian is just afraid

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,480
that Chuan can go downhill

247
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,540
without training for a long time.

248
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,500
As for Chuan…

249
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,300
I think Chuan

250
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,930
is trying to train Chu Tian as a commander.

251
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,810
Xiao Yichuan told you?

252
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,380
Who am I?

253
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,390
I can see it myself.

254
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,700
Since the play-in match,

255
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,140
Capt. Qin and Chuan

256
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,700
have always made Chu Tian command.

257
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,170
And

258
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,660
they're getting more and more strict

259
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,530
on Chu Tian in training.

260
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,730
I can see that.

261
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Chu Tian has the strength.

262
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
But he's still in the dark.

263
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,540
He doesn't understand Chuan's intentions.

264
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,940
That's why

265
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,800
he was so angry.

266
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,380
At first, I didn't agree with him playing professionally.

267
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,860
Now it seems

268
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,940
I underestimated him.

269
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,540
Xiao Yichuan is a commander himself, isn't he?

270
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,050
Why does he need to train Chu Tian?

271
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,860
Which team doesn't have a commander reserve?

272
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,060
Moreover,

273
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,710
Chuan is not so young

274
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,250
as a professional player.

275
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,860
And he encounters

276
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,150
Chu Tian, a good talent,

277
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,720
who he cherishes and protects.

278
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,550
And

279
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,480
I can understand

280
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,780
Chuan's feelings about training Chu Tian.

281
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,820
After all,

282
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,450
we're both Chu Tian's brothers-in-law.

283
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,130
Then may I ask which sister of Chu Tian

284
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,950
is your girlfriend?

285
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,830
Of course, it's you, who is gentle, kind, beautiful, and generous.

286
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,960
Did I say yes?

287
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,540
Then I'm at least a prospective brother-in-law.

288
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,290
I'll take that as a yes.

289
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,920
Let's move on to the next topic.

290
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,640
Well.

291
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,430
How can a prospective brother-in-law

292
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,250
quickly become a rea lone?

293
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,260
Show me the way.

294
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,570
I suggest you withdraw from the competition.

295
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,250
Now not only the fourth finger

296
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,830
of your right hand,

297
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,020
but also the third interphalangeal metacarpal muscle

298
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,540
have muscle deformation.

299
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,630
If you overexert yourself again,

300
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,980
and the thenar muscles atrophy appears,

301
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,260
most of your hand

302
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,770
will lose sensation.

303
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,780
If you wait until then to operate,

304
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,460
the risk of surgery will also increase.

305
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,060
The effect of surgery

306
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,240
will also be greatly reduced.

307
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,950
As soon as I finish the competition,

308
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,130
I'll have surgery right away.

309
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,910
Is that okay?

310
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,680
What about the knock-out match?

311
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,220
You see,

312
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,220
I'm following your advice

313
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,980
and getting an infusion.

314
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,270
Why don't you give me two more days?

315
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,800
I'll try not to move for a few days

316
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,330
and wait to play for the game.

317
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,490
It's only in three days.

318
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,050
You don't want this hand anymore, do you?

319
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,620
The muscles being atrophied

320
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,360
and the neural tube being lost and replaced by collagen tissue

321
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,300
are irreversible changes.

322
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,230
They can't be saved by surgery.

323
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,870
Dr. William is coming to China

324
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,780
this weekend.

325
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,040
I can arrange a meeting for you.

326
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,600
So I advise you

327
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,350
not to delay any longer.

328
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,610
And don't even think about going to the competition before it's too late.

329
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,540
Today is for the senior thesis guidance.

330
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,850
Your essay is generally quite good

331
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,270
with a special topic.

332
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,580
The balance between professional teams'

333
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,980
business value and professional ability

334
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,420
is indeed the key practice of Sports Management.

335
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,920
There are some details that need to be revised

336
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,710
There are some details that need to be revised according to what I said.

337
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,340
And you should be able to wait for the oral defense.

338
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,860
Thank you, ma'am.

339
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,920
How's your internship going?

340
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,540
After this season,

341
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,960
your internship will be up, right?

342
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,060
Yes.

343
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,350
We're getting ready for the competition this weekend.

344
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,430
Can you get the job later?

345
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,370
Still planning on staying at JR Sports.

346
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,340
as a team manager?

347
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,920
I'm not sure yet.

348
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,240
I guess the results

349
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,140
of this competition

350
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,510
will be a watershed

351
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,530
for the future of the team.

352
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,180
But

353
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,930
I still have confidence in them.

354
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,170
It doesn't matter

355
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,220
what the result will be,

356
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,100
even if we have to start all over again.

357
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,520
The way you look now is typical of

358
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,080
a child who grows up in the ivory tower.

359
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,320
You haven't seen many setbacks.

360
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,420
You're simple

361
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,210
and pure,

362
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,950
desperate for a promise,

363
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,360
living on hopes and aspirations.

364
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,890
Although I shouldn't discourage you

365
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,380
and I appreciate

366
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,350
that you know how to give,

367
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,670
you're going to

368
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,820
graduate soon.

369
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,970
You have to face the reality in society.

370
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,940
Any choice can more or less

371
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,540
affect your future life.

372
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,130
I hope you won't forget your original intention,

373
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,320
but you must also learn to seize the opportunity

374
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,700
and meet the challenges.

375
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,500

378
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,440
Hello?

379
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,780
You're getting really needy.

380
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,230
What are you doing?

381
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,580
Training?

382
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,580
No.

383
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,360
I'm...

384
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,590
Missing you.

385
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,220
I'm just saying

386
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,320
why I sneezed so much.

387
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,120
It tuned out you were thinking of me.

388
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,570
It's an early end to the day.

389
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,540
Are they all asleep?

390
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,660
Yes.

-Tell me.
-Tell me.

392
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,470
You first.

393
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,740
Tell me

394
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,430
are we going to make it?

395
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,750
I'm not pressuring you.

396
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,820
I just hope

397
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,370
we can always be together.

398
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,940
I've realized in the past few months with you

399
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,930
that everyone being there for each other

400
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,930
is what makes a team.

401
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:23,900
So

402
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,690
no matter what the result is,

403
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,790
I hope we don't get separated.

You choose to stay with us.

407

What's wrong?

408
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,490
Why do you ask that?

409
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:00,930
Nothing.

410
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,690
I just think

411
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,290
it's a bliss

412
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,020
to make sure of one's own path

413
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,880
and go on with determination

414
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,780
and no setbacks.

Just like you,

also learns how to run.

Why are you

starting to be mean again?

420
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,750
I don't care about other people.

It's late.

Go to bed now.

423
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,590
You have electricity in the dorm today, right?

424
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,820
Yes.

It's not like I forget to buy electricity every day.

All right.

427
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,790
Go to bed.

428
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,660
Okay.

Qin Zheng.

438
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,430
Are you going to buy the house or not?

439
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,030
The wedding date has been set.

440
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,740
All the relatives in the family have also been notified.

441
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,290
But you haven't even bought a house yet.

442
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,680
Where are you going to live then?

443
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,010
We can rent a larger house

444
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,380
and wait for a suitable property.

445
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,250
You won't get married without a house.

446
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,330
Her father and I won't compromise on this.

447
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,800
It's not that we won't buy.

448
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,420
We just planned

449
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,350
to rent a house for the time being.

450
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,220
Renting a house and owning a house

451
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,770
are always different.

452
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,580
I think there is no difference.

453
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,470
Come here.

454
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,860
What's wrong with you now?

455
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,400
You can't tell the good from the bad, can you?

456
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,730
For whose sake did I insist on buying a house?

457
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,060
It's for you.

458
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,170
I want to buy a house too.

459
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,410
But we didn't find the right one.

460
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,740
We'll get married first

461
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,360
and buy a suitable house later.

462
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,870
Why are you so ignorant?

463
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,980
If you don't listen to me now,

464
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,150
you can regret it later.

465
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,880
This is our situation.

466
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,200
It's not like Qin Zheng doesn't work hard.

467

No matter how hard you push him,

468
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,070
can he offer the money that way?

469
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,150
Then don't get married.

And there was still a huge traffic jam.

Why are you so early too?

I don't think it's about time.

488

00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,500
What time is it?

516
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,520
The training game is at 9 am.

517
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,940
I told you.

518
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,480
Then why don't you go?

519
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,050
I should have said that to you.

520
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:40,840
Xiao Yichuan.

521
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,790
Do you not want to practice properly?

522
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,480
Or did one of us upset you again?

523
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,949
So you're showing your dissatisfaction

524
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,940
by this, right?

525
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,040
Can you pick another time?

526
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,360
After the competition in several days,

527
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,480
you can do whatever you want.

528
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,220
Okay?

529
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,900
So you

530
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,050
go back to training

531
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,860
right now.

532
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,100
I'll make another appointment with them.

533
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,410
Go.

534
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,010
I'm not going.

535
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,700
What did you say?

536
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,480
I said

537
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,700
I'm not going.

538
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,690
Okay.

539
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,190
Then you're no longer my brother.

540
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,550
The training game is over.

541
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,640
I asked Wang Boyu for the video of the game.

542
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,370
Come over and review it.

543
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:47,950
What's going on?

544
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,180
Why don't you even close the door at home?

545
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,740
Why didn't you answer your phone?

546
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,770
Dong Shi and others have called me several times…

547
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,260
Are you not feeling well?

548
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,820
Are you okay?

549
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,760
Does your hand hurt?

550
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,880
Why don't you give me a look?

551
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,220
Xiong Jiujiu.

552
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,540
My dream is gone.

553
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,840
Chu Tian.

554
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,850
Chuan can't play anymore.

555
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,610
What do you mean he can't play?

556
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,770
I just saw him.

557
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,860
He was at home, wasn't he?

558
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,260
Chuan's hand has been injured

559
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,680
from the time he joined the team.

560
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,310
After the last tournament,

561
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,300
he's already been in the hospital.

562
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,230
The doctor advised him to quit a long time ago.

563
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:55,610
But

564
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,920
he wanted to go on with us.

565
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,520
He was also afraid that you'd be worried

566
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,910
and ruin your pre-game state,

567
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,240
so he kept it a secret from you.

568
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,910
Okay, put it on.

569
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:36,830
Okay.

570
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,350
I re-tied the pressure band for you.

571
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,450
But your hand pain

572
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,120
is still caused by the previous hand injury.

573
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,860
Dr. Chen.

574
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,330
How bad

575
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,950
is his hand?

576
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,100
The muscle strength is decreasing.

577
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,490
The atrophy has also increased.

578
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,560
The median nerve is also showing signs of fibrosis.

579
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,740
So?

580
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,380
If he still won't listen to me,

581
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,670
even the gods can't save him.

582
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,110
Let's

583
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,780
quit the competition, okay?

584
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,860
Okay?

585
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,490
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

586
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,690
Afraid that I would worry?

587
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,020
I'm sorry.

588
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,660
Look.

589
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,590
Every day,

590
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,520
there are many people coming here.

591
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,460
Every day,

592
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,800
there are also many people leaving.

593
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,500
Everyone encounters their own difficulties every day.

594
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,080
There are only results,

595
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,470
and no hypotheses

596
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,260
for many things in life.

597
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,340
I know

598
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,090
this isn't the result you want.

599
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:53,800
But don't forget

600
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,160
I'm here to face it with you.

601
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,710
But I'm not ready for that.

602
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,950
It's okay.

603
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,710
Just remember,

604
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,880
I'm still here with you.

605
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,180
I know.

606
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,340
I know

607
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,040
how much E-sports means to you.

608
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,440
You love it

609
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,600
just like I love you.

610
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:45,890
I say I love you.

611
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,200
I will always be with you.

612
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:41,660
I'm sorry.

613
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,450
You're such a good kid.

614
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,580
How could I blame you?

615
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,390
20-year-old Xiao Yichuan,

616
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,550
I'm the 20-year-old Chu Tian.

617
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,680
Leave your dream

618
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,830
to me to realize.
