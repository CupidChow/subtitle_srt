is not good at talking, but he's actually very nice.

174
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,100
Didn't you see

175
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,410
-he even stopped that woman for you? -Get out of my car if you talk.

176
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,650
Here we are.

177
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,740
Thank you.

178
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,700
Bye, miss.

179
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,120
Remember to add me on WeChat.

180
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,740
Okay, we're here.

181
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,580
This is the girl's dorm Building B.

182
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,180
Here it is.

183
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,390
-Okay, thank you. -I'm leaving, bye.

184
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,000
Sorry.

Please try again later.

196
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,720
Hello?

197
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,460
Hello?

198
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,100
Hey.

199
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,310
Hey.

200
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,440
Do you want midnight snacks, Chuan?

201
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,860
Stop calling me Chuan.

202
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,680
Let's go home.

203
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,540
Okay, Chuan.

204
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,190
God poured wisdom all over the world

205
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,860
but gave you an umbrella.

206
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,080
Why didn't I think of this?

207
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,010
He even said I'm a thug.

208
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,380
I should have beaten him to death.

209
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,250
One minute of anger

210
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,770
means 60 seconds of unhappiness.

211
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,210
An hour of anger

212
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,620
means 60 minutes of stupidity.

213
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,500
I'll pretend to be deaf if someone pisses me off.

214
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,570
Let him be.

215
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,580
What time is it?

216
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,730
I need to do live streaming.

217
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,680
I can't let him affect my career.

218
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,900
Although it's late today,

219
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,670
the Bear's live room

220
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,900
is here to recommend delicious food to you.

221
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,650
This is today's star product,

222
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,830
the best plum juice.

223
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,490
Have a taste.

224
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,130
Nice.

225
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,310
Sweet but not greasy.

226
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,220
What time is it?

227
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,859
Isn't it 11:30?

228
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,890
The watch is not accurate.

229
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:19,810
Look at your phone.

230
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,260
Don't you have phone?

231
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,760
She hasn't added me yet.

232
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,080
I'll let you know as soon as she adds me.

233
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,090
Chuan,

234
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,370
I think

235
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,340
you're weird today.

236
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,580
Are you...

237
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,420
What did that girl do to you?

238
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:58,620
Look.

239
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,930
You broke her phone.

240
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,180
You helped her but said she was a thug.

241
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,090
Is this a new way to attract girls?

242
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,320
Unbelievable.

243
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,560
I really want to hit someone now.

244
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,600
Why don't you care

245
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,900
if you can survive tonight?

246
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,650
I'll give you ten minutes.

247
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,840
Clean up the house.

248
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,940
A man in a messy room

249
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,640
can be surrounded by girls.

250
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,350
Besides,

251
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,900
I was busy with the competition the other day.

252
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,180
I'm tired.

253
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,060
I heard.

254
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,260
Your team won the championship again.

255
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,600
Don't show off to me.

256
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,600
What's the use of these commercial champions?

257
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,870
Only the global league champions are meaningful.

258
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,010
However,

259
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,520
the word of "again" you used is very good.

260
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,330
It makes me feel very comfortable.

261
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,120
I bought your favorite functional drink.

262
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,430
It's really expensive.

263
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,870
This drink has too many calories.

264
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,920
If you drink two bottles,

265
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,980
you'll lose your abdominal muscle.

266
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,390
The functional drink is high calorie.

267
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,830
Stop talking.

268
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,930
Take off my pajamas.

269
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,050
Don't be so petty.

270
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,040
You wore my pajamas.

271
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,330
-Did you touch my... -No.

272
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,220
Absolutely not.

273
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,840
Seriously?

274
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,520
Which is more important, me or your sneakers?

275
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't ask such embarrassing questions.

276
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,080
If you have a girlfriend,

277
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,250
will you let her step on your sneakers and kiss you?

278
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,980
Of course not.

279
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,970
But

280
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,610
she can step on me

281
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,910
and kiss my sneakers.

282
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,670
You deserve to be single.

283
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,140
The plum juice is sweet.

284
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,540
-Why do I feel dizzy after drinking it? -Miss, this is wine.

285
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,230
This is wine.

286
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,400
Look carefully.

287
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,100
The streamer is so gentle.

288
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,630
I'm not gentle.

289
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,900
You are the gentlest.

290
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,690
Your whole family is gentle.

291
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,380
You said I was unhappy.

292
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,980
Why am I unhappy?

293
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,190
Of course I'm happy.

294
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,640
I'm the happiest in the world.

295
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,390
You said I was drunk.

296
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,250
How could I be drunk?

297
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,300
I'm not drunk at all.

298
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,060
Next time, let's have grape juice.

299
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,340
OK.

300
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,390
Streamer, please recommend diet snacks.

301
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,140
OK.

302
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,860
Lend me money.

303
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,250
OK.

304
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,380
Battle?

305
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,380
OK.

306
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,300
Tomorrow night.

307
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,370
Okay, no problem.

308
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,030
Chuan,

309
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,960
you're trending again.

310
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,940
Xiao Yichuan, an e-sports player, who has been away for days,

311
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,180
traveled with a girl late at night.

312
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,600
Isn't this Xiong Jiujiu?

313
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,200
I...

314
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,690
I was also in the car just now.

315
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,800
Why didn't anyone say anything about me?

316
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,260
They really treat me as your driver.

317
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,010
Awesome.

318
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,140
Don't surf the Internet.

319
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,990
Go to sleep.

320
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,490
I got the teddy bear you gave me.

321
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,070
Is it one of a pair?

322
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,240
Xiong Jiujiu .

323
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,620
Xiong Jiujiu.

324
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,420
She probably

325
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,280
forgot me.

326
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,920
Xiong Jiujiu.

327
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,750
Hong's call. He has something urgent.

328
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,200
He even called me.

329
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,190
Hi, Hong Yang.

330
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,480
Xiong Jiujiu.

331
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,910
Are you going to fight with ON team?

332
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,900
Ah.

333
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,430
Who should I fight with?

334
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,480
Let me introduce.

335
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,920
This game is called

336
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,760
[The Last One]

337
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,170
the Last One.

338
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,100
This is the map of this year.

339
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,800
About 60 square kilometers.

340
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,620
There are different areas

341
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,780
and buildings on this map.

342
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,790
There are random supplies in the buildings.

343
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,590
No more than 100 people per military exercise.

344
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,320

Poor guy.

514
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,030
I really want to help you.

515
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,790
But what should I do?

516
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,960
I can't get out of the training camp.

517
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,490
I'm worried about entrusting you to someone else.

518
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,340
Others can do it too.

519
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,780
Why don't you recommend someone

520
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,360
who are free, doesn't need training and won't break the rules to me?

521
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,610
Oh.

522
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,230
There really is one.

523
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,710
But he...

524
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,670
He has a bad temper.

525
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,340
You have to coax him.

526
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,190
It's okay.

527
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:30,940
[Room 701, Unit 1, Building 7, Huafei International, No.7 Xieyang Road]

528
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,590
Keep the old, you get nothing new.

529
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,570
We have to look forward.

530
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,950
Besides, dating can relieve stress.

531
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,950
Why does Xiao Yichuan have a good friend like me?

532
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,840
Remember, cheer him up.

533
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,460
No problem. Thank you.

534
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,610
This.

535
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,530
This.

536
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,220
No.

537
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,240
Gifts blind the eyes.

538
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,410
Come on!

539
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,500
Over-confident little streamer.

540
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,200
This battle will

541
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,710
let you know what is e-sports.

542
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,250
What time is it?

543
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,320
[The answer is on the way, don't be too touched.]

544
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,950
The answer is on the way.

545
00:33:59,050 --> 00:33:59,970
Don't be too touched.

546
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,880
Let me do it.

547
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,280
Don't use your hurt hand.

548
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,639
I hurt this one, okay?

549
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,179
Since one has been hurt,

550
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,389
the other one needs to be protected well.

551
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,340
Don't make a fuss.

552
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,580
Let me tell you.

553
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,870
I took two days off

554
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,430
for your hand.

555
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,140
From tomorrow on,

556
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,880
I have to make up 20 training hours.

557
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,990
Are you touched?

558
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,170
You only owe 20 hours.

559
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,200
I owe 2,000 training hours.

560
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,140
If I make up 6 hours a day, it'll take me a year to finish.

561
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,120
If I go on like this, I won't be a player anymore.

562
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,540
I heard the doctor you met in Australia

563
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,670
is professional.

564
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,050
What did he say?

565
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,360
Is your rehabilitation training useful?

566
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,780
Just so so.

567
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,990
My injury

568
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,430
is not that serious.

569
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,490
It's better to come back

570
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,910
than staying abroad.

571
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,550
Didn't you text me every day that you miss me?

572
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,240
But the doctor advised

573
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,490
you to have an operation.

574
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,490
Doctors like to scare people.

575
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,030
I just need to be careful.

576
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,240
Everyone in our industry has injuries.

577
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,050
Nothing serious.

578
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,500
Don't lie to me.

579
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,380
What's with that look?

580
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,220
I'm not terminally ill.

581
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,960
I appreciate your filial piety.

582
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,700
I won't die.

583
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,250
Xiao Yichuan,

584
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,720
don't always go your own way.

585
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,900
You can't bear it.

586
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,730
It’s for your own good.

587
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,490
Look how obedient other teammates are.

588
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,120
Look at you.

589
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:20,910
If I hadn't taken care of you,

590
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,510
could you have grown up like this?

591
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,110
What?

592
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,040
Wang Boyu, you've grown up.

593
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,770
Are you lecturing me?

594
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,590
Brother Chuan.

595
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,430
Brother Chuan.

596
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,780
I love you.

597
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,590
When you were not here,

598
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,600
there were many rumors.

599
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,000
Your anti-fan never stops.

600
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,940
My heart can't stand it.

601
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,820
Don't surf the Internet.

602
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,300
I think I have nothing to do

603
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,440
with your poor training hours.

604
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,520
In our industry,

605
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,580
players' careers don't last long.

606
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,310
It's only a matter of time before your condition decides.

607
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,640
You came back this time

608
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,940
because you're afraid you don't have time, right?

609
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
You think too much.

610
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,570
Some clubs are contacting me.

611
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,470
I’ll talk to them later.

612
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,420
Have a good chat.

613
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,300
Think carefully.

614
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,160
If you come back,

615
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,600
I'll be the happiest one.

616
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,640
Without you,

617
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,940
I don't even have fun playing games.

618
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:40,930
Hey.

619
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,830
Without Xiao Yichuan,

620
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,540
I feel lonely.

621
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,070
Your confession came so suddenly.

622
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,130
I can't accept it for a while.

623
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,730
Get lost!
