00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,840
What do you want from me?

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,060
Capt. Qin.

5
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:28,980
I guess Xiao Yichuan doesn't know

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,920
you were paid to

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,860
lose the game that he first officially participated

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,980
on purpose,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,440
right?

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,990
If you have something to say, just say it.

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,430
I want this card.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,400
You

13
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,330
bring Xiao Yichuan

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,020
to ON Team.

15
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,430
That's not gonna happen.

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,630
This card doesn't belong to me.

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,770
I heard you were planning to get married.

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,110
Are the wedding house and bride price

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,789
all prepared?

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,770
This is the internal subscription card

21
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:30,820
of the property you visited.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,240
Take it.

23
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,580
You'll get a good discount.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,450
As a benefit for company employees,

25
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,600
I don't mind giving it to you in advance.

26
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,600
I will also offer you and Xiao Yichuan

27
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,330
a very good transfer term.

28
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:46,740
Of course,

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,050
the breach of contract

30
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,670
will also be borne by us.

31
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,590
It's not the matter of money.

32
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,729
Capt. Qin.

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,420
You can't

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,560
feed on passion.

35
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,770
Running a team

36
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,550
is a business in nature.

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,340
This is the truth

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,050
you understood a few years early.

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,100
Didn't you?

40
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,720
I won't take anything.

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,160
I can ask Chuan's opinion first

42
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,550
at most.

[Episode 13]

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,650
I have a medical kit here.

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,230
Chu Tian, take it.

47
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,600
You keep it first.

48
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,750
Be careful about where you are.

49
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,380
Behind the stone.

50
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,860
53 seconds to shrink the circle.

51
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,380
Help me set up.

52
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,800
I'll go find an AK.

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,260
Watch out.

54
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,140
There's someone in front of us.

55
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,070
Second floor opposite.

56
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,990
There's one on the second floor.

57
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,660
Watch out.

58
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:09,930
Capt. Qin.

59
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,370
You can't see very well, can you?

60
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,120
Second floor.

61
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,590
Watch out for the grenade.

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,940
I'm throwing a grenade.

63
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,260
Hey.

64
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,900
Where are you going?

65
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,000
I said tomorrow we…

66
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,790
Are recording the show.

67
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,870
Wang Boyu told me.

68
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,130
Then why don't you get well prepared?

69
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,630
What's there to prepare for?

70
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,710
I'll improvise.

71
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,410
Um.

72
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,700
I have something to do tonight.

73
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,880
I might not be back.

74
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,430
See you tomorrow.

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,840
Hey.

76
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,920
I mean.

77
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,420
It's only been a few days since the game ended,

78
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,380
and this is already the second time of you going to the hospital.

79
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,480
I can't rest assured

80
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,770
without 24 hours of watch.

81
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,520
I went to the hospital as you told me to.

82
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,140
And I'm much better now.

83
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,130
Hey,

84
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:09,860
you see?

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,940
Leave it.

86
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,240
Xiong Jiujiu

87
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,130
can't take care of you

88
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,760
as well as I do.

89
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,160
What would you do

90
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,550
without me?

91
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,530
Just stay at home.

92
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,220
What would Xiong Jiujiu do without me?

93
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,980
You don't know her.

94
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,400
She's bad at everything

95
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,730
except being jealousy.

96
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,470
She's needy

97
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,980
just like you.

98
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,360
Drink your water.

99
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,680
So you're really going to

100
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,460
the show tomorrow?

101
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:44,940
Hmmm.

102
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,270
It's not appropriate to not go.

103
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,450
Lead the team,

104
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,640
and attend the show?

105
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,610
Xiao Yichuan.

106
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,370
What kind of power

107
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,220
has turned you who you're now?

108
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,880
When SIK was recording a show,

109
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,380
why didn't you quit?

110
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,990
We have different personas.

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,300
I've always been known as

112
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,340
friendly and easy-going.

113
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,590
And you?

114
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,380
Cool guy.

115
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,120
Let's see if this

116
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,940
can keep your mouth shut.

117
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,990
Well, no wonder.

118
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,350
You've got a girlfriend on the JR Team.

119
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,820
And a boyfriend too.

120
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,900
As your first official partner,

121
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
I feel very relieved.

122
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,650
How jealous.

123
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,310
Stop it.

124
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,580
They are…

125
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,690
Teammates.

126
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,990
That sounds even more jealousy, okay?

127
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,900
Chuan.

128
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,980
You've really changed.

129
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,460
You've become more…

130
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,370
like me now.

131
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,650
Wang Boyu.

132
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,300
Your sarcasm is excellent now.

133
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,220
You don't even swear anymore.

134
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,510
Tomorrow you're going to the show.

135
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,530
I'm going to choose our outfits,

136
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,310
see how we should match.

137
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,370
It's a pity your thick skin

138
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,430
is not used for level 3 armor.

139
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,170
Hey, Meng.

140
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,880
The house lottery has begun.

141
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,350
Since you all think the house is good,

142
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,860
let's do what you think.

143
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,210
About the down payment,

144
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,900
I'll keep it in mind.

145
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,470
Capt. Qin.

146
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,380
I'm busy here.

147
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,180
I'll talk to you later.

148
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,980
I'm hanging up.

149
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,020
Capt. Qin,

150
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,090
have you had breakfast?

151
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,980
Yes.

152
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,480
I came out for some fresh air.

153
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,750
Get in the car.

154
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,900
It's the auspicious time to go.

155
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,310
But

156
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,790
I think Xiao Yichuan hasn't arrived yet.

157
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,340
I've called.

158
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,770
He said he's waiting for us at the meeting place.

159
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,460
Get in the car. Get in the car.

160
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,850
Happy, joyous, pleasant.

161
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,090
Let's go.

162
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,060
Excuse me?

163
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,820
What brings

164
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,840
Miss. Chu here today?

165
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,420
Well,

166
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,790
I lack fire of the five elements today.

167
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,780
Miss. Chu Tian has the basic nature of fire.

168
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,810
Fire is also good for our team.

169
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,180
All right.

170
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,770
No need to explain.

171
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,570
We all understand.

172
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,490
We all understand.

173
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,150
I came here today mainly to see you.

174
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,780
How dare you not answer my calls after winning a game?

175
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,440
You don't see me as your sister anymore

176
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,930
after winning the championship, do you?

177
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,140
You tell me.

178
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,080
I believe you.

179
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,070
Bastard, if you behave like this again…

180
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Well,

181
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,820
Chu Tian.

182
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,890
Your sister has asked me to ask you

183
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,090
if you're feeling better lately.

184
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,570
Don't be embarrassed.

185
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,870
Love should be said out loud.

186
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,510
Look at me.

187
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,000
Not only do I care about you in my eyes,

188
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,220
I also care about you in my heart.

189
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,380
Stop it.

190
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,370
Stop it.

191
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,320
Are kids nowadays

192
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,160
so flashy in love?

193
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,060
So you really got Miss. Chu Tian?

194
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,659
She is your girlfriend?

195
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,510
No.

196
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,840
Nice talk, Hong Yang.

197
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,929
Say something more.

198
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,070
I say,

199
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,630
I don't know what she sees in you.

200
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,750
Shut up.

201
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,930
Want some snacks?

202
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,130
Chips?

203
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:55,980
And other things?

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,360
How about some chocolate as sweet as you?

205
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,440
Oh, right.

206
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,740
I also have purple potatoes here.

207
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,360
I only belong to you.

208
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:57,910
Chuan.

209
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,270
Let me help you clean up.

210
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,620
Tian.

211
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,350
I've missed you for a few days.

212
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,540
Did you miss me?

213
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,420
No.

214
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,630
Director.

215
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,230
Manager Xiong.

216
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,580
This is our flying guest for this episode,

217
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,070
Shi Ya.

218
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,080
This interview will be conducted by her.

219
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,510
Hello again,

220
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,110
Xiong Jiujiu.

221
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,310
Many of our teammates are new here.

222
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,400
Please take care of us.

223
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,300
That's a must.

224
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,470
For the sake of Chuan and you,

225
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,370
I personally

226
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,580
favor JR Team.

227
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,140
Excuse me.

228
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,590
Shi Ya.

229
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,650
What did you say?

230
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,890
Keep some integrity.

231
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,860
You're being mean to SIK, right?

232
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,950
I'm busted.

233
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,010
Where are the people of the ON Team?

234
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,900
I thought three teams are recording the show together today.

235
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,200
Their team went on a trip abroad

236
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,460
for relaxation after the game.

237
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,460
They asked us to make up a separate recording.

238
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,220
Today only you and SIK are recording.

239
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,140
Oh, that's...

240
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,380
a pity.

241
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
This is good actually.

242
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,540
Their captain is so cocky

243
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,520
that I'm so pissed at the sight of him.

244
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,390
They came the second place entirely by luck

245
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,650
and they're even taking it abroad.

246
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,320
If they had won first place,

247
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,210
I'm afraid

248
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,920
the earth can't hold them.

249
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,380
What do I teach you guys?

250
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,850
Don't bully the underprivileged.

251
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,870
The captain is right.

252
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,360
Director.

253
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,630
Director.

254
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,700
It's all set.

255
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,270
We can get ready.

256
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:32,970
Good.

257
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,700
Guys.

258
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,760
Let's go in and get ready.

259
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,710
Okay. Let's go.

260
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,370
Qin.

261
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,740
These three guys on your team seem to be new.

262
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,420
But it's been a long time

263
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,350
I haven't seen

264
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,830
such strong motivation.

265
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:49,810
Ah.

266
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,250
That's right.

267
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,180
They all just want to play well

268
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,380
with no more distractions.

269
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,900
It's easier said

270
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,450
than done.

271
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,440
Nowadays, many newcomers

272
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,380
think of E-sports

273
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,330
as a way to make money

274
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,440
just by playing video games

275
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,970
with the purpose of making money

276
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,340
who can achieve nothing in the end.

277
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,460
A lot of capital and hot money

278
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,630
has made the business a mess too.

279
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,050
But Xiao Yichuan in your team

280
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,240
is truly skilled

281
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,430
and also truly controversial.

282
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,890
He always lashes out during many years in the industry.

283
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,630
Our Captain Wang has been suffered a lot.

284
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,570
I think

285
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,990
he only listens to you.

286
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,220
Chuan

287
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,060
has changed a lot.

288
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,340
How's the shooting going?

289
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,000
Almost done.

290
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,740
Almost done, right?

291
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,460
Then let's get ready for the interview.

292
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,350
Ya.

293
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,410
You get ready.

294
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,770
We'll interview the captains of the two teams first.

295
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,380
Okay.

296
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,560
I should be considered Xiao Yichuan's

297
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,260
life-saving benefactor and soul coach.

298
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,260
If I...

299
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,050
That's right.

300
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,320
He did change my life.

301
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,690
If it wasn't for Wang Boyu,

302
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,760
I would be healthy both physically and mentally

303
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,820
and have a bright future ahead of me.

304
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,790
Xiao Yichuan, you're heartless.

305
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,120
Why didn't you bring up

306
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,900
the time when I sent you to the hospital and cooked for you?

307
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,390
What?

308
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,650
You did cook for me.

309
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,410
You also caused me to have gastroenteritis.

310
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,370
I said my stomach hurt but you didn't believe me.

311
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,180
You had to make me do physical training.

312
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,730
I ended up with a fever and dehydration of over 38 degrees Celsius.

313
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,540
You didn't send me to the hospital.

314
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,420
What did you want?

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,130
I later

316
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,980
learned to cook well

317
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,500
and have made it up to you for years.

318
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,790
Do you have a list?

319
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,260
I do hold a grudge.

320
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,340
You stay at my house

321
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,350
in the name of cooking for me.

322
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,580
Needy.

323
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,330
Sleep in my bed.

324
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,260
Wear my pajamas.

325
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,250
And eat my chocolate.

326
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,650
Good.

327
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,220
Do you believe me to

328
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,530
release the video

329
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,480
of you singing love songs?

330
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,100
That's because I can.

331
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,670
Unlike you, all alone,

332
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,880
who can only touch your own face in the mirror at home,

333
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,830
being in a relationship with yourself.

334
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,700
So?

335
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,180
Chuan is not single?

336
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,310
You've gotten yourself into a ditch.

337
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,510
Next question.

338
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,500
There is a saying on the Internet

339
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,950
that the two are like

340
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,100
the AB sides of the life of the top E-sports player

341
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,140
whose career paths diverged

342
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,760
because of the different results of the first battle.

343
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,770
If ULT hadn't lost so badly

344
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,970
in the debut,

345
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,450
Xiao Yichuan, how differently do you think

346
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,430
would you turn out today?

347
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,530
This question is not so proper.

348
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,020
Director.

349
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,460
Let's re-record this part.

350
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:43,850
It's okay.

351
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,180
You only care about Xiao Yichuan's success

352
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:54,950
or failure.

353
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,170
But only I know

354
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,430
all Xiao Yichuan wants to become

355
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,980
is a qualified professional E-sports player,

356
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,710
whether in the past

357
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,580
or in the future.

358
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,100
Thank you, Chuan.

359
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,720
And thank you to Wang Boyu.

360
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,200
Let's ask Wang Boyu to take a short break.

361
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,390
Then I'd like to invite

362
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,100
the youngest player who made into this global league,

363
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,720
Chu Tian.

364
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,030
Welcome, Chu Tian.

365
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,460
Here.

366
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,580
Please be seated.

367
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,950
In fact, we can see that in this game,

368
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,080
there are many fans,

369
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,790
even professionals,

370
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,440
questioning your use of

371
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,120
domestic guns only.

372
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,860
You didn't fire a single shot at the start of the game

373
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,300
due to your use of domestic guns only.

374
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,730
How do you feel about it?

375
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,270
This is my own paranoia.

376
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,770
I admit

377
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:06,650
the failure.

378
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,220
But it doesn't mean I'll always lose.

379
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,700
This is what our captain

380
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,210
once said.

381
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,530
So, as a first-time rookie,

382
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,800
why do you want to be a professional?

383
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,390
What does a professional

384
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,150
mean to you?

385
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,000
It means

386
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,260
to go forward with my best efforts,

387
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,140
to do something

388
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,270
that is worthy of my talent

389
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,330
and passion.

390
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,820
Thank you, Chu Tian.

391
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,910
From his words, we can tell

392
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,260
his sincerity and love for E-sports.

393
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,830
Then we will continue to invite

394
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,770
other members of the JR Team

395
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,150
to talk about their feelings about this league tournament.

396
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,380
Welcome.

397
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,360
Miss. Chu Tian.

398
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,280
You're done?

399
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,220
Yeah.

400
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,420
Everything went well.

401
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,200
So I come over and help you with the dinner.

402
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,300
It recently came to me

403
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,580
that Chu Tian has adapted to this career.

404
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,870
It's just

405
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,490
I'm still worried he'll regret it later.

406
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,250
He's already 20 years old.

407
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,660
He has his own way to go.

408
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,320
And

409
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,680
he is more mature than all of us.

410
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,710
He knows what he wants.

411
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,320
And you

412
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,070
also know what you want, right?

413
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,060
You two

414
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,020
haven't come clean yet?

415
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,810
Since you got here,

416
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,070
he's looked at you more than ten times.

417
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,930
Who cares?

418
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,010
Oh, good.

419
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,130
If you don't, someone else does.

420
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,810
Can't you see

421
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,680
the pretty lady over there likes him?

422
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,640
Her eyes are overflowing with love.

423
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,650
If you were half as active as she is,

424
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,150
Xiao Yichuan would have been taken down by you long ago.

425
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,700
Okay.

426
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,510
The interview is over.

427
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,330
Good job, everyone.

428
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,740
Chuan.

429
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,060
Should we go watch the replay together?

430
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,830
There's a replay?

431
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,620
I'll watch it too.

432
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:39,950
Let's go.

433
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,320
Let's go.

434
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,340
Come on, let's have a look.

435
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,150
Director.

436
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,310
We need to watch the replay.

437
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,080
Okay.

438
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,020
Oh,

439
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,660
really?

440
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,900
Here you go.

441
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,480
A girl's trump card.

442
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,410
Go ahead.

443
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,160
It's all done?

444
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,090
Look.

445
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,730
Jiujiu is here.

446
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,900
Why is your mouth so red?

447
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,450
You ate a pitaya?

448
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,100
Where is it?

449
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:05,780
I feel like one too.

450
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,610
No, I didn't.

451
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,600
I mean.

452
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,040
I mean,

453
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,370
if you want to have one,

454
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,840
I can buy it for you.

455
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,380
You must be tired today.

456
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,480
Drink some water.

457
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,650
What did I do wrong?

458
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,670
Just tell me.

459
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,860
You're so scary this way.

460
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,640
You must be thirsty after such a long interview.

461
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,430
Capt. Qin and the others have all gone to drink water.

462
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,220
You are the only one who still has no water.

463
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,640
Drink some water,

464
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,770
in case you get thirsty.

465
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,310
I haven't had any water either.

466
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,730
Go find your manager.

467
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,360
Oh.

468
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,190
Didn't your team make the cut?

469
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,100
I believe the good times are near.

470
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,720
They'll be opening in a while.

471
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,230
Should we go and register?

472
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,760
This is the internal subscription card

473
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,180
of the property you visited.

474
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,780
Take it. You'll get a good discount.

475
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,900
You

476
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,110
bring Xiao Yichuan

477
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,070
to ON Team.

478
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,490
Capt. Qin.

479
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,050
What's going on?

480
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,930
Why don't you play with others?

481
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,080
I'm here to get some fresh air.

482
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,980
Capt. Qin.

483
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,980
Tell me.

484
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,700
Why do people always ask you

485
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,000
why you want to do this?

486
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,290
Maybe it's because they're afraid

487
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,180
that someday you will forget your answer.

488
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,810
Capt. Qin, you've also been asked this kind of question?

489
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,540
Right.

490
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,530
It was a long time ago.

491
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,110
Tian.

492
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,100
Capt. Qin.

493
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,610
I'd like to draw Chu Tian in

494
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,780
for SIK.

495
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,210
Can you avoid it?

496
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,260
You brat.

497
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,940
Chu Tian.

498
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,500
You really don't want to think about it?

499
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,870
If you come to SIK,

500
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,490
not only will you have better conditions and facilities,

501
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,120
you will also have a captain who loves you.

502
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,990
My captain is very good to me.

503
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,950
He's not good to you.

504
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,860
How good?

505
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,710
Come on.

506
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,690
Tell me what's good about your captain.

507
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,110
Good character?

508
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,090
Handsome?

509
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,420
Excellent skills?

510
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,530
Or gentle and virtuous?

511
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,390
Stop it.

512
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,740
This is used to describe me, okay?

513
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,580
Shame on you.

514
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,420
-Chu Tian, come... Come here. -I've got enough integrity,

515
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:23,980
unlike you.

516
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,890
Wang Boyu, compensate my shoes.

517
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,370
I'm about to catch a cold.

518
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,560
Does anyone care about me?

519
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,710
No.

520
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,540
Some men are really terrible.

521
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,410
They always act cute.

522
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,420
He?

523
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,420
He is cute?

524
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,470
Do you have bad eyesight?

525
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,260
Women are always so deceptive.

526
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,590
Why are you blushing then?

527
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,150
I'm not.

528
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,490
That's right.

529
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,470
You're not.

530
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,250
Xiong Jiujiu.

531
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,270
Give it to me.

532
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:48,770
Thank you.

533
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,340
I'm going to go back with the director team to edit the film.

534
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
And this show

535
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,350
will probably be aired in a couple of days.

536
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,250
Thank you for your hard work today.

537
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,160
Thank you.

538
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,570
You helped us arrange the accommodation,

539
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,840
so we can rest for one night.

540
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,820
I'm concerned you guys

541
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,450
can be tired from the intense training.

542
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,210
Think of it

543
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,360
as two days of relaxation.

544
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,220
Hmmm.

545
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,190
How is Chuan

546
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,760
doing in your team?

547
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,130
He's doing well in our team.

548
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,150
The four of them are

549
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,060
not only teammates but also brothers.

550
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,360
JR is a team

551
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,750
with team spirit.

552
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,110
Oh, really?

553
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,340
That's good.

554
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,940
I'll be off then.

555
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,400
Okay.

556
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,480
Thank you for today.

557
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,480
What are you watching?

558
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,150
Come and help.

559
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:32,650
I'm coming.

560
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:41,940
Chuan.

561
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,710
I can't believe you brought a suit with you.

562
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,620
Why didn't you tell me at home yesterday?

563
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,180
I haven't asked you to compensate my shoes.

564
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,050
My shoes haven't dried yet.

565
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,640
Come on.

566
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,420
Blind box opening activity has begun.

567
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,550
One for everyone.

568
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,930
The gifts we prepared during the day

569
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,870
are all here.

570
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,620
Let's see who they'll go to.

571
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,890
A stereo?

572
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,850
Who prepared this gift?

573
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,100
Are all gifts of this standard?

574
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,040
I only prepared a nail clipper.

575
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,090
And it's…

576
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,400
used.

577
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,110
You've got a lot of luck.

578
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,380
This stereo

579
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,640
is from me.

580
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,390
I like it, thanks.

581
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,560
You can keep this nail clipper for yourself.

582
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,340
No need to give me.

583
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:07,860
Thank you.

584
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,030
A compass?

585
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,000
So retro.

586
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,630
Wow.

587
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,460
It suits you,

588
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,290
otherwise you will be too proud to orientate.

589
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,280
I mean,

590
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,400
that's disrespectful.

591
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,550
“Basic introduction to spatial geometry”?

592
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,420
The third domestic competition league souvenir?

593
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,530
Wow!

594
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,190
Here you are.

595
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,390
Chinese medicine foot bath voucher?

596
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,980
Hey, Yu. Here it is.

597
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
I wanted to give it to you.

598
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,950
You work so hard in design.

599
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,840
But it's okay.

600
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,840
When we get back,

601
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,510
I'll give you a full set of vouchers.

602
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,460
Mr. Dong.

603
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,100
Why don't you show some sincerity

604
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
and invite our whole team over?

605
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,540
We can also bring Chu Tian with us.

606
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,390
I don't think foot bath is enough.

607
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,520
Can I request a massage?

608
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,930
Let's have a hot pot in the evening.

609
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,920
We didn't bring Hong Yang and Dong Shi last time.

610
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,990
Let's do it together this time.

611
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:26,740
Hey.

612
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,620
I second the motion.

613
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,150
KTV and barbecue.

614
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,130
Bring them along.

615
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Hong Yang, which side are you in?

616
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,440
Now we're talking about me paying the bill.

617
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,080
You turned against me so soon.

618
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,860
Aren't you the boss?

619
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,800
You take me as the boss now.

620
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,050
A heart-shaped stone?

621
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,570
I prepared this

622
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,790
rather random little gift.

623
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,340
I really like it.

624
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:04,900
Hmmm.

625
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:08,960
Xiong Jiujiu.

626
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,790
Look at yours.

627
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,250
Right.

628
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,300
[A kiss]

629
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,190
A…

630
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,380
A what?

631
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,990
A…

632
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,940
The food is getting cold.

633
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:30,650
Everyone, eat up.

634
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,280
Come on.

635
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,990
Eat up.

636
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,460
Something doesn't feel right.

637
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,130
Who else's gift is not delivered?

638
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,150
What a coincidence.

639
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,240
Do you want to receive the gift?

640
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,390
I'm full.

641
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:52,960
You guys continue.

642
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,670
I'll leave now, bye.

643
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:57,810
Chuan…

644
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,310
A kiss?

645
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,030
Oh!

646
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,920
Tian.

647
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,610
Where are you going?

648
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,330
Why are you going?

649
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:19,800
Miss. Chu Tian.

650
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,750
Chu Tian.

651
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,950
Chu Tian, why are you going?

652
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,830
Leave me alone.

653
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,970
Don't you know

654
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,760
what the situation is now?

655
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,580
Who does Xiong Jiujiu really like?

656
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,060
Don't you know it better than me?

657
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,250
You obviously know everything.

658
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,470
But you just wouldn't admit it.

659
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,670
Otherwise, why don't you go confess your feelings

660
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,160
all these years?

661
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,940
What's the point of fooling yourself?

662
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,890
When exactly will you

663
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,150
be willing to face the reality?

664
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,600
Chu Tian.

665
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,940
Why are you going so fast?

666
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:12,490
I'm not walking.

667
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,030
Who's walking?

668
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,030
I'm going to my room to get something.

669
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,020
What do you have to get now?

670
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,190
Oh.

671
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,640
Is this it?

672
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,080
Why would I take this?

673
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,620
My breath is especially fresh.

674
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,440
So fresh.

675
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,090
Then why are you blushing?

676
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:34,900
I'm...

677
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,610
I'm not blushing.

678
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,600
I just

679
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,380
I just ran

680
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,120
and was deprived of oxygen.

681
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,490
You are obviously shy.

682
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,380
I'm not.

683
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,610
Or do you mean

684
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,450
you want to receive the gift in the room?

685
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,310
I don't want to.

686
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,510
Capt. Qin, leave it to me.

687
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,440
You can talk to our coach.

688
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,360
Have you asked Xiao Yichuan?

689
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,490
[Have you asked Xiao Yichuan?]

690
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,420
Who is it?

691
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,220
It's me.

692
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:22,730
Capt. Qin.

693
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:23,770
What's up?

694
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,580
I passed by your room

695
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,679
and saw your light was still on.

696
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:29,510
Sit.

697
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:45,580
I talked with Coach Liu

698
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:47,460
for a long time this afternoon.

699
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,489
You and Wang Boyu went all the way from the youth training camp

700
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,980
to leading your respective teams.

701
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,490
It's been so long since then.

702
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,690
The former rookies

703
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,210
are leading the younger generation now.

704
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,400
Wang Boyu went to SIK,

705
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,100
coaching Monster Team and Ocean Team.

706
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,980
And you've come to JR Team.

707
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,650
Capt. Qin,

708
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,980
what are you trying to say?

709
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,020
I just want to ask you,

710
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,930
if there is a chance,

711
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,150
do you want to go to a better team?

712
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,940
We're fine now, aren't we?

713
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,740
But we all know

714
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,660
the problem with JR Team.

715
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,580
But you said during the game

716
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,160
that we are not incompetent.

717
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,920
Capt. Qin.

718
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,380
You brought me into this industry.

719
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,510
In my heart,

720
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,620
you will always be my captain.

721
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,020
Why do you…

722
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,500
have such irresponsible thoughts?

723
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,250
Forget it.

724
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,260
I'll go first.

725
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,770
[KINDMAX PRE-CUT KINESIOLOGY TAPE]

726
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,770
[Wrist]

727
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,350
[KINDMAX PRE-CUT KINESIOLOGY TAPE]

728
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,350
[Wrist]

729
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,810
Which hand?

730
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:47,910
It's just…

731
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,500
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

732
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,920
It is not a difficult disease…

733
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,840
Which hand?

734
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,800
That's why you didn't train after you joined the team.

735
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,980
So it was because of the injury

736
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,010
when you were sweating that day?

737
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:17,930
Chuan,

738
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,530
you can't ignore this.

739
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,280
Capt. Qin,

740
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,810
I want to participate in this year's tournament.

741
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,140
-I don't want to give up… 
-But you can't play in full force

742
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,040
with the injury.

743
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,310
No matter what the result is,

744
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,230
this is at least my explanation to JR Team.

745
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,750
It's also my account of my career.

746
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,710
But if you're going downhill because of the hand injury.

747
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,040
You'll no longer be the Xiao Yichuan

748
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,550
known as all-powerful.

749
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,620
Have you thought about

750
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,860
what kind of comments you will face?

751
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,940
-I don't care…
-That's because you're not going down for now!

752
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,720
You haven't experienced that feeling.

753
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,500
You don't know the helplessness.

754
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,730
Many professional players

755
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,480
after all the glory

756
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,990
choose not to resign

757
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,580
when faced with injury or illness.

758
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,340
But what happens?

759
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,480
They go downhill, lose the competence,

760
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,660
and can't win.

761
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,910
In the end, they're scolded as a parasite to the team by fans

762
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,190
and forced to retire

763
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:40,960
amidst the boos and curses.

764
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,380
Chuan.

765
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,780
I don't want you to be like this.

766
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,280
It's not that serious.

767
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,480
At least one of you, say something.

768
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,960
I'm not used to this.

769
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,520
You can't race anymore.

770
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,850
I'm fine.

771
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,070
You're fine?

772
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,150
How could you be like this if you were fine?

773
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,580
Would you tell me

774
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,700
you were not going to the basic training

775
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,360
if you were fine?

776
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,580
I'm stupid like a pig.

777
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,540
I complained about your laziness.

778
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,570
I was so selfish to make you

779
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,160
stay in the team.

780
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,880
I didn't even notice

781
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,370
your hand was injured.

782
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,650
Who asked you to do a self-examination?

783
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,410
You were so afraid that I'd run away.

784
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,900
What about everyone else

785
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,990
if I leave?

786
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,020
It's not that bad.

787
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,020
I'll try to hold on.

788
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,890
If you're worried,

789
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,710
we can train another commander.

790
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,820
Ah?

791
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,330
He has too little experience.

792
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,260
Chu Tian is a talented player.

793
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,190
His personal ability is unbeatable.

794
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,730
But he's still young

795
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,040
and inexperienced.

796
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,300
We have to make him gain more experience

797
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,370
from now.

798
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,180
His future

799
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,040
is so promising.

800
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,180
Capt. Qin.

801
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,580
You once said,

802
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,090
“Look at this kid.

803
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,890
Does he look like me back then?”

804
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,240
You retired in a hurry.

805
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,470
I stumbled to this day.

806
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,240
Now let's

807
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,690
think of it as helping ourselves back then.

808
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,410
Let's do as you say.

809
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,030
But if your hand injury worsens

810
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,940
and you go downhill,

811
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,470
I won't let you play anymore

812
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,560
as your coach.

813
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,620
Got it.

814
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,130
Xiong Jiujiu.

815
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,060
Yeah?

816
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,590
You are the manager.

817
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,620
You have to supervise this young man.

818
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,400
You know what you should be

819
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,910
most concerned about right now?

820
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,470
Well?

821
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,120
What you should be most concerned about right now

822
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,440
is your own hand injury.

823
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,780
Don't worry about other things.

824
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,190
If Chu Tian can share the pressure of the game

825
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,590
and training for you,

826
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,130
can I take care of everything else?

827
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,080
I mean,

828
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,890
can you not carry all the things by yourself

829
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,420
in the future?

830
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,600
Don't make me worry anymore, okay?

831
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,140
I know.

832
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,830
Don't frown.

833
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,830
I've been seeing my doctor regularly.

834
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,380
I'll be fine if I take more rest.

835
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,560
And

836
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,620
if you hide anything from me again,

837
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,940
don't blame me for being rude.

838
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,540
Okay.

839
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,860
It's too cold.

840
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,760
I gotta go.

841
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,200
Xiao Yichuan won't go to ON Team.

842
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,180
Don't waste your energy.

843
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,900
Where's the pitaya?

844
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,770
Are you serious?

845
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,870
This is the lipstick Miss. Chu Tian gave me.

846
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,880
Lipstick.

847
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,720
Why are you wearing lipstick for good reason?

848
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,500
Are you a pig?

849
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,110
Shi Ya is my mother's friend's daughter.

850
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,460
She was the commentator

851
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,260
for my first game which I lost.

852
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,380
She is very nice.

853
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,300
But we're just friends.

854
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,300
I know.

855
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:00,680
But

856
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,040
she likes you a lot, doesn't she?

857
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,620
You should ask me

858
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,020
who I like.

859
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,390
You can talk to

860
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,570
whoever you like.

861
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,270
I'd like to.

862
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,900
But someone

863
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,720
run away

864
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:17,870
during the dinner.

865
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,210
Around the table, do you want to…

866
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,210
Do you want

867
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
the gift I gave you or not?

868
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,180
You can't miss this opportunity.

869
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,540
It won't come again.

870
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,180
Like I care.

871
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,150
Wow hahaha.

872
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,790
What's wrong with you guys at night?

873
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,320
You've lost.

874
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,550
Bring the red envelope now.

875
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,320
I knew you would do this secretly.

876
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,060
Hey.

877
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,520
We didn't lose, okay?

878
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,990
They haven't kissed.

879
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:05,790
That's right.

880
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,620
You lost, Wang Boyu.

881
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,380
Transfer the money now.

882
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,800
My legs are thickened by mosquito bites.

883
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,270
Be a good loser, captain.

884
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,610
Hurry up and kiss.

885
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,880
It's about hundreds of RMB.

886
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:30,300
Wow!

887
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,690
[Bonus scenes ahead]

888
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,650
Hey, Chuan.

889
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,090
There will be a blind draw for gifts tonight.

890
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,020
Prepare something.

891
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:20,700
Write it down.

892
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,290
I don't have anything with me.

893
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,270
Find a way.

894
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,210
[A kiss]
