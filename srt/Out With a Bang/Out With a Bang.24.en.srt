00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,370
Okay, let's continue the second half.

9
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,380
Jump into the factory.

10
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,530
Xiao Yichuan and Dong Shi occupy the big factory.

11
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,460
Hong Yang, search supplies around small factory.

12
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,580
I'll get the guns.

13
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,229
Xiao Yichuan and Dong Shi, outflank them from left and right side separately

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,890
before they get the guns.

15
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,990
Hong Yang, hurry up and collect supplies and find the vehicle.

16
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:37,979
I got the gun.

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,280
I'll cover you.

18
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,080
Two are at the back door.

19
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,979
I don't know their exact location.

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,470
They are good at sneak attacks.

21
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,530
Be careful.

22
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,860
Where should I park the car?

23
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,570
At the back door.

24
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,300
Someone is at the back door.

25
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,940
Chuan and I don't know their exact location.

26
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,060
It's Okay.

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,760
Just park outside the factory.

28
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,390
Hong Yang.

29
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,780
Find a location near the car

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,440
and prepare for the ambush.

31
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,310
I'll ride the car first.

32
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,050
The car is in a bad location.

33
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,640
Are you going out to be a target?

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,390
Dong Shi.

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,460
Prepare the smoke bombs to cover me.

36
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,500
Twenty degrees north, 100 meters.

37
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,579
Forty-five degrees north, 300 meters.

38
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,340
Someone is at the window of the second floor.

39
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,770
I'll take charge of the second floor.

40
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,260
The Shark Team is wiped out.

41
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,420
JR Team wiped them out

42
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,040
within two minutes.

43
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,580
After the first half,

44
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,100
You even dare to use me as a bait.

45
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,780
I learned it from you.

46
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,220
they quickly adjusted themselves

47
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,060
and got 12 points.

48
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,300
The JR Team has become more active.

49
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,140
-This is a very good start. -Come on!

50
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,220
Wang Boyu fought versus two,

51
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,520
and killed two enemies in the AD Team.

52
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,780
He's so fast.

53
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,390
There's no time for them to react.

54
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,370
I'll enter the circle from the south.

55
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:50,930
Tell me your location respectively.

56
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:51,780
Okay.

57
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,330
I am following the Lime Team,

58
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,930
around 200 meters southwest.

59
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,180
I can enter the circle anytime with them.

60
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,380
I'm at the logging camp.

61
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,860
[The Fox Team and the UB Team are frozen here.]

62
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,800
I'll transplant after getting two points.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,490
Me too.

64
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,700
I'll get two points from Reya Team

65
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,380
and then enter the circle from the school.

66
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,820
Wang Boyu'a amazing shooting

67
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
eliminated one of his enemies again.

68
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,140
Our SIK

69
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,860
is indeed a top team.

70
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,220
Hiding behind the strong team

71
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,580
and attacking them from the back is quite wise.

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,020
It must be Wang Boyu's idea.

73
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,990
The other Chinese team JR

74
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,290
is relying winning by uniting.

75
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,300
From the qualifiers till now,

76
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,700
the cooperation of the team is obviously better and better.

77
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,100
Let's cross the blocks from the east and enter the safe zone.

78
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,300
Okay.

79
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,440
Xiao Yichuan and Dong Shi, get on the back car.

80
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,780
Hong Yang and I will get on the car in front of you.

81
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,490
There's someone on the third floor opposite.

82
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,130
There are people in the townhouses in the back.

83
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,860
Looks like

84
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,090
they are ready

85
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,000
to meet us in the safe zone.

86
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,980
We have to cross the bridge if we go the wild area.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,140
There are gunshots on the bridge.

88
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,620
Then let's cross the blocks together.

89
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,200
Attack the building.

90
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,110
I'll go to the second floor.

91
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,650
Chuan just shot

92
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,400
and killed two enemies of FAL Team.

93
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,180
The Emperor Qin's strategy is really amazing.

94
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,100
Chuan is not only good at shooting,

95
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,900
his position and gesture is outstanding too.

96
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,890
Someone jumped out of the window.

97
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,660
Xiao Yichuan wiped out all the four players in FAL Team

98
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,870
by himself.

99
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,420
The JR turns the tide

100
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,710
with their excellent counterattacks.

101
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,230
After this battle,

102
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,240
JR Team has scored ten points.

103
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,220
Chuan's operation just now is definitely

104
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,650
one of the best battles in this league.

105
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,000
And it's definitely the most valuable battle.

106
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,390
That's right.

107
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,799
It's a battle written in the textbook.

108
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,539
Chuan,

109
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,020
the whole world will remember this name tonight.

[Ranking Table]

111
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,890
This is the third round of the second half.

112
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,490
At the end of this round,

113
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,300
we are supposed to be at the sixth rank.

114
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
It is estimated that there is a difference of

115
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,830
about 40 points with the first place.

116
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,460
Mars's advantage is absolute.

117
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,300
There's only one round left.

118
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,850
If we want to win

119
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,930
in the last round,

120
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,830
besides getting the first place

121
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,430
in the last round,

122
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,140
according to the average elimination number of Mars's

123
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,040
in the previous rounds,

124
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,380
we need to at least

125
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,310
eliminate 35 opponents.

126
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,430
Each of us needs to eliminate nine opponents,

127
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
and live to the end.

128
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,150
That's not impossible.

129
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,220
If they don't unite,

130
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,750
there might be a chance.

131
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,620
Failure and regret are different.

132
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,930
As long as we try our best,

133
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,240
we'll get a good result.

134
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,390
Don't leave any regrets.

135
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,580
Congratulations to the FAL Team. They're the first place in this round.

136

After the third rounds of the second half,

137
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,830
we can see many changes

with 124 points.

145
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,090
With its outstanding strength,

146
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,310
Mars has gained 132 points

147

We are 39 points

153
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,880
behind Mars.

154
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,650
This is the last round.

155
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,050
Don't think about points.

156
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,140
Just think about one thing.

157
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,700
We will never give up.

158
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,330
Okay, let's continue.

159
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,110
This is

160
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,940
the last round

161

Jump to school.

164
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,690
Carry out the binary search.

165
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,910
I go jungle with Dong Shi.

166
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,930
Chu Tian, Hong Yang, enter the building.

167
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,140
Don't miss every chance to score.

168
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,780
We can see that JR Team

169
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,720
keeps being active

170
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,380

171

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,550
Okay.

173
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,490
SIK has been fighting

174
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,580
since landing.

175
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,270
It seems that they want to catch up with points.

176
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,530
Mars is unwilling to show their weakness.

177
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,440
They want to make the gap bigger.

178
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,070
Both teams are trying their best to score.

179
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,320
The safe zone is renewed.

180
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,860
FAL and SIK

181
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,170
are in the North City.

182
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,830
There's no chance for Hong Yang and me.

183
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,300
Four players in Lime Team are all alive. In the eastern wild area of North City,

184
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,340
Mars and Blaze Team

185
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,140
are there too.

186
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,230
Looks like they're going to form a group again.

187
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,030
There are fewer and fewer people.

188
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,690
Getting points becomes harder and harder.

189
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,230
Let's take a detour

190
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,510
to collect some points in the west.

191
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,880
Besides trying to get the first place

192
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,380
in the last round,

193
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,840
we also need to at least eliminate 35 people.

194
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,120
Go to the North City and find SIK.

195
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,050
Roger.

196
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
JR Team is heading for the North City.

197
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,370
All the strong teams are assembling in the North City.

198
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,270
It's like a living hell there.

199
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,770
Looks like it's time for the donnybrook.

200
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,730
One of the players in FAL is eliminated by Chuan's snipe.

201
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,150
Why is JR Team here?

202
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,570
Is JR Team crazy or strong enough?

203
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,350
It's not a good timing to get into the battle.

204
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,810
They even face the gun head-on.

205
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,390
They are crazy about fighting.

206
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,610
Aren't they afraid of being fed?

207
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,140
Leave these to me.

208
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,420
You go to the building area.

209
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,870
Chuan, you go first.

210
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,660
I'll cover you.

211
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,260
Chu Tian, how is it going?

212
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,160
There are seven people opposite.

213
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,720
I can still stall them.

214
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:15,800
Leave me alone.

215
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,610
You just need to enter the center of the North City.

216
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,870
I'll wait for you in the north.

217
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,640
Both Hong Yang and the Dong Shi are eliminated.

218
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,370
Your position is easily attacked from the back.

219
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,090
I'll go ahead to fight.

220
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,080
You just need to enter the circle.

221
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,380
Leave me alone.

222
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,020
I'll transfer to Wang Boyu's location.

223
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,220
Try to get into the safe zone.

224
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,260
If I enter the circle,

225
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,470
you two can't stand it.

226
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,540
Tian of JR Team is outside the safe zone,

227
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,580
facing the two teams in the circle alone.

228
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,860
[With inferior position of one against seven,]

229
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,140
[he wiped out the whole Fox Team]

230
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,140
[with his shooting.]

231
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,910
He also used the last grenade

232
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,510
to explode his own vehicle.

233
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,980
Even if he breaks his own way out,

234
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,280
he won't give his opponent

235
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,180
the chance to enter the safe zone.

236
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,430
He's ready

237
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,570
to die with his opponents.

238
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,380
There are only Chuan and Tian left in JR Team.

239
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,980
Wang Boyu is the only one left in SIK.

240
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,900
All is alive in Mars Team.

241
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,109
There are three left in Lime Team.

242
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,510
And there's one left in Team Blaze.

243
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,420
Mars has the highest score now.

244
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,349
If SIK wants to win,

245
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,310
they not only need to get

246
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,220
at least four points,

247
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,740
but also need to surpass Mars

248
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
in the single round ranking.

249
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,970
Why are they working together?

250
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:01,940
Good luck.

251
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,860
Don't wait for me.

252
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,490
I can't go in.

253
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,540
Tian's blood is running out.

254
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,340
He fell down outside the safe zone.

255
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,550
Tian not only created possibility

256
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,820
for his teammate.

257
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,900
He told us

258
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,090
with his strength and determination that

259
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,500
he won't stop fighting

260
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,100
until the last moment.

261
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,730
Even in despair,

262
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
he has never given up hope.

263
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,160
Good job, Chu Tian.

264
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,900
Son, come on!

265
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,230
Chu Tian, come on.

266
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,810
Okay.

267
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,770
Now, Chuan, Wang Boyu and Mars Team

268
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,870
are frozen here.

269
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,450
Chuan first found a chance to rack his gun.

270
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,870
Idiot.

271
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,910
Where's our tacit understanding?

272
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,680
Why don't you shoot now?

273
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,020
The safe zone is renewed for the last time.

274
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,100
The final circle has been transferred to

275
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,580
the house where Mars is.

276
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,230
Wang Boyu and Chuan are very passive now.

277
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,140
As we can see, Max of Mars Team

278
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,150
is hiding in the house.

279
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,440
He doesn't show up or shoot.

280
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,540
I guess he's going to stay until the game ends.

281
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,660
No, no.

282
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,460
Wang Boyu killed

283
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,130
and eliminated three players of Mars.

284
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,270
Wang Boyu not only got three key points,

285
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,510
but surpassed Mars

286
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,580
in this round.

287
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,560
In this way,

288
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,680
even if JR Team defeats Wang Boyu later,

289
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,420
SIK

290
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,890
has already won the championship

291
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,580
with 152 points.

292
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,620
That's right.

293
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,620
China finally

294
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,740
wins the first champion

295
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,140
in the TLO Global Championship this year.

296
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,170
The game is not over yet.

297
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,720
Let's see the final battle

298
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,920
of the two Chinese teams.

299
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,630
This is the battle between Bo&Yi Brothers again.

300
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,510
I always have a wish

301
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,980
to fight you to the death.

302
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,620
Let's remove all our protective gears.

303
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,920
Each of us get a gun, three bullets

304
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,990
and a four times scope.

305
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,860
Let's have a final gunfight.

306
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,430
Are they going to have

307
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,970
a clean and simple ultimate shooting contest?

308
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,230
Look! Chuan

309
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,620
even threw away the four times scope.

310
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,620
This is the sportsmanship of fighting till the end.

311
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,090
This is the real meaning of E-sports.

312
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,880
We accept failure, but we won't give up.

313
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,990
The winner of this round is the JR Team.

314
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,230
In this round,

315
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,150
not only did they get the first ranking

316
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,660
with 10 points,

317
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,860
but also 21 points of elimination.

318
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,740
They got 33 points in total.

319
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,060
Although the total score

320
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:38,980
is 126 points,

321
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,740
being in the fourth place.

322
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,070
But they created the highest score

323
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,060
in a single round of this game.

324
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,800
This is the end of the game.

325
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,150
Congratulations to SIK,

326
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,820
who is the champion of this TLO Global Championship

327
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,060
with 152 points.

328
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,590
Big thanks to these boys

329
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,530
for giving us an exciting and entertaining summer.

330
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,690
The MVP of this competition

331
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,140
is Chuan from JR Team.

332
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,130
[One Year Later]

333
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,260
[TLO Youth Training Camp]

334
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,810
When there are still lots of players in the battle,

335
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,370
you need to be efficient to eliminate them,

336
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,380
while collecting guns and information.

337
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,900
If there are more than three players landing

338
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,850
with guns,

339
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,570
you should clear them

340
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,670
according to the freeman's parachute location reported.

341
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,010
But if there are multiple players who have no weapons,

342
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,480
players with guns

343
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,790
must take the position quickly

344
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,730
and provide protection for their teammates.

345
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:39,610
So,

346
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,460
steady, ruthless and accurate marksmanship, as well as the fast positioning

347
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,670
is the key to victory.

348
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,260
You need to improve your speed.

349
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,090
Coach.

350
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,930
So,

351
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,590
many FPS masters with good shooting skills

352
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,700
like to put keyboards diagonally.

353
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,220
Can I improve my speed

354
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,860
if I do this too?

355
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,610
It depends on

356
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,640
whether it is comfortable and convenient for you.

357
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,020
As long as you can operate smoothly,

358
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,420
let alone you put the keyboard diagonally,

359
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,940
I don't mind

360
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,930
even you want to put it on your head.

361
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,580
He's the captain of JR Team, Tian.

362
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,210
They won

363
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,850
the Aurora World Cup Invitational last month.

364
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,380
Tian was the MVP.

365
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,800
What are you looking at?

366
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,940
Your idol is trained by me.

367
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,800
As long as you train hard,

368
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,390
and keep making progress without distractions,

369
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,780
you will have a chance

370
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,260
to become professional players like them.

371
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,380
All right.

372
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,620
That's all for today.

373
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,360
Class dismissed.

374
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,530
Is it okay?

375
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,160
Nice place.

376
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,700
Why are you all here?

377
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,600
Who allowed you

378
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,100
to enter the office without my permission?

379
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,270
Yes, Captain Wang.

380
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,010
How can you enter Chuan's office?

381
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,360
What are you doing here? Head-hunting？

382
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,780
You can't enter too!

383
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,210
Hey, I'm different from them.

384
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,810
We are family, aren't we?

385
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,320
We came from the youth training camp.

386
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,220
Have a seat please, Coach.

387
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,130
Everyone sees it can get a share.

388
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,560
Manager Hong, share it please.

389
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,700
Hey.

390
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,620
Let's take a look together.

391
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,750
Right.

392
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,380
Go away. First come, first served, understand?

393
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,910
We are brothers.

394
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,940
Let's read it together.

395
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,900
Come on, bro. Let's take a look first.

396
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,430
[Information of Trainees]

397
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,430
[Xing Ziyi]

398
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,340
Xing Ziyi?

399
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,650
Why is it him?

400
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,470
Yes, it's him.

401
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,400
Everyone has a chance to start over.

402
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,790
As long as he can go forward bravely.

403
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,280
Yap, that's good.

404
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,960
I also want to take revenge for that last shot.

405
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,730
Xing Ziyi

406
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,400
is a bit arrogant,

407
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,610
but his skill is not bad.

408
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,770
Mr. Xiao,

409
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,560
do you have any good candidates?

410
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,020
Remember to leave some for our SIK.

411
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,330
Do you think we can have players like Chu Tian every year?

412
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,600
JR

413
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,070
won the League Tournament this year.

414
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,710
I think you must have a sense of crisis.

415
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,730
Are you kidding me?

416
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,200
If I hadn't had a bowl of beef noodles that day

417
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,500
which caused the diarrhea,

418
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,040
how could I give Tian the chance to win?

419
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,150
Yes.

420
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,660
It was sour and spicy noodles last time.

421
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,310
This time it's beef noodles.

422
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,620
You need to get used to

423
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,380
be the second place

424
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,520
following our JR Team.

425
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,950
Otherwise, the recipes in the canteen are not enough to be your excuses.

426
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,070
Chu Tian, why are you so mean?

427
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,630
You're worse than Xiao Yichuan.

428
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,990
Why hasn't she replied?

429
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,300
What are you doing?

430
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,280
Did your work go well today?

431
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,140
Did you miss me?

432
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,540
I am about to drive the car.

433
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,740
I can't text you anymore.

434
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,360
Traffic jam.

435
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,340
I'll be late for five minutes.

436
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,290
Don't miss me too much.

437
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,090
Why aren't you answering?

438
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,270
Are you fixing your makeup?

439
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,060
Are you angry because I'm late?

440
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,100
Don't worry.

441
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm coming.

442
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,590
I'm coming to pick you up.

443
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,300
I'm going to pick up Xiong Jiujiu.

444
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,820
Bye.

445
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,280
Poor Xiong Jiujiu.

446
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,550
As for the theme of

447
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,130
of this White Ram Cup E-sports Competition,

448
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,520
we made it "fight for the greatest vitality".

449
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,310
Any objections?

450
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,840
E-sports,

451
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,720
as a newly launched sports competition,

452
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,190
we have the responsibility and obligation

453
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,500
to guide teenagers to treat it right.

454
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,820
E-sports is not playing games,

455
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,180
but a formal sports competition.

456
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,760
The core of E-sports

457
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,699
is to move forward and fight forward.

458
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,330
We can never forget

459
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,110
the purpose of this E-sports.

460
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,150
We have the responsibility and obligation

461
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,820
to protect them.

462
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,219
The leader of the referee team

463
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,280
is still Xiao Yichuan, right?

464
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,929
I appreciate you two so much,

465
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,310
as you can generate love together.

466
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,670
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

467
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,100
Okay, let's call it a day.

468
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,880
Let's go home.

469
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,610
Since you moved back to the base,

470
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,989
you didn't treat us all to a meal until now.

471
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,340
How insincere.

472
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,380
You can't come empty-handed as guests.

473
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,010
Who doesn't have a red envelope,

474
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,219
remember to transfer the money later.

475
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,460
Hong Yang,

476
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,750
since you became the new manager of JR Team,

477
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,260
you've become more and more greedy.

478
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,860
Your JR Team

479
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,800
won many awards this year.

480
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,540
Are there any certificates of merit?

481
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,870
When did this culture of comparison emerge?

482
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,140
I think the cause is a big boss from some department

483
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,670
keeps bragging about it on his Moments.

484
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,850
After all, the E-sports department

485
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,790
is now the rising star of the company.

486
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,780
You have to understand

487
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,670
my PDA.

488
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,650
It's not your turn to display your affection.

489
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:27,610
Caption Qin,

490
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,820
when is your engagement with Meng?

491
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,480
When will you take us on your house tour?

492
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,680
The apartment is still under renovation.

493
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,210
When it's done,

494
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,340
I'll invite you there immediately.

495
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,010
You just need to prepare the red packets.

496
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,250
Isn't it inappropriate for you to pile up big events like this?

497
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,050
The bonus we won in the competition

498
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,280
will all be cash as wedding gifts to you.

499
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,020
Piling up?

500
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,830
Who else will get married too?

501
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,280
They two...

502
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,300
Let's dig in.

503
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,520
Be joyful and happy.

504
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,550
I'm not disabled yet. I can do it myself.

505
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,560
I've been writing on blackboard while teaching lately.

506
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,800
You handicapped coach.

507
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,910
Do you miss us?

508
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,250
No.

509
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,520
You know, seeing those boys in the youth training camp

510
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,710
are like seeing us

511
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,820
on the competition again.

512
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,180
Come on.

513
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,200
Have more please.

514
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,240
They have light in their eyes

515
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,600
and fire in their hearts.

516
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,180
I hope these boys

517
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,520
can aim at the target in the field

518
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,400
like we did before in the race.

519
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:11,890
Come on.

520
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,500
Come on.

521
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,530
Cheers.

522
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,310
Cheers.

523
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,930
Cheers.

524
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,230
[Stinger]

525
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,710
Ready?

526
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,430
Start.

527
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,370
Wait. You didn't fasten your seat belt.

528
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,290
Ready, go.

529
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,470
I'm turning around.

530
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,140
I'm going to turn back from the right.

531
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,330
One, two, three.

532
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,670
What?

533
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,080
The supplies are all inside.

534
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,740
Why did you turn around?

535
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,350
Someone is inside.

536
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,840
He's far away from us.

537
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,010
But I'm a coward.

538
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,560
I'm here with you.

539
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,680
Stop.

540
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,440
Get away. Get away.

541
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,740
We represent

542
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,230
the spirit

543
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,510
of E-sports of all China teams.

544
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,150
Don't move.

545
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,230
♫ Let me hug you, bro ♫

546
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,860
♫ Tell me what's on your mind ♫

547
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,390
It's your turn to sing.

548
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,940
Come on, sing.

549
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,170
Why don't you sing?
