[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,130
Xiong Jiujiu.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,530
You scared me.

4
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,350
How about you

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,810
go down with me?

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,660
No.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,400
A person has a face,

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,500
and a tree has skin.

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,750
Let's see who's the winner.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,890
Besides,

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,299
he looks fierce.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,500
Actually, I've found the weakness of a paper tiger.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,460
You

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,470
are really troublesome.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,800
This looks nice.

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,350
Are you really not going down?

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,120
Don't worry.

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,050
It'll be fine.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,550
If he bullies you,

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,140
you can take this off.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,330
When the music stops,

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,800
I will come up.

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,160
I put it on.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,350
Go back and rest.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:14,690
Okay.

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,550
You are siblings.

27
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,610
Can't you separate?

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,180
Behave yourself.

29
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,100
Don't act like you want to fight.

30
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:25,750
If you piss me off,

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,690
the manager will come to cheer me up.

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,750
It's fine.

33
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,100
Go back and rest.

34
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,160
Stay away from him.

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,789
Call me if you need anything.

36
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,370
Your phone.

37
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,610
It kept ringing just now.

38
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,810
Wang Boyu.

39
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,990
He is a clingy type.

40
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,860
I know I'm handsome.

41
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,860
Don't be too crazy.

42
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,810
I took off my earphones by myself.

43
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,540
I am going to sleep. Good night.

44
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,860
Xiao Yichuan.

45
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,340
Xiao Yichuan.

46
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,020
Xiao Yichuan.

47
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,190
Impossible.

48
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,590
It can't be him.

49
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,360
It's not him.

50
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,350

[Episode 6]

52
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,010
Why didn't you reply my message?

53
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,740
Go on.

54
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,260
What?

55
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,780
I'm going downstairs.

56
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,460
Listen.

57
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,430
Don't do anything stupid.

58
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,900
Don't flatter yourself.

59
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,890
I asked you to keep folding the blankets.

60
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,730
I haven't logged in for a long time.

61
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
And I just saw your message.

62
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,659
How have you been?

63
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,260
It's been three years,

64
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,180
and you just remembered and asked me if I was okay?

65
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,070
I'm fine.

66
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,810
I missed an appointment once,

67
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,150
and you were missing for three years.

68
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,950
Is it too late for you to say goodbye now?

69
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,280
Don't contact me anymore.

70
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,500
Don't contact you?

71
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,780
Then why am I here?

72
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,730
I didn't mean to not contact you.

73
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,450
Then why?

74
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,420
I didn't mean to not contact you.

75
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,960
Why should I say that?

76
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,490
How do I reply?

77
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,809
Are you injured?

78
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,500
Can it be this?

79
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,770
Nonsense.

80
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,030
I hit my head in the game.

81
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,780
No.

82
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,810
What if she saw Sakuragi Hanamichi?

83
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,560
I got into a car accident on the way to the final.

84
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,780
Is the reason for the car accident too fake?

85
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,830
I saw a little girl

86
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,260
on the way home from the race.

87
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,280
I don't think she's seen Touch.

88
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,930
Okay, this one.

89
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,810
In order to save a little girl,

90
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,940
I was hit by a car.

91
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,090
I just recovered.

92
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,810
Is it serious?

93
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,820
Where are you?

94
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,640
I'm recuperating.

95
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,160
I'm recuperating abroad.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,950
See you when I am back.

97
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,850
When will you be back?

98
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,430
I'll pick you up at the airport.

99
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,210
Why is it so hard to lie?

100
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,770
Should I tell her the truth?

101
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,140
I was in a coma for three years.

102
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,800
I just woke up a few days ago.

103
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,730
I hurt both of my legs.

104
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,550
When I woke up, I found I had changed my prosthetic leg.

105
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,110
I can't walk now.

106
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,730
I don't know when I can go back.

107
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,250
I just moved my hands,

108
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,100
so I contacted you.

109
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,540
I didn't want you to worry.

110
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,360
Old friend,

111
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,050
would you like to talk to me more?

112
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:00,960
I don't even know

113
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,530
what the outside world is like.

114
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,140
Okay.

115
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,980
I'll talk to you every day.

116
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,390
But I still want to apologize to you

117
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,810
for what happened three years ago.

118
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,700
It's okay. It's over.

119
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,660
How have you been?

120
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,620
What are you doing?

121
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,060
I just started my internship.

122
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,790
I am in an E-sports team.

123
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,080
The core backbone of our team

124
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,580
is an industry leader.

125
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:05,860
Morning.

126
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,780
You're back.

127
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,420
Let's have breakfast.

128
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,780
How was your sleep last night?

129
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,960
It's good.

130
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,930
It may be a little thick with sleeping bag

131
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,880
this season.

132
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,000
It's good.

133
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,920
I feel much more comfortable than sleeping in bed.

134
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,080
Good.

135
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,400
How about you

136
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,840
change a room tonight?

137
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,140
I'll change it for you later.

138
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,520
Let's talk about it tonight.

139
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,460
I have to go back to the company this afternoon.

140
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,120
Besides,

141
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,660
that room was mine.

142
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,380
I'm in an E-sports team.

143
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,410
The core backbone of our team

144
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,660
is an industry leader.

145
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,990
It must be an honor

146
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,530
to be with an industry leader.

147
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,550
With him, every day is like hell.

148
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,590
He is the most conceited

149
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,960
and unsympathetic person

150
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,450
I have ever met, a real villain.

151
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,980
He can grow up alive

152
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,450
and not be beaten to death.

153
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,680
The people of our country must be

154
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,360
too kind and merciful.

155
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
How could this happen?

156
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,320
No one in this world has no advantages.

157
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,830
Go to find it.

158
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,500
Find it?

159
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,140
One more look at him will shorten my life.

160
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,980
Come on.

161
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,850
Hurry up.

162
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,210
Let me show you something good.

163
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,220
Look at

164
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,530
the treasure I brought today.

165
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,060
Come, sit down.

166
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,870
Registration for the International League Tournament in China

167
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,560
is about to begin.

168
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,670
Manager.

169
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,380
Yes?

170
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,760
You can go to the financial and legal departments

171
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,590
to apply for the materials

172
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,070
and related qualifications of the company.

173
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,100
No problem.

174
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,220
I'll prepare for it.

175
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,160
The league registration this afternoon.

176
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,130
We need a loud name.

177
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,500
I spent 8,800 yuan

178
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,280
to ask the master to give us

179
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,400
a very good name today.

180
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,370
Open it.

181
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,410
Bloody Noble.

182
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,050
Fierce Man.

183
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,530
Bury Love and Glory.

184
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,740
What?

185
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,820
That's right.

186
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,760
But

187
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,950
I'm most satisfied with this.

188
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,110
The highest comprehensive score.

189
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,210
Crazy Dragon.

190
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:00,890
Take it upside down.

191
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,900
I can't stay in a team called

192
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,170
Crazy Dragon.

193
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,320
Let's call it

194
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,670
-Iron Blood. -Mr. Dong.

195
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,260
This is an international competition.

196
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,530
We need to translate it

197
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,590
into English by then.

198
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,980
Yes.

199
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,470
Just like SIK Team.

200
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,150
SIK.

201
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,890
SIK.

202
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,650
And their logo

203
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,920
is a big pattern of spades.

204
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
It's a symbol of death

205
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,960
and a symbol of warriors.

206
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,990
They are worthy of being the king team of the country.

207
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,900
Then let's call it KOK.

208
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,680
King of ten thousand kings.

209
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,200
King of Kings.

210
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,050
The ham sausage?

211
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,740
Aren't you afraid that the ham sausage will sue you?

212
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,770
How about

213
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,000
using my

214
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,460
Crazy Dragon?

215
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,280
No.

216
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,510
Why don't you believe in metaphysics?

217
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,950
I think it's good.

218
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,240
So awkward.

219
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,970
Can't we discuss it?

220
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,220
Xiong Jiujiu.

221
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,130
Yes.

222
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,510
When you sign up,

223
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,740
use the company's name first.

224
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,730
Geek Team.

225
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,700
We still have a chance to change it

226
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,990
before the play-in match.

227
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,340
Remember.

228
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,690
The time of submission

229
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,710
must bring a six.

230
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,330
Got it.

231
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,620
Manager, Mr. Dong.

232
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,550
Some of our equipment

233
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,860
needs to be changed.

234
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:42,970
What?

235
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,570
The computers.

236
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,110
If you have enough funds,

237
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,170
we can upgrade the equipment.

238
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,310
I9-10900 ten cores 20 threads CPU.

239
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,440
RTX 3080 Ti.

240
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,800
We need a TV to review in the training area.

241
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,750
We also need professional sports medical kits

242
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,660
and massage equipment.

243
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,140
We should take care of

244
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,070
our hands, waists, backs and necks.

245
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,329
RTX.

246
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,230
I'll write

247
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,050
a list for you later.

248
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,859
Okay, thank you, Capt. Qin.

249
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,319
How about this?

250
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,700
Go to the company to

251
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,960
rereport the budget tomorrow,

252
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,220
including the other things

253
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,619
that they want

254
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,390
I told you last time.

255
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,069
Okay.

256
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:19,980
They gave me

257
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,190
some new items.

258
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,470
I'll go back and check the price.

259
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,819
Okay.

260
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,339
Come here.

261
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,660
Let's start the formal training.

262
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,480
[Competitive Shooting Game]

263
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,740
Competitive Shooting Game.

264
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,560
Besides individual ability,

265
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,250
the most important thing is the teamwork among you four guys

266
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,900
Different positions have different functions.

267
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,060
Who takes the lead,

268
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,300
who collects information

269
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,380
and who puts and suppresses.

270
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,710
Only mutual coordination

271
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,580
can maximize strength and comprehensive improvement.

272
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,880
People who are professional

273
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,920
are gifted.

274
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,230
But without teamwork,

275
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,530
it's hard for a genius to perform at his best.

276
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,350
Since it's a joint operation,

277
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,260
we need to divide our tasks.

278
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,340
Last night,

279
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,210
I watched your single video.

280
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,670
According to your performance,

281
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
the sniper position, Chu Tian,

282
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,640
assault position, Dong Shi.

283
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,930
The observation position is Hong Yang.

284
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,920
The freeman and the commander, Xiao Yichuan.

285
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,040
Any objections?

286
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,380
What is the basis for being a commander?

287
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:20,900
Unconvinced?

288
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:21,840
Yes.

289
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,810
Hold it.

290
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,770
Don't think about flying before you learn how to walk.

291
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,340
You might fall down.

292
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,980
How about a game?

293
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,780
Don't provoke me.

294
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,500
I don't buy it.

295
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,830
Find someone else to play with you.

296
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,370
Chu Tian, come here.

297
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,280
Drink some water. It's only the first day.

298
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't be nervous.

299
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,380
Where are you going?

300
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,990
I don't drink water either.

301
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,210
I want no sour, only sweet

302
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,500
and unsweetened lemonade.

303
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,210
The water temperature is 11 degrees.

304
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,070
Huh?

305
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,480
Call me when you're ready.

306
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,690
If you're done, let's start.

307
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,650
Arrange the training content yourselves.

308
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,860
Sit here for 12 hours.

309
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,070
Let's begin.

310
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,290
Hong Yang.

311
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,990
In the final round,

312
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,120
150 rounds of rifle ammunition are enough.

313
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,270
Check it when it's transferred to the point.

314
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,800
Chu Tian, pay attention to choose open terrain to move.

315
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,720
Don't be greedy.

316
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,580
Go back to cover and find the time to attack.

317
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,240
Keep shooting in advance

318
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,700
when you are rushing into the room.

319
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,540
Good.

320
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,480
This is what you want.

321
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,620
It's not sour but sweet but no sugar.

322
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,590
11 degrees lemonade with honey.

323
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,490
Drink it.

324
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,750
It's going to be 10 degrees.

325
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,580
Finished?

326
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,660
Then go to practice.

327
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,120
I don't need the basic training.

328
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,320
Really?

329
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,430
Come on.

330
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,950
Come with me.

331
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,030
Eye protector.

332
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:57,700
Here.

333
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,240
The eye protector is here.

334
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,700
This thing is to pay IQ tax.

335
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,780
It doesn't work.

336
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,730
There are so many kinds of foot massage equipment.

337
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,280
An old E-sports team?

338
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,490
I suggest that you choose a small one.

339
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,220
It's crowded under the table.

340
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,990
Chu Tian's stage timer.

341
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,630
I think

342
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,880
this one allows everyone to have one.

343
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,160
It's necessary for a junior player.

344
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,790
No need for me.

345
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,490
So what?

346
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,840
Talk after you read Chu Tian's data.

347
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,550
His combo speed and accuracy

348
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,920
are better than many professional players.

349
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,570
Don't think that people

350
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,430
who can't do it today will never do it.

351
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,310
By the way,

352
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,040
take it and check the price.

353
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,080
See you in half an hour.

354
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,730
That's a lot. You did it on purpose, didn't you?

355
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,360
That's too much.

356
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,650
This man

357
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,950
is really unreliable.

358
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,700
Enjoy yourself.

359
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,600
I'm leaving. Bye.

360
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,630
You pulled me out and left me behind.

361
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,580
Is it your usual style to leave whenever you want?

362
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,460
Xiong Jiujiu.

363
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,100
Xiong Jiujiu.

364
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,780
Please hurry to the service desk on the second floor after hearing the broadcast.

365
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,420
Your dad is waiting for you.

366
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,980
Xiong Jiujiu.

367
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,710
Xiong Jiujiu.

368
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,650
Please hurry to the service desk on the second floor after hearing the broadcast.

369
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,370
Your dad is waiting for you.

370
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,730
Hello?

371
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,360
Dr. Chen.

372
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,280
I didn't forget. I'm a little late.

373
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:17,890
See you later.

374
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,560
Original and copy of license.

375
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,580
The participants need at least five players.

376
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,560
Including substitute...

377
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,230
Substitute player.

378
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,530
Capt. Qin.

379
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,580
Hello, Capt. Qin.

380
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,020
We need to write a substitute player.

381
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,420
Can I write you?

382
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,040
I won't let you play then.

383
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,940
Okay. Thank you, Capt. Qin.

384
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,910
Qin Zheng.

385
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,090
[Sign up successfully]

386
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,090
[See you on the field]

387
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:26,850
After registration,

388
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,680
we are the official participating team.

389
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,700
I'm panicking.

390
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,210
Me too.

391
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,620
But my hand is cramping.

392
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,490
Do you have a spoon?

393
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,240
Are you really going to grab a room with a girl?

394
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,350
I'm just teasing her.

395
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,380
I'll move later.

396
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,080
My butt is numb.

397
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,960
Training time is an hour and a half away.

398
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,820
Hurry up.

399
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,310
What is this? Secret operations?

400
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,320
Here are some of your problems.

401
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,620
The flying speed of skydiving in the ninth round

402
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,450
is more than 130 kilometers per hour.

403
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,980
The parachute skating at full speed

404
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,420
is over 2,000 meters.

405
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,200
Consider vertical and horizontal

406
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,510
when forcing the gun.

407
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,780
The average survival time and damage rate

408
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,550
are not proportional.

409
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,730
The shooting rate of wheat fields and grass grounds

410
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,740
are less than half of the alley battle.

411
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,110
Chu Tian's one is much less than mine.

412
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,380
Today is the first day of training.

413
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,820
Except for

414
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,020
some specific operations,

415
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,340
I also wrote some battle habits

416
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,580
for each of you.

417
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,380
There will be more and more sticky notes in the future.

418
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,700
Take it back and paste it around the computer.

419
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,330
It's like going back to before the college entrance exams.

420
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,680
This is my habit of working in a professional field.

421
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,940
I hope it will help you.

422
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,720
Thank you, Capt. Qin.

423
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,060
Chuan,

424
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,170
did you train like this before?

425
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,940
I have

426
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,230
more of this stuff than you have before.

427
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:07,810
So,

428
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,150
don't try to become fat in one bite.

429
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,420
Hey, Chuan,

430
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,040
I think both of us have the problem of forcing the gun.

431
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,180
Why don't you

432
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,720
teach us the magic skill

433
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,410
of your eight times scope gun-forcing?

434
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,020
That skill is invincible.

435
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,850
I'm back!

436
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,010
You're back.

437
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,220
Let's eat.

438
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I told you

439
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,710
I'll work late today.

440
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,720
So you don't have to worry about me.

441
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,370
If I don't,

442
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,150
will you eat on time?

443
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,430
Eat.

444
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,830
Chuan, please teach us.

445
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,210
Teach you what?

446
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,140
The gun-forcing.

447
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,700
Capt. Qin pointed out

448
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,050
everyone's training problems today.

449
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,860
Everyone has the problem of gun-forcing.

450
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,220
We want Chuan

451
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,200
to show us.

452
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,680
You know his eight times scope gun-forcing.

453
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,700
God's operation.

454
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,720
That's true.

455
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,290
Fine.

456
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,930
But don't close yourself after seeing it.

457
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,330
Let's go.

458
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,790
Chuan is awesome.

459
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,180
Chu Tian is good too.

460
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,640
We have to work hard.

461
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,960
Let's grow together.

462
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:00,860
Chu Tian,

463
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,740
your gun-forcing was really amazing.

464
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,660
I tried it before, but it was hard.

465
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,490
Good job.

466
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,720
Thank you.

467
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,930
I'll wash some fruits for you.

468
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,410
Okay. ## 好(Okay./OK.)

469
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,030
I'll catch up with you,

470
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,250
then surpass you.

471
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,890
And let you fall under my gun.

472
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,700
-You're dreaming. -Chu Tian.

473
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,380
You have to know that as a rookie,

474
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,170
and you can play like this, which is already quite good.

475
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,100
No.

476
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,980
Yes.

477
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,590
Mr. Dong and I have a lot of problems.

478
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,810
It's just some minor operations.

479
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,020
When did you start playing?

480
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,310
A few days ago.

481
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,450
Few...

482
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,460
He's born with a gun-forcing.

483
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,880
Oh no.

484
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,340
Look at those shots.

485
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,770
That's right.

486
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,500
Chu Tian.

487
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,730
With your talent, as long as you train hard,

488
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,280
no one will be your opponent.

489
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,780
Here, fruit.

490
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,550
Thank you.

491
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,090
You should know

492
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,590
your current data

493
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,820
is higher than professional players.

494
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,940
But you should rest today.

495
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,440
You've been training for 14 hours.

496
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,060
Go back to sleep after eating the fruit.

497
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,410
14 hours is nothing.

498
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,420
I was...

499
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,080
You...

500
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,300
How were you?

501
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,440
Why are you standing here?

502
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,880
You want your 11-degree sugar-free lemonade again?

503
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,180
You eat a lot and don't work much.

504
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,710
You talk too much all day long.

505
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,820
Eat a lot and don't work much.

506
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,910
Who are you mocking?

507
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,300
You're invincible if you have some talent?

508
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,040
Do you think playing video games is a game?

509
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,480
Do you know how long it took me to get where I am today?

510
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,680
This Xiong Jiujiu pissed me off.

511
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,020
I shouldn't be soft-hearted.

512
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,850
I won't move out of this room.

513
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,660
I'm sorry.

514
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,880
I misunderstood you.

515
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,420
I'm sorry.

516
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,970
I apologize.

517
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,650
Don't be angry. I'm sorry.

518
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,710
Why aren't you saying anything?

519
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,530
Well,

520
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,180
what do you mean?

521
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,830
Say something.

522
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm so angry today.

523
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,850
The kid in the next bed

524
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,940
is pretending to be nice with a smile.

525
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,770
He even acts cute to my nurse every day.

526
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,440
My disappointing little nurse even

527
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,060
took my water for him.

528
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,080
I'm angry too.

529
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,940
I couldn't help mocking my industry leader colleague

530
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,240
and blamed him wrongly.

531
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,360
I wanted to apologize.

532
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,970
But he ignored me.

533
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,530
Why do you

534
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,150
always pick on him?

535
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,900
Maybe I don't want to be looked down upon by him.

536
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,400
I didn't want to argue with him.

537
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,630
Actually, he has many advantages.

538
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,980
He might have forgiven you.

539
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,870
Then why did he treat me coldly?

540
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,900
I think

541
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,530
he is cuter

542
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,449
when shouting.

543
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,070
What are you doing?

544
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,300
Capt. Qin.

545
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,700
Why are you still up?

546
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,060
Aren't you tired of moving house?

547
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,670
I didn't move.

548
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,550
I came out for some fresh air.

549
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,190
Is something wrong?

550
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,340
Of course not.

551
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,820
A person who used to train

552
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,860
for over ten hours

553
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,450
suddenly stopped training.

554
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,040
Are you sure you're okay?

555
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,170
They all say you've become a loner and unlike others.

556
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,760
I didn't believe it.

557
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,470
I still think the old you

558
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,640
suits you better.

559
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,060
If you have any problems,

560
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,610
you must tell me.

561
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,980
Look.

562
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,770
Does he look like you in the past?

563
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,080
His hit rate is so high.

564
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,070
I underestimated him.

565
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,130
I told you not to buy so much.

566
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,080
It's okay.

567
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,540
There are so many people in the base.

568
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,640
If you eat well, you will train well.

569
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,270
Well,

570
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
did he

571
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,140
make trouble for you last night?

572
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,090
No.

573
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,390
I don't know why

574
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,180
he went to sleep on the floor yesterday.

575
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,490
I want to buy some fitness equipment.

576
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,130
Where should I put it?

577
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,770
Xiong Jiujiu.

578
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,170
Team official WeChat Popularity Voting.

579
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,090
Why did you bring Xiaojiujiu

580
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,880
to pair up with me?

581
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,060
Is it beautiful?

582
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,110
I'm just doing my job impartially.

583
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,420
This is Mr. Dong's idea.

584
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,880
I'll delete it if you don't like it.

585
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,140
So buying fitness equipment

586
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,530
is favoritism to this unidentified connected person?

587
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,570
This is Capt. Qin's idea.

588
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,130
When you improve your skills,

589
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,510
you also need physical training.

590
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,640
You sit on the sofa every day.

591
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,640
You should be the one with the worst physical fitness

592
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,810
on the team.

593
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,010
Do you know

594
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,160
if I'm physically fit?

595
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,390
You...

596
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,530
Let's compete.

597
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,770
The loser will admit defeat.

598
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,130
OK. ## 好(Okay./OK.)

599
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,780
I'll make you convinced.

600
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,570
Are you two childish?

601
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,420
-You don't understand. -You don't understand.

602
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,780
Are you ready?

603
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,950
Let me remind you.

604
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,240
Don't cry if you lose.

605
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,470
Three, two, one.

606
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,720
Tablet.

607
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,280
Who is the most skilled person in the world?

608
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,580
Chu Tian.

609
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,380
Really?

610
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,900
Tablet.

611
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,580
Who is the most handsome man

612
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,470
in the world?

613
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,590
Chu Tian.

614
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,080
Okay.

615
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:34,320
Okay.

616
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,250
Tablet.

617
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,370
Who is the best match for her

618
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,130
in the world?

619
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,110
Chu Tian.

620
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,540
I seem to know something.
