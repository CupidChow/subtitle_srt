00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,120
I know Xiong Jiujiu likes you.

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,140
And I admit

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,230
I like her.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,220
I've been in love with her

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,960
for many years.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,720
When I was young,

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,100
I followed my sister everywhere

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,120
so that I could see her more.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,260
I didn't understand

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,780
what kind of feeling it was.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,780
But I only know that

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,360
Xiong Jiujiu is the only person

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,080
that I want to

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,220
get close to.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,860
Afterwards,

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,860
we grew up

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,300
and left home for study.

19
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,230
I couldn't see her.

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,390
Every time she sent me a voice message,

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,110
I could listen to it many times.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,820
Every time I made a phone call with her,

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,830
I felt like celebrating the New Year.

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,580
Every time before the holiday,

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,700
I started to feel happy

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,530
a month earlier.

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,980
Anyway, everything about her

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,870
can be carved in my mind easily.

29
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,130
Every food she likes,

30
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,330
her habits,

31
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,220
every Weibo tweet

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,950
and Wechat Moment she posted,

33
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,310
I can remember all of them.

34
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,110
Because of her,

35
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,940
I want to become

36
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,210
a better person.

37
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,080
I've never absent in her life.

38
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,910
Even if I could only stand by her side

39
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,820
and look at her quietly,

40
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,970
I feel satisfied.

41
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,660
You've been holding it in for so many years.

42
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:22,940
Don't you feel bad?

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,620
I'm used to it.

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,740
Then

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,780
what do you think?

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,480
I know her well.

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,800
Even though I tried my best to stay by her side,

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,610
she still treats me as a friend,

49
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,860
as her family,

50
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,180
and a younger brother.

51
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,460
So I never wanted to give her pressure

52
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:02,940
until

53
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,380
you appeared.

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,220
One day,

55
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,990
Xiong Jiujiu told me

56
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,880
she met a boy.

57
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,510
Although they've never met,

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,000
she understood his dream.

59
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,010
She was looking forward

60
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,900
to meeting you.

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,130
I was a freshman in college at that time.

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,210
I knew

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,320
I might never have a chance.

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,490
But then you didn't meet each other.

65
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,530
I wondered

66
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,620
whether it was another chance

67
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,100
given by the god.

68
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,780
But Xiong Jiujiu

69
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,550
never opened her heart again.

70
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,330
My plan was that

71
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,460
after graduation,

72
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,890
I would come back

73
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,010
and keep her company.

74
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,780
I'm not going anywhere.

75
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,780
I thought one day,

76
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,450
she would see me standing behind her.

77
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,240
I just didn't expect that

78
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,450
I waited for her for three years,

79
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,300
and she waited for you for three years.

80
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,790
Did you join this team

81
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,740
because of Xiong Jiujiu?

82
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,980
Aren't you here for her?

83
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,100
Yes.

84
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,370
I did it for her.

85
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,380
I hope

86
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,860
in the long-term partnership list of the company next year,

87
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,850
I can see these names.

88
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,920
If you do well,

89
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,380
you'll be the general manager of the business department.

90
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,050
I won't let you down,

91
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,050
Mr. Huo.

92
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,020
Go.

93
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,820
As soon as possible.

94
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,460
Okay.

95
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,350
These clients

96
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,170
have been working with JR for many years.

97
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,620
Are you confident to get them?

98
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,580
They just haven't met

99
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,980
new partners who can bring

100
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,340
more profits.

101
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,300
Businessmen

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,970
are profit-seeking.

103
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,090
Is this also your way to poach Xiao Yichuan?

104
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,020
Xiao Yichuan is not the only man I want.

105
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,210
It's great to get him here.

106
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,260
But if we can bring more strong clients

107
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,900
to the company,

108
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,190
do you know

109
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,760
how many times of ON's market value

110
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,700
will increase?

[Episode 15]

113
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,860
Uncle Hong.

114
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,770
Why did you slash the E-sports department?

115
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,460
Several major clients of our company terminated the cooperation with us.

116
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,980
They won't renew the contract next year.

117
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,930
These big frames

118
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,900
are one of the main source of cash flow every year.

119
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:21,970
Without them,

120
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,060
the operation of the company next year

121
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,980
will be greatly affected.

122
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,320
But that's the problem of other departments in the company.

123
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,620
Why did you slash our E-sports department?

124
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,460
Didn't you tell my dad at the last meeting

125
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,050
that since we're qualified for the play-in match,

126
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,860
we have great potential?

127
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,940
You're right.

128
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,210
This is not the responsibility of the E-sports department.

129
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,620
But the company is short of funds.

130
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,909
In order to ensure

131
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,100
the steady operation of the company

132
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,290
from the latter half of this year to next year,

133
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,860
we must reduce the cost

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,200
and focus on the stable business of the company.

135
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,860
So you turned the focus away from the E-sports department?

136
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,830
The E-sports department

137
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,010
is not the only one who faces cost reduction.

138
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,190
The company won't calculate

139
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,260
the cost that the E-sports department has spent.

140
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,280
As for the budget that hasn't been used yet,

141
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,180
the company will withdraw,

142
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,290
including the deposit for the competition.

143
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,170
Besides,

144
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,380
your base, as the company's asset,

145
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,380
will be taken back

146
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,420
and be used for other purpose.

147
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,810
If the company is under financial pressure,

148
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,070
the base might be sold.

149
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,300
You have three days

150
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,820
to move out.

151
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,690
Mr. Hong,

152
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,140
this is too sudden.

153
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,840
How can we train if we move out?

154
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,590
There is only one month before the competition.

155
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,790
We...

156
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,890
I'll go find my dad.

157
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,090
Dong.

158
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,970
The chairman is also very sad now.

159
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,730
You should grow up.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,590
Well,

161
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,930
could you please give me some time?

162
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
We can't quit.

163
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,530
Keep the disbandment of the E-sports department a secret.

164
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,310
Give me some time.

165
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,340
Don't be sad.

166
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,500
The company is under financial pressure.

167
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,100
We should understand that.

168
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,100
Dong Shi and I

169
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,610
will continue to follow up.

170
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,380
I'll make everyone come back as soon as possible.

171
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,150
Just see it as a break.

172
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,160
Yes.

173
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,900
Capt. Qin is right.

174
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,070
Everyone has been working hard lately.

175
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,030
You can use this period of time

176
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,300
to have a rest.

177
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,610
Consider it

178
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,800
as a short break before the competition.

179
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,560
The day after tomorrow,

180
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,580
the company will come to check the base.

181
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,860
Let's have a rest

182
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,380
and pack up.

183
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,960
The manager asked you to rest,

184
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,830
but the captain didn't agree.

185
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,270
He just asked you to go somewhere else.

186
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,320
Why do you look like it's the end of the world?

187
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,100
Capt. Qin and I

188
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,210
used to train in internet cafes.

189
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,370
You are like those young masters who have never lived a hard life.

190
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,490
Hong Yang.

191
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,720
Don't slack off when you get back to the dorm.

192
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,940
Even if you have to do your homework,

193
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,020
don't give me back

194
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,890
the poor skills you have learned.

195
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,650
Don't worry, Chuan.

196
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,500
And you.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,680
Kid,

198
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,410
I'll check your training results.

199
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,790
Anytime you want.

200
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,520
It doesn't matter where we train.

201
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,500
We can also make an online training.

202
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,650
Besides,

203
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:30,830
Capt. Qin

204
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,310
can also watch our live stream and screen recording

205
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,630
to review it for us.

206
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,500
Okay.

207
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,550
It's a deal.

208
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,050
During this period,

209
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,510
Chu Tian is mainly responsible for commanding solo and foursome.

210
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,100
Hong Yang should improve the speed and shooting rate.

211
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,670
Today,

212
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,930
the E-sports JR Team is officially formed.

213
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,710
Our base

214
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,060
is facing south.

215
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,110
It's square and full of Yang energy.

216
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,630
To my best teammates.

217
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,480
Every one of us

218
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,080
is like each other's family.

219
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,850
Cheers.

220
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,740
Good luck, my family.

221
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,500
Leave me alone for a while.

222
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,820
Hey.

223
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,480
Don't forget

224
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,740
how you promised me and Miss Chu Tian.

225
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,400
Chuan.

226
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,100
Are you leaving?

227
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,800
Why didn't you stay with your mom?

228
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,650
Someone is still waiting to be fed at home.

229
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,680
Chuan.

230
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,270
Wait.

231
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,740
I have something to tell you.

232
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,500
Remember the show you attended last time?

233
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,860
The response was very possitive.

234
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,620
A few bosses

235
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,220
wanted me to introduce

236
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,500
them to you.

237
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,450
Why?

238
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,530
I'm not interested in socializing.

239
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,800
Because they want to sign you!

240
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,860
I have a team.

241
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,430
Your current level

242
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,290
doesn't match the team at all.

243
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,580
Did you stay in that stupid team

244
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,980
because of Xiong Jiujiu?

245
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,410
Can you be more mature?

246
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,660
This is my own business.

247
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,440
Delete Wang Boyu

248
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,030
in case he keeps harassing you.

249
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,260
It's okay.

250
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,140
I just take him as a practice.

251
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,820
But

252
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,040
as the commander of SIK,

253
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,210
he's calm

254
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,140
and has a quick response.

255
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,910
The rhythm is under his control.

256
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,270
In face of an emergency,

257
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,770
he can solve it quickly.

258
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,000
What?

259
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,390
You changed side in the war so quickly?

260
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,550
I'm just telling how I feel.

261
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,300
There are many excellent seniors.

262
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,650
Learn from them.

263
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:37,830
In the future,

264
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,080
surpass them all.

265
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,050
Don't worry.

266
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,040
You are no exception.

267
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,500
Come on.

268
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,070
Try the soup my mom cooked.

269
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,140
It's been cooked for hours.

270
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,300
I even brought the pot here.

271
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,620
Thank you.

272
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,760
Drink slowly.

273
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,910
After leaving the base,

274
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,079
you can't even take care of yourself?

275
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,190
It's not like you.

276
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,520
When do you think

277
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,250
we can go back?

278
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,900
It doesn't matter.

279
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,450
If the earth doesn't explode,

280
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,770
the training will not stop.

281
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,030
If the universe doesn't restart,

282
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,130
don't think about resting.

283
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,220
I'm not talking about training.

284
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,650
I'm worried about the team.

285
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,620
Are you worried about Xiong Jiujiu?

286
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,660
I know what you're thinking.

287
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,380
I will face myself

288
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,800
and give myself an explanation.

289
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,580
I hope you will too.

290
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,480
Okay.

291
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,900
Eat slowly.

292
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,410
Did your sister abuse you?

293
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,350
Didn't she feed you?

294
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,340
Eating the food cooked by my sister

295
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
is being abused.

296
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,180
How about

297
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,370
we order takeouts?

298
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,700
No need.

299
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,080
It's good.

300
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,300
Alright.

301
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,990
Stop eating.

302
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,220
The food is not eatable.

303
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,220
I'll order takeouts.

304
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:45,930
Don't act tough.

305
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,900
I once promised you

306
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,820
I would give Chu Tian

307
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,020
a reliable and stable job

308
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,860
and take him to the world's top competition.

309
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,520
I might break my promise.

310
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,570
I told Chu Tian that

311
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,110
when he graduated,

312
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,020
I'd be an independent designer

313
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,740
who earned millions a month,

314
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,700
and his daily work

315
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,580
would be to count money for me.

316
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,360
So I broke my promise too?

317
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,820
Why do you want to

318
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,130
be an independent designer and open an online store?

319
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,080
I used to work for

320
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,250
a fashion magazine.

321
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,260
The salary and prospects were all good.

322
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,380
But it was not enough for me.

323
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,920
I've learned fashion design for so many years.

324
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,700
I fell out with my parents

325
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,290
because I wanted to resign and run an online store.

326
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,730
At that time,

327
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,380
I stayed up late

328
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,660
at night

329
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,580
to create designs.

330
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,880
In the morning,

331
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,180
I went to the factory to carry fabrics.

332
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,720
It was tiring.

333
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,580
I thought about giving up.

334
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,660
And then?

335
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,180
Then I've been persistent till now.

336
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,900
Look at me now.

337
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,710
I'm not a famous designer,

338
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,500
but I do

339
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,560
what I love every day.

340
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,260
So I'm happy every day.

341
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,310
But sometimes, passion and love alone

342
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,570
cannot support the dream.

343
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,420
Passion may not support your dream,

344
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,870
but sticking to your passion can.

345
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,340
If you feel like you can't persist,

346
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,090
just grit your teeth.

347
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,700
Your teeth haven't been broken yet.

348
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
Don't ever mention quit.

349
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,740
Okay.

350
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,820
I'll grit my teeth.

351
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,970
[Office of the Chairman]

352
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,420
As for the company's decision,

353
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,700
I understand

354
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,490
and also respect it.

355
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,140
The E-sports department didn't grow rapidly.

356
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,860
The profitability

357
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,780
is much weaker

358
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,620
than that of other departments.

359
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,820
It's been holding the company back.

360
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,130
As an employee

361
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,540
and your son,

362
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,220
I couldn't do more for the company.

363
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,750
I'm sorry, dad.

364
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,930
But I just want to make one last request.

365
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,020
Can you keep the relevant qualifications of JR Team?

366
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,020
It may just be an empty name for you,

367
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,860
but for us,

368
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,760
this is a chance we finally got.

369
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,320
Is it meaningful?

370
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,590
As for the 5 million deposit for your participation,

371
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,780
-with your ability... -It's meaningful.

372
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,840
As long as the seat is still there,

373
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,300
everything is meaningful.

374
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,770
Going with empty hands?

375
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:03,950
Is that okay?

376
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,340
Sure.

377
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,730
The company will no longer provide any support.

378
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,340
It's okay.

379
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,210
We'll figure out a way.

380
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,240
We can seek investment

381
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,170
or find sponsors.

382
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,700
We'll handle it.

383
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,180
As long as JR is still there

384
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,100
and our team is still there.

385
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,260
From your words,

386
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,130
I can see that you've grown up.

387
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,660
I promise you.

388
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,290
I'll keep the relevant qualifications

389
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,850
of the E-sports team.

390
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,320
If

391
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,070
you can make your own living

392
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,380
whether by sponsorship

393
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,240
or investment,

394
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,260
the company won't take it.

395
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,580
It's

396
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,450
all yours.

397
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,770
Thank you, Dad.

398
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,880
Previously,

399
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,560
I have been criticizing you

400
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,060
because I thought

401
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,580
you just liked playing games.

402
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,500
Back then,

403
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,530
I gave you some money to do E-sports

404
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,700
to see

405
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,060
if you just did it halfheartedly.

406
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,430
Today, I know

407
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,830
you're not fooling around.

408
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,060
I really hope

409
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,970
to help you fulfill your dream.

410
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,650
But you have to

411
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,260
make the dream come true by yourself.

412
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,640
Hello, Mr. Wang.

413
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,180
Okay.

414
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,300
Mr. Li.

415
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,540
I'm Dong.

416
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:54,980
I'm Dong.

417
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,450
Mr. Wang.

418
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,620
I wonder if

419
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,850
you know anything about E-sports?

420
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,040
That's great.

421
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,100
When do you have time?

422
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,820
I will go find you.

423
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,980
What's going on with the department?

424
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,370
Xiong Jiujiu.

425
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,810
How about

426
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,050
I transfer you to the basketball team

427
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,840
for internship?

428
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,330
Back then,

429
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,850
I forced you to join the E-sports department.

430
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,970
If you want to quit,

431
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,050
I can transfer your internship certificate.

432
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,650
No.

433
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,650
I just want to stay in the E-sports department.

434
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,180
Is the circumstance

435
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,610
very bad?

436
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,460
Yes.

437
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,660
My dad told me

438
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,700
the qualifications of our team

439
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,410
can be kept.

440
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,700
But

441
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,930
the competition deposit

442
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,310
can't be raised in a short time.

443
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,920
We should pay the deposit

444
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,950
15 working days before the competition.

445
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,340
Now,

446
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,580
we only have less than two weeks.

447
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,450
Time is running out.

448
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,550
I need to find a way.

449
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,460
You're just an intern.

450
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,060
I can't risk

451
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,300
your future.

452
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:32,720
Let's do it together.

453
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,770
Let's attract investment for the team

454
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
and get the deposit.

455
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,260
I'm the manager of JR Team.

456
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,040
I can't give up my team

457
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,830
at this moment.

458
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,980
It's what I should face.

459
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,930
It's what we should face.

460
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,590
Alright.

461
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,720
After I handle the matters

462
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,350
in the school,

463
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,050
I'll go back to you.

464
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,300
Wait for me.

465
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,820
Xiong Jiujiu.

466
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,810
Mrs. Zhang.

467
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,060
I haven't seen you in the school recently.

468
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,860
How was your internship?

469
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,690
Did it go well?

470
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,260
Not bad.

471
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,280
I have something to tell you.

472
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,420
NESG came to our school to recruit.

473
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,010
We recommended a few students.

474
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,410
Your resume was approved.

475
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,090
They will come for the interview tomorrow.

476
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,230
Go back and update your resume.

477
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,540
Every year,

478
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,380
only three or five students

479
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,530
can get the chance for the interview.

480
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,100
You must seize the chance.

481
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,920
But Mrs. Zhang,

482
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,700
I'm an intern at JR Sports Ltd.

483
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,180
I don't want to go to another company for the time being.

484
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,620
You don't want to go to NESG either?

485
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,260
NESG is one of the organizers of

486
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,010
the Global League Tournament this year.

487
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,440
An interview opportunity from such an international company

488
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,750
is so rare

489
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,030
for the fresh graduates.

490
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:44,980
Well,

491
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:45,800
how about this?

492
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,870
Tomorrow

493
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,210
I will still go for the interview.

494
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,470
I'll explain to the HR.

495
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,630
You're the manager of JR Team, right?

496
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,620
I have seen you

497
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,260
on the show E-sports Canteen.

498
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,700
Yes.

499
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,860
I'm the intern manager

500
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,380
of JR Team.

501
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,700
Also a manager.

502
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,910
Are you satisfied with your current job?

503
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,620
Do you have a long-term career plan?

504
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,370
I like

505
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,680
the current job very much.

506
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,140
At the same time,

507
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,480
I'm very satisfied with myself

508
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,390
because I've grown up for this job.

509
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,680
So,

510
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,080
I want to take it

511
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,900
as my future career and work hard.

512
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,820
I can see

513
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,900
you really like your current job.

514
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,660
As for this year's Global League Tournament,

515
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,440
NESG is one of the organizers.

516
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,180
What do you think about our company?

517
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,780
Actually, I'm here

518
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,980
to express my gratitude to your company.

519
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,620
I don't want to leave JR Team for now.

520
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,470
I want to stay with my team

521
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,620
forever.

522
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,620
It seems that she values loyalty and love.

523
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,260
This is the information of the job for which you interviewed today.

524
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,950
Take it back and have a look.

525
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,620
We really like you.

526
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,940
I hope you not to make hasty decisions now.

527
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,100
Think about it carefully.

528
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,400
We'll contact you again.

529
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,390
Thank you.

530
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,500
[Introduction to NESG]

531
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,510
So great.

532
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,350
Is the team not going well?

533
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:21,860
Not bad.

534
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,050
Tomorrow,

535
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,500
Dong Shi and I

536
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,850
will meet the sponsors.

537
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,960
But your sad face

538
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,300
doesn't show "not bad".

539
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,570
Are you crying?

540
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,210
You can cry on my shoulder.

541
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,500
I was just thinking

542
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,990
how I joined this team

543
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,330
accidentally

544
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,860
and dragged you all in.

545
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,930
I wonder if you will regret it.

546
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,830
What about you?

547
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,100
If I give you another chance to choose,

548
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,350
would you still join the team?

549
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,060
I think I will.

550
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,580
So, look.

551
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,390
What is supposed to happen will happen.

552
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,740
No need to struggle with it.

553
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,940
Just...

554
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,570
Like you.

555
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,080
Just like me.

556
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,150
Back then,

557
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,130
I joined the E-sports team

558
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,060
because of you.

559
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,460
It's like when I was young.

560
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,710
Wherever you went,

561
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,860
I would always follow you.

562
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,180
Do you remember once

563
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,540
we skipped night study to set off fireworks?

564
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:51,820
In the end,

565
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,260
the fireworks burnt my leg.

566
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,340
You felt so guilty

567
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,120
that you insisted on riding a bike to send me to school every day.

568
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,120
You didn't stop despite the weather.

569
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,800
You insisted for half a year.

570
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,510
Actually, my injury had already recovered.

571
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,860
I lied to you for months.

572
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,510
I cherish the days so much.

573
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,320
I still can't forget

574
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,230
the days I spent with you.

575
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,580
At that time,

576
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,610
you only worried about my leg

577
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,160
burned by the fireworks.

578
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,420
But I only remember

579
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,020
the fireworks we watched together.

580
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,730
They were very beautiful.

581
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,410
Xiong Jiujiu.

582
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,330
Yes?

583
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,130
I like you.

584
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,110
But this like

585
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,300
ends here.

586
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,770
I might be used to it these years.

587
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,940
Wherever you go,

588
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,900
I wanted to follow you.

589
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,480
I wished to

590
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,860
be with you forever.

591
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,530
I wished to follow you,

592
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,260
stay by your side,

593
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,070
and protect you.

594
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,350
But I realized

595
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,350
you were strong enough

596
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,040
to protect yourself.

597
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,760
You've known clearly

598
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,620
where your happiness

599
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,020
is.

600
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,890
So I can,

601
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,900
with relief,

602
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,440
say goodbye

603
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,300
to my feelings.

604
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,770
I didn't expect

605
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,790
that my brother

606
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,020
has grown up.

607
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,300
You have your own thoughts.

608
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,880
But I never realized it.

609
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,320
Now I realize

610
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,310
I was the one who didn't grow up.

611
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,370
I took your care for me

612
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,790
for granted.

613
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,290
I didn't notice your thoughts.

614
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,870
I ignored your feelings.

615
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,750
I'm sorry.

616
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,469
I've always treated you as my family.

617
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,969
I never thought

618
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,870
there would be other feelings between us.

619
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,639
You will find your

620
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,540
own love.

621
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,020
You will find the girl

622
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,580
who treats you as the only one.

623
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,380
Alright.

624
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,690
The fireworks are over.

625
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,389
You let slip me.

626
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,659
It's a lifelong regret.

627
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,050
So don't let slip Xiao Yichuan.

628
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,600
Actually,

629
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,070
if you lower your standards,

630
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,889
he is quite good.

631
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,840
I promised Miss Chu Tian

632
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,580
to go back early.

633
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,950
I'm leaving.

634
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,260
Did you sleep here

635
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,660
last night?

636
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,630
It was too late when I finished the proposal last night.

637
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,620
Have you read what I sent you?

638
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,730
Print it out later.

639
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,580
We need it for signing with clients in the morning.

640
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:22,860
I've read it.

641
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,420
I have added some content.

642
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,210
I've printed it out.

643
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:28,860
You,

644
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,260
go and wash up.

645
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,330
Leave the rest to me.

646
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,500
I'll tidy up.

647
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,230
Xiong Jiujiu.

648
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,860
You are the best manager

649
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,730
I've ever worked with.

650
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,380
Come on.

651
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,980
I'm the only manager you've worked with, right?

652
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,310
We'll get enough money for the deposit.

653
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:51,740
Yes.

654
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,010
Go wash up.

655
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,530
Manager,

656
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,950
I'll wait for you after work downstairs at night.

657
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,280
I'll do my best.

658
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,490
See you tonight.

659
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,900
Is this the birthday gift

660
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:19,700
you prepared for Xiong Jiujiu?

661
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Are you sure it's because she can't keep it in her dorm,

662
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,880
not because

663
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,360
she doesn't want it?

664
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,820
She loves it so much.

665
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,940
When she asked me to keep it for her,

666
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,020
she was so reluctant.

667
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,280
I admire your confidence.

668
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:42,700
Hey.

669
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,900
What are you looking for?

670
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,170
I know the location of things better than you do.

671
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,680
I found it.

672
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,460
Business cards?

673
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,130
How long have them been kept?

674
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,100
What are you doing?

675
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,710
I want to introduce investors to our team.

676
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
These brands came to me before.

677
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,910
Xiao Yichuan,

678
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,940
I don't care if you buy shoes.

679
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,900
But now you want to sell your charms for commercial shooting?

680
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,680
Why didn't you discuss with me?

681
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,900
I'm telling you now.

682
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,100
You go to Chu Tian's live stream every day

683
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,180
and tip him a rocket.

684
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,020
What do you think?

685
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,450
You're showing partiality to Chu Tian!

686
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,970
You want me to lose both men and money, right?

687
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,920
But what’s going on

688
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,910
with your team?

689
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,910
Why do you have to attract investment by yourselves?

690
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,690
JR Sports has some financial problems.

691
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,060
We have to pay the daily expenses

692
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,860
and the five-million competition deposit

693
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,010
on our own.

696
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,800
and sponsorship.

697
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,780
It may be faster.

698
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,610
For a team,

699
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,260
you even broke your bottom line.

700
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,140
Xiao Yichuan,

701
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,100
what should I say about you?

702
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,660
You've been stumbling all the way.

703
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Will you be able to compete or not?

704
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,020
In my opinion,

705
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,300
you might as well give up

706
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,650
and recuperate.

707
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,530
Nonsense.

708
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,200
No one else in the team gave up.

709
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,340
The 21 keyboard Chu Tian asked you to give...

710
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,090
Was it in vain?

711
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,460
It was an accident.

712
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,420
But Chu Tian is a very nice person.

713

723

733
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,820

735

736

Not bad.

739

and willing to consider it.

740

742

I don't have time to take care of you.

747

748

What did the doctor say?

749
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,530
I did.

750
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,330
The numbness is gradually disappearing.

751

The inflammation is gone.

752
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,670
The doctor said

753

as long as I don't exercise hard,

754
