When did you figure out it was me?

If you don't tell me the truth,

I'll let you have a prosthetic leg tomorrow.

22
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,650
He actually has a lot of good points.

He is the strongest in our team.

24

He is actually also quite poor.

25
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,060
I found him quite charming

seem to care about him.

29
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,820
So you're playing with me on purpose, right?

30
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,730
I'm not.

31
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,420

How can you not be angry?

35

I really don't mean to hide anything from you,

36

You're not going out, are you?

38
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,940
Fine.

39
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,340
In this case,

40
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,860
I'll go out.

After all, it's true that my first love fell through.

45
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,300
I even went to school to look for you at that time.

46
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,100
But all I saw was you leaving with some guy.

47
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,020
I finally called your phone at night.

48
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,620
It turned out to be answered by a boy again.

One minute of anger

52
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,660
means 60 seconds of unhappiness.

An hour of ager

54

55

You said this

56
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,900
the first time you came to my house.

57
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,380
I was eavesdropping and thinking,

58
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,020
how possibly could a girl be so cute?

59
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,260

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,980
disappeared right away.

61
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,570
I made up my mind at that moment

62
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,690

63

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,820
That's because he's guilty.

177
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,140
He lied to me.

178
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,380
What do you mean?

179
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
In fact, he was the person I got to know online

180
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,850
three years ago.

181
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,540
It's just some white lies.

182
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,570
Just like when I lied to my coach to go to the doctor

183
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,620
but actually I was lining up to buy you.

184
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,360
What's so unforgivable about that?

185
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,760
Don't you think so?

186
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,610
Tanned doll.

187
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,060
I should've confessed my feelings to her earlier if I had known.

188
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,620
But...

189
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,250
She loves me so much.

190
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,340
I'm sure she wouldn't

191
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,180
bother with me for a small lie.

192
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:41,900
Right?

193
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,570
Blue doll.

194
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,660
I moved into this room

195
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,100
for her.

196
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,660
She should know, shouldn't she?

197
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,060
Anyway...

198
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,540
I know now.

She blocked me?

226
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,700
So in a situation like this where you have plenty of time

227
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,980
and are in the case of the initiative,

228
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,860
first switch the gun,

229
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,580
and then attack the building.

230
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
It's time for dinner.

231
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,220
[It's dinner time. When will the manager start dinner?]

232
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,980
When will the manager start dinner?

233
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,450
[It's dinner time. Manager, when will the dinner start?]

[I'm so hungry that my stomach hurts. Is someone in charge?]

I'm so hungry that my stomach hurts.

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,170
Is someone in charge?

237
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,410
[It's dinner time. When will the manager start dinner?]

238
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,410
[I'm so hungry that my stomach hurts. Is someone in charge?]

239
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,410
[Manager. Xiong Jiujiu. Someone here needs to be rescued.]

240
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,140
Manager.

241
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,850
Xiong Jiujiu.

242
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,380
Someone here needs to be rescued.

243
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,820
Is Chuan going crazy

244
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,100
because of hunger?

245
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,620
Everyone come to the living room for a moment.

246
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,020
I have something important to announce.

247
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:40,530
[You're moved out of the group chat by Xiong Jiujiu]

248
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,660
I have something important to announce now.

249
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,420
During the past few days in the hospital,

250
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,700
I've done some serious math.

251
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,980
Although our equipment problem has been solved,

252
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,820
the funds we received from the company

253
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,500
can only meet our daily operation.

254
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,780
If the next batch of payment is still delayed,

255
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,460
we will be faced with

256
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,140
the problem of no reserve fund.

257
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,380
I thought Wang Boyu

258
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,940
introduced us

259
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,380
a live platform before.

260
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,650
So many people signed the contract. It's still not enough?

261
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,930
Yes.

262
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,660
Because that's a contract with the company.

263
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,490
The signing fee and the live streaming share

264
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,260
all go directly into the company's account

265
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,300
as gaming department's revenue.

266
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,100
We don't have the right to use it directly.

267
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,300
Our live revenue

268
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,180
and budget

269
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,420
are separately calculated.

270
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,810
If we don't have enough money,

271
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,490
we still have to follow the procedure to apply for it

272
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,330
and wait for the approval.

273
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,140
So

274
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:29,940
we have to save budget

275
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,460
by reducing daily expenses.

276
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,140
As the manager of the team,

277
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,140
the accountant and the living committee member,

278
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,660
I think I have the responsibility to take care of the financial affairs.

279
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,420
So...

280
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,380
Starting tomorrow, I will implement a money saving plan.

281
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,100
I'll list the plan later.

282
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,540
I'm going to the grocery store.

283
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,500
We'll make our own dinner today.

284
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,620
Really?

285
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,020
We'll make dinner ourselves.

286
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Then what am I responsible for?

287
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,700
Let me go with you.

288
00:15:59,210 --> 00:15:59,980
No need.

289
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,420
Don't you have training today?

290
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,380
But you just got out of the hospital.

291
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,450
Let's go.

292
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,860
I have extra training at night anyway.

293
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,580
Let me go with you.

294
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,340
Let's go, Chu Tian.

295
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,330
It's cold.

296
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,420
So embarrassing.

297
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,700
It is cold.

298
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,980
It's still early.

299
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,340
Do you want to go sit for a while?

300
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,100
All right.

301
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,780
It's so beautiful here.

302
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,980
This will be

303
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,780
our

304
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,940
future secret base.

305
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,090
When you are in a bad mood,

306
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,500
you can come here.

307
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,500
I'm not in a bad mood.

308
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,850
It's just…

309
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,530
You have something on your mind?

310
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,099
Of course

311
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,140
I can't hide anything from you.

312
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,540
I heard it

313
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,660
in front of the hospital room.

314
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,579
I didn't expect him

315
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,780
to reappear.

316
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,090
Nor did you expect him to be Xiao Yichuan.

317
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,980
Don't mention this

318
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,260
in the team.

319
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,060
I can handle it myself.

320
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,980
Then…

321
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,380
If

322
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,420
you don't feel comfortable staying here,

323
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,530
just leave

324
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,980
when the internship is over.

325
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,620
I really like this job.

326
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,020
I wouldn't give it up for anything.

327
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,500
Let's not talk about him.

328
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,570
Let's go back and have some good food.

329
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,660
It can keep you

330
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,860
out of worries.

331
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,180
Let's go.

332
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,420
You guys made all this?

333
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,010
It looks good.

334
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,660
The taste is also good.

335
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,580
Try it.

336
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:42,820
Nice.

337
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,900
Tasty.

338
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,300
Here it comes.

339
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,100
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

340
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,300
Is there a name for our team yet?

341
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,170
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

342
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,260
Finally, on the night of the full moon

343
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,660
when Uranus was transiting,

344
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,660
I got a name

345
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,100
with my English level of four times of trying in CET-4.

346

347
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:22,980
What does that mean?

348
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,140
Just Right.

349
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,610
Just Right.

350
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:27,810
Just Right.

351
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,780
Yes.

352
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,060
Just right.

353
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,460
Not bad at all.

354
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,740
This means our team

355
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,260
is the best combination,

356
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,380
the right choice by God.

357
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,740
I think

358
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,820
this is just an instant name.

359
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,060
How come?

360
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,700
It's the meaning of God's decision.

361
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,020
We meet each other

362
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,170
among millions of people.

363
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,180
In thousands of years,

364
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,900
in the boundless desert of time,

365
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,500
we meet each other not sooner,

366
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,060
not later.

367
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,140
When we encounter, just ask quietly,

368
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,860
you are here too?

369
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:22,940
I mean,

370
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,340
I saw this phrase on the Internet.

371
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,940
But don't you think

372
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,980
this is our destiny?

373
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,180
Instead of reading the book of horoscopes,

374
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,980
you're now reading corny love stories?

375
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,580
In my opinion,

376
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,460
each of you

377
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,460
is indispensable.

378
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,380
In our industry,

379
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,940
many companies

380
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,660
are involved in E-sports

381
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,940
just to make some fame,

382
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,540
raise funds,

383
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,580
and then sell the equity to cash out.

384
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,050
But we are different.

385

We are here together

386
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,660

387
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,810
I've recently realized one thing.

388
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,740
It doesn't matter what you do.

389
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,980
It's all about who you do it with.

390
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,780
We are all here

391
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,540
fighting for the same goal.

392
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,340
Forming this team

393
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,980
and meeting my best teammates

394
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,330
are the most inspiring and romantic things

395
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,140

397
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,700
That is

398
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,020
a touching speech.

399
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,580
So,

400
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,100
this name…

401
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,380
Actually,

402
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,940
JR also has a Chinese meaning.

403
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,620
Think about it before you say it.

404
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,820
We've just decided to accept this name.

405
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,100
It means family.

406
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,730
I hope

407
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,700
we can be like family

Warm enough, right?

411

553
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,660
Who can help me?

554
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,260
Be sure to remind Jiujiu

555
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,380
when you send it.

556

She is now completely ignoring me.

558
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,260
You have only yourself to blame.

559
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,020
Your disguise would have to fall off sooner or later.

560
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,490
Why didn't you be honest with each other early?

561
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,060
Yes, thanks to you,

562
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,860

Since you have your sweetie,

565
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,180
I've become the old one,

566
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,260

567
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,930
That's disgusting.

568
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,300

569
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,780

571
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,420
I really don't want to face

572
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,770
the fact that you're a relationship paranoid.

573
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,540
Love comes too fast like a tornado.

574
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,420
I've given you too much freedom.

575
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,170
Unable to leave the storm zone,

576
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
I can't escape in time.

577
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,660
Xiao Yichuan, that's irritating.

578
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,300
I really want to beat you up.

579
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,940
Tell me.

580
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:56,780
Is she gonna let it go

581
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,940

582
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,700

Chuan.

584
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,260
I've noticed that your temper

585
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,660
has recently become much better

586
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
after turning on your love radar.

587
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,660
But don't just focus on relationship.

588
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,770
Are you sure you want to

589
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,140

590
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,100
They are all newcomers.

591
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,100
I always rely on myself.

592
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,300
Did you go to sleep?

593
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,940
I was wrong.

594
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,409

Hello, Chuan.

738
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,940
It's our first-time meeting.

739
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,370
How are you?

740
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,940
Drink some water.

741
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,300
About the previous communication on the phone

742
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,700
with Manager Xiong,

743
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,260
I've already prepared the latest contract

744
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,050
and sent it to your email.

745
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,380
I've read the contract.

746
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,610
Most of the terms are fine.

747
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,660
But about the legal aspects,

748
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,500
I still need to ask the company's finance and legal affairs

749
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,620
to review it for me.

750
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,220
No problem.

751
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,500
The boss pays special attention to

752
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,900
Chuan's contract signing with our platform this time.

753
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,260
So I was specially instructed

754
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,380
to hear his opinion.

755
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,620
So if you have any ideas and suggestions,

756
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,700
just let me know,

757
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,140
so that we can work with you.

758
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,660
The manager has full authority to represent my wishes.

759
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,180
Well, Mr. Liu,

760
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,020
about the live share,

761
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,620
can we raise it a little more?

762
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,020
Well…

763
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,170
In fact, the share we give you

764
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,850
is already no worse than Team SIK's.

765
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
After all, me and…

766
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,050
Wang, Wang are friends.

767
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,820
So we will naturally

768
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,060
give an appropriate price

769
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,420
to the friend team he introduced to us.

770
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,020
I see.

771
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,340
But you are a new team.

772
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,620
The company has its own rules.

773
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,500
I can't offer too much help.

774
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,580
I hope Manager Xiong can understand it.

775
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,780
I do.

776
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,140
The company should have looked at

777
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,130
our team's network ranking data, right?

778
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,300
But our ranking

779
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,900
has been rising as well.

780
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,140
Think about it.

781
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,730
If our team wins the Global League Tournament

782
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,020
and Red Ant Live

783
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,700
is our exclusive live streaming platform,

784
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,380
what would that mean?

785
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:25,900
Um…

786
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,220
The most iconic battles in gaming history

787
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,860
and the most-talked-about teams

788
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,060
are all underdogs before the game, aren't they?

789
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,300
A comeback against the odds.

790
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,100
The traffic we can bring to the live streaming platform

791
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,980
is very significant.

792
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,620
Xiao Yichuan, don't you think so?

793
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,570
Ah yes.

794
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,540
If we don't talk about it now,

795
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,180
we'll have to raise the price when we win the championship.

796
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,490
So what's your proposed share?

797
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,450
Okay.

798
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,700
I'll apply for it

799
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,340
and see what we can get.

800
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,740
But after you sign the contract,

801
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,530
we will definitely

802
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,980
recommend you some very good advertisers.

803
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,860
I'd really appreciate it.

804
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,500
