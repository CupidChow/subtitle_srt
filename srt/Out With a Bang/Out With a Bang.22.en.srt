1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,630
I will leave JR Team

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,530
and quit the E-sports industry.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,570
Captain Qin.

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,740
Where is Captain Qin?

6
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,930
All of you must be starving

7
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
after a whole day of competition.

8
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,300
Here.

9
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,320
Eat something.

10
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,500
Give some to Hong Yang.

11
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:56,950
Captain Qin

12
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,370
hasn't replied yet?

13
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,620
Not yet.

14
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,970
Chuan,

15
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,170
we should give Captain Qin more time.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,260
I believe he will come back.

17
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,520
Xiong Jiujiu and I will keep contacting him.

18
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,620
Yes.

19
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,460
It's a competition.

20
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,250
Winning and losing are normal.

21
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,460
Don't be too sad.

22
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,910
You did a great job today.

23
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,520
During the battle,

24
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,329
your teamwork was perfect.

25
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,000
The commentators were praising you too.

26
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,210
I felt so passionate and got tearful

27
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,990
when I saw that.

28
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,010
I didn't expect

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,150
ON Team to qualify for the game.

30
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Indeed.

31
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,430
When Captain Qin led us to analyze them,

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,540
we watched several live streams of their training matches

33
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,110
and the videos of their play-in match.

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,420
Especially recently,

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,490
the fighting rhythm of the four players of ON Team

36
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,550
are totally off.

37
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,220
In today's game,

38
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,730
even if God blessed them,

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,560
they shouldn't be able to win the solo match

40
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,900
against so many guru players.

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,640
I really want to know

42
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,260
who they worshiped.

43
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,680
It's my fault.

44
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,810
We almost got it.

45
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,810
During my previous regular training,

46
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,880
I saw you two having a solo match.

47
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,070
His headshot hit rate is lower than yours.

48
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,940
He's not as accurate as you when he shoots.

49
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,260
I'm actually curious on how he managed to

50
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,890
improve so fast in such a short time.

51
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,650
Even if his assault rifle M16A4's shooting speed

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,590
is faster than your 95 Rifle,

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,200
it's...

54
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,610
I don't think both shots can be aimed at your head so accurately.

55
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,740
Now that we lost, it's useless to say anything.

56
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,150
Stop comforting me.

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,220
Alright.

58
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't think too much after the game.

59
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,720
Let's take a break.

60
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,880
We can go home then.

61
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,860
Being happy

62
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,070
and healthy

63
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,480
are more important than anything else.

64
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:34,960
Yes.

65
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,710
Don't think too much.

66
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,890
Let's eat.

67
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,290
Once we're done,

68
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,180
I'll go to the hospital with you.

69
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,030
I've packed your luggage for you.

70
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,050
Okay.

71
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,070
[Out with a BANG]

72
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,880
[Episode 22]

73
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,960
Ziyi was too strong in the second half yesterday.

74
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,610
He had a gun standoff with Jim at the start of game.

75
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,300
Jim shot his body.

76
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,970
Then, he just took Jim's life with a headshot.

77
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,870
Yes.

78
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,250
It's almost flawless.

79
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,330
During this period of time,

80
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,200
I always blamed you for being too aggressive.

81
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,650
I didn't expect we'll have to rely on your

82
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,510
gun standoffs to get the points back.

83
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,330
Ziyi, here's to you.

84
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,550
I accept

85
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,490
your ability.

86
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,470
Me too.

87
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,290
A toast to you.

88
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,540
Even now,

89
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,580
you are still pretending to be a saint.

90
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,820
Your pride

91
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,080
became worthless

92
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,940
when you agreed to cheat.

93
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,880
You forced me.

94
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,850
No one forced you.

95
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,510
You'd better behave yourself.

96
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,580
Get into the top three of the final,

97
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,140
or defeat SIK Team

98
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,340
and become the best in China.

99
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,320
How?

100
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,860
Do you still want to use the method today?

101
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,720
-I don't want to... - You have no say in this.

102
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,730
The operation will be at 10am the day after tomorrow

103
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,360
and anesthesia will be at 9:30am.

104
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,470
Okay.

105
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,230
You don't worry, my friend.

106
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,300
Have a good rest these days.

107
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,570
As his girlfriend,

108
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,670
keep an eye on him.

109
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,800
No problem.

110
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,240
No need for milk, right?

111
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,400
I don't like milk.

112
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,290
A child should drink milk.

113
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,159
Don't be so rebellious.

114
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,720
Yes.

115
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,740
After drinking the milk,

116
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,540
rest early.

117
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,950
It's only 9pm.

118
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,980
9pm is the golden time for children to sleep.

119
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,750
Stop it, you two.

120
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,500
I'm going for surgery.

121
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,310
Do you have to act like some end-of-life care?

122
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,540
You're not sleeping at night.

123
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,930
Do you want to be on the headlines tomorrow for not waking up on time?

124
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,610
It's only 9pm.

125
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,870
Besides,

126
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,190
even if I only play in the second half,

127
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,600
I definitely can enter the final.

128
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,820
You'd better keep your word.

129
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,810
If you lose,

130
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,060
don't say I know you.

131
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,320
Chu Tian, your sarcasm skills

132
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,500
are perfect.

133
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:34,970
Do you have anything else to say?

134
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,850
If not, I'll hang up.

135
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,419
I just...

136
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,059
I'll visit you after the game.

137
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,169
Okay.

138
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,450
I'll wait for your good news.

139
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,960
The doctor said

140
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,140
you need to rest well before the surgery.

141
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,290
I'll keep your phone for you.

142
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,140
After drinking the milk,

143
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,060
go to bed.

144
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,550
Mr. Li,

145
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,790
I'm Hong Yang.

146
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,200
I have a question to ask you.

147
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,330
Senior Zhou,

148
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,460
I want to ask you something about game designing.

149
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,470
When you are designing FPX's

150
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,160
shooting games,

151
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,360
how big is the design error in the calculation formula

152
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,830
and the bullet trajectory error

153
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,130
in the shooting range?

154
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,760
What will affect it?

155
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,260
I see.

156
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,680
Thank you.

157
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,580
I made something.

158
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,460
-Help me take a look at it. -Look at this first.

159
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,590
What is it?

160
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,690
Look carefully.

161
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,040
These are Xing Ziyi's second half's shooting videos.

162
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,460
We can hear three gunshots here.

163
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,190
But there seems to be only one bullet hole.

164
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,980
No guru player can

165
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,610
shoot all three shots so accurately.

166
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,060
Besides,

167
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,000
his estimated aims are more accurate than before.

168
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,780
He shot four times in advance.

169
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,790
And here.

170
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,950
Most importantly,

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,300
his precise aim is faster

172
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,990
than his rough aim.

173
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,760
I knew it.

174
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,910
Chu Tian would never lose to Xing Ziyi.

175
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,470
So is it what I think it is?

176
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,570
He used a cheating program in the game.

177
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,320
That's right.

178
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,240
I suspect Xing Ziyi used an auto-aiming

179
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,410
cheating program in the game.

180
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,780
Where are you two going in such a rush?

181
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,290
Didn't we agree

182
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,620
to go to the hospital to see Xiao Yichuan?

183
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,300
What are you doing?

184
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,090
Let me tell you.

185
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,420
Hong Yang found ON Team

186
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,230
cheating in the game.

187
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,150
We're going to the organizing committee to report it.

188
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,690
The evidence is here.

189
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,280
Let's go together.

190
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,050
Wait,

191
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,000
what about Xiong Jiujiu?

192
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,790
She's waiting in front of the office.

193
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Team B's progress

194
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,040
is also very intense today.

195
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,470
Since the first half until now,

196
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,380
SIK Team still holds the first place out of the teams.

197
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,260
They are 12 points ahead of the team in second place, Fox Team.

198
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,310
And look at

199
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,270
Xing Ziyi's sniper shots in the second half.

200
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,370
They are mostly shot instantly from a wide angle.

201
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,940
But it wasn't like this in the first half.

202
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:27,730
Also,

203
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,280
look at the last time Xing and Chu Tian shot each other.

204
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,250
Xing's assault rifle M16A4's shooting speed is 13.

205
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,260
Chu Tian's 95 Rifle's shooting speed is 12.

206
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,670
According to their Health Points at that time,

207
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,800
both of them would be eliminated if they

208
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,670
were shot twice at their hands or head.

209
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,260
Although Xing's gun's

210
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,900
shooting speed is faster than Chu Tian's,

211
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,980
it's not hard to see in this video that

212
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,930
Chu Tian clearly locked on

213
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,660
his location quicker.

214
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,660
There's a relatively big error between Xing's rough lock-on

215
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,870
and Chu Tian's precise location.

216
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,810
Even if it's an extreme operation

217
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,530
with instant and precise shooting,

218
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,000
Xing should be the one who shoots the opponent later.

219
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,120
But Chu Tian was eliminated first by two shots in a row.

220
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,320
So,

221
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:05,890
there is only one possibility.

222
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,820
Xing has already aimed at Chu Tian

223
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,410
before finding his location.

224
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,040
There is only one way

225
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,460
to do this.

226
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,030
He used an auto-aiming cheating program.

227
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,680
Xin,

228
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,210
arrange the technical department to remove that

229
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,680
machine and change it during the break.

230
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,580
Okay.

231
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,030
Wang Boyu shot the main player, Zero of the Alive Team.

232
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,540
He increased the score gap between them again.

233
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,940
SIK Team's points gained in the first half got them the first place.

234
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,310
-I think none of the teams can catch up to them. -Xin,

235
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,210
arrange the technical team to wait at the scene.

236
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,530
Okay.

237
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,380
Lei,

238
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,120
bring the game POV videos of all

239
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,180
four players of the ON Team

240
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,780
and their voice recordings to us for investigation.

241
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,060
We care greatly about

242
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,000
what you've reported.

243
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,150
The organizing committee will investigate this matter seriously

244
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,360
and give you a fair answer

245
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,740
as soon as possible.

246
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,180
Thank you.

247
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,400
Thank you.

248
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,160
Thank you, hero.

249
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,790
I just want to

250
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,690
give all the teams

251
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,660
a fair match.

252
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,730
Besides,

253
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,230
Chu Tian's individual ability is really

254
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,490
much better than Xing Ziyi's.

255
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,960
His ability shouldn't be buried

256
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,420
because of ON Team's cheating behaviors.

257
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,930
This is not my own business nor

258
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,610
JR Team's business.

259
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,990
This is

260
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,730
an insult to the entire E-sports industry.

261
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,350
The fairness of competitive sports

262
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,840
cannot be broken.

263
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,450
The little kid is finally

264
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,660
a grown-up now.

265
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,830
He's not only like a grown-up,

266
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,120
but also like a captain.

267
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
If Chuan were here…

268
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,540
There's no “if”.

269
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,740
He will come back.

270
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,140
Yes, he will.

271
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,550
He will come back.

272
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,590
But don't tell him

273
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,500
about this when we go to the hospital.

274
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,560
Let him prepare for the surgery.

275
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,890
Hello, this is Xiong Jiujiu.

276
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,180
Hello.

277
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,220
I'm the HR of NESG.

278
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,210
I contacted you last time.

279
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,350
Is it convenient for you to attend

280
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,620
the interview on the 25th of this month?

281
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,790
The interview notice has been sent to your email.

282
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,680
If you've made up your mind, please reply to it promptly.

283
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,080
I've thought about it.

284
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,310
Now...

285
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,840
I still don't plan to change my job.

286
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,970
Thank you so much

287
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,370
for your recognition.

288
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,140
It's fine.

289
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,430
Okay.

290
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:24,860
Bye.

291
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,380
Thank you.

292
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,990
Why are you looking at me?

293
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,380
Let's go.

294
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,860
Aren't we going to the hospital?

295
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,530
NESG is asking you to join them?

296
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,430
Yes.

297
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,000
But I've clearly rejected it.

298
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,130
I

299
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,230
want to compete with you

300
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,400
and be the manager of the Star Team next year.

301
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,250
Mr. Dong.

302
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,000
Do you realize that

303
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,230
I'm still very valuable in the market?

304
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:58,900
Let’s go.

305
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,490
Chuan.

306
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,930
We're here to see you.

307
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,720
You're finally here.

308
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,030
I'm bored to death.

309
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,620
Chuan.

310
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,630
I brought you your favorite fruit.

311
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,670
Drink it.

312
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,980
Why is it milk again?

313
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,090
She bought it.

314
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,720
Chu Tian said the doctor told you to drink more milk.

315
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,620
So I bought it.

316
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,150
You don't like milk?

317
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,820
Give it to me.

318
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,540
I love it.

319
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,730
I love milk.

320
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,060
That's good.

321
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,690
Give me your phone.

322
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,810
SIK Team is in the top during the first half.

323
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,070
Even Mars Team is behind them.

324
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,980
The gap is huge.

325
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,730
Don't worry.

326
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,210
Mars Team is like a sly fox.

327
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,849
As long as they can make it through,

328
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,349
they often hide their abilities

329
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,500
during the elimination game.

330
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,619
Why are there always teams who like to fake their abilities.

331
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,750
Can't they show their real abilities

332
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,950
and focus on the game?

333
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,130
What's wrong with Hong Yang?

334
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,690
He was too excited and passionate

335
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,370
while watching SIK Team's game this morning.

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,520
Yes.

337
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,230
Captain Wang's elimination game

338
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,070
was so cool.

339
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,360
So

340
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,050
you just need to prepare for the surgery

341
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,430
and focus on rehabilitation.

342
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,360
Or else

343
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,480
Wang Boyu will go crazy then.

344
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,220
I'll wash the fruit for you.

345
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,510
I'll bring it to you later.

346
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,010
Let me help you.

347
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,490
Let's go.

348
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,750
Who wants to give me their phone?

349
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,910
Let me see how good

350
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,000
Wang Boyu is.

351
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,750
Chu Tian, give me yours.

352
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,840
Out of battery.

353
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,260
Hong Yang.

354
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:10,820
I haven't paid my bills.

355
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,420
Dong Shi.

356
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,750
I don't have a phone.

357
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,100
Even blind people

358
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,430
can see through your acting.

359
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,520
SIK Team's street battle today

360
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,460
was very memorable.

361
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,400
Wang Boyu's view was limited in this position,

362
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,750
but he immediately adjusted

363
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,510
his teammates' coordination locations

364
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,340
and ambushed two players of the Fox Team.

365
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,990
When you meet a strong team in the street battle,

366
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,390
don't rush to attack.

367
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,980
We must strengthen our sense of ambush and counter ambush.

368
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,470
The view here is not good.

369
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,420
But as long as Ziyi maintains yesterday's level,

370
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,680
even if he meets Wang Boyu, he can still win.

371
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,800
There is still a difference

372
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,810
between Xing's shooting skills and Wang Boyu's.

373
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,170
Yu Dan, open the door.

374
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,520
Hello.

375
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,060
We're the organizing committee's competition supervisor.

376
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,250
The manager, coach, and all members

377
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,140
of the ON Team, please head to the office.

378
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,170
We need to ask about something.

379
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,430
Why?

380
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,180
What do you need to ask?

381
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,110
Why do you have to ask us in the middle of the night?

382
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,870
Can't you see we have something going on?

383
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,190
Coach.

384
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,330
The manager is not here.

385
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,530
All of us need to go?

386
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,460
Yes.

387
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,780
Also, please bring along all additional

388
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,690
hardware for the game.

389
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,830
They will be temporarily confiscated and investigated.

390
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,520
It has nothing to do with them.

391
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,150
Who is it?

392
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,720
Coach.

393
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,400
The organizing committee took everyone away.

394
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,450
Call Manager Fang now.

395
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,220
Okay, I got it!

396
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,690
Wen.

397
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,400
Something happened, Wen.

398
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,060
Wen.

399
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,700
How many times have I told you?

400
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,700
Don't call me after nine.

401
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,920
You're disturbing my beauty sleep.

402
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,700
Why can't you solve it yourself?

403
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,900
The organizing committee

404
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,740
took everyone away.

405
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,520
What should we do?

406
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,340
I don't know what to do.

407
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,160
Come quickly.

408
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,790
What?

409
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:53,570
Wen.

410
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,060
Wen, you're finally here.

411
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,400
What happened?

412
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,410
If you need to investigate Xing Ziyi, then investigate him.

413
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,830
Why do you suspect us too?

414
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,820
He said

415
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,430
it has nothing to do with us.

416
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:02,930
Exactly!

417
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,560
We were playing fair and square.

418
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,730
How could you

419
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,960
blame it on us?

420
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,950
Wen.

421
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,980
Why did you bring my team here?

422
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,170
Where is your supervisor?

423
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,820
Manager Fang.

424
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,610
Your team's player, Xing

425
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,280
used a cheating program in the elimination game yesterday.

426
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,780
This is the detailed investigation.

427
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,810
What cheating program?

428
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,600
I warn you not to talk nonsense here.

429
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
We don't admit it.

430
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,850
You can file a complaint.

431
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,190
But ON Team as a suspected team

432
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,980
will be disqualified from the competition.

433
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,010
Besides,

434
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,180
we have enough evidence.

435
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,450
When Xing Ziyi comes back,

436
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,260
ask him yourself.

437
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,880
Do you think we're easy to bully because we're a new team?

438
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,010
Do you think you can just cancel

439
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,280
a team under ON?

440
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,260
Just you wait.

441
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,280
I did it.

442
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,880
Xing has admitted the whole process of cheating.

443
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,900
Tomorrow, the organizing committee will officially issue a notice

444
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,970
on the disqualification of ON Team

445
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,600
and the cancellation of their results.

446
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,920
ON Team

447
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,260
and Xing Ziyi would be banned from

448
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,330
competitions for three years.

449
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,930
I'm sorry.

450
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,200
Thanks.

451
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,650
Don't eat greasy food before the surgery.

452
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,300
Didn't the nurse tell you?

453
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,500
Have some soup.

454
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,720
See what you have

455
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,170
and what I have.

456
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,260
Do you have any conscience?

457
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,270
Yours is great.

458
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,390
Three dishes and one soup.

459
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,680
Right, Tian?

460
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,100
For junk food like fried chicken,

461
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,510
eat less even without surgery.

462
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,740
Chuan,

463
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:27,830
as the saying goes,

464
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,440
three dishes and one soup,

465
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,720
you can get rich and live a happy life.

466
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,190
Then you can go live a happy life.

467
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:39,570
What?

468
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,110
So you closed my eyes for a while to

469
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,450
let my expectations float in the dark.

470
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,150
Is there any normal person in your team?

471
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,950
I am.

472
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,270
I just wanted to hug you.

473
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,250
I'm afraid you'll be scared of your surgery tomorrow.

474
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,170
It smells like fried chicken.

475
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,080
I need to wash my face.

476
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,080
Actually, I'm a little scared.

477
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,910
Why?

478
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,580
Alone...

479
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,860
Alone in the hospital.

480
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,620
It's scary.

481
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,670
Then go to bed.

482
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,160
You won't be afraid if you fall asleep.

483
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,540
I need a hug

484
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,540
to calm my nerves.

485
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Here, a hug.

486
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,540
I also need a kiss

487
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,730
to relieve the pressure of my surgery.

488
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,930
I also need a...

489
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,670
Lift up?

490
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,540
Sure.

491
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,020
You can choose to sleep or not to sleep.

492
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,030
Why are we here?

493
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,110
The organizing committee said

494
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,240
ON Team has been disqualified from the competition.

495
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,830
According to the advancing rule based on rankings,

496
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,210
we can enter the final.

497
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,280
There are only three of us now.

498
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:06,910
This means

499
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,290
even if we advance to the next level,

500
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,440
we can't compete normally.

501
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,610
So...

502
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,800
So we should quit the competition.

503
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,850
When Chuan recovers,

504
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,010
we can compete again next year.

505
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,980
I'll talk to the company.

506
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,110
Besides,

507
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,850
I have stayed up late to make the next game season plan.

508
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,560
I can't waste it.

509
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,100
Xiong Jiujiu will submit the withdrawal application tomorrow.

510
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,830
Cheer up.

511
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,690
Don't be too sad.

512
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,450
Hong Yang.

513
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,150
Let's go for a walk.

514
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,670
Every time I tell others this joke,

515
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,470
they would laugh.

516
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,180
Why won't you laugh?

517
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,980
Isn't it funny?

518
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,580
You must be tired.

519
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,970
Don't force a smile in front of me.

520
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,010
Tell me if you're sad.

521
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,460
These days,

522
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,430
I feel like I'm riding a roller coaster.

523
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,050
I guess we are the first one in history

524
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,670
who advanced to the next level and decided to withdraw from it.

525
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,160
I don't know what E-sports

526
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,110
mean to you.

527
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,100
But as long as you are together,

528
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,420
you can come back anytime.

529
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,320
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

530
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,150
Actually, I don't care whether I can be

531
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,180
the boss of a champion team.

532
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,850
My online store happens to need a boss.

533
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Are you interested?

534
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,170
Are you...

535
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:00,670
No.

536
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,490
I'm not done yet.

537
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,040
I didn't promise you because I pity you.

538
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,280
I...

539
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,850
I'm confessing my love.

540
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,870
I promise you.

541
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:53,480
[E-sports Canteen]

542
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,210
The cheating incident of ON Team

543
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,680
is the biggest scandal in this championship.

544
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,460
Up to now, the club owner, Huo Ran still

545
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,790
hasn't shown up to cooperate with the organizing committee's investigation.

546
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:58,810
This morning,

547
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,180
the team manager, Fang Wenwen brought a group of reporters

548
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,260
and found his apartment.

549
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,220
Let's see.

550
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,130
Are you a man?

551
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,420
You only know how to hide when something happens.

552
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,910
What's going on with the cheating program?

553
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,350
I can't answer these questions today.

554
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,840
I'll answer them one by one later.

555
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,370
Thank you.

556
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,430
The organizing committee has canceled

557
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,140
all of ON Team's competition results from this year.

558
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,540
They also made a decision to ban

559
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,030
ON Team and its team leader, Xing Ziyi

560
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,280
from competitions for three years.

561
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,890
The cheating incident of ON Team

562
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,720
has actually impacted the China's E-sports Teams

563
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,040
negatively across the globe.

564
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,290
After that,

565
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,600
the organizing committee also confirmed that their results

566
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,290
have no problems.

567
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,530
But many teams from other countries

568
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,700
don't want to compete

569
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,930
with Chinese teams

570
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,630
Looks like Chinese teams play

571
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,350
shady overall this game, guys.

572
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,320
Even if they cheat, they can't win.

573
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,510
Because the opponent is me.

574
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,550
The organizing committee should investigate the results of SIK Team too.

575
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,700
Maybe there will be no Chinese team

576
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,020
in the final.

577
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,480
Sick, man. It's true. Yeah.

578
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,740
Fighting during the game.

579
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,700
Do you want to be blacklisted?

580
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,130
You want to be banned from competitions too?

581
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,830
I can't stand it, captain.

582
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,620
Did you hear what they said?

583
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,740
Why should all Chinese teams

584
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,760
bare the responsibility of

585
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,670
the cheating behaviors of ON Team.

586
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,180
They even doubt the results of our SIK Team.

587
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,450
They can say whatever they want.

588
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,790
We just need to beat them

589
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,460
in the final.

590
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:25,900
We're done.

591
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,530
Go back if we're done.

592
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,080
Go back.

593
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,060
Go back first.

594
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:28,870
Go back.

595
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,510
Let's go.

596
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,000
I wish I didn't pass my English in primary school.

597
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,320
We're just listening to these bad words.

598
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
What about JR Team?

599
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,860
Qin Zheng quit E-sports.

600
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,090
Xiao Yichuan has an operation today.

601
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,950
No matter how fast he recovers, he won't make it to the final.

602
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,660
I'll seek justice for JR Team.

603
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,290
Seek justice for them?

604
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,830
Then let's fight hard.

605
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,770
Now, we are the only

606
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,240
Chinese team in the final.

607
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,690
We represent

608
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,240
the spirit of all E-sports teams in China.

609
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,090
We'll bring honor.

610
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,820
Xiao Yichuan, right?

611
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:17,540
Yes.

612
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,889
We're going to anesthetize you soon.

613
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,469
Did you eat or drink water?

614
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,260
No.

615
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,270
Okay, wait a minute.

616
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,100
Nurse,

617
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,900
is my girlfriend here?

618
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,460
Why? Are you nervous?

619
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,719
No.

620
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,020
I...

621
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,420
I'm just...

622
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,830
I'm just a little clingy.

623
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,630
ON Team has been disqualified from the competition.

624
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,660
The eliminated JR Team

625
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,480
will be fourth in Team A.

626
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,600
But during the elimination game,

627
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,350
Qin Zheng announced to quit the E-sports industry.

628
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,990
Until now, there's no explanation on why Xiao Yichuan is not participating.

629
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,660
I wonder if JR Team

630
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,480
will continue this competition.

631
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,390
Are you really quitting?

632
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,040
Have you made up your mind?

633
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,090
Yes.

634
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,290
We've decided.

635
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,470
Sign it then.

636
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,260
We are not quitting.
