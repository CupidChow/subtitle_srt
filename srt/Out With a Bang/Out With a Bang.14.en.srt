2
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,610
Why are you still up so late?

3
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,460
What are you doing?

4
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,690
It's I who should ask you this.

5
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,740
Why are you still up so late?

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:43,990
Here.

7
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,890
Are you feeling better?

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,450
Is it this?

9
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,100
It's fine.

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,060
Don't worry.

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,830
I'm watching Chu Tian's video.

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,950
If he knows that you are so dedicated,

13
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,300
he must be touched.

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,410
Do you think

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,380
he's qualified for the commander?

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,620
Captain Qin and I will train him specifically.

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,110
As long as he is ready to suffer,

18
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,490
he can do it.

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,210
Well,

20
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,220
then what should I do?

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,980
For example, prepare healthy diets

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,730
or what else to pay attention in our daily life.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,280
Tell me

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:26,940
and I will bear it in mind.

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,860
I am a commander, too.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,140
Why don't I get this special treatment？

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,020
Adult as you are，

28
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,220
why do you still strive for favor?

29
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,450
Age doesn't matter.

30
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,130
OK.

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,729
You've been working hard, Commander.

32
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,979
I'll fetch some fruit for you.

33
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,140
Captain Qin.

34
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,940
Captain Qin.

35
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,110
I'll go cut some fruit.

36
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,550
Okay.

37
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,900
Captain Qin,

38
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,990
Today I watched some videos of Chu Tian.

39
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,700
He played in a duo with Hong Yang.

40
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,180
But he performed much better solo

41
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,910
than in a duo.

42
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,630
It's mainly because

43
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,660
that he is now unaware of his role as a commander.

44
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:09,759
Yes.

45
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,880
I've been observing him for days.

46
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,980
He somehow lacks organizational ability.

47
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,380
Maybe he thinks

48
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,440
there has been a commander.

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,720
Besides,

50
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,200
people always pay more attention

51
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,020
to the foursome in international competitions.

52
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,250
So he doesn't care too much about it.

53
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,860
So,

54
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,970
we should make him aware of it.

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,960
Maybe he will understand it

56
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,820
when he realizes his shortcomings.

57
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:35,630
Go on.

58
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,700
Look.

59
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,880
This is his habit.

60

[Out with a BANG]

61
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,970
[Episode 14]

62
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,360
Neither of you

63
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,560
cooperated with each other.

64
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,670
You're so indifferent to the result.

65
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,680
Chu Tian has slipped back.

66
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,820
Captain Qin.

67
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,390
Am I that bad?

68
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,200
You entered the circle first.

69
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,550
After the investigation,

70
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,930
why didn't you talk to Hong Yang

71
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,480
before you took action?

72
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,420
I...

73
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,410
When you were stuck on the narrow side,

74
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,080
have you thought of Hong Yang's situation？

75
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,330
What you only thought about was shooting.

76
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,480
You were late to cover your teammate.

77
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,560
Haven't you thought of that?

78
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,670
As you played in a duo

79
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,200
and Hong Yang has already told you

80
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,270
there came another team,

81
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,940
why didn't you delay

82
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,740
their trip

83
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,860
and cooperate with Hong Yang

84
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,140
instead of rushing forward with residual blood?

85
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,580
Hong Yang,

86
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,100
train with Dong Shi.

87
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,020
You now begin to play in foursomes.

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,440
Randomly match a team online

89
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,220
and train your command ability.

90
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,300
Command ability?

91
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,780
What’s wrong?

92
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,100
Is there any problem?

93
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,130
We have a commander, don't we?

94
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,750
Is it against your training?

95
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,940
-No. -Are you discontented with the arrangement?

96
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,550
No.

97
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,200
I asked you to train your command ability.

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,560
Why didn't you say anything?

99
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,900
I...

100
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm a sniper.

101
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,310
So will you be a sniper forever?

102
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,670
Don't you need to learn something new?

103
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,750
Do you think you're good enough?

104
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,230
What happened?

105
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,490
Captain Qin asked Chu Tian to train his command ability

106
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,590
and Chu Tian got a scolding.

107
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,100
How about

108
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,840
taking a break?

109
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,710
Start a new game.

110
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,410
Say something in this round.

111
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:00,940
Jump.

112
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,950
What about our entering this building?

113
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,030
Let's split up.

114
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:06,920
I'll go to the next building.

115
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,870
What about me?

116
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,330
What should I do?

117
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,200
Open mic.

118
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,050
Say something.

119
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,740
Hello?

120
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,250
Well,

121
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,730
we still need

122
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,310
to cross four lines of defense

123
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,260
to reach the safe zone.

124
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,030
Number one,

125
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,059
go find a vehicle.

126
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,880
Number two,

127
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,820
go investigate.

128
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,210
I'll set my rifle in a high point to kill our opponents.

129
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,620
The last one...

130
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,790
should pay attention to the defense

131
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,260
against the opponents outside.

132
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,340
I'm lit.

133
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,660
Where's the medical kit?

134
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,490
I need some supplies.

135
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,850
We don't have medicine.

136
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,740
I'm investigating.

137
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,420
Me neither.

138
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,480
No one is searching for supplies.

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,040
The commander didn't arrange that.

140
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,480

141
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:16,780
Well.

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm dead.

143
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,970
The circle is shrinking.

144
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,780
Commander, shall we go?

145
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,540
Yes.

146
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,540
Come on.

147
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,500
Share the supplies.

148
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,660
They're too few to be split.

are you crazy?

163
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,670
Watch your mouth.

164
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,060
As Tian and I are so familiar with each other，

165
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,520
why couldn't I greet with him？

166
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,100
Who will greet with a fire stick?

167
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,790
It's fine if you really use it

168
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,420
as a fire stick.

169
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,550
Why did you shoot?

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,380
Were you showing off your gun?

171

Let me talk to Tian.

172
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,570
Or you go tell him this.

178
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,510
Here.

179
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,780
Try this.

180
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,240
I bought this after work.

181
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,470
It's said that it's delicious to be steamed,

182
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,340
so I had a try.

183
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,810
Try it.

184
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,400
From tomorrow onwards,

185
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,940
you'll train your command ability

186
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,830
for extra two hours in foursomes every day.

187
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,790
-Why? -No why.

188
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,780
You had realized that you jumped

189
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,880
in a wrong position,

190
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,500
but why didn't you tell your teammates?

191
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,450
When you divided the work,

192
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,050
didn't you notice that

193
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,990
there was an omissive mission?

194
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,370
Why didn’t you

195
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,060
specify the allocation of supplies?

196
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,690
About who would be given priority

197
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,580
when splitting supplies

198
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,660
or medicine

199
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,740
and how

200
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,700
and when to transfer,

201
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,620
have you

202
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,620
thought about these

203
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,300
for your teammates?

204
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,730
I...

205
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,880
I didn't think that much.

206
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,010
I asked you to play in foursomes with netizens

207
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,020
in order that you could learn

208
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,140
how to have them cooperate with you

209
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,120
instead of your cooperating with them.

210
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,900
You should have full court vision.

211
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,230
But Xiao Yichuan

212
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,850
is our commander, isn't he?

213
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,180
Everyone

214
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,520
should be qualified for any position.

215
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Do you think you are

216
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,940
a perfect sniper

217
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,970
and don't need to make progress?

218
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,140
No.

219
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,870
Are you skilled enough

220
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,530
in dynamic visual acuity,

221
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,120
sound sensitivity

222
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,970
and rapid calculation？

223
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,770
No.

224
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,120
I...

225
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,030
I think Chu Tian

226
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,370
performed well.

227
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,380
You are too strict.

228
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,920
How about this?

229
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,610
Let's eat.

230
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,640
Come on.

231
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,580
Have some fish.

232
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,440
Just take it as Wang Boyu.

233
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,440
After the meal,

234
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,030
start a game again.

235
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:24,980
Come in.

236
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,310
Captain Qin.

237
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,940
What's wrong?

238
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm engaged for tomorrow.

239
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,800
Can I practice for extra four hours

240
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,350
the day after tomorrow?

241
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,740
How about this?

242
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,700
I'll tell everyone to take a day off tomorrow.

243
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,180
And you go to the training area

244
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,170
to play another game

245
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,810
with Chuan beside you.

246
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,140
Okay.

247
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,470
Tian.

248
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,580
Scram.

249
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,910
Why did you take his phone again?

250
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,350
Chu Tian actually allowed you to use his phone?

251
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,200
Why did he play in foursomes on the self-support server?

252
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,290
Don't you need training?

253
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,430
Say something.

254
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,060
Take a guess.

255
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:14,770
Come on.

256
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,330
Come on.

257
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,540
Hello.

258
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,120
I'll be the commander.

259
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,210
Jump to a highland.

260
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,480
Number one,

261
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,620
float in the air for a while longer

262
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,120
and keep observing the team.

263
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,750
Number two,

264
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,070
go investigate with me.

265
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,590
Number three should search the buildings

266
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,200
to get supplies.

267
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,700
Oh.

268
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,970
Don't forget the vehicle.

269
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,440
Directly give them to Number two if you find

270
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,700
rapid expansion of the magazine and level three backpack.

271
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,300
No, no, no.

272
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,550
I need level three backpack too.

273
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,840
It shrunk.

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,450
Number two

275
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,030
should go straight to the safety zone.

276
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,450
Number one and three should...

277
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,100
At the beginning,

278
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,090
you told me positions of other teams

279
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,860
and where were they?

280
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,250
The south.

281
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,200
In the south is...

282
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:27,860
the valley.

283
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,620
If you want to leave for the city proper,

284
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,610
you have to

285
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,620
go through the wasteland or the airport.

286
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,150
Then you go to the airport.

287
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:35,980
I'll follow in the rear.

288
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,550
You didn't remember

289
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,250
the exact reduction along the air line, did you?

290
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,130
The route is almost vertical from north to south.

291
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,060
Almost 30 have jumped off

292
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,490
when you were over the sea.

293
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,620
At least eight teams

294
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,370
would land on the farm,

295
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:03,900
the ruins,

296
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,800
the city proper and the airport.

297
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,900
More than ten teams jumped with you.

298
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:07,950
On a conservative estimate,

299
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,120
four teams

300
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,600
would probably choose the wasteland and the airport.

301
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,650
You couldn't see the rest players.

302
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,100
But according to the route,

303
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,500
the city proper, the airport

304
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,660
and the jungle in the west

305
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,990
would be places where people flocked together.

306
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,110
You didn't estimate

307
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,090
the general distribution of all teams

308
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,840
at the beginning.

309
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,700
You only focused on teams around you.

310
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,630
Though you have communicated with your teammates,

311
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,040
as more and more

312
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,510
information was conveyed to you,

313
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,590
you would get confused.

314
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,750
A commander can't focus on himself only.

315
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,380
You should pay attention to all the teams

316
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,370
and have a clear idea at any time.

317
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:00,930
Kid,

318
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,369
you should always be humble.

319
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,750
Come on.

320
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's review and sum up.

321
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,190
Look.

322
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,220
You went to the airport

323
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,319
and wanted to make the reverse slope a cover.

324
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,579
But you have

325
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,290
mistaken the other party's route

326
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,470
and didn't bring your teammates'

327
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,630
superiority into full play.

328
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,069
As the shock worker threw over a grenade

329
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,859
and the sniper set the shooting route,

330
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,270
all of you were killed.

331
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,350
Did you train like this before?

332
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,580
You trained yourself to be powerful

333
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,100
in every position.

334
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,210
When I first joined the team,

335
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,780
I was a sniper

336
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,020
like you.

337
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,590
I firstly got the chance to take part in the competition

338
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,930
with our team when the shock worker was injured

339
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,680
and couldn't bear it.

340
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,600
I took his place.

341
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,850
You should know

342
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,040
my performance in that game.

343
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,510
Do you find it

344
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,540
more and more difficult?

345
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,330
Not only that,

346
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,420
but I also feel

347
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,850
there's still a long way to go.

348
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,430
That doesn't matter.

349
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,900
You can run over if it's too late to walk there.

350
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,020
Just go ahead.

351
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,070
I'll always be with you.

352
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,270
Let's go.

353
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,190
Go upstairs and sleep.

354
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,940
If you are too tired to walk,

355
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,250
I'll push you like this,

356
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,300
pull you,

357
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,280
or just carry you.

358
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,820
-Childish. -Which one do you like?

359
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,030
None.

360
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,310
Let's continue tomorrow.

361
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,620
Tomorrow?

362
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,100
We're off tomorrow.

363
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,630
Who said that?

364
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,490
I did.

365
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,270
What important things are you going to do？

366
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,260
Nothing.

367
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,600
What are you two doing?

368
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,160
-Nothing special.

369
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,170
By the way,

370
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,590
are you free tomorrow?

371
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,790
What's wrong?

372
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,580
Nothing.

373
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,080
Just an idle question.

374
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,690
Okay.

375
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,140
Take an early rest.

376
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,750
Okay.

377
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,510
I have something to talk to him.

378
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,350
What is it?

379
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,490
Go in.

380
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,580
You...

381
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,710
What are you going to do

382
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
in the room alone with me

383
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,650
as everyone is sleeping  at deep night?

384
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:54,780
All right.

385
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,610
Stop it.

386
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,220
Come here.

387
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,360
I won't delay your sleep.

388
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,380
I searched online a few days ago

389
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,880
for how to alleviate muscle pain.

390
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,680
But I don't know if they work.

391
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,430
Are you feeling better about your hand？

392
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,070
Don't worry.

393
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,080
I am just somehow inflamed.

394
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,520
Anti-inflammatory drug can cure it.

395
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,090
Don't worry about me.

396
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,690
I'm not disabled.

397
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,350
What are you talking about?

398
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,970
I am still expecting you to lead the team

399
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,360
and win the bonus for me.

400
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,110
So I am your money-making machine.

401
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,180
Well,

402
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,460
give the machine a massage.

403
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,800
Okay.

404
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,460
Well.

405
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,880
By the way,

406
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,590
you asked me

407
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,830
if I would be free at tomorrow night,

408
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,830
-are you...? -No.

409
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,960
Then I might have to

410
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,860
work late tomorrow.

411
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,970
Well，

412
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,480
fine.

413
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,500
I'm tired.

414
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,890
I'll go to sleep.

415
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,740
Is it interesting to lie to yourself?

416
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,920
When will you face the reality?

417
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,390
[Chu Tian]

418
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,530
Hello?

419
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,060
Do me a favor.

420
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,090
Slow down.

421
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,060
Are you an Upper Cave Man？

422
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,740
Can't you order takeout with your phone?

423
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,540
Why did you come all the way here in person?

424
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,970
It's Xiong Jiujiu's birthday today.

425
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,380
I want to pick up a memorable cake

426
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,190
for her.

427
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,390
-Never come back until there is a dead end. -Hello.

428
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,580
I want to order the same cake

429
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,860
on the picture.

430
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,170
Can you make it today?

431
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,790
Yes.

432
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:52,930
Okay.

433
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,630
The cake

434
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,730
and the gift.

435
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,670
What else do I need to prepare?

436
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,540
Are you going to...

437
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,780
I'm going to confess my love.

438
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,300
Fine.

439
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,790
You need to draw to a close.

440
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,660
Make the cake this way.

441
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,200
Thank you.

442
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,260
No problem.

443
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,570
Chu Tian,

444
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,240
I have something important to tell you.

445
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,020
Chu Tian,

446
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,670
can you be my girlfriend?

447
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,780
Hello.

448
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,990
A gentleman ordered the coffee for you.

449
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,150
Please wait a moment.

450
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,410
Okay.

451
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,380
Thank you.

452
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,950
You're welcome.

453
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,540
Where are you?

454
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,520
You asked me here,

455
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,570
but where are you?

456
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Listen.

457
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,400
I'll leave if you don't show up

458
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,200
until I drink up the coffee.

459
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,050
Miss Chu Tian.

460
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,980
Why is it dirty?

461
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,670
You are here.

462
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,090
Why are you standing there? Take a seat.

463
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,030
Why did you ask me to hurry over？

464
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,900
I want to treat you to coffee.

465
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,590
Good.

466
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,420
Then I bought you a cake.

467
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,160
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

468
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,760
Do we really need that

469
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,760
as we are so familiar？

470
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,620
Oh, right.

471
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,420
We do need that.

472
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,140
But Chu Tian, I like you.

473
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,940
As courtesy demands reciprocity,

474
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,560
you should like me too, right?

475
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,700
I don't think

476
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,580
you have anything important to say.

477
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,370
I'm leaving.

478
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,030
Chinese Almanac says today is a good time to confess.

479
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,170
It seems that we can't believe in Chinese Almanac.

480
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,530
A good time

481
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,330
means

482
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,210
the time when we would get the best result.

483
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,290
It's good for both of us.

484
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,470
What on earth

485
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,980
do you want?

486
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,270
Chu Tian, I like you.

487
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,640
As courtesy demands reciprocity,

488
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,730
you should like me, shouldn't you?

489
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,110
Stop grinning cheekily.

490
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,250
I just want to bring you

491
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,540
happiness.

492
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,490
It's a pity that I don't know those cheesy lines

493
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,100
and can't cheer you up.

494
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,600
I'm engaged and I'm leaving.

495
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,020
You don't need to bring me happiness.

496
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,260
You are my happiness.

497
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,620
Chu Tian,

498
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,840
I’ve kept these words for a long while.

499
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,080
I must speak them out today.

500
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,800
I want everyone to hear that

501
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,890
I like you.

502
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,060
I can't control

503
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,280
or hide my feelings.

504
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,130
Give me a chance.

505
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,470
The goal of ON team

506
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,500
is always the champion of the tournament.

507
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,020
We don't lack any

508
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,220
confidence or strength.

509
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,520
Of course SIK

510
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,750
is a worthy opponent.

511
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,240
As for those

512
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,210
that

513
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,480
are barely qualified for the final,

514
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,590
we don’t know much about their strength,

515
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,940
but we hope

516
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,670
-they won't bring shame on our Chinese teams. -Don't they know

517
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,850
what humble means?

518
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,130
ON Team

519
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,540
will do our best.

520
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,020
We'll do our best too.

521
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:08,780
Bye.

522
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,590
I'm back.

523
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,730
You know what?

524
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,330
I really...

525
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,570
Happy birthday.

526
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,460
You scared me.

527
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,690
Did you arrange all these?

528
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,110
Yes.

529
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,750
You're no wonder Tian.

530
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,950
Let's eat first.

531
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:01,890
Here.

532
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,260
Happy birthday.

533
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,200
Happy birthday to me.

534
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,590
On your birthday,

535
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,630
I'll call everyone here.

536
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,800
Then you won't have to

537
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,910
celebrate it lonely.

538
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,580
When I was young,

539
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,510
I did have few friends.

540
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,130
I remember once on Chu Tian's birthday,

541
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,110
a group of kids came to our home.

542
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,510
And I envied her so much,

543
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,580
because I didn't have many friends.

544
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,820
I had been depressed for a whole night.

545
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,470
And only you found that.

546
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,750
Later,

547
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,090
the next day, you bought me a cake

548
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,660
and wanted to celebrate my birthday again.

549
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,390
In the end,

550
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,500
you took me to watch fireworks.

551
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,300
You said

552
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,400
you hoped I could have

553
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,680
a lively birthday too.

554
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,420
I remember that.

555
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,140
I remember every birthday

556
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,060
that you celebrated for me.

557
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,780
This cake looks familiar.

558
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,160
This is exactly the same

559
00:30:59,180 --> 00:30:59,940
as the one you made for me.

560
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,590
No wonder it's so retro.

561
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,260
Xiong Jiujiu,

562
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,540
will you remember

563
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,070
every birthday that I spent with you?

564
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:17,760
Of course.

565
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,720
I remember everything.

566
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,100
Xiong Jiujiu.

567
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,300
Yes.

568
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,630
I...

569
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,690
Wow.

570
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,290
Wish you prosperity.

571
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,300
Who bought this?

572
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,600
It's quite festive.

573
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,580
Xiao Yichuan.

574
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,230
Did I...

575
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,700
come back too early?

576
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,410
No.

577
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,950
If not,

578
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,500
I won't stand on ceremony anymore.

579
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
I haven't eaten yet.

580
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,560
Don't you feel guilty

581
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,480
as you two are eating delicious food here?

582
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,830
Think about it with your conscience.

583
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,450
Do you really have a clear conscience?

584
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,200
I...

585
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,400
do have a clear conscience.

586
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,390
Let me see yours.

587
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,440
Your heart is beating fast.

588
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,810
What's wrong?

589
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,710
If you're in a bad mood,

590
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,540
you need to vent your feelings.

591
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,040
Or it's bad for your health.

592
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,700
Come on.

593
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,430
Tell me

594
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,390
why are you upset.

595
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,220
I'm not.

596
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,620
It's good to know how to control your emotion.

597
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,140
But you are really bad at that.

598
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
Do you think we can't see it through?

599
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,080
I thought

600
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,490
I had hidden it well.

601
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,540
Look.

602
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,170
Especially those who have lagged behind.

603
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,340
Stop trying to do those beyond your ability.

604
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,890
I will help you

605
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,080
get real in the competition.

606
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,360
Why don't we

607
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,690
livestream？

608
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,540
The netizens have been

609
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,260
expecting Tianyi Brothers to show up together.

610
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,170
Besides,

611
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,030
we can meanwhile complete

612
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,050
the mission of live stream.

613
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,280
Yes.

614
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,360
Then...

615
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,679
do it together.

616
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,850
To celebrate your birthday.

617
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:21,489
Okay.

618
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,580
Hello, everyone.

619
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,980
Welcome to my live room.

620
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:26,500
Look.

621
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,010
There are balloons and a cake behind me.

622
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,610
Are they beautiful?

623
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,560
Chu Tian prepared these.

624
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,780
Here, Chu Tian and Xiao Yichuan.

625
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,929
Say hello to everyone.

626
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:35,810
Why does Chu Tian

627
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,600
look unhappy?

628
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,820
Chu Tian, does Xiao Yichuan

629
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,090
kidnap you？

630
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,020
If so, blink at us.

631
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,800
Why don’t you have a drink with us?

632
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,200
The team members

633
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,830
are expecting you to issue bonuses.

634
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,780
Xiao Yichuan

635
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,210
can easily become a hot topic

636
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,130
with a birthday live stream.

637
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,010
Do they still have the nerve to ask for a bonus?

638
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,210
They only knows fauxmance.

639
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,920
I'll now make a hot topic.

640
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,680
Could it be that you feel depressed

641
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,230
because Xiao Yichuan is celebrating Xiong Jiujiu's birthday?

642
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:24,660
Again?

643
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,160
Mr. Huo,

644
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,110
I have something to show you.

645
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,090
I spent some money

646
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,250
and this is just a part of their plan.

647
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,530
Mr. Huo,

648
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,560
see if it helps.

649
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,100
I can find a way to get the whole plan.

650
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,740
Go.

651
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,330
Yes.

652
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,470
Are you feeling better,

653
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,070
birthday girl?

654
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,430
The birthday girl still has to take out the trash.

655
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,870
How can she be in a good mood?

656
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,770
Why didn't you reply

657
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,600
to my message today?

658
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,220
I was busy.

659
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,690
Come on.

660
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,310
You've written that

661
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,270
all over your face.

662
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,560
Do you think I've forgotten your birthday?

663
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,800
Let's go.

664
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,880
I'll take you to a place.

665
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,870
Please.

666
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,380
Can I open my eyes now?

667
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,180
In a minute.

668
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,080
Open your eyes now.

669
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,450
Wow.

670
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,660
You might be too full to eat two cakes.

671
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,870
But you can make wishes twice.

672
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,120
But this wish

673
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,870
must have something to do with me.

674
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,770
I hope

675
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,540
Xiao Yichuan

676
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,980
can...

677
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,440
always be by Xiong Jiujiu's side.

678
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,890
What's wrong with you?

679
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,860
The wish might fail if we say it out.

680
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,750
So you really made this wish?

681
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,600
Then you can simply

682
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,730
tell me.

683
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:40,380
Here.

684
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,510
Blow out the candles.

685
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,080
Okay.

686
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,960
Well,

687
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,360
as I have told you my wish,

688
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,330
-will you fulfill it? -Yes.

689
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,470
Actually, this is also my wish.

690
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,220
I have a birthday gift for you.

691
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,220
I put it in your room earlier today.

692
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,790
Just a little token of heart.

693
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,320
Don't be too touched.

694
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,870
Thank you

695
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,780
for your gift.

696
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,060
You're welcome.

697
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,880
I'll go upstairs and rest.

698
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,200
You should take an early rest too.

699
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:20,540
Okay.

700
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,940
I'll get some drinks from the kitchen

701
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,790
and then go back to sleep.

702
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,100
Thank you for today.

703
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:26,920
Good night.

704
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:27,760
Hmm.

705
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,910
It seems

706
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,330
to be a beautiful night.

707
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,320
Why?

708
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,690
Love

709
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,710
is like quicksand.

710
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,310
What?

711
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,540
[Handsome Chuan is with you.]

712
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,710
You're at leisure.

713
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,850
Did I

714
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,700
disrupt your plan?

715
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,490
I know Xiong Jiujiu likes you.

716
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,460
And I admit that

717
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,650
I like her.
