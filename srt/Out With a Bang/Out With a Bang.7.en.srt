1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:03,620
Are you ready?

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,430
Three, two, one.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,470
Hurry up.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,660
Hurry.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,380
One, two, one. One, two, one.

7
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:05,950
What are you looking at?

8
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,140
Chuan and Tian are running together.

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,520
As expected,

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
love

11
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,920
is complicated.

12
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,500
You should do physical training, too.

13
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,100
Let's do it

14
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,940
today.

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,340
Okay.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,250
Let's go.

17
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:28,330
We don't have to sit here anymore.

18
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,330
Let's go.

19
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:38,720
Let's go.

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,700
We go out finally.

21
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,460
Chuan, Tian, catch up.

22
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,180
Speed up!

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,720
No, no.

24
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,490
Let them run.

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,940
Let's not disturb them.

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,710
Run faster.

27
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,060
Go.

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,729
Are you taking advantage of our exhaustion?

29
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,560
It's you.

30
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,750
Not us.

31
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,820
Hurry.

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,030
It seems that

33
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,170
I know nothing about physical training.

34
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,850
It's happier to be a Fat Otaku.

35
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,380
Compared to those two

36
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,540
who are still running outside,

37
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,980
we are just two younger brothers.

38
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,160
Brother is back.

39
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,720
You're all here.

40
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,990
The result of the online popularity voting in the Global League Tournament

41
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,710
is out.

42
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,550
Our team

43
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,800
is the last one.

44
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,680
What?

45
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,820
But Chuan is in our team.

46
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,730
The last one? Impossible!

47
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,490
Yes.

48
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,610
It's not working to share with the topic.

49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,120
Or did your cp fans

50
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,880
love others?

51
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:51,920
Hey.

52
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,900
It's none of your business.

53
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:54,770
I...

54
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,050
Did I say I'd care?

55
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,730
I'm just checking the rankings of other teams.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,610
No need.

57
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,490
I'll read it to you.

58
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,070
The first place is Wang Boyu's team.

59
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,210
Their team, SIK Team.

60
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,500
The second is the OP Team .

61
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,090
The ON Team is the sixth.

62
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,210
Ah?

63
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,270
ON?

64
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,620
They must have done a lot of data.

65
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,570
I know Huo Ran well.

66
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,220
Let me see.

67
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,860
Although it's not official,

68
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,740
it's too shameful.

69
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,340
I'll discuss it with the propaganda department

70
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,420
to see

71
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,440
if we can do a live stream to canvass.

72
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,570
Okay.

73
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,090
I'll leave it to you.

74
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,590
Okay.

75
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,810
Let's go.

76
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,640
Let's review.

77
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,700
So that we can go to bed early.

78
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:38,810
Okay.

79
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,320
The news about Xiao Yichuan's return was so hot.

80
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,040
In the end, he joined a stupid team.

81
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,400
I heard of nobody in his team.

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,890
All of them are so unprofessional.

83
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,750
When Xiao Yichuan dismantles the team again,

84
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,310
we'll see

85
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,920
if the JR Sports will approve it officially.

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,630
Xiao Yichuan hasn't logged in for six months.

87
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,140
A professional player only knows to travel abroad.

88
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,650
I think

89
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,960
Xiao Yichuan's career is as long as a broad-leaved epiphyllum can live.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,070
I kindly remind him

91
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,980
to put his resume on the job-seeking website.

92
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,850
Xiao Yichuan,

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,560
come and help me.

94
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,680
Help what?

95
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,070
Can you help me

96
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,510
put this bucket of oil on it?

97
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,250
It's too heavy for me to carry it.

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,880
You want me to learn the kabe-don on TV?

99
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:03,940
What?

100
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,210
Find a reliable excuse next time.

101
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,130
My colleague was suffering cyber violence.

102
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,590
I hope he won't see it.

103
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,080
Didn't you say he was arrogant

104
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,070
and sympathetic?

105
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,830
You seem to care about him.

106
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,460
Actually,

107
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,330
he's quite pitiful.

108
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,140
[Out with a BANG]

109
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,920
[Episode 7]

110
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,760
E-sports department has a big budget problem.

111
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,800
E-sports

112
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,810
is not a sport that consumes too much physical energy.

113
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,780
The fitness equipment and nutritionist

114
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,940
are making a fuss.

115
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,659
And one less person.

116
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,690
As for team analyst and coach, one person is enough.

117
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,470
Mr. Hong,

118
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,659
our E-sports department

119
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,930
has a strong training intensity,

120
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,300
so it has special requirements for teammate's physical quality.

121
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,159
As for the team analyst...

122
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,470
For example, our team

123
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,620
is like a band.

124
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,170
A team member is a player.

125
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,130
The team analyst is the composer.

126
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,550
The coach is the conductor.

127
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,300
-OK. -So...

128
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,980
You don't need to recite it.

129
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,260
The difference between team analysts and coaches of team

130
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,640
originated from the three major balls.

131
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,560
Doesn't the company know it?

132
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,100
There are more problems with hardware equipment.

133
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
The equipment in your base is new.

134
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,150
You need to change them as soon as you buy them.

135
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,640
This is a waste of resources, you know?

136
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,210
The E-sports department

137
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,860
can't make any profit now.

138
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,070
For the company, if the E-sports department expends so much,

139
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,730
it's better to buy a formed team

140
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,470
to cultivate it.

141
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,550
Besides,

142
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,270
there's no need for the second team members.

143
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,880
It's the beginning of the E-sports department.

144
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,070
The ability of the main players is more important

145
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,970
than youth training.

146
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,480
You've had a hard time getting your team together.

147
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,909
If the first team is disbanded,

148
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,970
what happens to the second team?

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
We won't disband.

150
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,670
Stop shouting slogans.

151
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,180
Make a team that can fight first

152
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,100
and then make a request.

153
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,260
Mr. Hong,

154
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,530
our E-sports department has just been established.

155
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,870
The company must help us.

156
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,350
Trust us.

157
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,570
We will get good results.

158
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,700
Speaking of results,

159
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,380
your team

160
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,020
is the last one on the internet.

161
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,620
It's only temporary.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,270
What about the negative comments online?

163
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,400
Your main player Xiao Yichuan

164
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,240
has not logged into his account

165
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,150
for six months.

166
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,340
Doesn't he usually train?

167
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,100
Others, including the coach and team members,

168
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,210
have also been questioned online.

169
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,860
What does it reflect from the side?

170
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,580
Your team's ability is not recognized.

171
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,570
Your future is not optimistic.

172
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,700
Submit the budget of the e-sports department again.

173
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,060
For now,

174
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,850
at least cut a half of it.

175
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,070
A half?

176
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,670
Mr. Hong.

177
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,120
This is too much.

178
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,980
What should we do?

179
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,760
Hello, Capt. Qin.

180
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,240
Xiong Jiujiu.

181
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,490
Is the budget enough to

182
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,600
prepare more equipment?

183
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,980
Capt. Qin,

184
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,780
the previous budget was cut.

185
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,200
The review failed.

186
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,770
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,820
But don't worry.

188
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,860
I will revise

189
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,060
and submit it.

190
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,140
Focus on your training.

191
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,100
Don't be affected by this.

192
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,660
I see.

193
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,740
Don't blame yourself.

194
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,930
I'll discuss with others

195
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,180
to simplify our needs.

196
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,970
Okay.

197
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:23,810
That's it.

198
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,020
Capt. Qin,

199
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,850
I want to take a half day off from you.

200
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,450
From the report,

201
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,180
your power of flexor muscle

202
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,400
can only reach level four.

203
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,670
At present,

204
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,550
your condition is not good.

205
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,000
So you have to consider about

206
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,060
the surgery.

207
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,400
Dr. Chen.

208
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,800
You always scare me.

209
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,540
I just practiced a few times.

210
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,750
I'm usually fine.

211
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,820
Your hand is more numb,

212
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,770
which means your nerves have been oppressed.

213
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,460
If the scope expands,

214
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,260
it'll be too late.

215
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,690
Dr. Chen.

216
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:16,870
I took this out.

217
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,220
Is his hand okay?

218
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,080
Yes.

219
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,900
Dr. Chen, I know.

220
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,570
I'll take care of myself.

221
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,240
Please prescribe some medicine for me.

222
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,740
Dr. Chen.

223
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,700
The patient who removed the plaster is ready.

224
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,380
Okay.

225
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,240
Have a seat.

226
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,070
I'll go out for a while.

227
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,270
Please go ahead.

228
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,600
What did the doctor say?

229
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,550
It's nothing serious. It's just an occupational disease.

230
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,980
Working is so hard.

231
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,950
The company rejected the budget for our department.

232
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,170
It's better that you're fine.

233
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,690
But you have to be careful.

234
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,460
It's harder to cure sedimentary injury.

235
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,860
I'm talking to you.

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You still read Weibo?

237
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,850
Listen to me.

238
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,870
Xiao Yichuan.

239
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,970
I didn't even blame you.

240
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,760
If I hadn't seen the team list,

241
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,430
I wouldn't know

242
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,940
you joined that strange team.

243
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,680
You didn't tell me about such a big thing, right?

244
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,490
It's OK that you know it now.

245
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,490
You've been picking for so long,

246
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,840
but you picked this one.

247
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,940
The JR Sports focuses on traditional sports.

248
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,820
Its E-sports department is only established this year.

249
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,180
It's not a good thing

250
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,370
that they established E-sports department suddenly.

251
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,310
In terms of profession or health,

252
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,020
you can't afford it anymore, you know?

253
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,260
I'm serious.

254
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,490
Do you hear me?

255
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,590
Yes.

256
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,860
Xiong Jiujiu is in the JR Sports, right?

257
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,300
Are you using your career

258
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,620
to pursue a girl?

259
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,940
We don't know who's pursuer.

260
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,660
So, Xiong Jiujiu said she would deal with you.

261
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,950
It means make you join her team.

262
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,440
Not exactly.

263
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,590
Is there

264
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,260
improper transaction

265
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,690
between you and her?

266
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,100
So vulgar.

267
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,820
It's

268
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,180
sincerity for sincerity.

269
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,080
Awesome.

270
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,620
Send me the schedule

271
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,860
Dr. Chen gave you.

272
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,740
I'll come with you.

273
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,490
If you think training is too easy,

274
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,570
I won't stop you.

275
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,860
Chuan, I'm not blaming you.

276
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,960
Don't be fooled by this team.

277
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,160
Alright.

278
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,980
Do you think

279
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm fool like you?

280
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,340
I know what to do.

281
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,900
Besides,

282
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,120
I don't need training in that team.

283
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,710
No one controls me.

284
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,570
No one can control you anyway.

285
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,780
Take it as a vacation if you don't train.

286
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,340
I heard of nobody,

287
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,780
except you and Qin Zheng.

288
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,450
That's right.

289
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,900
Newbie.

290
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,890
A kid's game operation time

291
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,850
is not as much as my training time for five days.

292
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,330
That way, he can be a professional?

293
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,780
Not to mention other things,

294
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,010
from the professional perspective,

295
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,230
he is talented,

296
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,000
but he is rude.

297
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,380
He always wants to surpass me

298
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,140
and keeps moving forward.

299
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,320
Isn't this you in the past?

300
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,820
Everyone says you've become independent

301
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,500
and asocial.

302
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,650
You look better in the past.

303
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,570
Have I

304
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,300
changed a lot?

305
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,780
What?

306
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,260
Just asking.

307
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,060
Turn right and go to the mall.

308
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,290
Please leave your address here.

309
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,090
Delivery tomorrow.

310
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:35,910
Yes.

311
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,240
Why did you buy all this?

312
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,840
None of your business.

313
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,580
I did the math.

314
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,620
At least half of the budget was cut.

315
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,110
We need to adjust our manpower needs.

316
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,550
We also need to save the rest as possible as we can.

317
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,430
Yes.

318
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,890
We just went through

319
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,270
things we can save.

320
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,450
I think we can save a lot.

321
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,950
My peripheral device can still be used.

322
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,800
Other messy things

323
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,230
are not necessary.

324
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,000
Chu Tian is back.

325
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,780
What are these?

326
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,830
I bought for everyone.

327
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,640
Did you spend money

328
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,460
from your little vault again?

329
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,730
Aren't you afraid your sister will scold you?

330
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,330
I'll listen to her.

331
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,140
Anyway,

332
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,470
I won't lose anything.

333
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,470
Your sister likes to curse.

334
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
You bought so many.

335
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,100
I'm embarrassed as a boss.

336
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,630
Don't be shy.

337
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,390
Just don't pursue my sister.

338
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:49,890
What?

339
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,000
Is it so obvious?

340
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,300
It's so awkward.

341
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,100
You're after Chu Tian's sister

342
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,200
and let her brother spend money?

343
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,640
You enjoy living off a woman.

344
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,840
Watch your mouth.

345
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,380
I'm a second-generation rich man.

346
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,740
I have no money indeed.

347
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,550
I shouldn't

348
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,079
have given my dad my bank card.

349
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,619
You're an adult.

350
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,839
Why did you give your dad your bank card?

351
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,109
That's one of the conditions

352
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,510
to establish an E-sports department.

353
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,480
It's my fault this time.

354
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,340
My budget is not meticulous enough.

355
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,640
It's understandable that the company thinks it's unreasonable.

356
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,020
I guess

357
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,940
the company is not confident

358
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,010
after seeing our ranking.

359
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,860
Let's move.

360
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,920
Xiao Yichuan.

361
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,380
I can tell from your expression that something is wrong.

362
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,160
Say it.

363
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,070
We plan to do a live stream.

364
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,830
Why don't you come here to canvass?

365
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,290
Will the company approve your budget if I do?

366
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,990
How do you know about the budget?

367
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,950
What are they moving?

368
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,820
Let me see.

369
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:30,880
What is this?

370
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,790
Chu Tian bought this for us.

371
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,430
He is like an angel.

372
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,990
He spent a lot.

373
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,880
Yes, Chu Tian.

374
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,200
Don't waste money again.

375
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,180
If your little vault is gone,

376
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,640
I have to sponsor you to get married.

377
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,450
You want to sponsor Chu Tian to get married?

378
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,290
Yes.

379
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,330
We have to do it right away.

380
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,510
Do you have a girlfriend?

381
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,790
How about I introduce someone to you?

382
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,460
-No. -Okay.

383
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,430
Do you still need to do the live stream?

384
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,950
Yes.

385
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,780
I'll carry it.

386
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,290
I'll do the live stream.

387
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,180
I'm happy now.

388
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,320
I'll send earphones

389
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,040
to my fans in the live stream later.

390
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,140
Good evening, babies.

391
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,540
Welcome to our live stream room.

392
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,150
Please follow us on Weibo,

393
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,300

and vote for us.

395
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,470
Love you.

396
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,830
I love you too.

397
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,550
You can't do this. You're so lame.

398
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,140
This is based on my live streaming experience.

399
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,890
Dear audience,

400
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,900
are you still worried about ugliness?

401
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,520
Are you still crying for poverty?

402
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,030
Today, I'll recommend you

403
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,830
a way to achieve your own value.

404
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,620
Vote online

405
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,060
for the E-sports Team JR.

406
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,200
They are dark horses. They have potential. Everyone can fight against five enemies.

407
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,650
Others have to kneel before them when they have guns.

408
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,660
Just vote for us and luck will come sooner or later.

409
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,590
Just vote for us, your body will be so good.

410
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,980
To thank you for your support,

411
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,890
we will share the lucky draw on Weibo

412
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,100
and send out the same earphones as that of Xiao Yichuan.

413
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,620
Xiao Yichuan's same earphones.

414
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,420
It has perfect noise reduction and sound effect.

415
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,940
It's good-looking and elegant.

416
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,970
What are you waiting for?

417
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,350
Go and vote for us

418
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,850
on Weibo.

419
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,590
Please stay away from me.

420
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,440
See if anyone share it on Weibo.

421
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,280
Sure.

422
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,930
Chuan's fans is coming.

423
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,090
Not bad.

424
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,680
It's much more shared than before.

425
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,860
You two are good.

426
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,460
When will you teach me live streaming experience?

427
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,540
I think you can say that next time.

428
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,980
Vote today and laugh all day.

429
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,660
Look.

430
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,190
Vote the day after tomorrow and feel good all the time.

431
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,540
Does he look like you in the past?

432
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,330
You work so hard

433
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,700
just to surpass me?

434
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,180
Yes.

435
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,260
Let's have a match.

436
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,500
Since we're going to fight one-on-one,

437
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,620
why don't we set the standard?

438
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,330
-Let's see who will... -Who will eliminate the other?

439
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,540
Why are you squeezing me?

440
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm doing a live stream.

441
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,250
Why does Chu Tian keep chasing him?

442
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,670
They are competing

443
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,090
to see who hits the other first.

444
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,540
Chuan hasn't picked up the gun yet.

445
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,990
Hey,

446
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,090
you're too easy to be influenced.

447
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,510
You guys can vote for JR Sports.

448
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,710
Captain.

449
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,750
Look.

450
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,600
There's a sniper in their team.

451
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,340
To eliminate Chuan,

452
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,090
he killed 26 of them.

453
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,300
He killed 26 of them?

454
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,950
Amazing. What's his name?

455
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:36,980
Tian.

456
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,280
Chu Tian, go east.

457
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,070
95 degrees.

458
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,690
About 200 meters.

459
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,260
The map was updated last week

460
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,020
and two abandoned buildings were deleted.

461
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,290
There's a blind spot for a gun.

462
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,760
Hong Yang, I underestimated you.

463
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,270
Such a wicked blind spot.

464
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
I just like studying maps.

465
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,980
You have something

466
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,420
in your mind

467
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,070
that professional players are not good at.

468
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,740
You're fast.

469
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,170
Before I eliminate you,

470
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,340
I won't let anyone touch you.

471
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,750
You've eliminated 29 people in that game.

472
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,180
Oh my god.

473
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,060
29!

474
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,180
I can be proud of this game for the rest of my life.

475
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,130
That's right.

476
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,320
It was a glorious defeat.

477
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,560
He shot three times at one point.

478
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,390
He didn't even know he was exposed.

479
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,200
You still have a long way to go.

480
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,200
Don't be too impulsive, bro.

481
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,080
Alright.

482
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,280
I made supper.

483
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,690
Let's go.

484
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,480
Let's eat together.

485
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,830
Let's go.

486
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:46,870
Go.

487
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,470
The winner over there.

488
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,650
Do you want supper?

489
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,800
I won't keep it for you if you don't eat.

490
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,440
Chuan,

491
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,560
thank you.

492
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,130
You praised me today.

493
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,980
I was really encouraged.

494
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,540
I decided to train hard

495
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,500
and devote myself

496
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,850
for E-sports.

497
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,860
Aren't we going to reduce the budget?

498
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,120
I think I can work part-time

499
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,620
as an analyst.

500
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,530
I've studied the characteristics of many teams,

501
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,190
their usual routes,

502
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,060
and preferences of equipment.

503
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,110
I made these into big data.

504
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,300
It should have some reference value.

505
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,520
Hong Yang is professional.

506
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,090
You can try.

507
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,620
Maybe you can be a half of the analyst.

508
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,320
I'll do the other half.

509
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,800
I'll search

510
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,780
my friends' equipment.

511
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,850
How can they play so badly

512
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,460
and waste such good equipment.

513
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,320
If it doesn't work,

514
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,210
I'll pick an auspicious day to go back to the company

515
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,190
to argue with my dad.

516
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,040
Leave the nutritionist to me.

517
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,750
I'm a mukbang live streamer after all.

518
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,300
And my mom sends me links about diet every day.

519
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,600
I'll just learn to cook.

520
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,570
As long as we are together,

521
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,120
these difficulties are not problems.

522
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,330
Even if we are questioned now,

523
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,260
and are rebuffed everywhere,

524
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,660
But I believe one day

525
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,580
we will become professional E-sports players

526
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,580
and tell them

527
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,640
we are the best team with good grades.

528
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,090
Cheers.

529
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,940
Don't think that people who are not good today

530
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,880
won't success forever.

531
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,550
Chuan is still practicing?

532
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,370
Why are you so diligent?

533
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,820
I don't think it's good enough.

534
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,970
I want to be an official member of the ULT Team,

535
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,110
a real professional E-sports player.

536
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,810
Come on.

537
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,820
Keep practicing.

538
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,420
Today I found

539
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,640
the kid next bed

540
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,690
has some advantages.

541
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,730
As long as he doesn't stick to my little nurse.

542
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,400
I found out today

543
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,250
the big shot in our team seems to be arrogant superficially,

544
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,610
he actually gets along well with everyone.

545
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,380
After getting to know him more, I find he's quite charming.

546
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,179
No wonder so many people admire him.

547
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,130
I think

548
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,560
you care more about the kid in the next bed.

549
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:46,860
I think

550
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,980
you care more about

551
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,070
the big shot in our team.

552
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,420
He always teases me.

553
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,100
How could I care about him?

554
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,630
How is that possible?

555
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,950
What are you doing?

556
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,370
I'm moving out. You can live alone.

557
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,660
You were encouraging team mates downstairs.

558
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,550
You're breaking up with your team upstairs.

559
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,700
You're lighting up the contradiction in the team,

560
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,360
and disrupting our positive attitude.

561
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,520
You disrespect the mental health of the team members.

562
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,320
Look at the time.

563
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,710
Is it time to move?

564
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,510
It's a bit late.

565
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,990
Should I lower my voice?

566
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,060
No matter how low your voice is, there will be noise.

567
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,830
You want to disturb the people in the middle of the night

568
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,330
and cause noise to bring disaster to the country and the people.

569
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,000
If the neighbors call the police and make a scene,

570
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,710
the news about us living together

571
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,030
will be on the headline.

572
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,590
Keyboard Man doesn't care about the truth.

573
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,920
If things get out of hand,

574
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,240
will you be responsible for me, a pure boy?

575
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,390
Even if you don't care,

576
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,700
you're still a pure girl

577
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,280
without experience of love.

578
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,410
Your college classmates,

579
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,040
high school classmates,

580
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,180
primary school classmates, kindergarten classmates,

581
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,250
and grandparents...

582
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:16,740
Stop.

583
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,400
What are you talking about?

584
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,500
I just said I want to move out.

585
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,970
Don't do evil things although you think it is a tiny thing.

586
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,810
Since you're so serious about this,

587
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,800
you should think about the consequences of moving out.

588
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,350
But I...

589
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,600
Find a suitable time to move.

590
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,180
I'm going to sleep. Read to me.

591
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,890
Are you a three-year-old?

592
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,290
You even listen to bedtime stories?

593
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,220
You forgot your promise.

594
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,460
How about I...

595
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,760
I remember.

596
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,840
Isn't this a comic book?

597
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,910
How can I read it?

598
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,780
By imagination.

599
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,630
Coach Anzai told Tanizawa

600
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,550
the team doesn't exist for you.

601
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,800
On the contrary, your existence is for the team.

602
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,100
Give it to me! Lay-up.

603
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,580
Score!

604
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,940
Good job!

605
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,130
The team doesn't exist for you.

606
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,690
On the contrary, your existence is for the team.

607
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:33,840
Do you understand?

608
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,450
You don't?

609
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,690
I understand.

610
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,350
Good job.

611
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,420
Stand up and start training.

612
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,830
He always teases you.

613
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:13,970
Maybe...

614
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,170
because you're special to him.

615
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,870
He doesn't know how to treat you.
