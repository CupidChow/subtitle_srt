Was Chu Tian

180
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,130
often bullied in the team?

181
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,900
Bullied?

182
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,220
How is that possible?

183

184
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,440
Don't play dumb.

185
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,100
Xiao Yichuan

186
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,240
doesn't look easy to get along with.

187
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,010
Chuan just doesn't look easy to get along with.

188
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,830
Actually,

189
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,630
he encouraged Chu Tian a lot.

190
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,930
There is Xiong Jiujiu in the middle.

191
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,450
It's impossible for Xiong Jiujiu to like Chu Tian.

192
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,140
So,

193
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,160
we outsiders

194
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,050
should not interfere

195
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,260
in matters of love.

196
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,040
What do you mean?

197
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,560
I also hope Xiong Jiujiu

198
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,060
can get her own happiness.

199
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,750
It has nothing to do with Chu Tian.

200

You are such a sensible woman.

201
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,419
Don't use your name

202
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,340
to play this pun with me.

203
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,539
I know what Xiong Jiujiu is thinking.

204
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,860
But I can't persuade Chu Tian.

205
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,350
I hope he won't get hurt here.

206
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,080
I think JR

207
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,540
should not be a place

208
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,660
where Chu Tian can

209
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,680
continue to have a crush.

Yeah, Chuan.

I can't keep up with you.

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,020
You think too much.

and focus on your problems.

268
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,580
The points of games

269
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,150
are divided into two parts:

270
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,600
the ranking points and the number of eliminations.

271
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,070
Eliminating opponents in the early stage

272
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,850
will get a higher score

273
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,900
than in the later stage.

274
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,860
So under such rules,

275
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,070
most teams

276
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,940
will choose to fight head-on in the early stage.

277
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,380
Chuan and Chu Tian's speed

278
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,800
and shooting accuracy have no problems.

279
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,500
So the scores

280
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,450
mainly depend on you two.

281
