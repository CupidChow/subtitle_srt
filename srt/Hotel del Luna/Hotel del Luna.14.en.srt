(Episode 14)

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,733
Halt!

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,366
What are you doing?

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,334
They're keepsakes of the
Goguryeo people who were executed.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,933
We were ordered to keep
what's useful, and burn the rest.

12
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,333
Don't burn the keepsakes of
those who died,

13
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:31,400
but gather them in one place.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,934
Give them to the surviving
Gaorichon bandits

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,366
so they can hold a funeral
with these, at least.

16
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,066
Hold on.

17
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm going to kill you.

18
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,900
One day, I'm going to…

19
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,566
…kill you for sure.

20
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,433
Koo Chan-sung!

21
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:00,833
I was scared you wouldn't
come back.

22
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,333
You…

23
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,933
Who are you?

24
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,066
Mr. Koo!

25
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,034
- Mr. Koo.
- Mr. Koo!

26
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,433
Mr. Koo!

27
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:06,433
Thank goodness you're safe.

28
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,967
We were worried!

29
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,533
You made my heart skip
a beat once more.

30
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,400
President Jang,
you must've been startled.

31
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,900
Are you not feeling well?

32
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:27,533
It's nothing.

33
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,766
I'm fine. I must've scared you.

34
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,367
President Jang must be upset.

35
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:49,466
She's probably embarrassed about
rushing over here.

36
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:53,100
Anyway, thank goodness
you came out of there safely.

37
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:34,933
This is…

38
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
…the end for us.

39
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,133
Who is that man?

40
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,900
Why? You think you're him?

41
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,867
I thought maybe, yes.

42
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:53,400
What I'm seeing could be
the past I don't remember.

43
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:59,133
That man too, will be brought to
you by Koo Chan-sung!

44
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
No way.

45
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,400
There's no way
Koo Chan-sung is him.

46
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:29,900
All because of such
a small, pale light…

47
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,600
The full moon will be quivering.

48
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's because you turned back halfway
on your journey to the underworld,

49
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,333
that you lost your strength
and grew fainter.

50
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,167
This wine is from this world.

51
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,867
You were at the mouth of
the underworld,

52
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,966
so you need to eat something
from this world.

53
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,400
Thank you.

54
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,434
What a relief you got out
without getting lost.

55
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,534
I heard.

56
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,134
That time flows differently
en route to the underworld,

57
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,567
and that you might even lose
your memories in the process.

58
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:38,534
Those old tales of how people
wandered off to another world

59
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,100
only to return and find that
30 years had passed,

60
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,400
is not a joke at all.

61
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,734
I heard from the Grim Reaper that
some recovered their memories

62
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
when they stumbled on the
bridge to the underworld

63
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:49,434
which messed up
their present life.

64
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,334
Their previous life?

65
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,100
Did you see anything strange
in there, Mr. Koo?

66
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:04,767
I think I may have seen
something glowing.

67
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,766
Oh.

68
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:07,533
What is that?

69
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,800
We don't know, because
we've never been in there.

70
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,800
You got the first taste,
even before us dead souls!

71
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:18,500
But… how did you manage to
come back so soon?

72
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:19,734
I heard it's not easy.

73
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,967
To be honest, I have
no memory of exiting.

74
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:24,067
When I had come to my senses,
I was already out here.

75
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,866
So you lost your memories.
Go on and drink some more.

76
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:30,566
President Jang.

77
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,400
I ended up wandering in there,
trying to stop the bus

78
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:43,467
because I thought
a living child was on there.

79
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:46,800
The child is safe and so am I,
so please don't be mad.

80
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,466
I'm really fine.

81
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,066
You're just Koo Chan-sung…

82
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:52,966
Do you still see me
in your dreams these days?

83
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,966
After that long dream,

84
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,366
I haven't seen you since.

85
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,300
Then did you see anything else?

86
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,734
I didn't tell you because
I wasn't sure if

87
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,134
it was a dream or
just my imagination, but…

88
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,866
I saw that man.

89
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,733
That man, by the name Chung-myung.

90
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:22,867
He was waiting for you,

91
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,400
all alone by the lake.

92
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,367
In his hand was an accessory

93
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,500
in the shape of the moon
which meant it's for you.

94
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,033
By any chance…

95
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:44,134
Did he ever give you
a present like that?

96
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,366
No.

97
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,600
If I'm not peering into you,

98
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,133
then what was that dream?

99
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:00,766
At first, you said
what you're peering into

100
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,800
may be your previous life
you may not remember, right?

101
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:06,766
But you said that's
just not possible.

102
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:12,933
Right.

103
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,066
It's not.

104
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,134
Are you troubled after seeing that

105
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,900
Song-hwa and Yeon-woo had
ended up together, unexpectedly?

106
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:24,566
In case he may come to you
in a similar fate?

107
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,600
They can't do that to me.

108
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,500
Because they…

109
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:34,267
Right. Their lives had already
ended once for them,

110
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,200
so I can accept that.

111
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:38,533
But not me. I'm still trapped
in that life.

112
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:53,867
I think
I was having weird thoughts

113
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,000
after seeing that woman
and Yeon-woo together.

114
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,133
- Daddy.
- Hyun-min! Oh Hyun-min…

115
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,534
He'd fallen asleep at
the bus stop,

116
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,067
and was running a fever
so we brought him here.

117
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,767
While you were on your way,
he had some medicine

118
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,900
and now his fever is down.

119
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,000
Thank you so much.

120
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,400
Hyun-min, where were you?

121
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:39,534
I took a bus to a hotel.

122
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I guess he had a dream.

123
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,600
I went to see Mom,
but Mom wasn't there.

124
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,634
Hyun-min, once you're bigger,

125
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,834
Daddy will tell you
where Mommy went and

126
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,334
why she had to go, alright?

127
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,133
Okay.

128
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,500
I'm sorry.

129
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:08,733
Will it be less sad for him,
learning the truth much later?

130
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:11,600
That he'll never see her again?

131
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:20,834
Does Yu-na know that
you'll depart with your sister

132
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,400
once she's here?

133
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,100
Yu-na.

134
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,600
Um, you see…

135
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,334
Hey, if you go now, you'll only
get told off by President Jang.

136
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,834
- So spend more time with me.
- But…

137
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,867
I learned that
if you can get told off much later,

138
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,967
you won't be told off
that harshly.

139
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:42,533
Wait right here,
I'm going to the bathroom.

140
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,566
I should tell her today.

141
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,400
Ma'am, please stay here
and listen to that.

142
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,566
Do you like the piano?

143
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:17,666
Yes.

144
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,400
My friend's sister…

145
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:24,500
I mean, his grandmother…
looks much like you.

146
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,700
May I take a picture of you
listening to that music,

147
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,400
and show it to my friend?

148
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:30,400
Sure.

149
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,666
Thank you.

150
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,967
Um…

151
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:52,700
Do you remember your brother's name,
by any chance?

152
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:54,500
Yes.

153
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,700
My brother's name is
Ji Hyun-joong.

154
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,566
You remember your brother?

155
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:05,733
Yes.

156
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:14,133
What are you doing?

157
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,333
Hyun-joong!

158
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:18,433
Ah, yes. Hyun-mi.

159
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,000
Were you listening to music?

160
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,800
Let's see.

161
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:27,600
You're Mr. Ji Hyun-joong,

162
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,234
who founded this hospital,
aren't you?

163
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,134
Yes.

164
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,833
Ah, you're Director Kim's daughter
who was here last time.

165
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:40,966
So… you're her brother?

166
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,767
Yes. What about that?

167
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,467
But Ms. Ji Hyun-mi's brother,
Mr. Ji Hyun-joong…

168
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,433
He passed away a long time ago.

169
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
What?

170
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,434
Hyun-joong.

171
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,100
Hyun-joong.

172
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,466
Oh… yes. I'm here.

173
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,800
Who...

174
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,700
There's someone…

175
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:19,133
…who knows that
Ji Hyun-joong is dead.

176
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,600
I told you not to
approach Hyun-mi.

177
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,267
Was he the reason you died?

178
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,400
Did he steal everything you had,

179
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:35,934
even your name?

180
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,934
It's none of your business.

181
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,834
That's why you couldn't leave for
the underworld, huh?

182
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,500
Because you were upset to see him
live your life instead.

183
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,900
- Just let him be.
- How can I let him be?

184
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,267
He stole your life!

185
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,234
So what? I'm already dead.

186
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,100
And you're living
a life like that yourself.

187
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:00,133
That's right.

188
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:03,400
I stole someone's life, too.

189
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,700
I had no right to say that.

190
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:08,433
- Yu-na, that's not what I…
- I won't get involved.

191
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,800
Sanchez, is everything all good?

192
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:25,267
- Yes.
- Over here!

193
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,934
Why's it so noisy?

194
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
Is someone over at our place?

195
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,700
Detective Park's leg is swollen,

196
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,634
so Mi-ra had him sleep in
your room last night.

197
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,600
Then although I thought
he was all better now,

198
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,600
Mi-ra said patients need to
eat well so they were eating.

199
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,167
They were eating, when…

200
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:42,600
His colleagues came over to visit
since it's their day off.

201
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,534
And now they're cutting up
watermelon they brought,

202
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,966
since we have a yard
and everything.

203
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,066
You two look good.

204
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,067
So Mi-ra invited a whole lot
of people over again.

205
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,900
Chan-sung, the house is safe now.

206
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:59,467
Spiritually safe, thanks to the
candles Man-wol gave me,

207
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:02,067
and also literally safe,
thanks to all the detectives

208
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,766
Mi-ra invited in.

209
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,300
Sanchez, put Mi-ra on.
I'll say a word to her.

210
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,600
It's alright.

211
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,300
Mi-ra's probably doing this
for me,

212
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,933
in case I get depressed
being here all by myself.

213
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,634
It's nice how it's all boisterous.

214
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,034
I have no time to think about
anything else than

215
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,333
worry about the grass in our yard.

216
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:24,567
Chan-sung, so there's no need to
worry about me, alright?

217
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:27,600
It's sweet, right? I bought it.

218
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,734
Maybe not.

219
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,066
I'll have it, then.

220
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,466
- But you're a patient.
- My arms are just fine.

221
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,633
Will you shut up and eat if
I break your arms, then?

222
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,000
Ah.

223
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:43,866
Aw, delicious, huh?

224
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,067
- Here, you take the rest.
- Delicious.

225
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,800
Eat up. They're so sweet, right?

226
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,834
I thought Mi-ra and Detective Park

227
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
always fought to death
like enemies

228
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:57,634
but seeing them together…
They get along pretty well.

229
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,134
I don't think we'll need to worry.

230
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,900
It looks like
she'll be leaving us soon.

231
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,700
Chan-sung, I better go
and have some watermelon.

232
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:04,733
Talk to you later.

233
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:07,800
Sanchez!

234
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:10,534
Have some melon that
the detective brought for us.

235
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,267
- Come here and join us!
- Come here!

236
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,834
Mi-ra,

237
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,533
that melon's from our fridge.

238
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:18,933
Oh, is it?

239
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:22,767
- Is it?
- Oh, who cares?

240
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,400
Thanks for the melon!

241
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:25,566
Who cares?

242
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,866
Yes?

243
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,767
Do you remember

244
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,700
the woman President Jang
invited to our hotel?

245
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,334
This hotel is really nice.

246
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,966
And this woman is
a friend of yours?

247
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,666
Yes, she is.

248
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,066
Does she have anything to do
with President Jang's previous life?

249
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,133
They were bound by ill fate,
no doubt.

250
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,200
Until now,

251
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:08,267
we never once tried to learn
President Jang's story.

252
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,800
Because we thought
she had no intention to

253
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:13,866
satisfy her grudge and
leave this world.

254
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,567
But the tree that she's tied to
has now transformed,

255
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:21,600
and it is probably due to you,

256
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,800
and the old acquaintances that
you brought to her, Mr. Koo.

257
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:26,933
Your assumptions…

258
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,900
…are correct.

259
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,534
Will there be any more coming,

260
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,800
besides that woman?

261
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,534
They already came,

262
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,633
and more should arrive,
pretty soon.

263
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,366
And he too, will be brought to her
by me.

264
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:54,067
So that's the reason why
Old Mago sent you here.

265
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:56,434
Then you must've known
President Jang

266
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
in your previous life, then.

267
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,234
Not me.

268
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,500
Is that so?

269
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:03,434
That's strange.

270
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,834
If you two weren't bound by
fate at all previously,

271
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,766
then why did she choose you?

272
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,900
There's probably a reason for
God's plans.

273
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:20,866
Anyway, we saw love blossoming
as a result.

274
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,033
I'm going to…

275
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,933
…stay with her, forever.

276
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,333
Poor President Jang.

277
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:39,834
After all, this means that
she'll now see once again

278
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,866
the person who hurt her the most.

279
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:01,433
Jang Man-wol.

280
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,000
Why are you leaving,
without a word?

281
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,533
I don't want to see you.

282
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:10,600
I'll leave you to watch
all the flowers you wanted to see,

283
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,534
before taking your leave.

284
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,367
Are you thinking of just
letting him pass by, then?

285
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:17,766
And pretend ignorance?

286
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:24,566
But you met him.

287
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:34,900
You cannot avoid it.

288
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:38,733
He's already here, next to you.

289
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,433
Now I finally have the chance to
pass this on.

290
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:52,700
This is yours.

291
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,534
I saw that man.

292
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,000
That man, by the name Chung-myung.

293
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,934
In his hand was an accessory

294
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,900
in the shape of the moon
which meant it's for you.

295
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,633
Is it Koo Chan-sung?

296
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,566
If he is Koo Chan-sung,

297
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,500
can you accept that?

298
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:39,334
Was Koo Chan-sung…

299
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,933
…that man, all along?

300
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,667
The man you've been waiting for
is finally here

301
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,133
after a thousand years,
but you don't seem happy.

302
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:55,400
You were so confident about
killing him before perishing

303
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:58,100
if he were ever to come to you,

304
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,600
but now are you hesitant
about doing so?

305
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:07,533
So…

306
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,667
…is he Koo Chan-sung, or not?

307
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:16,067
Why not untangle those
long years of hatred,

308
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:20,767
with love that has finally arrived

309
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,433
after all these years?

310
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,366
You bound me with the man
I hated for over a thousand years,

311
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,800
by making him the man
I've only just managed to love?

312
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,200
I'm also curious too,

313
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:43,900
about who you'll see in him.

314
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:49,400
Will you see him as Ko Chung-myung
and perish,

315
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,600
or see him as Koo Chan-sung
and be salvaged?

316
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:57,833
That's up to your decision.

317
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:55,900
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

318
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:04,700
From now on, every scene you see
with me will be different.

319
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,100
This view too,
looks much nicer now that

320
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,400
I'm seeing it with you
and not alone.

321
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,433
Good on you, Man-wol.

322
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:09,933
I told you,

323
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,000
to believe in me.

324
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,666
Koo Chan-sung…

325
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:23,866
President Jang.

326
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,666
President Jang, what's the matter?

327
00:29:31,766 --> 00:29:33,700
Your face is pale.

328
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:46,900
I just…

329
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:51,333
I just killed Koo Chan-sung
from in my heart.

330
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,666
Koo Chan-sung may be…

331
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:02,666
…the reincarnation of
the man I despise the most.

332
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:04,700
No.

333
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,000
Even Mr. Koo has said no.

334
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:12,733
Right. He may not be, no.

335
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,800
But now that there is the
slightest possibility,

336
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:19,000
I can't face…

337
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:22,400
…Koo Chan-sung anymore.

338
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,633
What will you do now?

339
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:43,133
I can never kill Koo Chan-sung.

340
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:50,433
Old Mago said I need to
empty everything,

341
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:55,766
so I need to think about

342
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:00,400
how to do just that.

343
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,500
I bought this from
your favorite place.

344
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:36,133
Eating something sweet will
cheer you up.

345
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,133
Come and sit.

346
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:46,933
What's that in your hand?

347
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,866
That's the accessory I said
I saw in my dreams.

348
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:04,533
So this came from your dream.

349
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,634
Old Mago gave it to me.

350
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,634
When I saw it in my dream though,
it wasn't covered by blood.

351
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,700
I told you he died under my sword.

352
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,900
This blood is…

353
00:32:15,966 --> 00:32:18,467
…probably full of his hate for me.

354
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:21,467
Why did Old Mago give you
something morbid like that?

355
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:23,100
Give it to me, I'll hold onto it.

356
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm going to get rid of it.

357
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:34,666
A blood-stained moon
ought to disappear.

358
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,900
That's what Old Mago
always says, isn't it?

359
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:41,900
To empty and purge
the moon from grudge.

360
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,400
Can you do that?

361
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,000
I'll have to.

362
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,766
I'm thinking of calling forth…

363
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:56,000
…a blood-stained moon.

364
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,733
Mr. Koo!

365
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
Mr. Koo…

366
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,333
There you were.

367
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,000
The Grim Reaper is looking
for you.

368
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,133
Go on.

369
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:28,867
I found the evil spirit
that cursed you.

370
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:30,567
I see you found Seol Ji-won.

371
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,500
Did he get stronger, as he wished?

372
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:36,867
Do you think an evil spirit
who sources its power from a curse

373
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:39,133
will grow strong as he wishes?

374
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:43,767
He only merely hides in the dark,
like a rat in the sewage.

375
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:44,834
I'm relieved to hear that.

376
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,500
That he didn't grow as powerful
and evil as he desired.

377
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:51,666
But he continues to hide like
a coward, and won't come out.

378
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,600
Will you help me?

379
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:59,133
I hear you make an excellent bait.

380
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:02,234
But I won't say
who recommended you.

381
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,600
Probably Mr. Kim, no doubt.

382
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,134
I'll just take it as
a colleague having

383
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,800
an excellent opinion of
my abilities.

384
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:14,433
There were many human
general managers before you.

385
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,100
And of them all, you were…

386
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,566
This is just my opinion.

387
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,466
Why, thank you.

388
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,667
Have you been here with
Jang Man-wol's inn of the moon

389
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,000
ever since its earliest days?

390
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:34,000
That's right.

391
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,634
I lead countless numbers of
the dead

392
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,133
from here to the underworld.

393
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,234
Be good to your guests.

394
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,100
Especially the first one.

395
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,666
Who was the first guest here?

396
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,833
Old Mago said the first guest is
the most important guest.

397
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:58,533
I am yet to…

398
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,100
…guide the first guest to
the underworld.

399
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,434
No one here has yet

400
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,766
noticed his faint presence.

401
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:12,534
But how could that be possible,
when he's our guest?

402
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,666
I'm not an existence
who gives the answers.

403
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:17,066
I merely show you the end.

404
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,066
But first,

405
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,366
let's go catch that evil spirit.

406
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:58,500
From how it has the
symbol of the moon on it,

407
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:01,066
he obviously made it for you.

408
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,000
And you probably would've been
delighted, upon receiving this.

409
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,433
That's what I despise about you
the most.

410
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,900
When he comes,

411
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:35,500
I was going to throw him

412
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:37,533
into the hell called you
and perish you all together.

413
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,234
But now,
thanks to God's old trick,

414
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,533
I just can't do that anymore.

415
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,933
Because funnily enough,

416
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:55,033
I fell in love again.

417
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:01,866
And leaning on this love,

418
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:07,933
I tried my best to
ignore you, but...

419
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:14,433
There you go, dragging me
down to the abyss again.

420
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,900
I'm going to contain you in here,

421
00:37:29,266 --> 00:37:31,966
and shove this in
a trash can somewhere.

422
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:35,566
You'll rage and run wild.

423
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:41,700
Why don't we perish like that,
both of us?

424
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,833
Seol Ji-won, come on out.

425
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,966
I know you're hiding in here.

426
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,433
The Grim Reaper said
he's coming to get you.

427
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:56,966
There you are.

428
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,466
After all your showing off,
you've grown quite weak.

429
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:10,100
I've something to get rid of.

430
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,033
Take this, and feed off it.

431
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,700
Swallow it,

432
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,566
and become an evil spirit.

433
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:51,834
In the end, he chose to hide
where he originally was.

434
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,033
He lies in the dark, but will
show himself when he sees you.

435
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:13,133
Ms. Jang Man-wol, you're here too.

436
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,100
Yes, I came ahead.

437
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,066
Did you get him?

438
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:22,833
I let him go.

439
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:28,400
You're going to be in danger now.

440
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,800
Because to him,

441
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:34,133
I gave him a very special present.

442
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:40,733
You'll have to be tense up to
catch him now.

443
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,400
He's now so powerful that
he might just run wild.

444
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,466
What do you think you're doing?

445
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,866
Koo Chan-sung.

446
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,766
Old Mago says you're him.

447
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:08,966
I have to kill you,

448
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:11,833
but I just can't.

449
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,766
Because I like you too much.

450
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,466
But I won't protect you, either.

451
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,900
I've been waiting for over
a thousand years to kill you,

452
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:31,800
so if I protect you now…

453
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:34,800
What does that make me,
and my grudge?

454
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,267
Should that spirit
become an evil spirit…

455
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,833
You too, will perish, for
feeding power to him.

456
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:52,966
As you wish.

457
00:41:57,966 --> 00:42:00,900
Since the Old Magos dotes on you,

458
00:42:00,966 --> 00:42:02,900
they'll probably come forward
before you're harmed.

459
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,566
And…

460
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:08,900
…you'll perish?

461
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,800
In the end, I used you.

462
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:23,500
How sad that something like this
had to be love.

463
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:44,133
Ms. Jang Man-wol!

464
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,333
Ms. Jang Man-wol!

465
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,334
- What's wrong with the hotel?
- I don't know.

466
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,100
All the lights went off,
and there's a commotion.

467
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:23,034
Mr. Koo, did something happen to
President Jang?

468
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,734
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

469
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,634
Where is President Jang right now?

470
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,767
She went into the garden with
the luna tree,

471
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:30,466
and blocked the entrance.

472
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,000
No-one can enter now.

473
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:03,900
Let's first check the guest rooms.

474
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:05,933
Just what misfortune has
struck this place?

475
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,867
President Jang…

476
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:24,366
What exactly are you planning?

477
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,333
Is it true?

478
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,466
Am I that man from her past,

479
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:36,066
whom she hates so much?

480
00:44:37,033 --> 00:44:39,967
There's no way
my sister would've said that.

481
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:41,133
Because that man is…

482
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,733
…right here.

483
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,433
I'm sure you've met him, too.

484
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,366
How is that…

485
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:27,766
…that man?

486
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,100
This man is…

487
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:34,400
…the first guest of

488
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:36,366
Jang Man-wol's inn of the moon.

489
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:47,500
I must bring him to
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

490
00:45:47,566 --> 00:45:48,633
First,

491
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:52,833
shouldn't you stop her
from perishing?

492
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:58,000
Find what Jang Man-wol
fed to the evil spirit.

493
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,034
If that evil spirit does anything,

494
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,433
there is no going back.

495
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,667
Since we earned a little extra
from working overtime,

496
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:13,967
how about we all go for a drink?

497
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:15,966
- Sure.
- All right!

498
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:25,834
I hear he cursed his wife
so she may die.

499
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,334
What a trashy guy.

500
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,833
How shameless.

501
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,500
Hello.

502
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,767
Who…?

503
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,800
Leave this area. Quickly!

504
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,433
You're here, my friend.

505
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:44,900
I was going to see you after
being done with my hobby.

506
00:47:44,966 --> 00:47:46,400
I guess you were in a rush?

507
00:47:46,466 --> 00:47:47,800
How did you find me?

508
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:51,333
I found you thanks to what you
fed on, and its original owner.

509
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:54,867
Oh, this?

510
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:56,500
I came to get it back.

511
00:47:56,566 --> 00:47:57,834
So give it back.

512
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,533
How will you get it back?

513
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,533
Because you'll die, before then.

514
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,800
In the end…

515
00:48:16,766 --> 00:48:18,733
This is how you face me.

516
00:48:50,966 --> 00:48:52,700
You keep coming at me.

517
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:54,366
Shall we see how long
you can keep it up for?

518
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,033
I was only buying time until now.

519
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,433
But no need for that anymore.

520
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:01,900
The moon's rising.

521
00:49:09,633 --> 00:49:11,800
Why do you think that woman
gave you that?

522
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,633
I told you, she's my guardian.

523
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:17,966
Do you see the symbol of
the moon on there?

524
00:49:20,766 --> 00:49:22,300
Once the moon fully reveals itself,

525
00:49:22,366 --> 00:49:24,167
it'll be the end of you.

526
00:49:24,233 --> 00:49:25,567
Your tricks won't work.

527
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:27,600
I told you
that death isn't the end.

528
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,900
I tried to stop you, although
you chose death in the end.

529
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,533
And now, what awaits you is
an even bigger hell.

530
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,866
Goodbye, Seol Ji-won.

531
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:00,866
How dare you deceive me.

532
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:02,633
Just die!

533
00:50:10,266 --> 00:50:11,633
I never deceived you.

534
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:16,000
This really is the end for you.

535
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,967
I've done my share of
letting my hair down and wailing.

536
00:50:56,033 --> 00:50:58,834
There's 770 years
between us three!

537
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,500
You're a mere spirit
who died only yesterday,

538
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:03,433
so how dare you even try to
compare against us?

539
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,733
Take what you recovered,
and go to the hotel.

540
00:51:35,566 --> 00:51:37,000
I got him.

541
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:40,066
You snatched him with your finger
when we almost had him.

542
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,700
You fed that spirit a part of you to
turn him evil,

543
00:51:55,366 --> 00:51:57,733
so I cannot leave you
alone anymore.

544
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,133
I gave that evil spirit
the most terrible piece of me

545
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,133
from my abyss.

546
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,800
Then who are you, who stands here?

547
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,934
Are you the moon
shrouded in sadness,

548
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,367
who's sprouting leaves
and blossoming flowers

549
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,533
after time has started to
flow once more?

550
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:27,433
Make me perish.

551
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,733
No!

552
00:52:50,566 --> 00:52:51,800
I went and retrieved it.

553
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:54,467
There's no reason to
perish her anymore.

554
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:55,500
So please leave.

555
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:58,133
Just make me perish!

556
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:06,900
Fine.

557
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,533
Have your wish, then.

558
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,900
If you must sit at the
bottom of that abyss,

559
00:53:14,966 --> 00:53:17,433
I'll join you there.
I'll be that person.

560
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,633
Kill me.

561
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,700
I promised I'll remain next to you,

562
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,766
even if I end up dead by
involving myself.

563
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:43,866
That man you'd been waiting for…

564
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,466
He's really here.

565
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,534
You made it this far,

566
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,766
so hear him out about
what happened to

567
00:55:00,633 --> 00:55:01,600
that blood-stained moon.

568
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,533
That's the only way
you can truly empty your heart.

569
00:55:17,033 --> 00:55:19,466
Is this the underworld?

570
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:24,566
The underworld you'll be seeing
won’t be so grand like this.

571
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:26,867
But before you do depart,

572
00:55:26,933 --> 00:55:28,500
there are some people
you should meet.

573
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:30,334
Me?

574
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,766
Our guests have been
waiting for you.

575
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:37,933
And this is
our special service for them.

576
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:41,833
What is this cliched number?

577
00:55:42,866 --> 00:55:45,600
What, is this hell?

578
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:47,466
You'll know, once you enter.

579
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,500
Do you remember the last greeting

580
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:31,466
you said to us, as you murdered us?

581
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,366
Hello, Seol Ji-won.

582
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:58,066
We'll have to make those walls
more soundproof.

583
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,800
(We invite you to Hotel Del Luna
President Jang Man-wol)

584
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,666
Hotel Del Luna?

585
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,167
So this is where Mr. Koo
works at, did you say?

586
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:02,967
Yes.

587
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:05,600
Our president invited you,
Detective.

588
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:09,600
Oh, she also invited that doctor,
so come with her.

589
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,833
(We invite you to Hotel Del Luna
President Jang Man-wol)

590
00:58:19,366 --> 00:58:20,666
Jang Man-wol?

591
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:24,033
(We invite you to Hotel Del Luna
President Jang Man-wol)

592
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,634
- What is this?
- An invitation to a hotel.

593
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,867
My friend works there
so I've been there once,

594
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:29,000
and it's really nice.

595
00:58:29,066 --> 00:58:30,300
Where is it?

596
00:58:30,366 --> 00:58:32,367
Not everyone can go there.

597
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:36,033
It's a special hotel that's for
the invited only.

598
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:38,066
Very special.

599
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,733
Welcome.

600
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,966
Let me escort you to our pride,
the sky bar.

601
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,233
Wow.

602
00:58:59,966 --> 00:59:01,566
You came to this nice place,
all by yourself?

603
00:59:02,366 --> 00:59:03,534
Welcome.

604
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,534
We have seats for you inside.

605
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,633
This way, please.

606
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:09,100
This is Chwisaengmong,

607
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:11,800
which means, 'To dream of the past
life in your drunken stupor.'

608
00:59:11,866 --> 00:59:13,767
And I am the bartender here.

609
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:16,600
Tonight, God has given you
special permission to

610
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:18,434
have a taste of a moment

611
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,167
from your previous lives.

612
00:59:22,233 --> 00:59:23,167
Did you say God?

613
00:59:23,233 --> 00:59:26,000
I'm sure he means
it tastes that heavenly.

614
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,034
I blacked out then
so I don't really remember,

615
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,434
so this time,
I better take it slowly.

616
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Give it to us.

617
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,500
This is a flower petal.

618
00:59:47,566 --> 00:59:49,967
It's from a tree called
the luna tree.

619
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:51,767
Luna tree?

620
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:54,167
There's a tree called a luna tree?

621
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:56,100
Oh, I'm sure there is.

622
00:59:57,433 --> 00:59:58,733
Gosh, how pretty.

623
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,800
The people from your past
are here right now.

624
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,433
Through them,

625
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,833
I'm sure you'll be able to
hear his story.

626
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,100
Chung-myung.

627
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,466
Father is looking for you.

628
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,900
The Lord? About what?

629
01:01:14,966 --> 01:01:18,200
We received a tip-off that
you have been exchanging

630
01:01:18,266 --> 01:01:19,800
correspondences with the
rebel forces of Mt. Dongmo.

631
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:27,034
If you go as you are now,
you'll surely die.

632
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,133
That's why I sent my men.

633
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:33,566
To arrest the bandits that
you're waiting for now.

634
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:36,000
What do you mean?

635
01:01:36,066 --> 01:01:38,467
Those bandits are Goguryeo nomads.

636
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:40,734
If you arrest them and
present them to the Lord,

637
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,400
he will withdraw his suspicions.

638
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:47,000
They're harmless thieves who
only steal from wealthy merchants.

639
01:01:47,066 --> 01:01:49,267
If you die a traitor,

640
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:51,167
not only you and your men,

641
01:01:51,233 --> 01:01:54,466
but all immigrants in the castle
will be executed, too.

642
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,834
Even if their numbers
add up to be hundreds,

643
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,466
Father, who fears revolts,
will purge them all.

644
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,566
So go and arrest them.

645
01:03:10,566 --> 01:03:12,800
Why are you dragging away
the village people too,

646
01:03:12,866 --> 01:03:14,767
and not just those who thieved?

647
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,234
I'm not here to arrest thieves.

648
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,400
I'm here to extinguish
the rebel forces.

649
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:20,567
What?

650
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:23,700
I'll try my best so you may
survive, even as slaves.

651
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:24,934
But to do that…

652
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,900
You and your clique
must die as rebel forces.

653
01:03:27,966 --> 01:03:29,967
But why…

654
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:31,600
Why are you doing this?

655
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:37,066
I tried to search for a way to
be with you.

656
01:03:38,966 --> 01:03:42,533
Your new country on Mt. Dongmo that
you were headed to…

657
01:03:43,633 --> 01:03:45,366
I wanted to join you, too.

658
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:50,200
But I was found out,

659
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:52,000
and now I must try to cover it up,

660
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,800
at the cost of your lives.

661
01:03:55,733 --> 01:03:57,366
And once I manage to successfully,

662
01:03:58,466 --> 01:04:00,933
I will repay the debt with my life.

663
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,466
Don't repay us with your life,

664
01:04:08,966 --> 01:04:10,533
but save Man-wol.

665
01:04:11,133 --> 01:04:12,467
And to do that,

666
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:15,566
don't give her those excuses
you just gave me,

667
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,133
but be a traitor.

668
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:24,000
Then Man-wol will live.

669
01:04:36,766 --> 01:04:39,100
It was his promise with Yeon-woo.

670
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:54,033
He had been here all along.

671
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:05,900
Your first guest to
arrive at this inn of the moon,

672
01:05:05,966 --> 01:05:07,400
was him.

673
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:15,700
It wasn't only you
who remained here all this time,

674
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:18,500
repenting for your sin.

675
01:06:02,466 --> 01:06:04,366
Thanks to you,
I made a great contribution.

676
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,666
I'm going to kill you…

677
01:06:15,133 --> 01:06:16,966
I will kill you…

678
01:06:18,466 --> 01:06:19,800
…with my own hands.

679
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,566
If you are going to kill me,

680
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:28,966
then you should try
and be alive first.

681
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,833
Be a traitor.

682
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,400
Then Man-wol will live.

683
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:10,800
I've been waiting.

684
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:15,966
I hope there will be no hesitation
in your sword pointed at me.

685
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:18,933
Because then,

686
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,833
I too, will have no hesitation,

687
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:24,966
in jumping at your sword.

688
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,434
You never once

689
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,366
spoke his name.

690
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:14,066
If you call for him,

691
01:09:15,033 --> 01:09:16,866
he will show himself.

692
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:24,566
Have you been here all along?

693
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,966
Then show yourself,

694
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,633
Ko Chung-myung.

695
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,466
If there's any more you want to
say to me, go on.

696
01:10:52,466 --> 01:10:53,900
I'll hear you out.

697
01:10:56,433 --> 01:10:58,533
What more excuses do I have?

698
01:11:01,033 --> 01:11:02,100
Sister.

699
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,666
You said you'll watch me

700
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,133
in your last moments.

701
01:11:16,066 --> 01:11:20,400
While I was tied to the tree,
and my heart full of grudge…

702
01:11:21,533 --> 01:11:23,466
You were tied to those words

703
01:11:26,566 --> 01:11:28,500
and that's why you couldn't leave.

704
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:39,933
I…

705
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,100
I think my heart is all empty, now.

706
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:52,133
So you should stop here, too.

707
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:57,500
So this is…

708
01:12:01,433 --> 01:12:03,133
…truly the end for us.

709
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:09,766
Yes.

710
01:12:12,766 --> 01:12:14,100
This is the end.

711
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:48,333
This spirit has no power to
make it to the underworld.

712
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,800
Leave him here, and he will perish.

713
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:55,833
He won't have a chance at
his next life.

714
01:14:00,533 --> 01:14:02,366
So that this doesn't happen,

715
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,766
you send him off.

716
01:14:09,866 --> 01:14:14,467
That is the final price

717
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,433
you must pay for your sin.

718
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,900
Young-soo.

719
01:16:15,433 --> 01:16:16,700
Are you up?

720
01:16:17,966 --> 01:16:19,500
You two got so intoxicated that

721
01:16:19,566 --> 01:16:21,334
our general manager told me to
send you home.

722
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,800
That's why I called a taxi.

723
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:26,066
Since there's two of you, you can
make it back on your own, right?

724
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:27,700
Yes.

725
01:16:27,766 --> 01:16:28,933
Goodbye.

726
01:16:35,233 --> 01:16:37,100
Man, this happened again.

727
01:16:38,566 --> 01:16:40,600
The last time I was at this hotel,

728
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:43,367
she had to get a taxi for me, too.

729
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:46,633
At least this time,
I remember having a drink.

730
01:16:54,066 --> 01:16:55,867
Young-soo, why are you crying?

731
01:16:55,933 --> 01:16:58,633
I don't know, I just feel so sad.

732
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:04,833
Seeing you cry is
making me feel sad, too.

733
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,867
I feel really weird.

734
01:17:09,933 --> 01:17:11,600
Why are you crying when you have me?

735
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:13,633
Don't cry.

736
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:27,600
Does he really have
no intention to make up?

737
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:45,433
The day we first met is May 2.

738
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,433
I found it.

739
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,500
This watch looks really old.

740
01:18:23,566 --> 01:18:25,666
It's more than 70 years old.

741
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:28,734
It's been ticking ever since

742
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,167
you were alive.

743
01:18:31,233 --> 01:18:32,733
Something like this is really rare.

744
01:18:33,466 --> 01:18:35,466
I bet you went to great trouble
getting something like this.

745
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:37,500
Thank you.

746
01:18:38,766 --> 01:18:40,866
And I'm sorry.

747
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:47,867
I went to great lengths to get that,

748
01:18:47,933 --> 01:18:50,534
to let you know that
you're more than 70 years old.

749
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,834
So from now on,

750
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,567
even if my appearance ages
more than your sister…

751
01:18:57,633 --> 01:19:01,133
Don't you ever forget that
you're much older than me.

752
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,267
Put it on, then.

753
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:07,700
I bet it'll look really good on you.

754
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:10,933
Yu-na.

755
01:19:11,733 --> 01:19:14,566
I'll be leaving soon.

756
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,100
I told you that I'm waiting for
my sister Hyun-mi, right?

757
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,666
Well, Hyun-mi is
very sick right now.

758
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:30,866
And when she goes,
I have to go, too.

759
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,133
Yu-na.

760
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,666
I was already dead

761
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,900
even though this watch
kept on ticking.

762
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,467
My time can't flow the same way
as yours,

763
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:50,366
who's still alive.

764
01:19:56,233 --> 01:19:58,366
I'm starting to hate how…

765
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,466
I had to die, much before you.

766
01:20:26,366 --> 01:20:27,666
I'll drop him off, and come back.

767
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,433
You'll come back soon, right?

768
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:36,366
Of course, I'll come back soon.

769
01:20:57,433 --> 01:20:58,633
You are coming back, right?

770
01:21:06,633 --> 01:21:07,966
Wait for me.

771
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,866
(Styx)

772
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:10,366
(One month later)

773
01:22:23,466 --> 01:22:26,133
Ma'am, let me help you.

774
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,434
At the beach,

775
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,100
you may rent anything you wish.

776
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:35,267
Let's go.

777
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:37,033
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

778
01:22:45,033 --> 01:22:46,133
You've written a lot.

779
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,933
Will you take a look?

780
01:22:54,566 --> 01:22:58,967
It's been a month since
President Jang's departure.

781
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:00,633
President Jang's not here,

782
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,700
but why is the hotel
as it's always been?

783
01:23:03,766 --> 01:23:07,933
Because President Jang is no longer
the owner of this hotel,

784
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,800
is my prudent assumption.

785
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,500
Mr. Koo.

786
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:20,633
I think you should go
out into the garden.

787
01:23:28,466 --> 01:23:30,200
Even yesterday,

788
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:33,200
there were some leaves
and some flowers left.

789
01:23:33,266 --> 01:23:34,933
But now, there's nothing.

790
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:43,466
I guess our President is
not coming back.

791
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:23,700
Wait for me.

792
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:40,833
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

793
01:24:43,233 --> 01:24:44,466
Come back quick.

794
01:24:45,866 --> 01:24:46,966
Because I…

795
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,933
I'm starting to get anxious.

796
01:24:58,766 --> 01:25:02,433
All our employees are against
having a new president.

797
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,000
Please make
President Jang come back!

798
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,133
I'm against it, too!

799
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,000
It took me almost 500 years to
get used to Jang Man-wol.

800
01:25:14,066 --> 01:25:16,100
So a new president now? No, never!

801
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:22,200
Whether Jang Man-wol returns
or not is her decision.

802
01:25:22,266 --> 01:25:23,534
There is no way she won't return,

803
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,600
not after leaving Mr. Koo here.

804
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:30,000
If she has set foot on the bridge,

805
01:25:30,066 --> 01:25:31,900
she may have forgotten about him.

806
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:19,966
Laying down all her memories
from this place,

807
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:23,466
and guided by the most
distant memories…

808
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,800
She may just be
crossing that bridge.

809
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:38,834
Is that why all the flowers
have wilted?

810
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,566
So the tree is really dead now.

811
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,333
But then again,

812
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,966
the flowers have all wilted
and disappeared…

813
01:27:47,733 --> 01:27:52,100
It looks like Jang Man-wol is
really dead.

814
01:27:58,966 --> 01:28:01,800
Does that mean a new owner
will arrive to this lunar inn?

815
01:28:04,766 --> 01:28:09,267
The lunar tree is the owner of
this lunar inn.

816
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:12,000
But the leaves,
and the flowers, too…

817
01:28:12,066 --> 01:28:13,500
They have disappeared and died.

818
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:48,534
How did Kim Jun-hyun shove down
five of these at once,

819
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,367
when they're so hot?

820
01:28:50,433 --> 01:28:52,066
It's a wonder.

821
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:56,667
They say that's where he sat,

822
01:28:56,733 --> 01:28:58,066
so eat while it's still warm.

823
01:28:58,066 --> 01:28:59,334
(Where Kim Jun-hyun sat)

824
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,966
(To: Ms. Jang Man-wol
I love you)

825
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,567
"To Ms. Jang Man-wol, I love you?"

826
01:29:03,633 --> 01:29:04,700
You don't like it?

827
01:29:04,766 --> 01:29:05,867
Are you confessing your love to me?

828
01:29:05,933 --> 01:29:08,000
This is Kim Jun-hyun's autograph.
Kim Jun-hyun!

829
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:11,733
Just leaving you with petals
that'll soon fade away

830
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,700
is too tragic, so…

831
01:30:18,033 --> 01:30:22,366
Not all flowers have disappeared.

832
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,533
There's something that still remains.

833
01:30:38,033 --> 01:30:40,400
And in it, I left a flower

834
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:43,366
that dreams for the moon.
