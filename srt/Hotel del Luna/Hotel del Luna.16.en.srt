(Final Episode)

8
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,200
A young girl.

9
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,000
Her parents have long crossed the Styx,

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,160
so how did this little one hold out on her own?

11
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,920
I too, was surprised to find her still breathing

12
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,320
when I came to collect her.

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,520
We have a young soul, struggling to hold on??

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,440
Why don't you step back?

15
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,320
She won't even last a few more hours.

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,240
Who knows what fate may bring,

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,520
even in that short time?

18
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,800
Father, I see something over there.

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,520
Huh?

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,440
Whoa!

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,600
Tsk, tsk. Don't touch that.

22
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,280
These people are dead.

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,880
They must be the Goguryeo nomads.

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,400
I guess this is their tragic end after losing their nation.

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,040
Let's see??

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,520
Let's take this wagon for ourselves.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,920
We'll put it to good use. Tsk, tsk??

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She moved.

29
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,160
Can you see me?

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,520
You're still alive!

31
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,840
Don't be too sad.

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,760
I'm sure your parents have gone to the inn of the moon.

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,400
The medicine lady told me so.

34
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,800
That across the wilderness is the inn of the moon.

35
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,600
Dead people go there,

36
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,280
to have a good rest before continuing on.

37
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,120
What's your name?

38
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,680
Man-wol.

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,800
Meaning, the moon.

40
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,240
The full moon.

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,960
That's a pretty name.

42
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,800
Do you suppose

43
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,400
we ever came across each other in our previous lives?

44
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm from 1,300 years ago,

45
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,720
so how did I ever come to meet you?

46
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,480
With some people, you need to wait 1,300 years to meet them.

47
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,640
Did you know that it takes eons of time

48
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,520
before those stars can reach us?

49
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,840
The Orion Nebula is 1,300 light years away from our Earth.

50
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,160
In other words,

51
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,320
only after 1,300 years may we see it.

52
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Is that so?

53
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
Where is it now, then?

54
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,400
It's a winter constellation, so it's not visible now.

55
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,800
Winter??

56
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,640
From this full moon onward,

57
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,840
the power of the moon will diminish.

58
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,320
You will have no new guests walking into your premises.

59
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,680
You're telling me to close, in other words.

60
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
Until the next full moon,

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,240
is when your inn of the moon will stand.

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,760
Only visible in winter??

63
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,960
What a pity.

64
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,480
Koo Chan-sung, is there anything else we can see right now?

65
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,000
Well??

66
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,720
I'm not sure.

67
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,800
I'm not that knowledgeable in astrology, so that's all I know.

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
Ugh, you Harvard nerd.

69
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
Let's say you pointed to just anything and said,

70
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,000
'That one! That's also 1,300 light years away!'

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,160
Do you think I'd say, 'No, that's 500 light years away'?

72
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,960
I'd be like, 'Oh, really?'

73
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,920
Should I do that, then?

74
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,400
Let's see, then??How about I choose something

75
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,640
pretty and sparkling that you might like, then?

76
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,080
Whatever, it's too late.

77
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,360
There actually really is another star,

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,840
that took 1,300 light years to reach you.

79
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
Koo Chan-sung.

80
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,680
I told you my name means, "shining star," didn't I?

81
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,920
Alright, you'll do.

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,720
I don't need any stars that are only visible in winter.

83
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,200
As long as I have you.

84
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,600
Gosh, my Koo Chan-sung is so sparkling bright!

85
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,520
So blinding! So blinding!

86
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,560
Gosh, my Man-wol!

87
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,920
You're as bright as the moon!

88
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,080
The moon?

89
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
Let's say a ball of fortune, then.

90
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Since you've become so good.

91
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
Didn't you once say I'll end up a pork soup?

92
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
You once said you don't mind being chicken noodles.

93
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,960
What if I do end up as chicken noodles?

94
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,720
It's alright, I'll be that pickled radish on the side.

95
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,240
Really?

96
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,480
- Really? - Yes.

97
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,880
- You mean it, right? - Yes.

98
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,560
You really do promise that you'll be the pickled radish?

99
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
Yes, I'll be that pickled radish.

100
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,000
Did Mr. Kim go somewhere?

101
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,080
He stepped out after chatting with the guests over there.

102
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,920
Where did he go?

103
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,920
It's a novel about Kim Si-ik, the perverted scholar

104
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,520
whose acceptance into the government was revoked.

105
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,600
Let's just go,

106
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
before I face such shame again.

107
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,440
Let's promise each other to say goodbye before we leave.

108
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't ever leave without saying so, alright?

109
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,720
Gosh??

110
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,520
Goodness me.

111
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,520
President Jang, I don't see Mr. Kim anywhere.

112
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,840
I'm sure he's with Hyun-joong.

113
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,040
No, I looked everywhere in the hotel, but he's not here.

114
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
Maybe he stepped out for a while?

115
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Mr. Kim rarely steps out of the hotel.

116
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,120
Even if he does, he never goes alone.

117
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,240
Just from the way he talks,

118
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,640
you know he's still stuck in the Joseon Dynasty.

119
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,080
Apparently, he was chatting with some guests at the bar

120
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,520
about a scholar who came first in the state examinations

121
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,720
when his face turned ghastly pale and he left abruptly.

122
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
A scholar who came first in the state examinations?

123
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,120
President Jang, you know his full name, don't you?

124
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,480
By any chance, is his full name??

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
Kim Si-ik?

126
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,360
Who are these guests who've been

127
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
blabbering about our Mr. Kim?

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,640
We'd been talking about how I died before

129
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,080
publishing my novel about the scholar Kim Si-ik.

130
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,800
And do the contents of this novel mock him?

131
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,400
It's a work of fiction, based on thorough historical facts.

132
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,280
And that novel will come out into the world, will it?

133
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,920
I'd sent my draft to my publishing agent.

134
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,120
So they should release it posthumously.

135
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,960
Which publishing agent did you send it to?

136
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,120
And how many have seen it?

137
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,400
I??still write my works with pen and paper,

138
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,360
so there's just one copy.

139
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm sure only the editor-in-chief has seen it so far.

140
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,400
Publishing agent??

141
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,360
His handwriting hasn't improved one bit.

142
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,160
Ugh, my eyes.

143
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,720
(Kim Si-ik, the Perverted Scholar)

144
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
Did I turn on the air conditioner?

145
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,160
I'm not a perverted scholar.

146
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,280
This is slander.

147
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
First, let's try and buy that manuscript with money.

148
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,320
If we use the money from selling the horses, I'm sure it'll work out.

149
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm worried Mr. Kim may try and do something before then.

150
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,560
Because even if it's Mr. Kim??

151
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,680
The Grim Reaper won't forgive him if he harms someone.

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,280
Our Mr. Kim is a crane.

153
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,120
Have you ever seen a crane pick at anyone?

154
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,680
He doesn't have it in him to hurt anyone.

155
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,040
But he harbors a grudge of 500 years.

156
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,720
A crane may stand in mud,

157
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,000
but still guard its white feathers unsoiled.

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,080
Mr. Kim had been waiting 500 years to

159
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,960
cleanse his tainted reputation.

160
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,640
I am Kim Si-ik.

161
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,480
I am not a perverted man.

162
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,760
I guess I scared him too much.

163
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,080
All I wanted for him was not to publish that book.

164
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,840
Should I have kept it to a minimum?

165
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,600
Editor-in-Chief.

166
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,560
What's the matter?

167
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,720
- I saw a ghost. - What?

168
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,680
I saw Kim Si-ik just now!

169
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,000
Hold on??doesn't that mean this will be a hit?

170
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This novel's going to be a hit!

171
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
Editor-in-Chief.

172
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,320
- I was shit scared, you know. - What an auspicious dream!

173
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,760
What auspicious dream? I really saw him, for real!

174
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,120
- Shall we all go for a drink, then? - Let's do that!

175
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,040
Mr. Kim.

176
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,920
Mr. Koo. President Jang. You knew?

177
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,560
Look at you, it's pathetic.

178
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,120
Let's first go back to the hotel.

179
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm so ashamed that I just cannot go back there anymore.

180
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,040
Let me just go to the nearby station and board the bus to the underworld.

181
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,600
What's up with you, Mr. Kim?

182
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,440
You're the most refined crane at our hotel!

183
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,960
And cranes don't stoop to anyone.

184
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,120
So chin up!

185
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,080
I will try my best to

186
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,680
retrieve that manuscript somehow.

187
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,520
Mr. Koo??

188
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,440
You won't go to the hotel no matter what,

189
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,480
so stay at Koo Chan-sung's.

190
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,960
Thank you, Mr. Koo.

191
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,960
Only the Editor-in-Chief has seen this novel so far,

192
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,160
and even he too, hasn't finished reading it.

193
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,880
Because the author is a best-selling author,

194
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,440
I only just managed to convince him.

195
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,000
How did you convince him?

196
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,800
I told him I was your descendent.

197
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,480
Koo Chan-sung changed his family name for you,

198
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,120
and I bought this with a hefty sum.

199
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,040
Thank you so much.

200
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,840
"Kim Si-ik, the Perverted Scholar??

201
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,000
I guess this name will forever follow me.

202
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,440
If you've been wronged, then explain yourself.

203
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,040
Will you tell us what had happened exactly?

204
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,160
I passed the lower state examinations at a young age,

205
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,720
and was hailed a child genius.

206
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,800
However, my attempts at the higher exams were always unsuccessful.

207
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,160
After I reached the age of forty,

208
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,120
I left my hometown and settled in Hanyang,

209
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
and dedicated all my time to my studies.

210
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,640
The only joy in my lonely pursuit of knowledge

211
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,480
was watching the everyday people in their everyday lives.

212
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,120
I'd see a young girl, tending to her blind father,

213
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,720
and brothers who'd bicker day and night.

214
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,640
Then there was the young couple who were in love,

215
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,440
despite the difference in their social classes.

216
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,480
Whenever I got tired from poring into my textbooks,

217
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,000
I'd write stories based on what I saw earlier that day.

218
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,560
Sir, this is just too sad.

219
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
What happens next?

220
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,400
Of course, at that time

221
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,640
it did no good to a scholar's reputation to

222
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,000
write texts other than in Chinese characters.

223
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,480
However, those stories I wrote were not perverted stories at all.

224
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,600
Mr. Kim, those stories that you wrote about

225
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,120
a filial daughter, virtuous woman and two brothers??

226
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,960
They're the tales of Shimcheong, Chunhyang,

227
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,160
and Heungbu and Nolbu?

228
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,520
You wrote all that?

229
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,640
They say the author remains anonymous, but??

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,160
If this is true, then you're like the Shakespeare of Joseon Dynasty!

231
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,360
However, they ended up ruining everything,

232
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,040
just when I was at the epitome of my life.

233
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,600
Congratulations, sir!

234
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,680
Now you can return home in glory.

235
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,120
Kim Si-ik's order of first merit has been revoked.

236
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,280
What do you mean?

237
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,160
These are the stories you wrote, are they not?

238
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,400
How could a scholar write such lowly tales about commoners

239
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,160
and distribute them wide and far?

240
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160
It is a disgrace upon us all!

241
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,360
All of us Sungkyunkwan scholars will step forward to bar the

242
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,360
appointment of such perverted, vulgar man! Into office!

243
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,080
These are just tales of everyday people and their lives,

244
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,160
What is so vulgar about them?

245
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,400
A tale of a secret love affair between a man and a woman!

246
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,920
A tale of two brothers who disrespect their natural hierarchy!

247
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,160
Tales that mislead the public with hollow delusions!

248
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,120
How could a scholar write such tales?

249
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,600
Sirs! Good sirs!

250
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,400
Kim Si-ik!

251
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,880
If you have any shame,

252
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,520
do not dare to hold your head up high.

253
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,080
My appointment into office was revoked due to

254
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,640
my fellow scholars' appeal,

255
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,400
and the son of an influential officer at that time

256
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,720
took my spot instead.

257
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,080
Back in my hometown, my father passed away

258
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,880
after refusing to eat or drink because of his shameful son.

259
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,920
And I couldn't face my wife who had suffered all these years, alone.

260
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,160
Now, unable to stay or return to my hometown,

261
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,720
I wandered about until I finally met my death.

262
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,680
But these are all false accusations, I tell you!

263
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,720
He said at first, he waited for the world to forget about

264
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,040
those stories which were his greatest shame.

265
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,720
But instead, those tales became more and more popular as time passed.

266
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,360
There isn't anyone who hasn't heard of Chunhyang and Shimcheong.

267
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
Maybe he'd secretly got his hopes up, too.

268
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,680
Of not only recovering his tainted reputation,

269
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,960
but have pride in his work.

270
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,960
But there's no evidence whatsoever.

271
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,440
Do you all believe Mr. Kim's words, 100 percent?

272
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,000
See, that's why this book has come to be.

273
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,120
There's no way of knowing what exactly wrote,

274
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,040
so he ended up becoming the perverted scholar

275
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,760
whose admission into office was cancelled for

276
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,440
writing vulgar, perverted stories.

277
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,400
I'll look through this thoroughly.

278
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,080
Is Mr. Kim alright?

279
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,760
He's going to be staying at my place for awhile.

280
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,160
Sanchez??

281
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,080
We've been acquainted at our company dinner.

282
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,640
Yes, and what brings you here at our place?

283
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,720
It's a bit of a story, but Mr. Koo has kindly taken me in.

284
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, I see.

285
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,480
Then is he also from your hotel as well?

286
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,680
No, he's the Grim Reaper.

287
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,240
He's not someone a living person ever has the chance to meet.

288
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,560
Say hello.

289
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,920
He's not here because he has business with me, right?

290
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,080
No.

291
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,160
I'm here to comfort a long friend.

292
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,520
He bought some beer for us.

293
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,160
Would you like to join us?

294
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,400
No, please. I'm fine.

295
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,920
- Sorry to intrude on you. - No.

296
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,040
- Sir. - Yes?

297
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,080
We had no snacks, so took some dates from your garden.

298
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,800
When we do meet again,

299
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,720
I will repay this debt.

300
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,640
I have some peanuts... Should I bring you some?

301
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,680
Wait just a minute.

302
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,800
I never knew this about Kim Si-ik,

303
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,480
I must admit I'll be a bit sorry,

304
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,440
but I have no intention to publish that story

305
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,160
at the sake of Scholar Kim's 500-year grudge.

306
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,080
Let me get rid of it.

307
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,480
It'll be a waste to get rid of it.

308
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,960
My general manager has had a read through it,

309
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,320
and he tells me it's quite entertaining.

310
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,000
Without the adjective "perverted" next to him,

311
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,040
Kim Si-ik was described as a rather charming article.

312
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,000
A virtuous scholar who was not swept away by the

313
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,600
power struggle between the Hungu and the Sarim factions,

314
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,440
and a romantic who'd write to his wife back at home

315
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,840
once a month. It's quite impressive, really.

316
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,520
Those are the facts. That's who Kim Si-ik was.

317
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,080
So let's just amend this bit here

318
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,400
about Kim Si-ik straying from the path to success,

319
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,640
and shutting himself from the world

320
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,680
to indulge in perverted, vulgar stories.

321
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,120
Although we can't write in a historical work,

322
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,040
'The author of all those Korean folk tales is,

323
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,720
in fact, Kim Si-ik,'

324
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,360
this could still be interesting for a fictional work.

325
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes.

326
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,080
There's even a novel that describes Sin Yun-bok as a woman.

327
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,120
Anything's possible in novels.

328
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,520
Then there we go!

329
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Joseon Dynasty's greatest romantic,

330
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,080
and a genius storyteller:

331
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,160
Kim Si-ik, the virtuous crane.

332
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,080
Crane? A title just came to my mind.

333
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,880
'The Song of the Crane,' to continue the legacy of

334
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,040
my most acclaimed work, 'War of the Cranes.'

335
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,920
'The Song of the Crane!' Let's sing that song, then.

336
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,120
Please do write something great for us.

337
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,840
Oh what?

338
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,040
The Song of the Crane! The Song of the Crane!

339
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,080
Come on, we need to start singing that song!

340
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,840
This is a trait we've often observed in those who died from overwork.

341
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,080
I'd forgotten that our author here passes out in 30 seconds

342
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,720
when he holds a pen.

343
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,480
What?

344
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,000
If he's going to pass out every 30 seconds,

345
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,080
when's he going to finish writing that story?

346
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,240
We'll have to seek help from another writer.

347
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,440
What?

348
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,120
Which other writer?

349
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,120
At our hotel is a writer who wanted to die from overwork

350
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,800
but who didn't.

351
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,120
Sir, from what we've observed to date,

352
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,680
your writing is exceptional.

353
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:18,360
You just haven't been able to decide on what to write.

354
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,440
We have a great character, and a great mentor ready for you.

355
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,000
So would you like to try writing a complete novel?

356
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,040
Then??I will remain as a fictional character, will I?

357
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,120
All there is in the records about Kim Si-ik is,

358
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,000
"Had his admission into office revoked for writing vulgar stories."

359
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,560
Just that one line.

360
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,840
You can wait another 500 years, but it won't change.

361
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,560
Is that so?

362
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,920
However, the fact that you were a loving husband

363
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,800
and a virtuous scholar isn't fictional.

364
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,560
I don't think it's all that bad,

365
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,640
being remembered with a fictional work.

366
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,080
You might be right.

367
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,320
Plus??this is a novel, right?

368
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,360
So while we're at it, let's say Kim Si-ik was a tall, handsome man.

369
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,800
I mean, who cares right?

370
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,720
Is there anyone you think who resembles you?

371
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,280
There is a fellow who I thought highly resembles me??

372
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,760
Yes, who? Who?

373
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,680
The youth of this generation call him,

374
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Mr. Charisma.

375
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
So Ji-sub?

376
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,000
Are you saying you look like So Ji-sub?

377
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,560
Ugh, I really??

378
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,000
think you do look like him!

379
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,880
Yes, you do!

380
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,520
You can definitely tell, from this side.

381
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,240
Gosh, yes! You're right.

382
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,040
Turn a bit that way. A little more!

383
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,640
Yes, there we go!

384
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,160
Look at the resemblance! You both have black hair.

385
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,720
Mr. Kim, you're really like a virtuous crane!

386
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,840
Kim Si-ik even does martial arts?

387
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,000
This is pretty awesome.

388
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,160
Hey, I think they glamorized his image too much here.

389
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
This will be a hit.

390
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,360
President Jang! Mr. Koo!

391
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,040
The last chapter has just been finished.

392
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,960
Let's see??

393
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,080
Wow.

394
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,160
Wow!

395
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,200
This is good stuff.

396
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,840
Editor-in-Chief.

397
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,120
There's a nice story I once received from a budding writer.

398
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,600
Look inside the second drawer in my study.

399
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,640
The story is about Kim Si-ik, a scholar from the Joseon Dynasty,

400
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,000
and the author's name is Bae Seong-hoon.

401
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,560
Yes, yes.

402
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,640
Alright.

403
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,600
(The Song of the Crane)

404
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,040
The book has been successfully published,

405
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,120
and our two guests have departed with a smile.

406
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,080
And these are cocktails I've made for you,

407
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,200
to express my gratitude to you all.

408
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
Please enjoy.

409
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,280
I told you, 'Tears' is not really for me.

410
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,680
But this 'Tears' is a special one, so please have a sip.

411
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,640
What sort of 'Tears' is it, this time?

412
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,560
Tears of farewell.

413
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,440
I, Kim Si-ik, a scholar of Joseon Dynasty

414
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,720
was finally able to clear my tainted reputation.

415
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,080
So, with this drink of farewell with my good friends,

416
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,040
I now intend to depart to the underworld.

417
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,040
Mr. Kim??

418
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,000
Let's swallow back our tears with this drink,

419
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,560
and say our farewells.

420
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,520
Thank you all, for everything so far.

421
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,080
Thank you for putting up with me. I apologize for leaving first.

422
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,560
Goodbye, Mr. Kim.

423
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,720
Even after 70 years, you're still a kid.

424
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,960
Goodbye.

425
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,160
Let's go, then.

426
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,520
(The Styx)

427
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,640
Goodbye.

428
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,040
President Jang.

429
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Thank you for guarding my name and honor,

430
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,600
so I may be remembered as a mysterious scholar, like the crane.

431
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,440
These are my tears of gratitude for you.

432
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,400
I hope your cold, icy moon

433
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,680
sets with a beautiful warm, moonset.

434
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,760
It really tastes awful.

435
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,040
Why won't you come to the hotel these days?

436
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,920
Why should I, when it's going to disappear soon?

437
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,480
I assumed you would've left too, if Hyun-mi did,

438
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,920
so just came to check.

439
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,080
Mr. Kim left.

440
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,520
See? You feel sad now that he's left, aren't you?

441
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,680
Well, I think I'm going to be sad when you leave, too.

442
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,880
Can't you just tell me you won't leave? Please?

443
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,000
Although it was heartbreaking having to say farewell,

444
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,040
we all watched Mr. Kim depart with happy hearts.

445
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,440
Because we knew it would be sadder if he didn't.

446
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,560
How is it sad, when we can continue to be together?

447
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,000
Look at me and Hyun-mi.

448
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,120
Do you want that to be the future for us?

449
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,040
Fine, go.

450
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,560
But I can't watch you go.

451
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,440
Kim Yu-na's parents keep suggesting I go study abroad,

452
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,040
and I think I'll take them up on their offer.

453
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,480
Well, this is great.

454
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,040
You can go to the underworld, and I'll go abroad to study.

455
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,680
Let's just leave behind our grave here,

456
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,520
and say goodbye.

457
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Thank you.

458
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,560
Excuse me, um??

459
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,120
I saw you standing outside from time to time.

460
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Are you from my child's father's family?

461
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,120
I was once the daughter-in-law of the Yoon family.

462
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,080
When my child is born,

463
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
his or her surname won't be Yoon.

464
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,080
It'll be my surname.

465
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,080
But if it's a son,

466
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,080
he'll be their only heir to continue the family line.

467
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,920
And if it's a daughter, she's not their family?

468
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,600
Daughters don't continue the family, no.

469
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,960
Because once they get married, she joins her husband's...

470
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,000
Are you from the Joseon Dynasty?

471
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,560
No-one thinks like that nowadays.

472
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,720
If my child's grandparents want to see their grandchild,

473
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,080
I'll let them.

474
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,440
But regardless of whether it's a boy or a girl,

475
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,040
this baby is my child,

476
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,520
and my bloodline.

477
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,560
What's the matter?

478
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,880
Why was I??

479
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,400
Why was I never able to

480
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,600
see my daughter in that way?

481
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,760
I'm ridden with guilt??

482
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,000
I just hope this child,

483
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,160
I just hope that this child, your baby,

484
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,120
will be born healthy and live a good life.

485
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,960
And this, too.

486
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,080
(Eat Till You Drop)

487
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,960
Look.

488
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,480
Between this one,

489
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,600
and that one, which should I upload?

490
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,760
I think this one.

491
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,080
This one? Okay!

492
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,400
You always take photos so diligently but do you even have any followers?

493
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,800
Of course.

494
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,840
Hyun-joong, Yu-na, and Sanchez.

495
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
That's it?

496
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,040
Hey, I think the boiled egg on yours is much prettier.

497
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,200
With all your snapping away,

498
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,760
I thought you had something like a million followers!

499
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,040
If you're going to laugh, press like before you do.

500
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,120
I don't do social media.

501
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,040
Sir Alex Ferguson once said this about social media.

502
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,120
I'm not hearing it!

503
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,560
I bet he said something cocky again.

504
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,560
But that's his opinion, because I??

505
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,080
What? What is it this time?

506
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
He??

507
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
He pressed like.

508
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,520
Who did? Sanchez?

509
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,640
Kim??

510
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,000
Kim Jun-hyun??

511
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,640
Kim Jun-hyun, he??

512
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
The picture of seasoned thistle with rice, that I took.

513
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,480
Look here. He pressed like!

514
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,000
(Kim Jun-hyun Follow)

515
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,040
You're right.

516
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,680
But you have just three followers,

517
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,080
so how did Kim Jun-hyun ever come across your post?

518
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,440
I??I really have no regrets.

519
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,160
I have just gained recognition from the Gourmet himself!

520
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,600
Since when were you so into Kim Jun-hyun?

521
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,680
Hmmm?

522
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,240
I just liked him the moment I saw him.

523
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,800
He looked very much like someone I knew.

524
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,080
When life was hard because of my unhealthy pastime,

525
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,040
out of the blue, my savior appeared and rescued me with a game of baduk

526
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,440
and suggested I go on restaurant tours instead.

527
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,960
And he looked just like Kim Jun-hyun.

528
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
That's me.

529
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,160
What do you mean?

530
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,560
I told you I went to Manwoldang 200 years ago.

531
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,840
For the lunar herbs.

532
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,120
It was me who won that baduk game, and drew you

533
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,680
- a map of delicacies. - Don't make me laugh.

534
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,080
I remember him clearly. He had a buff build and

535
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,120
had gentle eyes, like Kim Jun-hyun. He was so sweet, too!

536
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,480
Even if you try, you're not half the man he is.

537
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,720
That wasn't funny!

538
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,120
Ha??

539
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,480
So that's how Old Mago manipulated your memory.

540
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,360
Looking back,

541
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,040
we've been to many good places together, haven't we?

542
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,440
And they were all really good, too.

543
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,800
There's something you need to have for me, at the very end.

544
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,080
Promise me you'll have it no matter what.

545
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,120
Promise.

546
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,000
Let's eat, these cold noodles are going to get cold.

547
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,960
Sure, let's eat them before they get cold.

548
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,960
Ah??do you want mustard?

549
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,800
Kim Jun-hyun said it's vinegar, not mustard for these noodles.

550
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,840
Didn't Baek Jong-won say that?

551
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,160
Did he?

552
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,040
You really are 1,300 years old.

553
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,920
You're even getting your idol's words mixed up.

554
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,520
- How much should I add? A little? - Just a bit.

555
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,120
Looks delicious.

556
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,040
You're not going to add any?

557
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,400
First, you should always taste the broth.

558
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,480
That leaves just you, Ms. Choi, to oversee the rooms.

559
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,840
It's alright, most of our guests have left anyway.

560
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,160
Thank you for your work so far.

561
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,120
- We'll be off, then. - Alright.

562
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,040
Ms. Choi.

563
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,360
Yes?

564
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,320
I, have to go for Hyun-mi soon.

565
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,160
Tae-seok called me.

566
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,880
Bring your sister here.

567
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,640
I'll let President Jang know.

568
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,760
Hyun-mi, your brother's here.

569
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,160
Hyun-joong!

570
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,520
Hyun-mi??

571
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,920
Hyun-joong!

572
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,560
Do you know just how long I've waited for you?

573
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,000
Let's go.

574
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,960
Yu-na??

575
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,600
So you're Hyun-joong's sister, Ji Hyun-mi.

576
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,480
Thanks to your kind brother,

577
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
you won't get lost on your way.

578
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,160
What about Yu-na?

579
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,960
Does she know you're leaving, Hyun-joong?

580
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,080
I saw her at the hospital just now.

581
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,640
Could you pass this on to Yu-na for me?

582
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,600
And??

583
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,000
Please tell her that every minute and every second

584
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
she has left is precious,

585
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,960
so tell her to go to school,

586
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,560
and be happy.

587
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
Granny!

588
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,120
Granny!

589
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,880
I'm ready to give up all my time,

590
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,520
if you'll grant me one wish.

591
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,480
Ji Hyun-joong!

592
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,040
Take this with you.

593
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,120
You brought flowers to my grave, didn't you?

594
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,560
So I got these for you.

595
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,440
I owe a lot to Old Mago

596
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,160
for these flowers now, you know.

597
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,080
She said in order to repay her,

598
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,280
I have to live my life to the fullest.

599
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,800
So don't you worry about me and go.

600
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,080
Thank you.

601
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,920
I won't worry about you, then.

602
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,080
Goodbye, Ji Hyun-joong.

603
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,640
Goodbye.

604
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,040
Why do you want to meet Mi-ra's parents?

605
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,520
You sound like you're about to get married.

606
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,080
We are??

607
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,160
getting married this winter.

608
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,640
Then??this is going to be an important occasion.

609
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,840
I think it's strange you want to meet them at a pizza place.

610
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,680
Because you're here, Sanchez.

611
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,680
My parents trust you deeply, Sanchez.

612
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,440
When my parents came for me in the States,

613
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,120
all my friends covered up for me

614
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,960
except you. You practically told on me.

615
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,080
That's when you scored big time with them, for being honest.

616
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,400
Well, I appreciate they have a good opinion of me,

617
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,240
but I'm not sure how that comes into this.

618
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,080
Well, if my parents don't like Young-soo all that much,

619
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,640
you need to help him.

620
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,000
Why should I, when it's you two who are getting married?

621
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,200
I'm not Young-soo's brother.

622
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,120
I have no other family,

623
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,840
so Mi-ra is a bit worried.

624
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,160
Sanchez, tell them you're like his brother.

625
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,160
Tell them what a great man Young-soo is.

626
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,520
You know, feed it to them!

627
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,040
Actually, why not just tell them that I'm pregnant?

628
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,880
But I'm not a gynecologist. I just own a pizza place!

629
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,920
Why are you doing this to me? You sure are strange.

630
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,680
Mi-ra, we shouldn't lie to your parents like that.

631
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,840
If they do oppose,

632
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,720
I'll just take my time to convince them.

633
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,080
It's that I hate you seeing all lonely at all??

634
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,720
So I want to be your family.

635
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,840
Mi-ra??

636
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,120
Those two will be getting married this winter with no problems at all.

637
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,880
You and I are so different when it comes to fridges.

638
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,840
It's better to have a bigger freezer!

639
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,680
There's so much to freeze and store for later, you know.

640
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,000
You always freeze things but never go back to them.

641
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,520
Let's just buy a big refrigerator and eat fresh.

642
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,840
Honey,

643
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,440
will it be the refrigerator or me?

644
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,800
The size of our freezer will be a measure of how much you love me.

645
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,000
My love for you is as big as the north pole.

646
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,160
So let's buy the one with a big refrigerator.

647
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,120
Done!

648
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,000
Whatever, I'm going to look at the furniture now.

649
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,120
Stop right there!

650
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,960
Ms. Jang Man-wol?

651
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,640
So you're getting married?

652
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,080
Did Chan-sung tell you?

653
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,160
Where is he? Did you guys come together?

654
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,080
He's gone to buy some milk tea.

655
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,120
So are you getting married or what?

656
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,640
Yes, this winter.

657
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,000
I'll send you an invite.

658
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,720
I'd like to give you a gift before then.

659
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
For me?

660
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,960
I wanted to give you something

661
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,440
which will always be in your memory.

662
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
Here, take a look at this.

663
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,120
Song-hwa.

664
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,680
Song-hwa.

665
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,120
Be good to Yeon-woo.

666
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,080
If you ever make him cry,

667
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,720
I'm going to twist your head like that, alright?

668
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,120
Do you like it?

669
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,600
Uh??yes.

670
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,040
This is my wedding gift for you.

671
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,000
Remember what I said, whenever you see it.

672
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,560
What did you say to Mi-ra?

673
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,800
Just??

674
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,160
To have a happy marriage, with their TV.

675
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,040
You gave Mi-ra a wedding gift?

676
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,040
Yes.

677
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,080
She says the wedding's in the winter,

678
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,040
but I won't be able to give her a gift then.

679
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,000
Because I won't be around.

680
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,160
Ms. Choi says she's leaving today.

681
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,680
It'll be the full moon soon.

682
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,040
Until the next full moon,

683
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,000
is when your inn of the moon will stand.

684
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,160
Your hands are cold.

685
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,840
Should I get you something warm?

686
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,080
No, this is nice. It feels like winter.

687
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,680
So why did you buy them a TV, as their wedding gift?

688
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,000
Well, the TV would rotate like this.

689
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,480
What about that?

690
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,680
Oh, nothing.

691
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,840
You??remember Yeon-woo, don't you?

692
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,120
Who is Yeon-woo?

693
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,720
The person who loves you the most is no longer Yeon-woo.

694
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,640
I know.

695
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,520
It's Ms. Choi.

696
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,040
Now the rooms are all vacant.

697
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,720
I'll be going ahead first, President Jang.

698
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,160
Thank you for letting me stay here

699
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,600
and for protecting me.

700
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,160
It's thanks to you, Ms. Choi,

701
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,120
that I was able to realize something big,

702
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,160
at the most important time.

703
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,800
So thank you.

704
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,520
Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

705
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,120
It was me who suggested we put you into room 13.

706
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,160
It's always bothered me,

707
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,920
so I'm sorry.

708
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,640
That's alright.

709
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,120
If I hadn't gone in there that day,

710
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,200
I wouldn't have the first second of what I have now.

711
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,480
Even if you ended up gaining a whole lifetime,

712
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,600
don't you ever show up in that tiger suit again.

713
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,160
It'll make you lose everything.

714
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,920
I'll take that to heart.

715
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,080
President Jang.

716
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,040
Now that this moment is finally here,

717
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,880
I'm reminded of when I'd first arrived at Manwoldang.

718
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,160
Where are you off to?

719
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,560
Do you plan to slaughter that family,

720
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,560
with that sword you sneaked out from here?

721
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,840
My daughter??

722
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,160
The man who killed his own child,

723
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,640
must have a son.

724
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,040
You won't kill many with that sword.

725
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,920
But with this, you might just succeed.

726
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,840
After that, get caught and perish as you wish.

727
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,720
Because you know it's you who you want to kill the most,

728
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,800
for failing to protect your most precious treasure.

729
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,000
You don't even wish to have a good rest here,

730
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,160
before moving onto a new life.

731
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,080
You hate yourself to death,

732
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,040
so even if it were offered to you, you'd throw it in the dumps.

733
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,800
Perhaps, you may be

734
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,480
most suited to working here at

735
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,960
the inn for the dead.

736
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,000
Because what you wish for is eternal death.

737
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,840
Is it the same for you?

738
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,120
That's probably why God tied me here,

739
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,640
because I was able to see through you.

740
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,720
I think it was from then on,

741
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,680
that I looked to you while waiting for revenge,

742
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:19,520
but at the same time, hoping you'll never change.

743
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,720
Who knew that both of us, each with our own hell,

744
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,800
would be able to depart with a smile, right?

745
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,120
It's a great relief.

746
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,160
Since this is a happy occasion, let's not ruin it by crying.

747
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,680
I leave with joy.

748
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,720
Then??

749
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,440
Ms. Choi.

750
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,880
Can I??

751
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,120
hold you just once?

752
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,160
I tried so hard not to cry,

753
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,040
so why did you have to make me cry?

754
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,880
Many times I pitied you,

755
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:10,120
and many times I wanted to hold you like this, just this once.

756
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,600
You've comforted me many times already, Ms. Choi.

757
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,760
Thank you.

758
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,080
How much time do we have left?

759
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,080
Tonight, on the night of the full moon,

760
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,720
all the powers of Del Luna will be retrieved.

761
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,080
Everything will disappear,

762
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,120
and Jang Man-wol must leave.

763
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,240
I've always wanted to ask.

764
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,960
Why me?

765
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,160
Why did you choose me?

766
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,400
The flower that dreams of the moon

767
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,560
has still left that last dream behind.

768
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,680
Now I'm all alone,

769
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,000
just like in the very beginning.

770
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,080
President Jang, I wasn't dozing!

771
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,880
I only closed my eyes briefly and my knees gave in??

772
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,120
That was a lie. I'm sorry.

773
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,000
Looks like we have a guest. You should go to your office.

774
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,040
Welcome.

775
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,800
How long has it been since your death?

776
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,600
Let me show you the way.

777
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,920
This way, please.

778
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,160
President Jang.

779
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,360
The guest in room 603 was due to board the bus today,

780
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,040
but she wants just one more day.

781
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:52,040
And this is the steamed bun that room 1120 requested.

782
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,080
He said he misses the steamed buns from his childhood.

783
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,800
I'll bring them up, then.

784
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,480
President Jang.

785
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,960
I just came up with a new recipe. Would you like to have a taste?

786
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,800
At least have a whiff.

787
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,920
Isn't this a beautiful color?

788
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,680
How is this the color of mop water?

789
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,600
And be honest with me. Have you ever mopped in your life?

790
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,600
Don't go just yet!

791
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,160
I'll bring some mop water, so let's compare the two.

792
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,520
Wait right there!

793
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,800
Koo Chan-sung is here to

794
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,720
send off his very last guest.

795
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,040
Koo Chan-sung.

796
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,000
I've been feeling very sleepy.

797
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,160
I'm dozing off.

798
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:06,960
Is it so I can depart, like in my dreams?

799
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,760
Even if you do fall asleep, I'll stay by your side.

800
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,960
Right now,

801
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,080
I just crossed eons of time

802
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:12,760
and embraced a flower that dreams of the moon,

803
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,440
to meet you.

804
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,080
The full moon.

805
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,160
That's a pretty name.

806
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,600
That across the wilderness is the inn of the moon.

807
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,120
You're still here.

808
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,120
Because this place is still here.

809
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,720
What brings you here?

810
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,080
There's this pair of scissors I lent to a bride

811
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,080
some time ago, right here.

812
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,520
Do you remember them?

813
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,000
You'd come here to tell her that it takes greater love to

814
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,120
let go, than hold on.

815
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,480
That's right!

816
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,600
But you know, I completely forgot to take those scissors back!

817
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,120
I have them with me.

818
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,360
Oh my!

819
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,080
Thank goodness.

820
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:44,840
I should repay you for finding this precious thing for me.

821
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,000
Gods never come to us when we want them to,

822
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,040
but they're always eager to repay their debts.

823
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,160
What should I do for you?

824
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,040
Should I sever the destiny

825
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,040
that's causing you awful pain?

826
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,960
Are we still bound by fate?

827
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,000
Can you see it, Old Mago?

828
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,600
Is there even anything that joins us, to sever?

829
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,440
Well??

830
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:12,720
That I can't answer.

831
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,040
Fine, then.

832
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,880
There is something I want.

833
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,160
I want to go back in time.

834
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,080
But that??

835
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,840
You can do it. You made me do it when you needed me to!

836
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,040
That's true, but??

837
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,680
Even just briefly is fine.

838
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,120
At least let us see the winter together.

839
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,040
Snow.

840
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,720
It really is winter.

841
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,000
Am I still dreaming?

842
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,000
As you wished,

843
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
this is the winter where we're together.

844
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,440
Where did this winter come from?

845
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Whether it's the past where you and I were together,

846
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,120
or the future which we'll spend together??

847
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,440
That, I don't know.

848
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,840
But??

849
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,720
This is just the winter where we're together.

850
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,720
Koo Chan-sung.

851
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,480
I saw you in my dreams.

852
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,520
Man-wol. Meaning, the moon.

853
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,840
The full moon.

854
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,160
That's a pretty name.

855
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:12,040
We really were destined to meet again,

856
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,640
after all those long years.

857
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:25,640
Then??is this the snow we saw in that distant past?

858
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,720
I'm hoping this is the snow we'll be seeing together in the future.

859
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,120
Really?

860
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,680
Now that you put it like that, it looks more beautiful.

861
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,160
You're going alone, without the Grim Reaper guiding you?

862
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,640
I was the owner of this place for these long years.

863
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,600
I'm going to make this journey, on my own two feet.

864
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,480
You're very brave.

865
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,960
Koo Chan-sung.

866
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,480
I thought a lot about

867
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,040
what I should say to you

868
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,480
when this moment finally came.

869
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,080
'I'm sorry,'

870
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,880
'Thank you,'

871
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,560
'Have a good life.'

872
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,040
I'd prepared many nice things to say,

873
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,080
but I can't remember any of them right now.

874
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,520
I just??

875
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,720
want to be with you,

876
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,080
keep seeing you,

877
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,840
and not leave you here.

878
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,080
If I was going to be like this in the end??

879
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,040
Why did I act brave for nothing,

880
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,880
so you couldn't even cling to me,

881
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,760
begging me not to go but stay here with you.

882
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,880
I'm sorry.

883
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,080
When you told me right here,

884
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,960
not to feel so sad when you do leave me??

885
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,120
Were you only pretending to be brave?

886
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,000
Back then, I didn't know I'd fall so deeply for you.

887
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,040
I??

888
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,800
I didn't know I'd ever fall in love again.

889
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,040
Like a fool that I am.

890
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,080
I??I've never thought about

891
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:58,680
a next time,

892
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,160
but these are the only words

893
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,120
I can say to you.

894
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,640
Let's??

895
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,120
Let's meet again

896
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,960
in our next lives, no matter what.

897
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,400
Alright?

898
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,080
Alright?

899
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,160
Koo Chan-sung.

900
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,920
You peered into me,

901
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,840
took care of me,

902
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,040
and protected me.

903
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,880
Thank you.

904
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,560
Goodbye.

905
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,760
Goodbye, Ms. Jang Man-wol.

906
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,720
(The Styx)

907
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,920
My moon, who swallowed up

908
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,080
my nights and my dreams??

909
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,840
Goodbye.

910
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,000
Nothing in this world

911
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,160
leaves without sadness or disappointment.

912
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:00,040
But just as the wilting flower dreams of blossoming again,

913
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:05,480
may you live, meet again,

914
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,560
and love again.

915
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:13,960
Because that is the answer ye have chosen,

916
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,080
ye foolish, proud,

917
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:20,640
and ye who's lost in self-pity.

918
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,080
Merry Christmas!

919
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,080
Brrr, it's cold.

920
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,000
Chan-sung!

921
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,320
Chan-sung. Brrr, it's cold.

922
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,880
It's gotten really cold, hasn't it?

923
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,480
It'll be as cold as Seoul in New York, so be prepared.

924
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,960
Post these for me once I find a place in New York.

925
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,920
Sure, I'll just bring them over when I do go to see you,

926
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,000
so just pack what you need.

927
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,600
Hey, how about we have lunch together tomorrow?

928
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,560
I've someone to see.

929
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,800
Have you been doing well, Yu-na?

930
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,040
Yes.

931
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,560
What about your exams? Which university did you apply for?

932
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,720
I'm going to major in hotel management.

933
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,760
And be a hotelier like you, too.

934
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,360
You must've gotten great marks, then.

935
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,160
I will, next year.

936
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,960
Up until now, I couldn't study because I was seeing ghosts.

937
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,560
But thanks to the potion you gave me,

938
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,800
I no longer see ghosts

939
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,720
so I've been able to focus on school and studies.

940
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:40,840
That's good to hear.

941
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,240
You also had the same potion you gave me, right?

942
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,040
You don't see it anymore, right?

943
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:12,040
Do you think that tiger saw what it wanted to, inside?

944
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:19,040
He was in that dreamlike moment he can never return to.

945
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,040
He was pretty lucky.

946
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,720
The memories of a most mysterious world

947
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,800
which others do not know of.

948
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,000
That's where you are.

949
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,920
And in them,

950
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,000
I remember my promise with you.

951
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,480
(Time and Existence)

952
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,120
(Time and Existence)

953
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,880
You're here early.

954
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,200
I thought you'd be late.

955
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,920
I didn't want to make you wait,

956
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,800
so I came as fast as I could.

957
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,800
Some day??

958
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,040
Some day??

959
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,080
If, somewhere in the distant future,

960
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,120
and in another life, we are together??

961
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:35,040
I hope to be with you, in that life.

962
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,120
And in that life,

963
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,000
we'll dream together

964
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,240
and laugh together in each others' arms,

965
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:53,000
and be happy right next to each other

966
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,720
forever and ever.

967
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:29,360
(Thank you to all our viewers for watching 'Hotel Del Luna')

968
01:30:33,600 --> 01:31:01,360
(Coming up next is the epilogue of our story)

969
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:06,920
(Hotel Del Luna)

970
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:39,200
I'm about to make a very important announcement today,

971
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,200
so where are the rest?

972
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:45,080
Is our sixth still in the Joseon Dynasty era?

973
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,640
Tsk, tsk??

974
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,800
Not once did we ever have all twelve of us here.

975
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,040
As if you're that busy!

976
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:57,600
If they're not here, you can call them up later.

977
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,160
What's your announcement?

978
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:04,000
I have a new owner for the inn of the moon,

979
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,920
who will surprise you all!

980
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:15,640
After all, the story of the inn of the moon for

981
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,720
the wandering dead must continue on??

982
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,800
