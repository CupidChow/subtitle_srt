(Hotel Del Luna)

7
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,067
Hell isn't so nice

8
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:59,666
when you see it together.

9
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,866
What I have is hell.

10
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,900
Goodbye,

11
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,966
Koo Chan-sung.

12
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,466
It's gone.

13
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:25,600
(Episode 9)

14
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:54,533
Do you see that?

15
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,700
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry.

16
00:01:58,766 --> 00:01:59,966
Let's go, let's go!

17
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,067
Who knew they had
a place like this in Myeongdong?

18
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,500
Right?

19
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,466
Let's go.

20
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:38,634
Mr. Koo must be at a loss.

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,567
Why not send him a text at least?

22
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,967
After all, we spent
all this time together.

23
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,434
I sent him something else instead.

24
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,900
As his severance pay
and his pink slip.

25
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,767
But then again,
I guess to you, President Jang…

26
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,733
Mr. Koo is just another human
who passed you by.

27
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,966
No. Koo Chan-sung is special.

28
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:07,100
I don't want
my heart growing weak,

29
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,166
so I decided to detach
that part from my heart.

30
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:15,500
Hearing you say that is…

31
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,100
Let's see…

32
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,633
The first time in 500 years.

33
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,700
500 years?

34
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,334
Has it been that long
since you died, Mr. Kim?

35
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,100
What have you been doing
all this time for 500 years?

36
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,867
I don't think
I should be hearing that from you,

37
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,367
who's been here twice as long.

38
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:34,367
My case is different.
I'm tied down here.

39
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:38,700
Well I can't leave either,
because of my great shame.

40
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:41,900
I just don't know how to face
my ancestors in the underworld.

41
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,500
There's no need to face
your ancestors once you're there.

42
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,534
They would've reincarnated
several times already.

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,834
Why worry about such a thing?

44
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,067
Well, I don’t mind and
I'm glad to continue my worries by

45
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,000
remaining at this hotel, but…

46
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,133
Will you be okay like this,
President Jang?

47
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:59,334
Will it be okay for you to
pass up the chance to go to

48
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
the underworld in peace
through Mr. Koo?

49
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,700
I won't be going in peace.

50
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,967
Anyway, I suggest you
speed up the progress in

51
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,300
doing something about your shame.

52
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,966
There probably
isn't much time left.

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,400
And if you don't solve it by then,
you still get on the bus.

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,700
What about our guests?
Did you see them off?

55
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,900
Yes, it went smoothly thanks to
the help of our Grim Reaper.

56
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,933
Though there was some confusion
due to our sudden moving…

57
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:33,934
If you have no regrets and
are happy to leave now,

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,634
please board this bus.

59
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,434
But if you still have regrets
and can't leave just yet,

60
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,466
please wait here.

61
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,767
Don't get it wrong.

62
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,034
We can't turn the bus back even if
you want to get off halfway.

63
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,334
What… you're happy to
depart for the underworld?

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,100
I saw my eldest get into college,

65
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,600
so I thought it's about time.

66
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,167
Yes, I remember you being worried
about your son in his senior year

67
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,600
and waking him up every morning.

68
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,067
So he went to
a good college, did he?

69
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,400
Well, farewell.

70
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,733
(Those going to the Underworld
Those remaining in this world)

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,434
Sir, you must line up.

72
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,100
I can't quite make up my mind on

73
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,400
whether to board the bus
or remain here a little longer.

74
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,866
Did you complete the novel
you were working on?

75
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,700
No.

76
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:25,034
It didn't work out
while I was alive,

77
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,666
so it wouldn't work out now,
would it?

78
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,566
I better go.

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Still… should I stay
and complete it?

80
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,500
He can't make up his mind, can he?

81
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:44,766
Oh, he won't be going.

82
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Not because he needs to
complete his novel,

83
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,967
but because he still hasn't learned
how to give up what's not possible.

84
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,000
This way to the underworld.

85
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,367
Make sure to get in the right line.

86
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:57,133
There's no turning back.

87
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:00,400
Some of our staff have
also boarded the bus.

88
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,400
We'll be short-staffed for
a little while.

89
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:06,500
Tell our employees to go,
if they wish to already.

90
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,834
President Jang, why are you acting
like you're going to close the hotel?

91
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,700
Now that we have a new address,

92
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,600
we should get
a new human general manager.

93
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,733
There's no need.

94
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,033
We have Yu-na, don’t we?

95
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:19,000
By the way,
have you moved all my belongings?

96
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,000
Our smarty-pants No. 4
called a moving service

97
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,833
and had your belongings
transported already.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,666
Where are you going?
You need to drive.

99
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,166
I know how to ride a horse,
but not how to drive just yet…

100
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,067
What have you been doing
all this time for 500 years?

101
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,900
You're the eccentric one.

102
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,900
A spirit who drives a car around,
just to brag, ha!

103
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,433
Jeez!

104
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,733
Ugh!

105
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:58,467
Why are you laughing?

106
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,633
It's funny to see a spirit
wear a seat belt.

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,400
Isn't this a fancy car,
with the lid off and all?

108
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,634
The last time I was in a car
was in your Pony II.

109
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,900
Aren't you enjoying it for someone
who called me a show off?

110
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,933
Come on, let's step on it!

111
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,034
Giddy-up!

112
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,500
Giddy-up, my ass.

113
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,433
So our new location is
in the countryside.

114
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:28,600
Nice.

115
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,667
It's like going on a picnic.

116
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,633
Pardon?

117
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,034
Oh, I'm on the phone.

118
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,367
Just follow the
navigation's instructions.

119
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:37,400
Sure.

120
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,467
I better get a driver's license
if I'm going to commute.

121
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,734
Just focus on school.

122
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,967
It's the school's holidays, duh.

123
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,300
Besides, I'll be graduating soon.

124
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,834
My parents said they'll buy me a car
if I get into college.

125
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,834
Oh, and I have an apartment
under my name, too.

126
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,466
I'm moving out
as soon as I graduate.

127
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,766
It's hard getting along
with her parents, huh?

128
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,634
I guess I'm paying the price.

129
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,500
Big time.

130
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,867
Gosh, this is really strong.

131
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:17,800
You want to try it?

132
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,400
Pardon?

133
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,734
Uh… sir?

134
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,033
It's alright.

135
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
What is it?

136
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,766
The woman in the car in front…

137
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,366
What?

138
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,033
Don't look.
It could get dangerous for you.

139
00:08:58,366 --> 00:09:01,600
Help me… help me!

140
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,100
Help!

141
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,834
Help!

142
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,000
Help…

143
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,500
There are a lot of spirits
who still haunt this world.

144
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,033
Don't mind it too much.

145
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:14,734
But I'm the next general manager
of Del Luna.

146
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,400
Let's bring that ghost to
the hotel as our guest.

147
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:18,367
What?

148
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,834
Sir, remember that gray car
that just passed us by?

149
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,634
- Can you follow it?
- What?

150
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,934
I'll pay you extra.
Please step on it.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,434
Alright then.

152
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,867
President Jang's going to
tell you off for this.

153
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,600
You're not Mr. Koo.

154
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,066
Please hurry.

155
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,666
(Apothecary)

156
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,066
Are you looking for Del Luna?

157
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:55,867
You knew that the hotel moved?

158
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:58,500
Then you must know
where it moved to, then.

159
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:01,600
If I tell you, will you go there?

160
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,566
When you almost died
because of Jang Man-wol?

161
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:08,967
I heard

162
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,900
you took an evil curse
onto yourself for someone else.

163
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,800
If that curse hadn't been lifted,

164
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:16,500
your soul may have been
greatly harmed.

165
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:23,600
Koo Chan-sung! Let go, now!

166
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:27,634
Ms. Jang Man-wol protected me.

167
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,867
I'm fine now.

168
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:31,367
It's thanks to you that
Jang Man-wol's in one piece.

169
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,966
You're the one who protected her.

170
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,834
My sister sure picked
the right candidate.

171
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
So keep up the good work.

172
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,366
Is that why I was sent to
that hotel, for such purpose?

173
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,934
To stop her from harming
an old enemy,

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,167
and let her just pass her by?

175
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,834
You did exactly
what you were entrusted to do,

176
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,934
so why are you angry?

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Because you felt sorry for
the Jang Man-wol in your dreams?

178
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,400
Yes, that's right.

179
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:03,800
It makes me angry that
you're praising me for

180
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,067
not taking her side
and stopping her.

181
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:08,634
And now she's abandoned me because
I got in her way.

182
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,567
Yet you're telling me to continue
doing just that?

183
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:15,000
Taking sides certainly
comes off as cool and suave,

184
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,967
while getting in the way isn't.

185
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:22,267
So everyone wants to be the
knight in shining armor,

186
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,667
taking someone in their arms
and comforting them.

187
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:29,367
But it's only the good who can play

188
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,733
the not-so-cool role of
being clingy.

189
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,034
Don't overestimate me.

190
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,734
I'm not a good person
who's willing to play the role

191
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,433
everyone wants to avoid.

192
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,100
Are you not?

193
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,666
Then don't.

194
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,033
Take this, and you'll be fine.

195
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,800
What is this?

196
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:58,166
This will close
your all-seeing eye.

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,934
From then on,
you won't see spirits

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,166
or Del Luna.

199
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,367
All will disappear from my sight?

200
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,867
That woman abandoned you,
didn't she?

201
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,033
So you should be given a chance
to abandon her as well.

202
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,700
Isn't God fair sometimes?

203
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,666
I came to you to ask
where I can find her,

204
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,034
but instead you answer me
with a way to never reach her.

205
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,034
The conclusion is not
in the hands of God,

206
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,833
but in the hands of man.

207
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,900
Like always, right?

208
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,700
Thank you for this chance.

209
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,067
What…

210
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,267
You're going to take it now?
Without even thinking over it?

211
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,634
Did you think I wouldn't,
after hesitation?

212
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,033
Because I'm a good person?

213
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,700
As I said,

214
00:12:57,766 --> 00:13:00,766
I'm not a good person
who'll gladly play that uncool role.

215
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,500
I'm only hesitating because…

216
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:09,466
I like her.

217
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,700
She's a nasty woman
who won't be satisfied with

218
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,033
being embraced and comforted.

219
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,666
She abandoned me
because I get in the way,

220
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:28,166
and there's no way
she'll welcome me back.

221
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,566
Plus, who knows when she'll do
something dangerous next?

222
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,900
Even so, let me think about
just how much I like her,

223
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:46,800
and whether it's worth running to her
and clinging to her.

224
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,167
If it's old, at least be antique.

225
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,667
Or if it's small, at least be cozy.

226
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,700
But this… This is just…

227
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,367
…ugly.

228
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:17,800
This is the only piece of land
we could afford with

229
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,500
the little money we could prepare
at such short notice.

230
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:22,967
Still, there's even the
graveyard over there,

231
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:25,100
so the land's overflowing
with the yin energy.

232
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,634
This area is also famous for
its clear waters

233
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
and its great makgeolli.

234
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:31,367
President Jang, you remember
the radish kimchi and

235
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:34,434
the makgeolli you enjoyed
when times were rough?

236
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,900
Well, they're from around here.

237
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:38,367
Stop reminding me of those times!

238
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:40,367
The place looks so dreadful that

239
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,366
I feel like we're poor again.

240
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,634
Still… the air's fresh.
And no fine dust, either.

241
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,567
Fine dust…

242
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,100
Like you'd breathe in any,
if there were any around here.

243
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,666
Why fuss about clean air and water
when you're a spirit?

244
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,500
Fine, I'll just turn
a blind eye to the exterior.

245
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,733
As long as it's the same inside.

246
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,100
Hurry up!

247
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,233
Don't you think the lobby
has become a bit smaller?

248
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,600
It's just you, President Jang.
It's still the same.

249
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,167
Many of our guests were upset at
having to board the bus so early.

250
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,067
With not many flowers blooming
in the garden,

251
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,133
it's no wonder
times have become difficult for us.

252
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,200
It'll be the full moon soon,
so more guests will be arriving.

253
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,033
At least the location is prime.

254
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,234
I'm thirsty.

255
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,834
I'll be in the garden with
my luna tree, so bring me champagne.

256
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,834
Your belongings are
yet to arrive President Jang,

257
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,533
so we have no champagne.

258
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,366
What?

259
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,434
What are those brats doing?
Why aren't they here yet?

260
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,367
Don't tell me they've gone off
somewhere on their own!

261
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:16,700
How about a bowl of
makgeolli in a long while?

262
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,366
For old times' sake.

263
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:24,366
I thought I made it clear
I don't want to be reminded.

264
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:28,400
But you just had to forget it
all too soon.

265
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,334
Mr. Kim,

266
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,334
perhaps you're still here
after 500 years,

267
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,234
because you forgot the reason why.

268
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,234
Like a goldfish!

269
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Goldfish?

270
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,634
I'm a scholar who passed the
state exams with the highest mark!

271
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,034
How could you compare me to
a goldfish, if not a crane?

272
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,000
Crane?

273
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,300
Well, I guess a bird-head and
a fish-head are the same.

274
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:05,434
Bird-head, did she say?

275
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,467
Why, that…! How insolent!

276
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,267
Just hold it.

277
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,400
She's in a bad mood because
our facade's shabby now.

278
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,567
Well, Jang Man-wol
may have a fine facade,

279
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,600
but I'm convinced
she's an evil spirit inside.

280
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,034
Not only did she abandon Mr. Koo,

281
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,367
but she called in that human and
tried to do something funny.

282
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:26,033
Do you think she abandoned Mr. Koo
because of that incident?

283
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:30,700
She said she did so,
in fear of growing weak.

284
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:33,800
I'm worried that she might be
up to something dangerous again,

285
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,367
when we have no human to
stop her now.

286
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,600
Has Mr. Koo's all-seeing eye
closed yet?

287
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,400
President Jang said it should,
soon.

288
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:43,833
She probably threatened Old Mago
in her insolent manner.

289
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,733
Goldfish… ha!

290
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:03,034
Hey, I thought the leaves would
all fall in the process,

291
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,833
but they managed to hang on.

292
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,034
Did you close
Koo Chan-sung's all-seeing eye?

293
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,934
I gave him the potion, yes.

294
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,433
He should stop seeing spirits
once he drinks that.

295
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:16,933
I see.

296
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,934
Good for him.

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,467
I only granted your wish
because it was the first time

298
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:24,900
you'd asked me so politely, but…

299
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:29,866
It's his choice whether to
drink the potion or not!

300
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:32,766
I wonder
what his decision will be.

301
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,367
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

302
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,534
While I can still be polite,
let me ask another favor.

303
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,567
Can you get rid of all this green?

304
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:43,800
That, I can't do.

305
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:46,234
That's how your heart is,

306
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,967
so it's up to you

307
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,800
on whether the flowers
do bloom or not.

308
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,867
They've even started to bud,

309
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:02,333
so it'll be a pity if
they never have the chance to bloom.

310
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,300
Don't count your chickens,
they won't be blooming.

311
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:08,966
So don't ever think about
coming to view flowers here!

312
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,666
It hasn't transformed,
even at night.

313
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,034
Take that,

314
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,866
and you won't spirits or Del Luna.

315
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:44,733
Do you think I'm horrible?

316
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,366
Then run, Koo Chan-sung.

317
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:28,366
Have you come to
Hotel Del Luna, by any chance?

318
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,466
Del Luna is no longer here.

319
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,867
While I'd like to escort you,

320
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,066
I…

321
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,300
I won't be going there any longer.

322
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,066
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,766
Are you a person?

324
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,733
What, you think I'm a ghost?

325
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,766
Who…are you?

326
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,366
What about you?

327
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,700
Oh,
I'm from the real estate office.

328
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,000
(Hanbit Real Estate Office)

329
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,400
I'm here to take some pictures
for the sale.

330
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:37,367
Sale?

331
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:39,400
This place is up for sale?

332
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,534
Yes. Is there a problem?

333
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,700
Yes.

334
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:45,633
There are a ton of problems
with this place.

335
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:53,300
- I see.
- Let's see…

336
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:55,700
There's nothing to wear!

337
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:56,833
I understand.

338
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,000
President Jang,

339
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,067
I just got a call from
the real estate agent,

340
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,567
and he wants to know if
you've paid the inheritance tax.

341
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:04,434
What tax?

342
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,534
If the inheritance tax
hasn't been paid,

343
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,800
it could cause problems with
the transfer, he said.

344
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:11,733
I'm not too sure
what he means by that.

345
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,400
How should I know, then?

346
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,600
Should I contact Mr. Koo?

347
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,000
No! How can we?

348
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:27,000
Would one of our guests know?

349
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:30,234
Our guest here used to be
a very competent lawyer

350
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,900
at Jang & Young,
the top law firm in the country,

351
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:34,834
before he passed away
from overwork.

352
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,800
Is that right?

353
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:40,267
So, Mr. Jang & Young…
What's the problem?

354
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,500
What's this about inheritance tax?

355
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:47,067
You inherited the property from
Mr. Noh Jun-seok,

356
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:50,734
according to this paperwork
which has all been prepared for you.

357
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,534
So all you need to do is
pay the tax now.

358
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,734
With what?

359
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,734
I thought you already
set aside funds for that.

360
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,967
Well, I don't know!

361
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,234
The person who did
the paperwork is no longer here,

362
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,500
so how am I supposed to know
what I'm going to pay it with?

363
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,767
If you're going to use
the money from the sale,

364
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,300
then there's the inheritance tax,

365
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,467
mortgage,

366
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:12,100
transfer tax…

367
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,533
You won't have much left.

368
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,834
Why not? It's my land!

369
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,600
I hear it's a real expensive
piece of land, too!

370
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,766
So why won't I have anything left?

371
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,466
That's how tax works.

372
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,167
I recommend solving the
inheritance tax problem,

373
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,533
and keeping the land…

374
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,734
Jang & Young? Jang & Young!

375
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,100
Jang & Young!

376
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:44,100
What are you doing?
You need to take care of this!

377
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,000
Jang & Young!

378
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,400
Jang & Young? Jang & Young!

379
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:50,533
Um…

380
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,634
Because he died from overwork,

381
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,533
he tends to faint if he reads
anything for more than 5 minutes.

382
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,100
What kind of
a crappy situation is this?

383
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,366
Ugh!

384
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,234
Sure, then please call me back.

385
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,434
By the way, how did you know
about our tax problem?

386
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,634
Well, I came to view the property

387
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,933
when I met this Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

388
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:20,300
In fact, he's here right next to me.

389
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,066
Is he?

390
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,667
May I talk to him for a second?

391
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,600
Is this really written in Korean?

392
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,100
Ugh… ugh!

393
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,234
President Jang, why don't you
talk to him yourself?

394
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,834
I honestly don't understand.

395
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,300
Do you think I would?

396
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:46,634
Alright, real estate agent.
Make it short and clear.

397
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,100
How much can I expect to
gain from this sale?

398
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,700
Don't even think about
swindling me,

399
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:54,767
because I have a competent employee
who has an MBA from Harvard.

400
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,033
But you fired him.

401
00:24:58,866 --> 00:24:59,867
Koo Chan-sung?

402
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:02,867
You know nothing about inheritance
or transfer tax, do you?

403
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:05,033
So why did you fire
a competent employee like me?

404
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:08,834
Why are you there?

405
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,300
What, did you get a new job
at a real estate office?

406
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:13,934
I was at a loss after being sacked
overnight, that's why I'm here.

407
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,466
You miss me now, don't you?

408
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:22,234
Just say the word
that you want me back,

409
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,000
and I might, right now.

410
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,400
Tell this to my real estate agent.

411
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:32,400
Please kick out the
unauthorized trespasser,

412
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,433
and lock the doors.

413
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:40,600
Alright, then.

414
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,700
It seems Mr. Koo is there, too.

415
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:57,633
Ah, he must've been
looking for us all night.

416
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:02,466
If he calls again, tell him
he can come to us after he's dead.

417
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:07,000
Ugh, that Hyun-joong and Yu-na!

418
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,534
Check up on them to
see that they're on their way.

419
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,500
Yes, President Jang.

420
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,500
If you don't like those,
put these on.

421
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,033
No, thank you.

422
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,033
They're not my style.

423
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,533
Wear your smart turd-colored shoes

424
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:03,100
and work for a normal hotel,
Koo Chan-sung.

425
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,500
I need to lock up,
so please come out.

426
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:06,866
Mister, where are we?

427
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,833
This happened because
we were following that car.

428
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,400
It won't even show on the GPS.

429
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,366
Where on earth are we?

430
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:27,400
Mister, what's wrong?

431
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:30,633
There was someone on the road.

432
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:33,633
No…

433
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:45,400
Oh man…

434
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:47,500
Sorry,

435
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:48,966
it seems my car's
having troubles, too.

436
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,967
No, Mister.

437
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,766
I think we're in the right place.

438
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,800
I'll go to the main road
and wait for Insurance to come.

439
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,967
Alright.

440
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,733
Oh man… Jeez.

441
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,466
That was a man, right?

442
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,767
But it was a woman
who was in that car.

443
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,667
- Let's go have a look.
- Yu-na.

444
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:15,300
I think
this might be too dangerous.

445
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:17,934
But you're a spirit, and so was I.

446
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,634
That's not what I mean. That car…

447
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,100
Did you see the driver?

448
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,500
It was a young man
wearing sunglasses.

449
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,400
There was a spirit in his car,

450
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:34,600
and now we come across another one
after following him.

451
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,700
Something's not quite…

452
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,500
Do you think
something had happened to them?

453
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:39,867
Maybe that man
did something to them?

454
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:42,034
Sometimes, humans can be
more dangerous than spirits.

455
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,667
If they were murdered,

456
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,533
then the more reason
I can't leave them here!

457
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:48,566
I mean, I was murdered, too.

458
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,866
I'll be careful.

459
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,600
Then run back to this truck
if you see anyone.

460
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,500
- Alright?
- Alright.

461
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:03,400
But uh… Normally, it's the humans
who are scared of spirits,

462
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:05,934
not the other way around.

463
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,300
Right.

464
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,033
He looked like
your ordinary guy, too.

465
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:53,000
This is our signature cocktail,
and our guests' favorite.

466
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:54,600
"Tears."

467
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,500
Did you make this, Mr. Kim?

468
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,034
That's right.

469
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,567
This is the place where you dream
about being alive, in your stupor.

470
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:06,500
And these are your last drop of
tears you swallow back.

471
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,567
"Tears," really? And that came from
our scholar of first merit?

472
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,267
You really went to all lengths to
try make it cool.

473
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,034
I don't think I should be
hearing that from you,

474
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,000
when you ostentatiously
named the hotel "Del Luna."

475
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:24,567
As I thought, a cocktail served up
by a spirit is

476
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,800
just so tasteless.

477
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,034
Didn't you say this place is
famous for makgeolli?

478
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,700
So don't you have makgeolli?

479
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,800
You said so yourself
not to even mention the word!

480
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:35,867
Or did you forget already?

481
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:38,800
Since when were you so obedient?

482
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:43,500
Ugh, this "Tears"
ruined my appetite.

483
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:50,367
Now that she can't waste
her time in a department store,

484
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:52,400
she comes to me instead
to pick a fight.

485
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,700
Why, it tastes just fine!

486
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,533
(Boram Makgeolli)

487
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:18,466
Nice.

488
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:35,566
What is this?

489
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:43,500
What… who drank all this?

490
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,066
This place sure makes
fine makgeolli.

491
00:32:57,633 --> 00:33:00,333
Is there anything to
have on the side?

492
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:03,367
Any radish fields around here?

493
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:06,533
This would go perfect with
a freshly dug-up radish…

494
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Let's see. Radish field…

495
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,866
Huh?

496
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,566
So there was a reason why makgeolli
tastes so great around here.

497
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,733
Are you the giant tree that
moved to the hill over there?

498
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,500
That's right.

499
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:56,534
I see you've built a pretty house.

500
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,967
That must be the inn of the moon
where spirits drop by.

501
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:01,534
Yes.

502
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,700
And I'm the owner.

503
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,066
I'm the Spirit of the Well
of this town.

504
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,566
(Spirit of the Well: Divine spirit
who guards the town well)

505
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:10,534
That's why this town had
clear waters,

506
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
because they had a divine spirit
who guarded its well.

507
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,700
Thanks to you,
I had some great makgeolli.

508
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:36,967
You're fired?

509
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,367
Is it because of me?

510
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:41,933
Mi-ra, what on earth did you do
at Chan-sung's hotel?

511
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,834
I don't remember.

512
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,700
I felt so good because
the hotel was so nice, but…

513
00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:49,300
I can't remember
a single thing after that!

514
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:51,034
And once I'd come around,

515
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,400
I was completely drunk
and in a cab.

516
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,967
Did I drink?

517
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,934
You probably did, you love to!

518
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,834
And you probably threw a tantrum.

519
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,834
You've done it plenty of times,
and I've seen it, too!

520
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,000
It's not because of Mi-ra.

521
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:04,300
I was…

522
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:07,600
I was just given the boot
because I got in the way.

523
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:12,733
So I should find a way to go back.

524
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,434
Oh man… It looks like
Man-wol dumped Chan-sung.

525
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,300
I thought they never
really got to dating.

526
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:25,400
Still, Chan-sung liked her.

527
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:27,000
Man-wol even gave him
a really expensive painting

528
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:28,600
to shake him off completely.

529
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:31,500
I've seen plenty of guys like that
at my yacht club.

530
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,800
But I didn't expect
Man-wol to be one of them.

531
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:37,500
Then… that huge painting
in the room must be like,

532
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,400
an envelope full of notes.

533
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:42,267
And her farewell gift had to be
Mt. Paektu, of all things!

534
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,200
Now Chan-sung's going to be sad

535
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:45,700
whenever he hears
the national anthem.

536
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:49,133
Man…

537
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:59,200
Sir.

538
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:02,866
So you do see dead people.

539
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,800
I heard the news that
you'd passed away.

540
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,800
I apologize I haven't been able to
visit you just yet.

541
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:17,600
I came one last time to
see this painting.

542
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:19,900
Is the tiger still here?

543
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:22,900
It departed to the underworld

544
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:24,634
after a good rest
at the hotel I was at.

545
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,734
Hotel?

546
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,134
There is a hotel for the dead,

547
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,700
just like you, Sir.

548
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:33,267
You're working at
an intriguing place, aren't you?

549
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,533
I'd like to go there myself.

550
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:38,667
You can.

551
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,533
You can probably see it
very well right now.

552
00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:47,866
Going somewhere?

553
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:50,600
Yes, to the hotel.

554
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,934
I thought you can't go anymore.

555
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,500
I just found a way to.

556
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:56,233
Let's go.

557
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:04,900
Koo Chan-sung's really going to
throw away his pride

558
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:07,300
and go to her?

559
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:08,734
Who knew he'd come to this?

560
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,766
You're acting strange, too.

561
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:12,700
Why aren't you stopping him?

562
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:14,767
You came to Korea
just to win Chan-sung back,

563
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,600
and even interfered with
their date.

564
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:17,967
So why aren't you doing
anything now?

565
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:21,200
Just. I just gave up.

566
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:22,234
What?

567
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,234
I was really determined to
win his heart back,

568
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,567
but was it ever since
I met that woman, Jang Man-wol?

569
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:30,367
I just got the feeling that
I have no chance.

570
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:33,300
Why? Because Man-wol's
rich and pretty?

571
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:36,300
Hey, I make money too,
and I'm pretty as well.

572
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:41,566
But I just feel like
I don't stand a chance against her.

573
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,434
What's wrong with me?

574
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,767
Was I indebted to her
in my previous life?

575
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,833
Oh I'm sure that's the case.

576
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,466
After all, you're indebted to
a lot of people in this life, too.

577
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:54,700
I'll pay you back!

578
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:58,534
Besides, I'm holding our reunion
at your restaurant, Sanchez.

579
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,000
Gosh, I should check the group chat.

580
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,267
Well I'm in that group chat too,

581
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,800
and it's me who's hosting it.

582
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:08,034
So why's she making
a big fuss over it?

583
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,466
Ugh, please.

584
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:26,900
- Were you out, President Jang?
- Yes.

585
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:30,500
What about my stuff?
It still hasn't arrived?

586
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:33,767
Hyun-joong and our intern bumped
into a spirit on the way.

587
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,800
They want to bring him in
as our guest.

588
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:38,800
Those brats…

589
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:40,700
I knew it, so they did side-track.

590
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:44,466
It looks like Hyun-joong learned it
from Mr. Koo.

591
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:49,400
Ever since Mr. Koo had that
experience with our room 13 guest,

592
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:52,866
he hasn't been able to just pass by
those spirits that are lost.

593
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,700
You're right.

594
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,400
I found her in the public bathroom,
so I brought her in.

595
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:13,634
Do you want the blue,
or the red toilet paper?

596
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,866
Do you want the blue,
or the red toilet paper?

597
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,367
How long have you been doing this?

598
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:21,300
I think I heard this stuff
when I was a child!

599
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,667
Alright, this way please.

600
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:29,033
Do you want the blue,
or the red toilet paper?

601
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:38,666
He looked lost at the crossroads,
so I brought him in.

602
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:42,500
Not that way! This way.

603
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:46,266
Please.

604
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,834
You're such a wimp,

605
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,900
and weak-hearted too, yet…

606
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:13,966
Koo Chan-sung?

607
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,867
The late President came to
visit my place,

608
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:32,834
so I brought him here to
the hotel.

609
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,834
I heard the hotel he transferred to
after leaving my one was

610
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,100
far grander,
so I came to have a look.

611
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,166
And indeed, it is a fine place.

612
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:50,300
Since you're here as our guest,

613
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:52,300
we will receive you with
our best hospitality.

614
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,433
Ms. Choi.

615
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:57,000
Let me show you to your room.

616
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:58,000
This way, please.

617
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,200
Koo Chan-sung.

618
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:09,234
You pulled some tricks, didn't you?

619
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,867
Did you egg on a spirit you know
to find us?

620
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:13,800
It's true
that I followed him here,

621
00:41:13,866 --> 00:41:16,300
but I didn't pull tricks to
come here.

622
00:41:16,366 --> 00:41:18,300
I met the President
purely for another reason.

623
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:19,534
What other reason?

624
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,033
Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

625
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,967
About that painting before…
Try my secretary.

626
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:28,834
They're building a hall
in my memory,

627
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,933
so you'll be able to get
a good price for it.

628
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,500
Yes, sir.

629
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:40,834
What painting?

630
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,200
The Mt. Paektu painting that
you dumped on me,

631
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,100
because you thought
it only got in the way.

632
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,467
You…!

633
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:49,000
You said it won't even sell for
a quarter of its original price!

634
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:50,767
It's not that it wasn't selling,
I was holding onto it.

635
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:54,134
I knew the value would escalate
once the President passes away.

636
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,867
Hey! Then you should've said so!

637
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,966
- If I'd known, I wouldn't have…
- Dumped it on me, no.

638
00:41:59,966 --> 00:42:01,866
You sure gave me
a generous severance pay.

639
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,767
You swindler!

640
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,734
I didn't swindle anyone.

641
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,167
Because I didn't expect you'd ever
do what you did.

642
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:12,933
Abandon the painting,

643
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,966
and me as well.

644
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:26,334
- Let's halve it.
- No.

645
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,566
You…! You greedy Harvard swindler!

646
00:42:34,066 --> 00:42:36,134
Fine. Half of half.

647
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,300
No.

648
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,266
I want the entire deal, or no.

649
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,100
You probably didn't realize
how much it was worth then.

650
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,434
It looks like your good times
are over.

651
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,900
You're drinking makgeolli.

652
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:56,066
Whatever. Get out!

653
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,267
I should first sell off that painting
and bring cash in hand.

654
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,466
In the end, she'll go weak
when she sees money.

655
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:29,466
Welcome, sir.

656
00:43:30,866 --> 00:43:34,034
May I come in?

657
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,166
Of course.

658
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:39,300
Please come in.

659
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,834
What a kind human you are.

660
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,900
Thank you.

661
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,100
A chaebol like you

662
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:45,467
probably had a slush fund
stashed away somewhere.

663
00:44:45,533 --> 00:44:47,267
You probably had so much money that,

664
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:50,167
there's probably the,
"Oops, I forgot to tell

665
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:51,933
my family about this one."

666
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,234
For example,
a safe in Switzerland,

667
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,233
or a secret account in
the Virgin Islands.

668
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:02,534
Or let's say… Gold bars, even,

669
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,100
which you buried under
a field of sunflowers.

670
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:07,466
No?

671
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:11,066
Well…

672
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:17,400
Please do take time to
think over it.

673
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:54,600
Isn't this water?

674
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,367
President Jang, what do we do?

675
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:03,266
I think something that shouldn't be
in the hotel has entered!

676
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,000
The entire hotel has flooded.

677
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:22,733
What on earth came into
this place?

678
00:46:24,566 --> 00:46:26,567
It passed me by when it entered.

679
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:28,333
It wasn't a human soul.

680
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:32,333
It was a divine spirit in
the form of a young man.

681
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,533
A divine spirit?

682
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,634
That's it!

683
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,433
But how did he come in here?

684
00:46:45,533 --> 00:46:48,900
This area is under
Old Mago's jurisdiction.

685
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:51,566
Other gods cannot possibly enter
without her permission.

686
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:06,566
Looks like someone sent him in.

687
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:16,000
I invited him,
thinking that he was a guest.

688
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,434
Who is that spirit, anyway?

689
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,934
He's a divine spirit and
guardian of this town's well.

690
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,134
A divine spirit?

691
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,100
You mean, like in the folk tales?

692
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:27,400
Yes, he's the Spirit of the Well.

693
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,234
How could you let him
enter our premise?

694
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,334
I didn't know!

695
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,534
It was my first time
seeing something like that,

696
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,333
so how was I supposed to tell
he's not an ordinary spirit?

697
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:41,600
This is all because
we moved all of a sudden,

698
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:44,400
and because Hyun-joong
just had to be absent!

699
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:46,733
This is all your fault, got it?

700
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:50,300
Fine, let's say it's all my fault.

701
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:51,500
So what now?

702
00:47:51,566 --> 00:47:53,300
Do we find him and make him leave?

703
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,500
You can't chase gods out.

704
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,566
It was us who invited him,
so we can't make him leave!

705
00:48:02,066 --> 00:48:04,034
Now we have no choice but
to serve him.

706
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,567
Why did he leave his well behind
and come here, then?

707
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,000
I guess something
made him unhappy.

708
00:48:11,033 --> 00:48:12,967
And now that the divine spirit has
left his place,

709
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:14,933
all havoc will have broken loose
in the outside world, too.

710
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,933
Oh, my head…

711
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:20,767
Please do your best
as we expect to become

712
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,067
quite busy in the upcoming months.

713
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,234
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

714
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,467
It's hot these days, too…

715
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:26,900
Sir! The water isn't running!

716
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:29,333
It isn't? What's going on?

717
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:34,334
- Why isn't the water running?
- Who knows…

718
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,500
Goodness…

719
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:44,967
The well's dried up!

720
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:47,267
What… What do we do?

721
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,334
This has never happened before.
What's going on?

722
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,433
Why has the well dried up?

723
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:13,000
If the town well dries up…

724
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:15,300
Does that mean the end for
this town's makgeolli business?

725
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:20,066
Why did the water for the makgeolli
come to my hotel, then?

726
00:49:20,933 --> 00:49:23,733
All my beautiful wallpaper is
going to be ruined.

727
00:49:24,966 --> 00:49:26,600
It's going to get moldy.

728
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:29,366
And rot, maybe!

729
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:34,100
Ms. Choi is doing her best to
find out which room he went into.

730
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,400
While we can't force him out,

731
00:49:35,466 --> 00:49:38,634
perhaps we could convince him to
leaving on his own will.

732
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,434
Once we find him,
I'll go talk to him.

733
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,000
Do you know how scary divine spirits
can be when they're cross?

734
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:46,034
In the old days, human sacrifices
were even offered to pacify them!

735
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,934
You mean the people did so,
driven by fear,

736
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,233
and not because God willed it.

737
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:53,400
How did you come back here,
Mr. Koo?

738
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:55,166
Didn't you meet Old Mago?

739
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,233
We found him.

740
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,200
He's in the corner room
on the eighth floor.

741
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:07,167
Prepare some wine and food
to pacify him.

742
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:09,000
He said he doesn't need anything,

743
00:50:09,066 --> 00:50:10,500
except for one thing.

744
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,400
He would like to see Mr. Koo,
who invited him in.

745
00:50:16,066 --> 00:50:18,000
Koo Chan-sung? Why?

746
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:19,300
I'll go, I'm the president.

747
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:20,567
No.

748
00:50:20,633 --> 00:50:23,233
He wanted a living human to come.

749
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,400
Is he really after
a human sacrifice?

750
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:44,100
Where are you going?

751
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,266
- To get a human.
- What?

752
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:50,633
He's probably ticked off
at the townspeople.

753
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:53,333
I'll go catch some, and
send them in to beg for forgiveness.

754
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,167
- That's putting them in danger?
- Who cares?

755
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:01,333
Not you, alright?

756
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,700
It was me who opened
the door for him.

757
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:13,000
He said thank you,

758
00:51:13,066 --> 00:51:15,200
so I'm sure he's not calling me
to do me harm.

759
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:18,400
Let me see him.

760
00:51:26,466 --> 00:51:28,634
I wanted to ask you something.

761
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,167
So here's my question.

762
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:32,600
Normally, people say,
"Can I ask you something?"

763
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:37,033
Who's that old lady you saw
at the hospital last time?

764
00:51:44,966 --> 00:51:46,400
You know her, don't you?

765
00:51:48,433 --> 00:51:49,867
Yes.

766
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:51,267
It's my sister.

767
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,400
What? Your sister?

768
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:55,034
That old lady?

769
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:59,067
She may be old now, but to me
she's still my adorable little sister

770
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:00,633
who used to follow me around,
calling me "Brother."

771
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:03,300
Brother…

772
00:52:03,366 --> 00:52:05,967
- So what's her name?
- Hyun-mi.

773
00:52:06,033 --> 00:52:08,433
Ji Hyun-joong's sister, Ji Hyun-mi.

774
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:10,900
Hyun-mi…

775
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:12,600
I should go visit her.

776
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:16,034
And ask her if she remembers
her brother, Hyun-joong!

777
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,133
No.

778
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:18,967
You can't ever do that.

779
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:21,600
Don't ever go to her, alright?

780
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,400
Hey, it's not like I'd talk about
you behind your back,

781
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:28,133
when I like you!

782
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:38,533
Damnit, I've said it!

783
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,400
What the hell are we doing here
in this haunted mountain, anyway?

784
00:52:41,466 --> 00:52:42,533
I don't know anymore!

785
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:44,966
Careful.

786
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,233
Are you alright?

787
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,666
Hyun-joong…

788
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:14,133
I found him.

789
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:16,234
Yu-na.

790
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,233
Yes?

791
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,400
I don't think
it's just him who's here.

792
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,366
Look.

793
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:48,066
The fog's so thick.

794
00:53:50,933 --> 00:53:53,167
If you were only bluffing and
were hoping I'd stop you,

795
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:55,067
I'll stop you just this once.

796
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:57,666
Koo Chan-sung.
Don't go in. Go back.

797
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Hearing you say that,
I feel like I'm being brave.

798
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:05,300
Whatever! Brave? You're just a wimp.

799
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:06,467
Just run.

800
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:09,234
I let you go, so why did you
come crawling back?

801
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,166
Because you left me
hanging for hope.

802
00:54:11,966 --> 00:54:16,167
One, two, three.

803
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:17,466
Three seconds.

804
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,567
Just say the word
that you want me back,

805
00:54:23,633 --> 00:54:25,533
and I might, right now.

806
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:40,634
Though it was very brief,

807
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,367
for that brief moment
you wanted me to come.

808
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:44,166
For those three seconds.

809
00:54:48,733 --> 00:54:50,533
So how can I not?

810
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,133
Don't laugh,
it's only making me angry.

811
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:02,000
You're not angry,
you're just worried.

812
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,633
But don't worry.

813
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,400
Speaking from experience,
God seems to favor me.

814
00:55:10,466 --> 00:55:11,966
Is it because I'm weak?

815
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,433
Koo Chan-sung!

816
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:42,666
Koo Chan-sung.

817
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,433
Answer me, Koo Chan-sung!

818
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:31,133
Are you in there?

819
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,300
Are you in there, Spirit of the Well?

820
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,467
Yes, thanks to you letting me in,

821
00:57:38,533 --> 00:57:40,733
I'm enjoying myself in here.

822
00:57:41,466 --> 00:57:45,367
I'm sorry, but this is
no place for you.

823
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:47,200
Please return to
where you ought to be.

824
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,233
I don't want to.

825
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,467
What has made you so angry?

826
00:57:53,533 --> 00:57:56,666
If you would tell me,
I'll try to have it solved.

827
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,100
I won't be going.

828
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,267
I don't want to go back.

829
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:02,933
What did you say?

830
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,600
I ran away.

831
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,466
I'm scared…

832
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,300
I'm scared of being abandoned.

833
00:58:29,266 --> 00:58:32,000
I gave them sweet, fresh water

834
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:34,266
without ever drying up the well.

835
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:39,567
Every time they drew from the well,
I filled it back.

836
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:42,733
I helped them make money by
brewing wine.

837
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:47,133
Please bless
our makgeolli business!

838
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,867
But now…

839
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:53,733
I no longer have the capacity to
fill it back as much as they want.

840
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,966
I am drying up.

841
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:04,967
So I ran here, seeking refuge,

842
00:59:05,033 --> 00:59:06,433
before I dried up
completely and pathetically.

843
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,300
I abandoned them

844
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:13,166
while they will still miss me.

845
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,400
How does it feel to be at the
bottom of my pathetic self?

846
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:07,333
It's sad.

847
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:11,467
I'm sorry to have come in
when I'm not welcome.

848
01:00:11,533 --> 01:00:13,566
But I have nowhere else to go.

849
01:00:26,966 --> 01:00:28,333
So help me.

850
01:00:50,466 --> 01:00:52,300
Being a pathetic spirit I am,

851
01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:54,633
I will reward you,
since I sought your assistance.

852
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:00,567
I showed you my fear,

853
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:03,900
so now
it is time to show you yours.

854
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:06,133
And that should help
with your dilemma.

855
01:01:46,466 --> 01:01:47,666
The moon…?

856
01:01:51,066 --> 01:01:54,000
Koo Chan-sung, are you alright?

857
01:01:57,266 --> 01:01:58,366
I'm fine.

858
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:07,233
I found away.

859
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:53,666
There's another one here,
Sergeant Park!

860
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,466
Stand clear.

861
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,467
Today, five bodies were discovered
on a mountain

862
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:20,567
which the police suspect were
illegally dumped.

863
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:23,200
The search still continues,

864
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:24,900
with the possibility of
more being found.

865
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:27,434
According to the police,
the identification of the bodies is

866
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,134
- Here you are.
- expected to take several days,

867
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,367
and perhaps another week
before their exact

868
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,900
cause of death is determined…

869
01:03:34,966 --> 01:03:36,067
It's a serial murder.

870
01:03:36,133 --> 01:03:39,000
They found as much as five bodies!

871
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:41,400
Is that right?

872
01:03:41,466 --> 01:03:42,733
Well, have a good one.

873
01:03:47,466 --> 01:03:50,333
What…
how did they find that place?

874
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:04,466
We brought some guests.

875
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,900
Drink up!

876
01:04:18,966 --> 01:04:20,634
- Eat up.
- It's been such a long time!

877
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,634
Hey, this is yum!

878
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:23,500
This here is expensive wine.

879
01:04:23,566 --> 01:04:24,634
Delicious, huh?

880
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,134
Mi-ra's a regular here,
apparently.

881
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,300
I do look young for my age,
don't I?

882
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:28,934
This place is great, right?

883
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,333
- Mi-ra, you drink soda.
- Why?

884
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,934
Hello!

885
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,234
Ah, Ji-won.

886
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,034
- Hey, Ji-won!
- It's been a long time.

887
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,966
It really has been a long time.

888
01:04:42,933 --> 01:04:44,400
Hey, come here.

889
01:04:45,233 --> 01:04:47,134
- Nice to see you!
- You haven't changed a bit.

890
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,967
How did he know about the reunion?

891
01:04:49,033 --> 01:04:49,667
Hmmm?

892
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:52,067
I contacted him because
I didn't see him on the list.

893
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:53,133
Have a seat!

894
01:04:54,233 --> 01:04:56,600
- Ji-won, sit down over here.
- Have a seat.

895
01:05:00,933 --> 01:05:02,566
It's nice to see you.

896
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:07,267
Long time no see, Sanchez.

897
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,300
You're right.

898
01:05:09,233 --> 01:05:11,166
I didn't know you'd be
coming here today.

899
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:16,434
There was someone
I've been wanting to see.

900
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,966
So Chan-sung's back in Korea too?

901
01:05:19,733 --> 01:05:21,667
Yes, he is.

902
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:24,100
Ji-won,
do you know Chan-sung well?

903
01:05:24,733 --> 01:05:26,966
I do. Very well!

904
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:31,300
He's smart and
exceptional in many ways.

905
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,067
Is he the same as ever?

906
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:37,500
Because I miss him.

907
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,634
A CEO I'm acquainted with has

908
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,600
offered a small pond
at his holiday house right here.

909
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,433
You'll be comfortable here.

910
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:59,433
Now the makgeolli from that town
won't taste the same.

911
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
They'll probably find
some other source of water.

912
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:04,334
Even if the taste of
the water changes,

913
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,167
as long as the label doesn't

914
01:07:06,233 --> 01:07:08,066
most people won't notice.

915
01:07:09,433 --> 01:07:12,334
The makgeolli there was so good.

916
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,967
Thinking about how I won't be
able to taste it again

917
01:07:15,033 --> 01:07:16,900
makes me a tad bit sad.

918
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,533
He seemed sad, too.

919
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,134
Sad,

920
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,667
after he abandoned his well
and let it dry up

921
01:07:24,733 --> 01:07:26,033
because he's so twisted?

922
01:07:27,466 --> 01:07:29,400
He said he wasn’t angry.

923
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:31,234
If he was really angry and
wanted to punish them,

924
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,034
he would've called you in,
who has the power to

925
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,233
and not me, a feeble human.

926
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:45,300
What did you see down there
at the bottom of the well?

927
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,500
I saw fear.

928
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:52,600
Fear?

929
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:55,200
In exchange for showing me
his fear,

930
01:07:55,266 --> 01:07:59,967
he also showed me
what I feared and

931
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:03,933
wanted to
avoid the most right now.

932
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,166
And I was extremely afraid.

933
01:09:47,633 --> 01:09:49,900
Just as I peered into your dreams,

934
01:09:49,966 --> 01:09:53,700
you probably saw
what my fears are, didn't you?

935
01:09:56,933 --> 01:10:00,100
Just as I moved this divine spirit
to this safe resting place,

936
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:03,666
you'd moved me to
a place where I would be safe.

937
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,200
You know what this is, don't you?

938
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:15,900
A potion.

939
01:10:15,966 --> 01:10:18,466
I thought it was strange that
Old Mago suddenly offered it to me.

940
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,467
You asked her to
give it to me, didn't you?

941
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:23,533
Believe what you want.

942
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:28,000
But Koo Chan-sung,

943
01:10:28,066 --> 01:10:29,700
I want you to be safe.

944
01:10:35,933 --> 01:10:37,033
No.

945
01:10:40,633 --> 01:10:44,100
I'm going to put myself in danger,
so you'll feel uncomfortable by it.

946
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,366
What?

947
01:10:50,733 --> 01:10:54,100
Koo Chan-sung, do you know
how valuable that is?

948
01:10:55,233 --> 01:10:57,834
Do you know how clingy I had to be
to squeeze that out of her?

949
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,033
Ms. Jang Man-wol!

950
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:02,133
There's no safe place
for me anymore.

951
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:07,167
I'm going to continue to get
in your way, and fall in danger.

952
01:11:07,233 --> 01:11:08,366
So you…

953
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,033
…continue to protect me.

954
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,733
(Hotel Del Luna)

955
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,167
To be honest,
I'd been hoping you'd come back.

956
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:19,467
I won't let you perish.

957
01:12:19,533 --> 01:12:20,566
So trust me.

958
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:24,167
You brought both her and Yeon-woo

959
01:12:24,233 --> 01:12:26,434
to me.

960
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,366
Thank you, Koo Chan-sung.

961
01:12:28,966 --> 01:12:31,400
If Koo Chan-sung hasn't
taken the potion,

962
01:12:31,466 --> 01:12:33,900
that means he'll be able to see
an old, lost acquaintance again.

963
01:12:33,966 --> 01:12:35,134
It's a past I buried behind.

964
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,367
Please get rid of it.

965
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:40,366
I just had to bring to you
another piece of your old past.
