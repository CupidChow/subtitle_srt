(Episode 10)

8
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:46,967
You know what this is, don't you?

9
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,234
A potion.

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,733
I thought it was strange that
Old Mago suddenly offered it to me.

11
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,400
You asked her to
give it to me, didn't you?

12
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,800
Believe what you want.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,300
But Koo Chan-sung,

14
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,033
I want you to be safe.

15
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,800
No.

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm going to put myself in danger,
so you'll feel uncomfortable by it.

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,466
What?

18
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,833
Koo Chan-sung, do you know
how valuable that is?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,567
Do you know how clingy I had to be
to squeeze that out of her?

20
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:27,766
Ms. Jang Man-wol!

21
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,866
There's no safe place
for me anymore.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,900
I'm going to continue to get
in your way, and fall in danger.

23
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:37,033
So you…

24
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,700
…continue to protect me.

25
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,866
Is this your potion?

26
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:04,900
This potion is yours, isn't it?

27
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,900
Sir…

28
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:10,400
How could you bring this to me
at a time like this?

29
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:13,500
It appeared you'd dropped it,
so I fetched it for you.

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,600
Thank you.

31
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:20,500
You brought back
something very precious for us.

32
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,966
Then… we'll leave you to rest.

33
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:29,700
Isn't this the potion that will
erase your fears?

34
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:31,967
Yes, that's true, but…

35
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:34,700
Then drink, and be at peace.

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,566
See?

37
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:46,267
Even he says to drink it
and be at peace.

38
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,700
That divine spirit
just can't take a hint.

39
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,200
That was the advice coming from
someone who found peace

40
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,734
by running away.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,766
So drink.

42
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,334
You must've forgotten,

43
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,734
but spirits who hold a deep grudge
can kill you.

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,600
Why, you almost died a few days ago.

45
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,933
By me.

46
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,966
Don't put up with
this and that, and free yourself.

47
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:09,966
Drink.

48
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,033
But if I drink this,

49
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,033
I won't be able
to see you anymore.

50
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,500
You must've forgotten too,

51
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,566
but I peer into your soul.

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,167
If I don’t look after you,

53
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,334
you'll grow even nastier.

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,967
So even if I have to
put up with this and that,

55
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,866
I'm going to stop that
from happening.

56
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,033
Because…

57
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,033
I just can't have you

58
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,766
become like that.

59
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:10,034
So I'm going to continue to

60
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,700
remain by your side,
and watch over you.

61
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,333
Mr… Koo Chan-sung?

62
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,266
What is it now?

63
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:24,566
What brings you here at
my late father's holiday house?

64
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:36,433
You'd asked a favor to my father
when he was still alive?

65
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:38,200
Yes.

66
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,733
I borrowed his pond in his garden.

67
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:45,200
Did you free one of
your goldfishes, perhaps?

68
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,334
It's something very special,

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,300
and you'll benefit from it, too.

70
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,200
When Father was still alive,

71
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:52,567
he mentioned you several times.

72
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,300
That you had helped him out
quite a lot.

73
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:58,267
We're here to pack his belongings.

74
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,466
I see.

75
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,533
(Baekgu)

76
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,267
Oh… this is mine.

77
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,500
I spent a lot of time here with
Grandpa when I was little.

78
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
- Mom.
- Yes?

79
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:15,600
I found this in the book.

80
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:21,367
Gosh, when was this?

81
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,433
Father was still so young.

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,367
I miss him, right?

83
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:31,434
If there's anything
you'd like to say to him,

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,934
why don't you write it down?

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,567
The hotel I'm currently at is
holding a special event

86
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,400
where you send letters to
your dearly missed ones.

87
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:55,667
I thought you'd have left already,
but you waited.

88
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,466
Because I hate driving.

89
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,000
If you hate driving,

90
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,667
why did you buy all those cars?

91
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:04,833
Because they're pretty!

92
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,767
I'm going to buy back
all those cars that you sold off!

93
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,867
With what money?

94
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,734
You said you'll put up with
this and that,

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,600
so try putting up with
my pettiness.

96
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,033
I want my Mt. Paektu back.

97
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,900
Do you think
I'll give that back to you?

98
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,234
That's my severance pay.

99
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,233
I only dropped it by accident
at your place. So it's mine!

100
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,167
There's a good restaurant
around here that was featured on TV.

101
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:31,167
Why don't we go there?

102
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,466
A good restaurant?

103
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:35,467
You can't believe I'm suggesting
we go to a restaurant

104
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,567
at a time like this, right?

105
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,866
It just makes your blood boil,
doesn't it?

106
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
Because that's how I felt.

107
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,033
Let's go.

108
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,167
If we arrive there late, only to
find that it's already closed

109
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,500
because of you,

110
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,200
your Mt. Paektu won't be
going back to you,

111
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,233
ever.

112
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,300
Kim Jun-hyun, your idol,
has also been here.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,666
Right, we need to take
a photo to commemorate.

114
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,100
There's no place around
to go shopping,

115
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,834
nor is there
your favorite cold noodles place.

116
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,667
So why not just
go back to Myeongdong?

117
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,267
It's quite a long way for me
to commute, too.

118
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,666
You can commute to
that other hotel for work.

119
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,167
From what I observed,

120
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,700
it seems like the late president is
quite fond of you.

121
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,100
I'd like my current president
who's sitting in front of me

122
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,566
to think that way instead.

123
00:07:58,466 --> 00:07:59,500
And to do that…

124
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,733
I'll take the challenge!

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,266
If I succeed in the one bite
challenge, take me back.

126
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,666
The one bite challenge?

127
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,700
Kim Jun-hyun put everything on
this table in his wrap.

128
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,033
Nice try,

129
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,466
but you'll never get there
even if your mouth rips.

130
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,233
If I succeed,
you're taking me back.

131
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,333
It's no use.

132
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,966
I'm over Kim Jun-hyun now
these days.

133
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,800
You even abandoned Kim Jun-hyun,
your all-time idol?

134
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:45,700
Yes.

135
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,767
So if you succeed with that,

136
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,533
try Gag Concert instead of
our hotel.

137
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,634
Was it easy getting over him?

138
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,366
It hasn't been easy.

139
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,633
He'd be on every channel
I switch to.

140
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:10,034
I really hope
this place isn't good,

141
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,800
so I'm not ever
reminded of him again.

142
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,500
(Eat Till You Drop)

143
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:16,767
I said to just leave the car and go.
Why do you keep following me?

144
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,434
I'm making it difficult for you by

145
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,333
being everywhere you turn to.

146
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,334
But now, I'm here to see
the President.

147
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,367
There's something his granddaughter
wanted me to pass onto him.

148
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,667
Give it, I'll pass it on.

149
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,900
No.
How am I supposed to trust you?

150
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:33,167
I'm going to deliver it to
our guest himself.

151
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,800
I'm the president here,
and you were fired.

152
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,633
President Jang.

153
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,267
And General Manager Koo,
you also came into work.

154
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,600
He's not the general manager
here anymore.

155
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,967
And he's here on a visit,
not to work.

156
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,900
Go see the President for
whatever your business is.

157
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,866
There is something
I must inform you.

158
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,267
You mean the guests you invited

159
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,834
were all murdered?

160
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,500
Yes, we saw their bodies buried
on a mountain, not in a graveyard.

161
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,834
I reported it to the police
using the public pay phone.

162
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,667
It was on the news, too.

163
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,267
They found multiple bodies,

164
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,500
and everyone is talking about
how it is a serial murder.

165
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,800
And putting together
what our guests have told us,

166
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:35,500
it does seem like
one man murdered them all.

167
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,500
They've all said
he was a complete stranger,

168
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,834
and all agree that
it was a young man.

169
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,134
It's that man.

170
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,366
I'm sure the owner of that vehicle
is the murderer.

171
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,700
Oh! I wrote down the plate number
so I don't forget.

172
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:52,700
- We could track him down, and…
- Don't get involved.

173
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,100
Hyun-joong already reported it,

174
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,400
and the media's covered the story
of multiple bodies being found.

175
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,700
So leave it to the human police
to catch the living murderer.

176
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:05,667
Our job is to make sure
our guests have a comfortable stay

177
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,633
while they watch all that happen,
and depart in peace.

178
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:11,867
Put TVs in their rooms so they can
follow the news if they wish to.

179
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:15,200
And give them complimentary
Wi-Fi access for the updates.

180
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,334
Are you alright?

182
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,034
Don't worry,
the police will get him.

183
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,300
Anyway, if it was Hyun-joong
who reported it to the police

184
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:37,533
they probably must think
they've been bewitched by now.

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,267
The report was made
using this payphone,

186
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,367
but at that exact hour,

187
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,666
no one was captured on the
surveillance camera right there!

188
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,933
Do you think it was a ghost?

189
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,966
How bizarre.

190
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:56,567
There's no such thing as ghosts.

191
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,666
What surprises me is that
they still have payphones around.

192
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,467
Do you have any coins,
by any chance?

193
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:06,800
Yes, one second…

194
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,733
Ah, here.

195
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,500
Thank you!

196
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:17,633
This is to say thank you.

197
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,734
It's alright.

198
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,800
If you lose that,

199
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:32,300
you won't be getting married.

200
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:35,334
Never, ever,

201
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,900
not in your life!

202
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:41,267
You'll never find love.

203
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,500
So don't ever lose that.

204
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,933
Hello, Sis!

205
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,300
Ah, yes.

206
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:53,766
Uh… excuse me?

207
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,433
What the…

208
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,900
Never, ever,

209
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:10,500
not in your life!

210
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,767
(Dear Grandfather
whom I miss very much,)

211
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,766
(I'm so happy to be
able to write to you)

212
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,167
Your granddaughter was
extremely sad that

213
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,700
she couldn't be there for
your last moments.

214
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:32,500
She was studying abroad
at that time.

215
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:34,467
But at least I get to
see her like this.

216
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,766
I owe it all to you.

217
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,733
So you're a motorcyclist?
It really suits you.

218
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,534
Does it?

219
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,567
I couldn't really go for a ride
because it may look disrespectable.

220
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,467
This I also owe to you, too.

221
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,800
I'm glad to see you
enjoying yourself.

222
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,800
My granddaughter is a beauty,
isn't she?

223
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,566
Yes.

224
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,367
Are you… seeing anyone?

225
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,334
Pardon?

226
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,567
My granddaughter doesn't have
a boyfriend either, so…

227
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:15,467
Her name is Jeong Ji-eun,
and she's 25 years old.

228
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,000
She's been buried in books
all her life that

229
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,434
she can't tell who's a fine man.

230
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,700
I wanted to match her up with
a righteous fellow, if I could…

231
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,466
Ah, I see.

232
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:32,900
I'm sure she'll find a good person.
Don't worry.

233
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,033
Then… I better get going.

234
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:48,467
Koo Chan-sung isn't seeing anyone.

235
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:51,633
I thought you might be curious about
that righteous fellow over there.

236
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,734
Is that right?

237
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,466
Then shall I tell you more
about Koo Chan-sung?

238
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:08,100
Should I tell him to take care of
this while he's here?

239
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,534
Ugh.

240
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,634
President Jang! There you are.

241
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,734
What is it?

242
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,700
By your special order,

243
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,400
I managed to make a good
impression on our VIP.

244
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:20,200
Good work. Any progress?

245
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:22,567
I said I will take care of
something that's been on his mind

246
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,366
since when he was still alive.

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,300
Ah! Well done, Mr. Kim.

248
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,067
As a talent who came first in
the Joseon state exams,

249
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,534
you've always proved
yourself useful.

250
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,300
You see, this President… He has
a granddaughter he dotes on.

251
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:40,567
His only regret is not having been
able to find a match for her,

252
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,767
so I said I'll be the matchmaker!

253
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,000
Matchmaker?

254
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,800
Right. If it goes well,
that means a new suit for you.

255
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:50,000
He's a CEO, so I'm sure
he'll be more generous than that.

256
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:51,767
Of course!

257
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,934
If we find him a grandson-in-law,

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,900
the least he could do is
take care of this now, huh?

259
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:58,834
Your dilemma is over!

260
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,900
I knew I could count on you.

261
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:03,866
Mr. Kim, you're our ace employee!

262
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:08,300
And the President really likes
the human I suggested.

263
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:11,900
Aw, Mr. Kim. When did you find
the time to go out there

264
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:16,067
and befriend someone, when
you're already busy with your bar?

265
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:18,367
When do I have the time to
befriend anyone?

266
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,033
There's just one human I know.

267
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,366
Huh?

268
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:24,833
It's Koo Chan-sung!

269
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:32,734
You mean, Koo Chan-sung, as in
our general manager?

270
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,167
He's not our general manager
anymore, is he?

271
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:36,767
I know you've been
feeling bad about him,

272
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,634
so let's help him marry into
a chaebol family!

273
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,800
Once he marries a chaebol,
he couldn't possibly ignore us.

274
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:42,867
We'll receive a handsome sum from

275
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,500
the President,
and Koo Chan-sung, too!

276
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,900
It's catching two birds
with a stone. Haha!

277
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,834
Has Koo Chan-sung left already?

278
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,766
I need to give him
his granddaughter's number.

279
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:53,966
You can count on me on this one!

280
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:57,033
Where did he go?

281
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:02,600
That bird-head…!

282
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Has Mr. Koo left already?

283
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:10,534
No, I haven't seen him leave.

284
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,934
So he's still in here, is he?

285
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Ah, alright!

286
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,500
(To: Ms. Jang Man-wol
I love you!)

287
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,266
Lies, she still hasn't
gotten over him.

288
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:39,967
You're still here.

289
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,300
I was just about to leave.

290
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,833
Mr. Koo? Mr. Koo!

291
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:46,867
What is it?

292
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,933
Do you think Mr. Koo's in
President Jang's office?

293
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:52,733
Mr. Koo?

294
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,634
Hmmm, he's not here.

295
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,400
What is it?

296
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:58,733
Well, uh…

297
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:02,300
Do you suppose he's in the garden?

298
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:05,900
What's wrong with him? Jeez.

299
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,533
Do we have to stay like this?

300
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,300
Why do we have to stay like this?

301
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,367
You don't like money, right?

302
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:23,500
I know you're the frugal type.

303
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,933
Why, instead of flashy colors
you prefer turd…

304
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,234
I mean, you prefer the dull brown.

305
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,400
Right?

306
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,967
Are you threatening me,

307
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,800
because I won't give back
your Mt. Paektu painting?

308
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,033
Ha! So you do.

309
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,267
You do like money.

310
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,700
Yes, I like money.

311
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,100
And I want to make lots, if I can.

312
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,967
Is love for money
something to brag about?

313
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,033
Is that what they taught at Harvard?

314
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,767
Yes, because ultimately, an MBA is

315
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,900
all about learning how to
make money.

316
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:55,267
Good for you,

317
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,200
you greedy Harvard swindler.

318
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,234
I hope you become a chaebol, then!

319
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,934
Or even a hotel president!

320
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Now get out!

321
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,800
What the…

322
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:16,800
She's really angry about that
Mt. Paektu painting, isn't she?

323
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,366
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

324
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,033
I'll give you that painting back.

325
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,333
But you hold onto that potion.

326
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,566
Let's leave aside just one
safe option for me,

327
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,833
where I can run away

328
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:47,900
and abandon you.

329
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:01,866
I'll be waiting for your call to
reinstate me, then.

330
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,433
And the lunch
we had together earlier…

331
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,266
I enjoyed it.

332
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:14,500
So let's go again, next time.

333
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:01,134
My wife hasn't been back home
for several days now.

334
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,467
So that's why I'm calling
all her friends.

335
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,400
If you ever hear from her, uh…

336
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:06,967
Please tell her that I'm sorry,

337
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,600
and that I really want her to
come back home.

338
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,433
Thank you.

339
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:28,533
No…

340
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,467
Honey…!

341
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:31,767
Honey…

342
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,800
What's wrong with you?
Why are you like this?

343
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,400
What happened to you?

344
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:38,867
Oh what?

345
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,866
I… what? What?

346
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,533
It's as they said. There's a body.

347
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,234
You are under arrest as
a prime suspect for

348
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,234
the murder of your wife,
Ms. Lee Do-yeon.

349
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,434
It wasn't me!

350
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,533
You have the right to remain silent,
and the right to an attorney…

351
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,334
What about the shovel?

352
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,233
You need to take the shovel,
the dirty shovel.

353
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:10,766
That's right. That's right!

354
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,500
Take away the serial killer.

355
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,800
Goodbye!

356
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,733
Ugh!

357
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,366
Why do you hate
Mr. Seol Ji-won so much?

358
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:43,600
Did something happen between you two
while you were in the States?

359
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,566
Not two, but three.

360
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:48,800
Chan-sung's involved, too?

361
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,800
After you went back to Korea,

362
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:54,700
a Korean girl who'd been studying
in Boston killed herself.

363
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,534
And for some reason, rumors were
rampant that I was to blame.

364
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,467
What? You, Sanchez?

365
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,967
No way, who'd believe that?

366
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,300
Apparently everyone.

367
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:05,267
Rumors led to more rumors

368
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:09,367
and suddenly,
I was this rich scumbag

369
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:11,867
who played with a rich girl and

370
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:13,933
even had his friends
do some unspeakable things.

371
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:17,767
And after that…

372
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,866
There was a big bet
on an online community.

373
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,800
On whether I'd kill myself or not.

374
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,267
And the person
who started all this, was…

375
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,466
Seol Ji-won?

376
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:37,333
It was you, wasn't it?

377
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:41,334
It was you who spread that rumor
about Je-in.

378
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,367
I only ever said that
I saw you inviting Je-in to

379
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:47,267
a party hosted by
some rich European guys.

380
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,566
It was a job offer!

381
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:51,534
As a waitress there.

382
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,534
She said she couldn't afford her
tuition, so I…

383
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,566
But this "job" could've actually
been something else.

384
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,600
Don't lose your cool.

385
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,734
No one believes you anyway.

386
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,200
See, people actually hate you
because you're rich

387
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:07,733
and you go around
pretending to be nice.

388
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:15,800
But hang in there.

389
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:18,933
At least I betted on you
not killing yourself.

390
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,767
(Die 121)

391
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,266
(Live 98)

392
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:08,500
What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you.

393
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,666
Let's go grab something to eat,
Sanchez.

394
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:23,300
When I was at my most miserable
that I wanted to kill myself,

395
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:25,266
Chan-sung came to me.

396
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:30,500
That day, he went to Ji-won with
that giftbox with a pistol in it,

397
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:34,267
and not long after that,
Ji-won suddenly went back to Korea.

398
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,333
Why? What did Chan-sung
say or do to him?

399
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:39,766
That... I don't know.

400
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,867
Anyway, after that…

401
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:45,234
He came to see me every day,
asking if I wanted to grab a bite.

402
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,267
Until the rumors dissipated.

403
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,666
So that's how
you two became close.

404
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:58,434
Who put this outside?

405
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,366
Collection day is not today,
but tomorrow!

406
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,900
Sorry.

407
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,500
Chan-sung, I also got some pizza
for you. Go wash your hands.

408
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:06,800
Ah, thanks.

409
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:08,566
Remember, recyclables are
on Saturdays.

410
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:19,400
Don't ever tell Chan-sung about
seeing Seol Ji-won today.

411
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:21,834
I don't want Chan-sung
getting involved with him again.

412
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,833
Alright, I won’t tell him.

413
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,800
Too bad.

414
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,700
There's no guy like Chan-sung.

415
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:37,000
I don't think there's a better man
than Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

416
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:45,100
I understand you very well, but…

417
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,567
You are already deceased,

418
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:49,900
so how could we possibly
pass this onto your granddaughter?

419
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:51,534
So I was thinking…

420
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,666
I'd like to use your special service
offered at this hotel.

421
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:59,434
I heard from Mr. Kim right here.

422
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,167
That there's this
"dream call" service,

423
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,866
where you can appear in
your descendants' dreams.

424
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:12,600
I also heard payment can be done
through real money.

425
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:15,766
I just happened to remember
something I'd put aside…

426
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:57,633
Grandpa!

427
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:10,533
You got my postcard?

428
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,300
Yes, and I really like the man

429
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:17,033
who passed this onto me.

430
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,033
You mean, Mr. Koo Chan-sung?

431
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,467
Yes.

432
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:27,266
I really do wish you'd take him
as your partner for life.

433
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,866
About this young man…

434
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:36,600
Time's up.

435
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:39,734
It's a rather short call for
a hefty price.

436
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,633
Then why not make one more call?

437
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,834
Our principle is,
one call per day.

438
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,533
You need to be considerate of
others who are in line.

439
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:00,833
At least you said
all the things you needed to.

440
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,434
President Jang.

441
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,833
Does this mean Mr. Koo will
marry into a chaebol family?

442
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,900
Do you think kids these days
listen to their elders?

443
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:16,866
Like she would, when she never did
while he was still alive!

444
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:27,300
Grandpa appeared in
my dreams last night.

445
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:29,534
He was extremely happy to
have received my photo.

446
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,366
Really? I'm sure
that made you happy, too.

447
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,833
And…

448
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,033
He also said something else.

449
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:45,700
I really do wish you'd take him
as your partner for life.

450
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:57,300
Use this.

451
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:04,033
Excuse me, could you
clean up this table?

452
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,767
Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

453
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,466
Have you had lunch yet?

454
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,433
I'd like to talk to you
about my grandfather.

455
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,766
Sure, let's go have lunch.

456
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,266
What do you like?

457
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:30,834
He's here. He's here!

458
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,367
Did you really murder your wife?

459
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,200
Why did you kill all those
other innocent people?

460
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:35,500
Are there any others
beside those seven?

461
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:36,934
What was your motive?

462
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,400
What drove you to
murder those people?

463
00:31:39,466 --> 00:31:41,434
Why did you kill your wife?

464
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,900
- Please, just one comment!
- One comment please!

465
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:45,866
One comment please.

466
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:48,833
(Husband Who Murdered Wife
Arrested, Motive Yet Unclear)

467
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,800
This isn't him.

468
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:52,367
I'm sure he was
much smaller than this man.

469
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:53,466
What is?

470
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,167
I don't think he's the murderer.

471
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:07,400
All they have to do is find the car
with the plate number, 0963.

472
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:08,900
0963?

473
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:10,900
You remember the number?

474
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:11,767
Yes.

475
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,967
Just forget them, like
how you forget your English vocab.

476
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,533
Hey, come on!

477
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:21,667
This is my friend's place,
and it's really good.

478
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:22,734
Hey, it's Mr. Koo.

479
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,966
Sanchez!

480
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,900
- Have you been well?
- Have you?

481
00:32:25,966 --> 00:32:27,367
You know Sanchez?

482
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:29,267
She's a member of our yacht club.

483
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,934
Oh, really?

484
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,900
Well, this is a coincidence.

485
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:35,600
- I should join you next time.
- You don't quite make the cut.

486
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:37,600
Please.

487
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,700
Maybe after you own a hotel.

488
00:32:39,766 --> 00:32:43,667
I was going to tell him about the
0963 when I see him…

489
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:44,967
But I guess I can't.

490
00:32:45,033 --> 00:32:48,234
Mr. Koo's not
our hotel manager anymore.

491
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,333
What?

492
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,534
He's going to marry into
a chaebol family.

493
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,534
I'll use my experience
as general manager to greet customers

494
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,134
and help with inventory.

495
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,866
- That's nice.
- I can talk to customers too.

496
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,266
(Koo Chan-sung)

497
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,500
I'll be waiting for your call.

498
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,934
President Jang! President Jang!

499
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,966
They met. They met!

500
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,833
The matchmaking is going smoothly!

501
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,334
What? They met?

502
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,934
I saw Mr. Koo with the
chaebol granddaughter today!

503
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,300
It was my first time seeing
Mr. Koo laugh so much!

504
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,933
It turns out Mr. Koo is
quite an ambitious man.

505
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,600
I don't know.

506
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:55,234
Koo Chan-sung's always nice and
smiles to everyone.

507
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,967
Then why don't you go
and have a look for yourself?

508
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,300
Apparently, they're going to see
each other again.

509
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:01,567
Mr. Koo invited her to his place.

510
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:04,033
An invite to his house means…
Meet the parents!

511
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:07,766
But Mr. Koo's father
already passed away, remember?

512
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:10,400
Do you think his mother is
still here?

513
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,366
Is Mr. Koo's mother still alive?

514
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,234
Who knows, I'm sure
she's around somewhere.

515
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,234
She never listens, does she?

516
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,867
Anyway, we should be happy for
Koo Chan-sung that

517
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,467
he'll have a new family,
since he's been quite lonely.

518
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:25,267
After all, he's been so good to
our guests while he was here.

519
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:29,333
I'm glad to see that
he's now rewarded for it!

520
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:33,700
Do you think so?

521
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,933
Well, good for him.

522
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,900
Are you cleaning the place since
Ji-eun's coming over tomorrow?

523
00:34:56,966 --> 00:34:59,266
Yes,
I want the place to look tidy.

524
00:35:04,866 --> 00:35:07,833
Right, you need to see someone else
if you want to forget about Man-wol.

525
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,600
But Chan-sung does have
high standards, doesn't he?

526
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:14,233
He always dates women
who own a hotel.

527
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,967
I hear there's a cursed book
in this library.

528
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,500
There's no such thing as that!

529
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:59,434
My cousin's a librarian here,
and she said so.

530
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,367
The ghost of the person who donated
the book still haunts it,

531
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:03,300
so take the book from the shelf,
and you'll see her.

532
00:36:03,366 --> 00:36:04,533
Sounds like fun.

533
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:07,600
Where is that book?
Let's upload it on social media.

534
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:19,800
- Is this the book?
- Yes.

535
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,933
Here we go.

536
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:25,033
- Take it out.
- I'm taking it out.

537
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,900
It won't budge. This is no joke!

538
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:34,266
- What are you doing?
- It really must be haunted.

539
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:46,866
What is it?

540
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,334
Seol… Seol!

541
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,766
Are you alright? Seol!

542
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:56,066
(Time and Existence)

543
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:56,333
Are you alright? Huh?

544
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,200
Are you alright?

545
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:02,700
Seol, wake up! Hey!

546
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:03,967
Hey!

547
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:06,766
Hey, wake up!

548
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:12,500
If Koo Chan-sung hasn't
taken the potion,

549
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,234
that means he'll be able to see
an old, lost acquaintance again.

550
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,800
That's one of the downsides of
having an all-seeing eye.

551
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:21,633
I hear you matched up
two random souls again?

552
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,900
It's quite fun, matching up
old enemies.

553
00:37:26,966 --> 00:37:28,667
They instantly take notice
of each other,

554
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:30,266
because there's still
something left in their heart!

555
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,700
Oh my.

556
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,566
So beautiful!

557
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,500
- Are you going to get in?
- Yes.

558
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,000
Excuse me.

559
00:37:56,266 --> 00:37:57,533
Does this belong to you?

560
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:01,900
Thank you.

561
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,766
Excuse me.

562
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,934
What are you going to
do about this now, huh?

563
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,167
This happened because of
your ball-point pen!

564
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:43,700
And it's my first time
wearing this today, too.

565
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:45,700
I'm sorry, what should I do?

566
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:46,900
Compensate me.

567
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:50,700
Actually, I'm busy today
so give me your number.

568
00:38:50,766 --> 00:38:51,600
Pardon?

569
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,466
But this is…

570
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,233
It's black.

571
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:05,033
Right. It's black.

572
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,833
Though it's pink on the outside.

573
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,266
Fine, then.

574
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,033
Excuse me.

575
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,900
This is something that's
quite important to me

576
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:23,933
and since you found it for me,
let me compensate.

577
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,666
Will you give me your number?

578
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:33,800
Sure. Alright, then.

579
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,567
So your grandfather
founded this library.

580
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:55,767
Yes.

581
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,834
I guess this was the reason

582
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,866
why my grandfather
appeared in my dreams.

583
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:08,634
To be honest, I wanted this to
ever since I first met you.

584
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,666
My grandfather will be very happy.

585
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:15,600
Let's go.

586
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:27,400
Are you satisfied?

587
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,900
What a fine couple they make!

588
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:34,266
Then as promised,
I'll take that money.

589
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,766
Why don't you stay and
watch them a little longer?

590
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:16,800
You're so beautiful now!

591
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:19,534
- A real princess.
- Really?

592
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,266
I almost didn't recognize you.

593
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,300
How is your mother doing?

594
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:25,934
She's doing very well,
and in good health.

595
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,434
I see. I should really
come and see her sometime.

596
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,333
This here is Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

597
00:41:31,266 --> 00:41:32,567
Hello.

598
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:34,633
Hello, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Koo Chan-sung.

599
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,566
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

600
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,167
Why are you here?

601
00:41:51,233 --> 00:41:53,467
The President said
he wanted to see his granddaughter.

602
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:55,100
This is a special service for him,

603
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,500
since he paid a hefty fee for
our dream call service.

604
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:58,367
Don't mind us,
but just be on your way.

605
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,333
Why don't you take a look around
the library since you're here?

606
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,134
They have many fine books
and pictures here.

607
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,767
I'm alright.

608
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:07,966
I'm leaving.

609
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,267
Don't say that, but stay.

610
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,700
There's a very good painting here.

611
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,634
I sold this painting.

612
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,767
I thought
you might die waiting for

613
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,666
a memorial hall to be built.

614
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,934
I talked it out with
his granddaughter,

615
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,600
and we decided to hang it here.

616
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,767
I came here to sell this,

617
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,500
so what about you?

618
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:44,700
What was your deal with him,
that involves me?

619
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,600
And what's this about
a dream call service?

620
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,533
You don't have to know.

621
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,534
So you say there are
many great paintings here?

622
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,500
I think I'll take a look,
while I'm here.

623
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:00,367
What did you rip off of
him this time?

624
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:02,733
I only ripped him off a little.

625
00:43:03,466 --> 00:43:05,534
I feel a little uncomfortable
about that painting you know,

626
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,234
since it actually belongs to him.

627
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,367
Well, you're a greedy
Harvard swindler, remember?

628
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:12,867
Swindler?

629
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:14,800
Stop saying that, and take it back!

630
00:43:14,866 --> 00:43:17,434
- I don't want to.
- You don't want to?

631
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,800
The excuse that you don't want to
just doesn't cut it!

632
00:43:19,866 --> 00:43:20,933
I said, take it back.

633
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:26,500
So, about this Koo Chan-sung…

634
00:43:26,566 --> 00:43:28,434
He seems like a nice guy.

635
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,333
Are you seeing him, Ji-eun?

636
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:34,633
I'd hoped so, but…

637
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,933
He says he has someone he likes.

638
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:54,033
The restaurant here is
really good.

639
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:56,433
Right?

640
00:43:56,766 --> 00:43:58,934
I used to come here often
with my father,

641
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,734
and it was good then, too.

642
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,300
You lived around here
when you were little?

643
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:05,867
My father wanted to enroll me
in a primary school in this area.

644
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:07,634
Though we never ended up
finding a room here

645
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,234
because the rent was so high,

646
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,033
we came here often, because
this place is cheap and good.

647
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,333
So it's always been
just you and your father?

648
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,734
Yes.

649
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,700
The reason why my name is
Chan-sung is because...

650
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:22,500
Because Dad was the only person
who said yes to me being born.

651
00:44:22,566 --> 00:44:24,400
That's why he gave me
this name that mean agree,

652
00:44:24,466 --> 00:44:26,366
because he felt sorry about that.

653
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:30,400
But because he didn't know
his Chinese characters so well,

654
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:32,300
my name ended up meaning
"bright star" instead.

655
00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:39,567
You know, your father sold you off

656
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:43,433
not to save himself but for you.

657
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:46,733
He said you'll be all alone
without him.

658
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:53,033
Of course I know that.
We only had each other.

659
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,400
If you're finished,
let's go check out some books.

660
00:45:03,466 --> 00:45:04,533
Books?

661
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,967
I can't quite do that,
not in this state.

662
00:45:08,033 --> 00:45:08,834
Why not?

663
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,367
This outfit doesn't really
go with books.

664
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:14,167
What does outfits
have to do with books?

665
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:15,700
Everything!

666
00:45:15,766 --> 00:45:16,734
Look.

667
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,967
You need to take a picture
to show you read books,

668
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:23,100
but I'm just not dressed right.

669
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,567
Please…

670
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:26,734
Koo Chan-sung, order some coffee
and just wait here.

671
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,934
I'll go get changed
and be right back.

672
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,933
No need for that, just sit down.

673
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:33,834
I wasn't asking you to
read a book together,

674
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,900
but to check out a book
that may be haunted.

675
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:43,467
The chief librarian here was
quite worried because

676
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,500
there's a rumor that a ghost
haunts the archives.

677
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:48,400
If there really is one around here,
let's bring her to our hotel.

678
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:50,667
There's a haunted book?

679
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:51,734
Yes.

680
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,500
And apparently, she was the
donor of the very book.

681
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:57,534
She was a headmaster of a primary
school who recently passed away,

682
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,967
and her family donated the book.

683
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:01,300
It seems like she treasured
that book very much.

684
00:46:01,366 --> 00:46:02,767
I don't know…

685
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:06,267
Most people easily throw away
what they treasured,

686
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:09,267
and instead guard with their life
what they want to hide.

687
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:12,467
That spirit must have
been on edge because of

688
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:14,534
all those humans coming to
pull that book out.

689
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,767
What could she have been
hiding in that book, though?

690
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,700
I can only think of
some secret stash of cash.

691
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:24,400
Tsk, tsk.

692
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:26,500
Only money will make her move,
huh?

693
00:46:28,366 --> 00:46:31,233
You pull it out, since you're
a human. That way, she'll come out.

694
00:46:34,266 --> 00:46:36,267
"Time and Existence"…

695
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:39,767
That title will make
anyone stay away from it.

696
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:40,967
I've read it before.

697
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:42,634
Yes, yes. I'm sure you have.

698
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,300
After all,
you're Mr. Smarty-pants.

699
00:46:45,366 --> 00:46:47,433
Good on you!

700
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:51,700
Yes, I read it to brag about it,

701
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:52,867
but it was quite
difficult to understand.

702
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:54,500
It was me who's been killing
all this time,

703
00:46:54,566 --> 00:46:56,534
having been in existence
for over a thousand years.

704
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,767
And even someone like me
doesn't know what time is,

705
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:03,500
so how would you know when you've
only been around for 30 years?

706
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:08,533
Well, let's first see
what "time" exists in this book.

707
00:47:09,366 --> 00:47:11,667
It might not appear if I'm around,

708
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:13,366
so I'll be at the back.

709
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,900
You can see me?

710
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,500
Yes, I can.

711
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,900
What are you doing here?

712
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,867
I didn't want anyone
seeing this book.

713
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:45,800
Is there something you treasure
inside the pages?

714
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:49,366
Or something you're hiding?

715
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:54,433
Can you get rid of what's inside?

716
00:47:55,366 --> 00:47:56,834
I'll help you.

717
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,333
But to do that,
I'll have to take this book out.

718
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,466
It's a past I've been hiding.

719
00:48:50,533 --> 00:48:53,834
I can't have my family find out.
So please…

720
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,500
Get rid of them.

721
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,733
That woman just now…

722
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:24,733
I think she may be my mother.

723
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,667
The last time I met her was
when I was still very young,

724
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:41,566
so I didn't even know
she'd passed away.

725
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:47,500
I didn't even realize
Father had sent these pictures.

726
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,100
(I'm going to the States
with Chan-sung)

727
00:49:56,566 --> 00:49:59,434
You're right, it wasn't
what she treasured,

728
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,033
it was what she was hiding.

729
00:50:07,433 --> 00:50:12,400
So she really was
against me being born.

730
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:36,500
I told you you'll have to put up
with this and that.

731
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,400
Well, this is what I meant.

732
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:40,566
The truth you didn't have to learn,
and was better not knowing.

733
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,300
Why? Am I wrong?

734
00:50:44,366 --> 00:50:45,434
Or are you going to say
it was still nice to see her,

735
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,800
because she was your mother?

736
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:49,366
You want to play the son
you never could, before she leaves?

737
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:52,466
Do you think I'd want to?

738
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:55,400
Thank goodness.

739
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:57,767
Hand them over,
so I can put them back.

740
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:00,800
Let her be there forever
and continue to suffer.

741
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:02,333
But that…

742
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:04,600
I don't want that, either.

743
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,434
Then what do you want me to do?

744
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,934
You had to go through that
because you started seeing spirits,

745
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,500
and since I'm to blame for that,
shouldn't I do something?

746
00:51:11,566 --> 00:51:12,733
I just…!

747
00:51:14,433 --> 00:51:17,666
I'm just sad that I can't be
happy about meeting my mother

748
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:21,466
for the first time in my life.

749
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:29,500
Let me just sulk.

750
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:50,266
It's nothing. Go.

751
00:52:26,966 --> 00:52:28,634
Did something happen?

752
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,534
Why the long face?

753
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,866
Well…

754
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:35,266
I'm just feeling blue.

755
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,734
You came to the right place.
I'm here to cheer you up.

756
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,733
Let's go, I'll buy you a drink.

757
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:50,667
Hey, you have a loose button.

758
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:52,467
Where did you drop it?

759
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:55,333
Why do you go around like that?
It's pitiful.

760
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,366
Was she trying to
comfort me back then?

761
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:21,267
Sanchez!

762
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,467
Mi-ra.

763
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,467
I was just about to
step out with Chan-sung.

764
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:25,933
Chan-sung's here?

765
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,267
This is not a great time to
ask you to join us,

766
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,867
so I'm sorry we'll have to leave you
to have dinner alone.

767
00:53:31,933 --> 00:53:35,334
Hey, I have company!
I won't be eating alone.

768
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,400
Really?

769
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,333
This really is a nice place.

770
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:32,733
What's going on?

771
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:37,466
Chan-sung, say hello.
This is Mr. Park Young-soo.

772
00:54:52,466 --> 00:54:54,900
I found something that's
very important to him,

773
00:54:54,966 --> 00:54:56,566
so he's going to buy me dinner.

774
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:03,900
But you… killed him.

775
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:04,966
What?

776
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:07,900
Oh, right?

777
00:55:07,966 --> 00:55:09,700
Yes, he has killer looks.

778
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:11,233
My gosh, Mi-ra.

779
00:55:12,566 --> 00:55:14,600
Mr. Park's a detective!

780
00:55:16,433 --> 00:55:18,500
So… it's just you and
Sanchez tonight, is it?

781
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:19,600
I'll see you later.

782
00:55:28,866 --> 00:55:31,500
What is it? Do you know him?

783
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,233
Not me, but Ms. Jang Man-wol does.

784
00:55:37,366 --> 00:55:38,567
Man-wol?

785
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:40,566
Then does he know Man-wol, too?

786
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:43,400
He probably doesn't.

787
00:55:46,766 --> 00:55:50,300
Sanchez, we'll have to have
that drink another time. Sorry.

788
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,333
Alright.

789
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:04,900
Tell me anything Koo Chan-sung
has told you in private.

790
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:07,500
Does he have any relatives
he keeps in touch with?

791
00:56:07,566 --> 00:56:09,966
What about his friends?
Anyone other than Sanchez?

792
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,934
No? No-one?

793
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,300
Mr. Koo was almost always…

794
00:56:21,366 --> 00:56:24,866
…with you, President Jang.
Don't you know anything?

795
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,200
I'm his boss, so I'm excused!
But not his colleagues.

796
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:33,500
How can you be so disinterested
in your colleagues?

797
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,467
Mr. Kim.

798
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:41,500
You even played matchmaker for him.
You don't know anything?

799
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:45,067
I only recommended him
because he had good heart.

800
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:47,867
Hey runt,
wasn't he closest to you?

801
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:49,367
Well…

802
00:56:49,433 --> 00:56:53,533
As far as I know, Mr. Koo…

803
00:56:54,966 --> 00:56:56,800
Well, he likes brown.

804
00:56:56,866 --> 00:56:58,366
I know that much!

805
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,600
The Grim Reaper is
also here with us.

806
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,667
I think
you've scolded them enough,

807
00:57:07,733 --> 00:57:09,500
when you don't know much
about him yourself.

808
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:12,334
Then what about you?
Do you know anything?

809
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,600
You've seen him quite often.

810
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:17,534
Ha!

811
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,567
I know you're all dead and all,

812
00:57:20,633 --> 00:57:22,866
but you can be so cold!

813
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,800
President Jang, if there is
anything you'd like to know,

814
00:57:26,866 --> 00:57:28,467
I suggest you ask him yourself.

815
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:30,366
There he is, right now.

816
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:53,834
I thought you'd be
sulking for a long time,

817
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,666
but looks like
you got over it pretty quickly.

818
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:59,333
I'm not quite done yet

819
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:04,833
but I came, because of you.

820
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,700
Me?

821
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,433
I think, it's me this time

822
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:15,366
who probed to deep into
your time and existence.

823
00:58:20,466 --> 00:58:22,833
I met the person
who's your greatest sadness.

824
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:02,300
An ex-thief…

825
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,900
…is now a police officer.

826
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:19,533
You're doing well again.

827
00:59:23,866 --> 00:59:25,366
Thank goodness.

828
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:30,000
Thank goodness, indeed.

829
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:47,500
Do you want to go and talk to him?

830
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,433
No.

831
00:59:52,366 --> 00:59:53,766
I don't deserve to.

832
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,434
But he was like family to you.

833
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,233
Will you be alright like this?

834
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,900
No, I'm not alright.

835
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:06,566
I'm a bit sad.

836
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,900
Once again,

837
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:14,733
I had to bring
an old acquaintance to you.

838
01:00:22,866 --> 01:00:26,666
Thank you, Koo Chan-sung.

839
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:34,466
- Let me see.
- No.

840
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:50,334
That serial murder…

841
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,600
The results are out for
that dirt on the shovel, right?

842
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:53,734
Pardon?

843
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,500
Yes, it's almost an exact match to
the soil from that mountain.

844
01:01:56,566 --> 01:01:57,700
Right?

845
01:01:57,766 --> 01:02:00,700
But why will our suspect
still deny it?

846
01:02:00,766 --> 01:02:02,800
Jeez, he's giving me a big headache.

847
01:02:02,866 --> 01:02:04,800
But, uh…

848
01:02:04,866 --> 01:02:07,533
He would have no motive other than
for his wife's murder.

849
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,434
He's a typical psychopath.

850
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,633
A murder addict.

851
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,367
The end!

852
01:02:37,433 --> 01:02:38,433
Ah!

853
01:03:12,366 --> 01:03:14,766
(Jungseok Moving Service)

854
01:03:14,766 --> 01:03:18,800
I'm telling you, we're missing
something from that delivery.

855
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:21,867
But the truck delivered
everything without problems.

856
01:03:21,933 --> 01:03:23,700
Uh…

857
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,967
Can you check who made
the reservation?

858
01:03:26,033 --> 01:03:28,967
The person who reserved the
3465 truck that day is

859
01:03:29,033 --> 01:03:30,700
Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

860
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:36,866
- Who?
- Aren't you Mr. Koo himself?

861
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,433
Koo Chan-sung?

862
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,233
It can't be.

863
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:54,966
Koo Chan-sung.

864
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,834
Koo Chan-sung…

865
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,966
Why did your name
pop out from there?

866
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,333
Chan-sung,

867
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,533
are you going to be
at home all day, too?

868
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:30,234
Yes.

869
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,900
You're not even going to
go to Man-wol's hotel?

870
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:34,734
You kept going there,
hoping to be hired back.

871
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,234
There's something
I need to sort out first.

872
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,967
Unless I do that,

873
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:42,233
I won't be able to
face the guests there.

874
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:03,566
(Time and Existence)

875
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:14,367
Will I find the answer after
reading this difficult book?

876
01:05:14,433 --> 01:05:16,900
On how to comfort a child,

877
01:05:16,966 --> 01:05:20,800
whose existence and the time
he spent with his mother

878
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:22,433
has just been denied?

879
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,933
Are you worried that
your secret will be exposed?

880
01:05:34,866 --> 01:05:37,200
Don't worry.

881
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,633
Because your child
doesn't want that.

882
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,266
He's very sad right now,

883
01:05:46,933 --> 01:05:48,666
and I want to comfort him.

884
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,033
So I need your hotel.

885
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:58,966
Let me escort you to my hotel.

886
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,300
You're hired again.

887
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,567
Take line 4 on the subway
and come to Del Luna.

888
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:17,633
I have a guest here waiting,
whom you need to send off.

889
01:06:18,533 --> 01:06:20,566
A guest I need to send off…

890
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,800
Welcome back, Mr. Koo.

891
01:07:02,866 --> 01:07:04,667
You're back in Myeongdong.

892
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:07,600
I like this location
much, much better!

893
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,566
I look forward to working
with you, as always.

894
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,300
I thought he'd be marrying
into the chaebol family,

895
01:07:35,366 --> 01:07:37,800
but instead he came back to
this haunted hotel.

896
01:07:37,866 --> 01:07:39,767
He has no ambition, for a man!

897
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:42,767
President Jang needs Mr. Koo.

898
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:45,566
Men with ambitions
aren't in these days.

899
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,267
You're really behind the times.

900
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,234
And…

901
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,634
I told you to fix that
outdated speech of yours!

902
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,033
Hey, come on!

903
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,434
I think I've worked
a lot on my language.

904
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,000
Don't you think? Oh, come on.

905
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:26,433
Sorry to keep you waiting.

906
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,300
Thank you for coming.

907
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:39,333
The photographs from the book…

908
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,633
May I keep them?

909
01:08:46,033 --> 01:08:47,566
Will you do that?

910
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,500
I…

911
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:54,433
I'm really sorry.

912
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:37,933
(To Heaven)

913
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,366
Goodbye,

914
01:09:57,366 --> 01:09:58,500
Mother.

915
01:10:49,866 --> 01:10:51,433
Did you see her off?

916
01:10:53,633 --> 01:10:54,600
Yes.

917
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,533
Sorry to bring her here
on my own will.

918
01:11:01,866 --> 01:11:05,433
Thank you, for doing just that
on your own will.

919
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:07,866
And…

920
01:11:09,033 --> 01:11:10,733
Thank you, for telling me
to come back.

921
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,466
Let's get this straight, though
this hurts my pride as President.

922
01:11:18,433 --> 01:11:20,867
You didn't come back because
I told you to.

923
01:11:20,933 --> 01:11:22,533
You came back, for me.

924
01:11:27,433 --> 01:11:29,067
I could have forced you to
drink that potion and

925
01:11:29,133 --> 01:11:30,766
have you never return,

926
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:34,566
but I didn't do that.

927
01:11:41,366 --> 01:11:44,600
Every time I gave you
a chance to run away,

928
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:47,566
I thought it was you
who came back nevertheless,

929
01:11:50,433 --> 01:11:51,966
But in actual truth,

930
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:56,600
I'd been hoping you'd come back.

931
01:12:01,366 --> 01:12:05,367
It feels nice to
have you clearly say that

932
01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:06,933
I wasn't the only one
clinging onto you.

933
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,500
Koo Chan-sung.

934
01:12:19,633 --> 01:12:21,433
I'm going to use you.

935
01:12:24,733 --> 01:12:26,833
You brought that woman,
and Yeon-woo too,

936
01:12:27,866 --> 01:12:29,733
in front of me.

937
01:12:31,633 --> 01:12:33,300
That means you'll probably…

938
01:12:35,533 --> 01:12:36,900
…bring him, too.

939
01:12:41,433 --> 01:12:42,934
That'll probably be the case, yes.

940
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,833
You will, no matter what.

941
01:12:46,866 --> 01:12:48,333
And I…

942
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,300
…will make sure that

943
01:12:52,366 --> 01:12:54,833
he doesn't pass me by in one piece.

944
01:12:55,533 --> 01:12:57,200
So that's why
you're going to use me?

945
01:12:57,266 --> 01:13:00,667
Yes. I'm evil and cunning.

946
01:13:00,733 --> 01:13:02,667
Because of me,

947
01:13:02,733 --> 01:13:06,667
you'll be used and played by me
until you're bruised and scarred.

948
01:13:06,733 --> 01:13:08,033
Is this another way of…

949
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,966
- threatening to run away…
- No.

950
01:13:14,733 --> 01:13:16,033
Don't run away.

951
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,366
You've already made up your mind.

952
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,533
You said you'll gladly get in
the way, and fall in danger.

953
01:13:27,766 --> 01:13:30,200
Do just that,

954
01:13:30,266 --> 01:13:32,666
and stay next to me

955
01:13:34,866 --> 01:13:36,366
with a heart that's ready to
accept death.

956
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:45,500
Even if I were ever to
go mad and run wild,

957
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,666
and disappear one day…

958
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,666
Still, stay with me.

959
01:13:59,233 --> 01:14:00,233
No.

960
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,600
I won't ever let you perish.

961
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:24,666
Trust me.

962
01:17:28,766 --> 01:17:32,566
(Hotel Del Luna)

963
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,500
It must be hard,

964
01:17:35,566 --> 01:17:36,767
missing someone
when you can't see them.

965
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:40,433
I'm letting you off this time
because you're weak.

966
01:17:42,633 --> 01:17:43,567
I'm sure you saw that
the tree has bloomed.

967
01:17:43,633 --> 01:17:44,966
Why aren't you saying anything?

968
01:17:46,033 --> 01:17:49,300
Brace yourselves, because
we'll have to depart before

969
01:17:49,366 --> 01:17:51,366
President Jang does.

970
01:17:52,233 --> 01:17:53,767
It's so beautiful like this.

971
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:57,367
So does it have to wilt?
It'd be so sad.

972
01:17:57,433 --> 01:17:59,334
Flowers bloom…

973
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,033
…so they may wilt.
