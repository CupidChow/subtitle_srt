(Episode 8)

8
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,333
Chung-myung?

9
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
You look happy,

10
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:33,700
my Princess.

11
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,533
(Man-wol)

12
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,766
Why are you here?

13
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,700
Why else?

14
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,800
What, you think I'm here to
congratulate you on your wedding?

15
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,133
I shouldn't have spared you then.

16
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:09,500
That bright smile just now…

17
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,400
It truly was beautiful.

18
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,500
Too bad though,

19
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,700
that the groom will
never get to see it.

20
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,466
Let me greet him instead,

21
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,600
though I'm not sure if
I'll be just as beautiful.

22
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,566
Chan-sung!

23
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,500
Ah, Mi-ra.

24
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,667
That's my friend.

25
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,300
Somehow she found out I'm here.

26
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:21,633
Koo Chan-sung.

27
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,400
You called her here.

28
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,900
I'm sorry.
This must be awkward for you.

29
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,700
So this is why you came.

30
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:38,433
They never had any intention to

31
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,267
send me off in peace,
in the first place.

32
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,533
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

33
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,766
What's wrong?

34
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,366
That face… it's smiling again.

35
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,266
In front of my eyes.

36
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:11,566
Mi-ra!

37
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,534
Go take care of her.

38
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,366
That's your job.

39
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Here, grab this.

40
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,500
Hey, Koo Chan-sung!

41
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:00,500
Yes.

42
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,666
- Hold on tight.
- Alright.

43
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,300
Here.

44
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,633
Thanks.

45
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,800
I'll be honest,
I came to interfere

46
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:33,266
but I didn't know I would be
bothering you like this.

47
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,734
Drink up.

48
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,266
You drank all that sea water.
This should freshen you up.

49
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,633
Was it… Ms. Jang Man-wol?

50
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,400
Did she leave because of me?

51
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,434
Do you know her by any chance?

52
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,434
No,
it was my first time seeing her.

53
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Why? Did she say she knows me?

54
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,866
Did we meet at
the hospital, perhaps?

55
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,400
Anyway, I was such
a nuisance to you.

56
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,534
But I honestly didn't mean it
back then.

57
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,767
The wind suddenly blew, and
it felt like someone was pushing me.

58
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,666
I really mean it.

59
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,533
Did she really push her off?

60
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:24,767
I've been running into nothing
but bad luck recently!

61
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,767
Maybe I need to see a shaman?

62
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,367
You need to sprinkle
some salt on you.

63
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,800
When an evil spirit strikes you,
you need to purify that evil energy.

64
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,334
Just in case,
don't go out at night

65
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,467
and avoid being by yourself.

66
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:38,467
You know,
you're like my grandmother.

67
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:40,434
My grandmother always told me,

68
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,633
I need to be careful because of
what happened in my previous life.

69
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:47,200
This is from my grandmother.
She said it'll protect me.

70
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,266
You still have that?

71
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:51,800
So you remember.

72
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,167
Chan-sung, I think
a spirit's onto me.

73
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,334
Be with me at night.

74
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,100
I need to go to work at night.

75
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,367
I called a cab for you,
so take that and go home.

76
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:02,367
But I even lost my bag!

77
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,734
It's been paid for, upfront.

78
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,567
I'm adding it to the bill,
so pay me back.

79
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:08,833
Don't forget, you're in debt,
which is scarier than spirits.

80
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,300
Tsk.

81
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:16,333
Goodness.

82
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,166
Koo Chan-sung.

83
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,933
You called her here.

84
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,733
So this is why you came.

85
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,866
Is she okay?

86
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,100
(Lee Mi-ra)

87
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,700
Lee Mi-ra…

88
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,333
His ex-girlfriend from
the States is here.

89
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,233
What a nasty way to
re-introduce her.

90
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,833
Isn't it already enough?

91
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:57,533
(Delete)

92
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,833
Ugh! How long are you guys
going to keep that up?

93
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,933
Let's go!

94
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,334
I have so many things
on my mind right now,

95
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,700
and that crude dance is
just getting on my nerves.

96
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,833
That's enough already, okay?

97
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,200
Woo-hoo!

98
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,733
I'm having a blast!

99
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,300
Next story.

100
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:48,467
Ms. Park Heung-ja,
who was the oldest living…

101
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,867
Once I get off,

102
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,534
you can go back to waving
your arms everywhere.

103
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,300
She was last living person to
be born in the 19th Century.

104
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,234
Ms. Park Heung-ja, who was
a role model all her life,

105
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,100
always greeting her children and
her grandchildren with a smile,

106
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,733
has departed this world without
regrets at age 120.

107
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,233
Thank you.

108
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,434
You lived a long, prosperous life
of over 100 years,

109
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,200
so you should have no regrets.

110
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:34,933
You're just going to
be on your way, like that?

111
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:45,167
Your great-granddaughter-in-law is
expecting, isn't she?

112
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,367
Just wait for another
month or two,

113
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,734
and you'd be able to see
their child, too.

114
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,700
She lived for 120 years.

115
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:55,100
She had 8 children,
and 24 grandchildren from them.

116
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,434
Seeing their grandchildren
before she departs…

117
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,434
…is simply greed.

118
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,200
That grandchild of your loving
grandchild must be so adorable!

119
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:06,600
It would be a pity if
you never get to see him or her.

120
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:10,300
She has lived 120 years!

121
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:11,933
You should have no regrets.

122
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,600
Why are you holding back the dead
on her peaceful departure?

123
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,400
It wasn't me.
It was her great, great-grandchild.

124
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:32,867
She's a special soul

125
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,334
who lived through three centuries

126
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,867
and experienced all that
a mortal can experience.

127
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:40,367
And now, because of you,

128
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,234
she is left to wander this life.

129
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,466
Like anyone would leave her to
wander this world.

130
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,233
See? She's here already.

131
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,167
Her children are great cooks!

132
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,534
The feast they prepared for
the dead is absolutely delicious.

133
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,200
You should have a taste.

134
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,433
I don't have to taste them to
know they're frozen meatballs.

135
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,534
You can't expect your household
to be peaceful if

136
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,466
you expect them to do
all the preparations themselves.

137
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,700
Ms. Park's family motto was to

138
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,767
take the easy way, was it?

139
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,866
So that's why
her family was so closely-knit.

140
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,767
Did you get in the way of
that dear spirit

141
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,333
just so you could see me?

142
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:49,300
I'm regretting it a little.

143
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,500
It's too far.

144
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:53,666
I should've just gone
directly to her.

145
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,433
To that Songhwa, I mean.

146
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,434
Ah, I should correct myself.

147
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,266
Her name is now Lee Mi-ra, is it?

148
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:08,500
While you dried up and
stopped where you were,

149
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:12,133
she arrived here after
many rounds of reincarnation.

150
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,400
You two only met because of
your past connections,

151
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,366
so just let her pass you by.

152
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,166
How can I just let her pass me by?

153
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,100
She may represent
an old grudge you bear,

154
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,867
but to her,

155
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:35,200
you are just a past encounter
she doesn't even remember.

156
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,100
You got Koo Chan-sung
into this mess,

157
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,933
to see me let her pass by me
without doing anything.

158
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:49,666
You can never harm her.

159
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,366
Right, because only then
I'll have a peaceful departure,

160
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,200
as the benevolent face of
God wishes.

161
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,134
I'll go hole up in my hotel

162
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,933
so you'll be rest assured.

163
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,200
Drop me off on the way.

164
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,266
Or even better,
take me to the Styx.

165
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,333
Will he…

166
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,833
…come, too?

167
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,234
In order for flowers to bloom,

168
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,933
you need to face the wind
and the rain, too.

169
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,433
Do you know where
Ms. Jang Man-wol is?

170
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,600
The President isn't back yet.

171
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,500
Did something happen
while you were out?

172
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,867
She suddenly lost her temper
and disappeared.

173
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,767
President Jang loses her temper
all the time,

174
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,467
so I don't think that's
anything new.

175
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:52,400
When she's mad, she usually goes
shopping or for a good meal.

176
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:54,300
She should be at the
department store or

177
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:55,367
a popular restaurant by now.

178
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:58,300
Her card maxed out,
so she can't possibly.

179
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:00,534
Then she must be extremely mad.

180
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,800
I better not run into her today.

181
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:04,434
When she's extremely mad…

182
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,134
Does she go off somewhere and
not come back to the hotel?

183
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
That won't ever happen.

184
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:10,667
President Jang has no choice
but to come back to the hotel.

185
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,600
Even if she runs away,
the hotel will chase her.

186
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,400
What do you mean,
the hotel will chase her?

187
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,400
Are there any more secrets to
this hotel I don't know about?

188
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:24,200
If President Jang never
mentioned them to you,

189
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,200
- then…
- Then I don't have to know?

190
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:32,234
I don't consider this
a temporary position anymore.

191
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,100
If all our employees know,

192
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,566
then I should know, too.

193
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,867
Ms. Jang Man-wol said she's tied
to this hotel as punishment.

194
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:46,134
So does this punishment follow her
even when she runs away?

195
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,300
That's right.

196
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:52,400
President Jang can never
escape this hotel.

197
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:18,633
She can't depart for
the underworld,

198
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,933
nor can she live in this world.

199
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:26,433
I think, at first, she tried to
run away several times.

200
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,333
But it was no use, apparently.

201
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:37,067
President Jang Man-wol is
the luna tree,

202
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,533
and it is the power of that tree
that this hotel is built on.

203
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,134
Wherever she goes,

204
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,467
there the luna tree will stand

205
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:50,733
and there the hotel shall be.

206
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:11,500
If she doesn't return
before the moon sets,

207
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:15,234
the tree will move to
where she is.

208
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
So she has no choice but
to return.

209
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:20,533
She simply cannot escape.

210
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,700
So in other words,

211
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:27,800
Jang Man-wol is imprisoned here.

212
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,766
Why was she trapped here
and robbed of freedom?

213
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,434
From what I hear,
Old Mago brought her

214
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,267
and tied her here before
she turned evil.

215
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:45,700
You saw what happens to a spirit

216
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:47,466
when they harm a human
out of grudge.

217
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,700
To Jang Man-wol, this place is…

218
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:59,633
…both her prison and her shelter.

219
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,366
It's safe for her that
she doesn't escape.

220
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,600
Here you are.

221
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,100
Thank you.

222
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,867
You were lucky that
no one took it with them.

223
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,233
Thank you.

224
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,733
But how did this get on the bus?

225
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:37,866
My picture's gone.

226
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,900
A theme park…

227
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,766
Lee Mi-ra must've been happy.

228
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:58,933
Koo Chan-sung?

229
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,566
Mr. Koo asked me to
bring this in for you.

230
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:27,800
He was in quite a panic

231
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,566
after you disappeared
and didn't come back.

232
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:34,600
I had to see someone.

233
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,267
To clear my head.

234
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,467
I told him
about your circumstances,

235
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,734
about why you had no choice
but to return to the hotel

236
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,533
because he was so worried.

237
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,666
Did you?

238
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:51,733
Where is Koo Chan-sung right now?

239
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Is she alright?

240
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:19,400
I was the one
who pushed her into the water.

241
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:20,666
Did she die, by any chance?

242
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,734
She's perfectly fine.

243
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,900
I'm sorry to hear that.

244
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,433
Why won't you ask me,

245
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,267
about why I pushed her?

246
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,300
Shouldn't you be interrogating me
about what I saw in her,

247
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:46,267
and nag at me not to do that again?

248
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,433
If I do that,
will you not do it again?

249
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:56,900
Because I'm not so sure anymore.

250
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,267
You said yourself that
you're a bad person,

251
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,667
and from how you've been tied down
here for over a thousand years

252
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,666
what you must've done
must've been quite serious.

253
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:11,500
But the you I saw in my dreams…

254
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:13,333
You were simply in love.

255
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,466
What were you up to just now?

256
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:23,500
What?

257
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,567
What were you doing alone,
after ditching me?

258
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:29,034
You wouldn't have been able to
do anything

259
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,533
with a maxed-out credit card.

260
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,467
Ha! Do you think I'm helpless
without you or a credit card?

261
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,734
I went dancing today,

262
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,633
and had a feast at a party.

263
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:43,167
A dance party?

264
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:47,166
Yes, the dancers at the party
were out of this world.

265
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,500
You went to a place like that,
all by yourself?

266
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:54,366
Why didn't you take me?
Now I feel left out.

267
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,467
If you had been there,

268
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,233
it may have been quite a sight.

269
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,466
Next time, take me with you.

270
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,100
It's always nicer to
share the nice stuff,

271
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,800
and enjoy the good times
together, not alone.

272
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,167
This view too,
looks much nicer now that

273
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,800
I'm seeing it with you
and not alone.

274
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:46,500
Whatever it is that you're trying
to do, don't forget this.

275
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:53,367
Whether this is your prison
or your shelter,

276
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:57,900
I'll be right here with you.

277
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:44,800
Doctor…

278
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:53,534
Doctor!

279
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,833
It's raining.

280
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,800
Gyeong-ah loves it when it rains,

281
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:03,466
because it means you'll be coming!

282
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,166
I'm not your doctor.

283
00:27:08,566 --> 00:27:11,833
Please be with me
until that record stops playing.

284
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:24,867
You'd hold my shaking hand

285
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:29,300
by the blue, blue beach…

286
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:32,733
And with stars in your eyes,

287
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,734
you'd pray…

288
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,900
Honey.

289
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:50,434
Honey. Honey?

290
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,366
Honey?

291
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:07,766
- Just got off work now?
- Yes.

292
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:14,333
What is that?

293
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,167
Apparently you told her to
come stay here.

294
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,400
Me? To who?

295
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:21,566
To me!

296
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,200
You…! Why are you…

297
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:29,267
I got scared being by myself.

298
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,366
I had a really frightening
experience last night.

299
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,000
What?

300
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:35,067
You know the bag I lost?

301
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,400
Well, I found it on an intercity bus!

302
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,934
And I never got on any bus.

303
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,234
Hold on! That means…

304
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,467
…this bag boarded the bus
by itself…?

305
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:45,800
Oh, jeez!

306
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:48,067
Stop it.

307
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:49,967
I don't want this anti-science
at home, either!

308
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:52,334
But science just doesn't
explain this situation.

309
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,367
Well, someone must've
picked up your bag

310
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,200
and then left it on the bus.

311
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:57,134
Oh…

312
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,833
Right, yes. That may have been it.

313
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,100
Did you lose anything?
Like money or credit cards?

314
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,267
I had no money or
credit cards to start with.

315
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,566
Which is why, Sanchez…
Can you lend me some money?

316
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,100
Come on, Sanchez!

317
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:16,533
Just in case,
I'll put up with it for now.

318
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,167
You're going to re-open the
theme park again?

319
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:23,100
Mmm-hmm.

320
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:25,966
It seems someone has
a happy memory at a theme park.

321
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,167
Whoever that is,
he or she will love it here.

322
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,966
So, when is this guest coming?

323
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:51,466
I'll be calling her very soon.

324
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:54,467
So you must escort her
with your best manners.

325
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:55,433
Yes, ma'am!

326
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,366
By the way, where did you send
Mr. Kim and Ms. Choi to?

327
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,500
To survey land.

328
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,234
It's spooky,
overflowing with yin energy,

329
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,467
and with no other buildings
in the vicinity.

330
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,900
It's perfect.

331
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:17,100
But no shopping centers or
good restaurants

332
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,267
which can be reached by car
in 15 minutes.

333
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,334
President Jang won't like that.

334
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,867
We've seen enough,
so let's move on.

335
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,934
To that public baths building.

336
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,500
But why do you suppose she's
interested in land, all of a sudden?

337
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:30,867
Isn't she struggling with card bills
and only just getting by?

338
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:33,566
I know. She should instead be
selling the land she owns.

339
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,300
Come on, you know how much
President Jang loves our location.

340
00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:39,734
There's a department store
and a great noodles place

341
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,366
all just a stone's throw away.

342
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:45,734
But perhaps… Koo Chan-sung is
nagging at her to

343
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,100
tighten the belt so much that
she's trying to sell land.

344
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,934
President Jang went into lengths
choosing a location.

345
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,266
There is no way
she'd sell that land. Let's go.

346
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:56,366
Eunseong Baths!

347
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:57,300
(Eunseong Baths)

348
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,867
You sure are
an early adapter, Ms. Choi.

349
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:06,366
Everyone gets used to it.

350
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:09,034
I'm from the Joseon Dynasty era,
so it's difficult for me.

351
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,067
I'm from the
Joseon Dynasty era, too.

352
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,867
You should start by
changing the way you talk.

353
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:16,300
How long are you going to
speak like a scholar?

354
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:23,400
I'll try…

355
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,300
Wait up!

356
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:26,967
Wait!

357
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,100
Thank you for your time.

358
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:35,034
Thanks for that!

359
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,866
I'll give you a call after I discuss
it with the potential buyer.

360
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:53,134
A theme park's been opened
at the hotel?

361
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Yes, you should come visit.

362
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,167
A date at a theme park
just sounds so perfect.

363
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:01,500
You have a boyfriend now?

364
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:06,067
Everyone's talking about
how I have one, yes!

365
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,300
Everyone? Really?

366
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:09,400
Great! So you've made a friend.

367
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:12,034
Now you just need to study hard
and not skip classes.

368
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,067
Right?

369
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,034
Whatever.

370
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,400
What about you? Did the school
teach you to be an idiot?

371
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:20,400
What's so bad about telling you
not to skip classes?

372
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:22,000
Study hard,

373
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,500
and be a fine doctor like

374
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,934
our general manager's
girlfriend over there.

375
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,300
My boss told me to
keep a good eye on her

376
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:30,000
and find out what
her reputation's like.

377
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,034
Can I add extra onions?

378
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,767
- Sure, go ahead.
- Let's both do that, then.

379
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:34,334
Alright.

380
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,967
Extra onions, please.

381
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:38,100
She loves onions, does she?

382
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,234
Onion is spelt with "o."

383
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,366
"Onion."

384
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:54,366
Oh, you're so smart, rich boy!

385
00:32:58,066 --> 00:32:59,766
(Onion)

386
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
President Jang is nicer than
you think, don't you think?

387
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,334
She even pays attention to people
around our general manager.

388
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,867
Do you really think
she's being nice?

389
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:12,933
What about you? Can you be
"nice" to my boyfriend?

390
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,133
Why? Is your boyfriend bad to you?

391
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,167
Yes!

392
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:22,866
My boyfriend's not only bad,
he's also a dumb idiot!

393
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,767
Is your husband doing okay?

394
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,500
No.

395
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:32,133
He's freaking me out every night.

396
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,334
Last night, he started
singing in his room.

397
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,300
What?

398
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,300
- What? You're going in?
- Yes.

399
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:48,834
How else will I report to
President Jang?

400
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
Listen.

401
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:52,200
Would you buy your cute neighbor
knocking on your door

402
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:54,234
to borrow some tools?

403
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,967
No… Do you have anything else?

404
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,967
Huh? There's something strange
at their house.

405
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:00,900
What?

406
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:05,833
Hey... that's not a person, is it?

407
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,734
I lent a celadon piece from
the Qing Dynasty to Mi-ra.

408
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,000
Though she actually asked me if
she can borrow it after she took it,

409
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:18,534
I guess you can still say
I lent it to her.

410
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,267
If she sold it off for money,
who knows when you'll get it back.

411
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,334
I'll get it back for you.

412
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,134
It's alright. I'll just take it out
of her pay if she doesn't return it.

413
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,866
I know you can't, but I can.

414
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,134
I should've steeled myself
and done that too

415
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,633
when she ripped me off.

416
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:35,600
Chan-sung.

417
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,300
You said you don't plan on staying
long at your current job, right?

418
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:41,034
You see, Veronica's father

419
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,134
just acquired a hotel in Sydney.

420
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,634
My father also has two restaurants
in that same hotel.

421
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,233
Are you interested in
transferring there?

422
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,433
I have no intention of
going elsewhere.

423
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:57,933
Is there a reason why
you're tied to Man-wol's hotel?

424
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,000
I mean, you're overqualified
and you have so much pride.

425
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,367
So it just doesn't make sense
to me that you're working overtime

426
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:08,134
every night at a hotel that
no one's heard of,

427
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,100
and doesn’t even provide you
with business cards.

428
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,367
Sanchez.

429
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:15,100
Do you think I'm someone
who'll settle for just any hotel?

430
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:20,034
Our hotel has
world-class facilities,

431
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,234
and our guests are extraordinary.
These are all beyond your imagination!

432
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,167
The only downside is that

433
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:28,733
I can't go around bragging
about it.

434
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:32,334
I see.

435
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,000
I thought you just put up
with that crappy hotel

436
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,200
because you had a thing
for Man-wol.

437
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:37,333
What…!

438
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:40,833
Got you. I so got you.

439
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,034
You know, you may seem like
a pushover and an idiot,

440
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,367
but you're actually quite sharp
and cool-headed.

441
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:52,167
Ah, that's right!

442
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,134
Just like how I'm actually
a chaebol,

443
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,334
when people think all I have is
this pizza restaurant, right?

444
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,500
That's what made Veronica
fall for me.

445
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:01,067
I'll bring you more drinks.

446
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,033
Sure.

447
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:07,166
(Lee Mi-ra)

448
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:14,667
Mi-ra, did you sell off
Sanchez's porcelain vase?

449
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,000
Chan-sung, um…

450
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:19,166
Would you have a room available
at your hotel right now?

451
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,400
Cameras can't capture ghosts, huh?

452
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:38,900
And it's the same for you.

453
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,967
It's possible, you know.

454
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,100
But only when I show myself like
I did at your school last time.

455
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,634
Though I can't keep it up
for too long.

456
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,833
Do it now, then.

457
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,866
Come on, quick!

458
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:51,766
Hey!

459
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,367
I see you! I see you!

460
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:55,733
Here we go.

461
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,966
Why are you here?

462
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:01,900
Mr. Koo…

463
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:03,200
What are you doing here?

464
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:07,000
We followed
your doctor girlfriend…

465
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,367
Mi-ra?

466
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:09,834
Why? What for?

467
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,133
I told them to.

468
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,867
Did you come here to torture Mi-ra
by having spirits haunt her?

469
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:23,267
You pretended like you
didn't care,

470
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,400
but you were actually worried
I might do something, huh?

471
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:27,333
So are you here to stand guard
for your girlfriend?

472
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:31,066
This isn't Mi-ra's house.
It's her colleague's,

473
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:34,200
and Mi-ra's staying
with me right now.

474
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:37,366
What? At Sanchez's?

475
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:41,433
Oh, so you two are
living together now?

476
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:44,034
Are you going
to keep following her?

477
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,734
Do I really have to stand guard?

478
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,600
I was only curious how well-off
and well-to-do she is, alright?

479
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,966
Where are you going?

480
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:53,667
You need to take that spirit
with you.

481
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:55,600
It wasn't me who put her there!

482
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:58,234
I didn't even know that
she lived with you, alright?

483
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,034
If I had, I would've had
a really scary ghost haunt her.

484
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,900
Well, the fact is that
there is a spirit at this place,

485
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:06,000
so let's not just leave her here
but take her with us.

486
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:08,866
President Jang.

487
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:11,834
President Jang, please.

488
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,833
Ha! You only call me that
when you need me.

489
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:21,700
I heard from Mi-ra,

490
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:25,100
that you keep hearing things
and seeing things in this house

491
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,800
and so you want to
stay at a hotel for the time being.

492
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:30,600
My parents left this house to me,

493
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:33,600
and maybe it's because
the house is old, but…

494
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,300
Hey,
I already told them everything.

495
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:38,066
You said you haven't been able to
sleep ever since you moved.

496
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:42,266
We could've just gone to your hotel,
no need to come all this way.

497
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:45,834
I wanted to meet
our potential guest first.

498
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,066
Our hotel isn't open to
just anyone, you see.

499
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,066
Is that why you're president is
also here with you?

500
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,100
Yes.

501
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,066
Stays at our hotel are
by invitation only.

502
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,233
A family of doctors, is it?

503
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Your hotel must be for
members only.

504
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:04,966
But we're fine
with just any hotel.

505
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:08,600
Do that, then.

506
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:11,667
Um…

507
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:12,600
President Jang.

508
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:14,334
President Jang!

509
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,634
We need to take our guest.

510
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,967
Forget it.

511
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,100
Do I really have to mind a spirit
who haunts this house?

512
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,167
This is the house of a friend
of my friend's.

513
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,900
Well, I don't like your friend

514
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:24,766
and neither do I like her friend,
which is you.

515
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:33,900
Is this the noise
you mentioned before?

516
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:35,366
You hear it, too?

517
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:38,166
So we're not mad, right?

518
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,267
We offer a very special service
at our hotel.

519
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,333
How about you try it out?

520
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,734
She's a girl by the name Gyeong-ah,
in a vintage dress.

521
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,867
Apparently, she's waiting for
a doctor.

522
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:04,834
Do you think she's looking for
her dead father?

523
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,934
Who knows.

524
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,334
She might run away
when she sees you,

525
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,900
so I’ll go in first.

526
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:12,833
You're not scared?

527
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:15,766
I have you here, don't I?

528
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,233
Miss Gyeong-ah?

529
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,266
Min?

530
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,633
Min!

531
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:55,066
It's alright.

532
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,933
Min… You're back! Min!

533
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:03,266
Who do you think Min is?

534
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm sorry to hurt you, Min.

535
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:27,100
But Gyeong-ah's heart
already belongs to my doctor…

536
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,233
So this "Min" and "Doctor"
are different people?

537
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:35,333
Are you ill?

538
00:41:36,366 --> 00:41:37,366
Min…

539
00:41:37,866 --> 00:41:40,234
Gyeong-ah doesn't have
much time left.

540
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,634
Although I can't give you my heart,

541
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,333
I will, however, allow you to
kiss me goodbye.

542
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,966
Gyeong-ah, is this your diary?

543
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,233
Sook-hee, stop it!

544
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:01,333
Don't touch my belongings!

545
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:03,666
So I must be Sook-hee, huh?

546
00:42:05,266 --> 00:42:07,834
It's not my fault that
you don't have Min's heart.

547
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,933
Enough with your jealousy,
Sook-hee!

548
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:14,166
What are all these postcards
and letters in here?

549
00:42:20,133 --> 00:42:22,133
Hey, Min. You ask her.

550
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,633
Ms. Gyeong-ah,
what are all these postcards?

551
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,234
Gyeong-ah's health is fragile…

552
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,267
So she can't go out,
and so she has no friends.

553
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:38,200
That's why she sent her story to
a radio channel,

554
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:40,766
and all these people
sent their regards!

555
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,600
"I hope you get better soon,
Gyeong-ah.

556
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,667
I'm also rooting for your love
for your doctor.

557
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,500
From Hee in Ssangmun-dong,

558
00:42:52,566 --> 00:42:54,400
who is also lovesick like
you are."

559
00:42:55,266 --> 00:42:56,400
This is for real.

560
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:00,800
Hyuk must be here!

561
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,067
So there must be a "Hyuk," too.

562
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:13,100
From the look on her face,
Hyuk must be in love with her, too.

563
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:18,567
So… Hyuk, Min and Doctor is

564
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:19,934
in love with Ms. Gyeong-ah,

565
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,334
while Sook-hee hates her.

566
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,967
Right, it's Sook-hee
who's the villain in this story.

567
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:25,900
Maybe it's best that
I pretend to be Min

568
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:27,833
and bring her to our hotel.

569
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,166
Gyeong-ah can't be
a guest at our hotel.

570
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,633
Because she's not a human soul.

571
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:53,700
You mean, she's not a ghost?

572
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:56,000
Didn't you feel anything strange

573
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,700
when she embraced you?

574
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:00,800
Now that you mention it,
it didn't feel cold.

575
00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:04,167
It always felt cold whenever I came
into contact with a spirit,

576
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:05,366
but not Gyeong-ah.

577
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:08,600
That's the product of
someone's thoughts.

578
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:11,000
Someone's thoughts?

579
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:12,733
An imagination.

580
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Gyeong-ah is a fictional character
made up by someone.

581
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,100
Someone made her up?

582
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:23,734
Miss Gyeong-ah,
who's terminally ill,

583
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,267
but enjoys romance with her doctor

584
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,167
while pursued by
both Hyuk and Min…

585
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,267
It's true she kept a diary and
sent letters to the radio station.

586
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,800
But Gyeong-ah didn't do it herself.

587
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:37,300
It was the person
who made her up, who did.

588
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:41,000
And who do you think that is?

589
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:42,400
Whoever it is,
if we can find that person

590
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:43,900
we can get rid of Gyeong-ah.

591
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:47,134
Who is this delusional person
who can't get over this

592
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,000
tear-jerking, saccharine love story?

593
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,767
What's going on?

594
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:53,234
Mother, they're here to help us.

595
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,633
- What is it?
- One second, Mother.

596
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,100
What are you doing in my study?

597
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,933
These are all my belongings.

598
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,900
By any chance, is your name…

599
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,200
It's Lee Bok-hee.

600
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,266
You two, give us some space.

601
00:45:31,866 --> 00:45:34,233
Do you know a woman
by the name Gyeong-ah?

602
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:46,066
I'm Gyeong-ah.

603
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:01,334
I married my husband

604
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,266
through an arranged marriage
at the age of twenty-two.

605
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,833
Without ever having dated anyone!

606
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,800
That's when…

607
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:15,600
…I made up Gyeong-ah.

608
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,267
I was happy when I was Gyeong-ah,

609
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:23,334
who was beautiful and tragic
like my favorite movie star,

610
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,300
and who was the heroine of
a passionate romance.

611
00:46:27,366 --> 00:46:30,167
The character you made up…

612
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,966
…still haunts this place.

613
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:34,666
Just like an old movie.

614
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,300
I see.

615
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:40,334
You're taking it easier
than we'd expected.

616
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,667
When you live this long,
you realize nothing's impossible.

617
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:47,366
Besides, I'm the delusional lady
who made up Gyeong-ah!

618
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Ms. Gyeong-ah called me Min.

619
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,633
You are so "Min"!

620
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:56,966
To tell you the truth,
it was Min who she loved the most.

621
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,100
Ha! What about her doctor?

622
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:04,266
Isn't she a big flirt?

623
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,300
Do I really have
to get rid of her?

624
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:11,733
Your son's family is
having a hard time.

625
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:15,600
I see.

626
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,867
It was
ever since I had my son that

627
00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:21,266
I'd forgotten about Gyeong-ah…

628
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,267
It must've been hard,
marrying a stranger

629
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,866
and without love, too.

630
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:51,100
Whether it was her imagination
or her delusion,

631
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:54,300
I'm sure that's what
helped her to get by.

632
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,333
Changing your reality
through your thoughts…

633
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,166
What a great idea.

634
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:08,300
She asked us to stay for dinner
no matter what.

635
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:10,767
She must be feeling lonely
after sending Gyeong-ah off.

636
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:13,034
So why don't you, Min,
do that and console her?

637
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,100
Sook-hee's a villain,
so it's best she doesn't join.

638
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,333
Alright.

639
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:23,966
It's burning beautifully.

640
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,333
Yes.

641
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:31,966
It's beautiful.

642
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,000
Ms. Lee, you really don’t have to
do all this for me.

643
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:46,000
Min, you just wait.

644
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,400
Um…

645
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:53,767
Has Mi-ra left already?

646
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:55,766
Yes, she should be back
at the hospital by now.

647
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,767
Oh, and thanks for the invite to
your hotel.

648
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:01,700
Pardon?

649
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:05,100
Your president gave us
an invite to the hotel.

650
00:49:05,866 --> 00:49:07,034
An invitation?

651
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,400
We'll definitely go.
I'm very excited.

652
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:13,167
Um, by any chance,
that invitation…

653
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:14,966
Did Mi-ra get one, too?

654
00:49:23,633 --> 00:49:25,733
I didn't know they had
such a hotel in this place.

655
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:28,666
Chan-sung's working for
a nice place, isn't he?

656
00:49:41,966 --> 00:49:43,300
Welcome, Madame.

657
00:49:43,366 --> 00:49:45,034
Our president is waiting for you.

658
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,634
Oh, I see. Thanks.

659
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,733
This way.

660
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:03,334
This way, please.

661
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,100
I'll be escorting you to
a special place

662
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:07,300
our president has prepared
just for you.

663
00:50:07,366 --> 00:50:09,133
Your hotel's really nice!

664
00:50:34,933 --> 00:50:37,067
Welcome,

665
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:40,834
to Hotel Del Luna.

666
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,733
Thank you for the invitation.

667
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,200
No, I should thank you.

668
00:50:45,266 --> 00:50:46,933
Because after all,

669
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,666
I couldn't
just let you pass me by.

670
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:55,000
Oh…

671
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:57,266
Well, this is very nice.

672
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,700
So… why is it empty?

673
00:51:04,366 --> 00:51:06,634
It's not empty,

674
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,766
it's just that you can't see them.

675
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,600
Because of that.

676
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:19,700
This?

677
00:51:19,766 --> 00:51:21,666
That's why you can't see anything.

678
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,400
Even back then... you didn't hear
anything, did you?

679
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,200
Is this the noise
you mentioned before?

680
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:30,800
So we're not mad, right?

681
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,934
Then if I take this off…

682
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,733
Will I see something?

683
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,166
Why don't you leave it with me?

684
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:39,066
Do you like it?

685
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,834
Yes, I love theme parks.

686
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,900
Do you? I had a feeling you did.

687
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:50,300
Because you looked happy.

688
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,866
So you found this.

689
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,666
Thank you.

690
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:03,300
This picture was taken…

691
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:06,266
…at a theme park with my family.

692
00:54:06,866 --> 00:54:07,900
That's right.

693
00:54:13,866 --> 00:54:17,766
And over there is…
you from that day.

694
00:54:22,766 --> 00:54:24,966
That's my mom, dad, and my sister.

695
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:28,300
And I'm happy.

696
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,234
And I…

697
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,933
…hate you, who's so happy.

698
00:54:37,633 --> 00:54:38,833
That's why…

699
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm going to turn her into
a very unhappy girl,

700
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,933
and give her to you, as a present.

701
00:55:25,933 --> 00:55:26,900
Hello.

702
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:34,767
You never had any happy family
to begin with.

703
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:37,866
Your mom would say this to you
all the time.

704
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:43,967
That she regrets having had you.

705
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:46,167
Your dad would get mad
whenever he sees you.

706
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:49,066
'Nothing's working out
because of you, you brat!'

707
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:52,867
And after your
bratty sister was born,

708
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,133
your mom and dad only loved her.

709
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:57,300
Look.

710
00:55:58,033 --> 00:56:00,067
On the day
you came to the theme park,

711
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:03,100
your family left,
leaving just you here.

712
00:56:07,766 --> 00:56:10,733
Ah… It was the worst day
in your life.

713
00:56:18,033 --> 00:56:20,734
Mom, Dad…

714
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,766
Don't abandon me.

715
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,233
Now, go.

716
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,867
Go, and…

717
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:47,234
Fill that woman's every day

718
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,567
with the unhappiness harbored by

719
00:56:49,633 --> 00:56:51,266
a girl who should've
never been born.

720
00:58:13,166 --> 00:58:14,833
Thanks, Koo Chan-sung.

721
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:18,600
Thanks to you, I got to meet her

722
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:21,033
and I found a great alternative.

723
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:23,733
That's why…

724
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:27,133
I feel a little bit better now.

725
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:28,800
Don't.

726
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,033
It's already been done.

727
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,600
And this is incomparable to

728
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:39,600
that adorable piece of thought
Ms. Lee Bok-hee made up.

729
00:58:41,133 --> 00:58:42,866
Because I'm the maker.

730
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:49,233
And that is a curse.

731
00:59:14,066 --> 00:59:15,300
Stop it.

732
00:59:15,366 --> 00:59:16,666
Do I terrify you?

733
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,600
Then run, Koo Chan-sung.

734
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:21,733
I'll let you go.

735
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
I'm not going.

736
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,900
So protect me.

737
01:00:01,133 --> 01:00:03,600
Koo Chan-sung, let go of her!

738
01:00:26,266 --> 01:00:30,266
Whatever it is that you're trying
to do, don't forget this.

739
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,100
Whether this is your prison
or your shelter,

740
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,766
I'll be right here with you.

741
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,933
You're not scared?

742
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:00,833
I have you here, don't I?

743
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,366
Are you awake now?

744
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,000
Who are you?

745
01:01:37,066 --> 01:01:39,334
President Jang asked me to
take you home,

746
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,867
because you were so drunk.

747
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:43,100
- I got drunk?
- Yes.

748
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:45,000
Your hospital's in
Myeongnyun-dong, right?

749
01:01:45,066 --> 01:01:47,033
- Let's go.
- Alright.

750
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:47,333
Everything will be okay now.

751
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,733
But you ruined everything.

752
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,767
I don't know.

753
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,866
Because the you I saw in
my dreams…

754
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:15,066
You were simply in love.

755
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:24,567
This will be
our last night together.

756
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:26,000
We're leaving.

757
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:29,600
Do you plan to join the rebellion?

758
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:33,867
They're going to rebuild
our lost nation.

759
01:03:33,933 --> 01:03:37,534
That's better than
being captured while thieving

760
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,033
and dying a gruesome death.

761
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,000
Come to the castle.

762
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,966
I can protect you.

763
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,633
You want me to abandon
my people, and go to you?

764
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:05,800
I can't do that.

765
01:04:07,933 --> 01:04:09,700
Then should I go to you?

766
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:22,667
If you cling onto me desperately…

767
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,333
I'll risk my life.

768
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Don't.

769
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:35,733
There's no way for us
to be together.

770
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:45,766
Right.

771
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:52,066
I guess I have no more reasons
to come here, then.

772
01:04:57,233 --> 01:04:59,266
You'll miss having…

773
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:02,400
…a good drinking buddy.

774
01:06:32,266 --> 01:06:34,933
Everyone's ready.
When shall we depart?

775
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,833
He came.

776
01:06:37,866 --> 01:06:39,300
I'm sure he's there now.

777
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:42,600
Let me see him, once last time.

778
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,766
Wol…

779
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:47,634
Will you be coming back?

780
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,733
Of course I'll come back.

781
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,134
You don't have to, it's okay.

782
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,234
It's all fine with me,

783
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,267
so you do what you want.

784
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:09,600
I'm coming back.

785
01:07:10,933 --> 01:07:12,633
After I see him one last time.

786
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:15,666
So you wait here.

787
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:26,233
Because of you,
your entire pack will die.

788
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,266
Thanks to you,
we won a great victory.

789
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:02,100
It was you who led us there,

790
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,633
and who bought us time, so…

791
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:09,800
You will be spared.

792
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,100
I'm going to kill you…

793
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,233
I will kill you…

794
01:10:16,733 --> 01:10:18,033
…with my own hands.

795
01:10:20,233 --> 01:10:21,800
If you are going to kill me,

796
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:25,300
then you should try
and be alive first.

797
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,567
Yeon-woo…

798
01:11:55,633 --> 01:11:56,700
Yeon-woo!

799
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,634
Yeon-woo… Yeon-woo!

800
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,934
No…

801
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,633
Yeon-woo… Yeon-woo!

802
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,300
Let go of me!

803
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:08,267
Yeon-woo…

804
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:10,767
Yeon-woo… Yeon-woo!

805
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:13,066
Yeon-woo! Yeon-woo…

806
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:15,633
Yeon-woo…

807
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,766
Yeon-woo…!

808
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,833
Yeon-woo…

809
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,334
Since you led our general to
great victory,

810
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,700
we will show you mercy.

811
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:37,400
(Man-wol)

812
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:21,567
I will…

813
01:14:21,633 --> 01:14:22,866
…kill you.

814
01:15:39,766 --> 01:15:40,733
Chan-sung.

815
01:15:47,633 --> 01:15:48,700
Are you alright?

816
01:15:50,866 --> 01:15:51,967
What happened?

817
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:54,567
Man-wol brought you here.

818
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,267
And you've been asleep ever since
for several days.

819
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,767
Several days? What do you mean?

820
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:00,766
You've been sleeping for
three days straight.

821
01:16:09,033 --> 01:16:10,834
Why's that there?

822
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,333
Man-wol left it there.

823
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,834
That?

824
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,966
She said it got in her way.

825
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:19,600
Is Man-wol going somewhere?

826
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,034
Wherever she goes,

827
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,200
there the luna tree will stand

828
01:17:14,266 --> 01:17:17,300
and there the hotel shall be.

829
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,866
It's gone.

830
01:18:00,966 --> 01:18:02,334
When I do leave,

831
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,400
don't be too disheartened,
Koo Chan-sung.

832
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,233
Whether this is…

833
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,033
…my shelter or my prison,

834
01:18:35,133 --> 01:18:37,266
what I have is hell.

835
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,033
And hell isn't so nice,

836
01:18:47,966 --> 01:18:49,766
when you see it together.

837
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,666
Goodbye,

838
01:19:05,733 --> 01:19:07,066
Koo Chan-sung.
