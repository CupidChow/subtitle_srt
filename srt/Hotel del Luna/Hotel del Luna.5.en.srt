(Episode 5)

8
00:00:58,933 --> 00:00:59,933
Koo Chan-sung!

9
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,166
Don't look.

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,700
And don't let her hear
you breathe, either.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,766
I heard a noise from…

12
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,033
Don't listen.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
What is it?

14
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,700
It's the guest in this room.

15
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,600
You'll go mad if you see her.

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,300
Don't ever turn back,

17
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,466
and run out the door
as soon as it opens.

18
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,633
Go.

19
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,133
Miss.

20
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:08,300
You can never open
and run out that door.

21
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,600
I apologize for interrupting
your sleep.

22
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,233
Please go back in and
have a good rest.

23
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:35,400
Your energy is overflowing
thanks to the incense.

24
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:44,334
After all those years
holed up in the closet,

25
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,266
seeing a living human
still makes you so upset, does it?

26
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,100
Do you want to go out
and vent your anger?

27
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,367
Since you're our guest,

28
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,500
I won't force you or
throw you in there.

29
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,566
I suggest you make your way
back in there quietly.

30
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,633
Koo Chan-sung.

31
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:31,933
Koo Chan-sung…

32
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:41,533
Koo Chan-sung.

33
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:44,666
Koo Chan-sung!

34
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:52,966
Koo Chan-sung…

35
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:57,800
Ms. Jang Man-wol?

36
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,433
Koo Chan-sung…

37
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,700
Koo Chan-sung…

38
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,567
Don't even try it.

39
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:11,533
You have no idea how much of
a wimp he is.

40
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:15,933
Try calling him all you want,
but he won't come back.

41
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,333
Koo Chan-sung?

42
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:27,966
Ms. Jang Man-wol!

43
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:14,200
Was that No. 3
who dashed out like mad?

44
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:16,634
Sir, even if you try squinting,

45
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,534
that wasn't
General Manager Koo Chan-sung.

46
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,500
Yes, I thought so.
From all that loose hair, I'd say…

47
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:23,466
It's the guest in room 13.

48
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,067
She left the hotel.

49
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,966
It seems our plan has failed.
This isn't good…

50
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:46,966
Koo Chan-sung.

51
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,600
It's not here anymore.

52
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,000
You can let me go.

53
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,833
You…

54
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,033
…saw it, didn't you?

55
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,666
I had a glimpse.

56
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,433
Is that why you've gone mad?

57
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:19,734
I haven't gone mad.

58
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,333
I was just so startled that
I'm having trouble calming down.

59
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:26,233
You're not hurt anywhere?

60
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,533
Are you alright, Jang Man-wol?

61
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,500
Koo Chan-sung…

62
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:38,766
Were you scared?

63
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,766
I'm just fine. No harm done.

64
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,167
Why…!

65
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,234
I say you've gone a tad bit crazy.

66
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,133
It was just a joke!

67
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,966
Were you really scared?

68
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,300
Then… what you said just now about
going mad if you see her…

69
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:00,734
You weren't joking?

70
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,700
I thought you were saying that
to scare me.

71
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:06,467
No, I wasn't joking.

72
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,700
You only lost it a little bit
because you had a glimpse.

73
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,667
But if you had seen her full on,
you would've gone completely mad.

74
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:11,733
Is that right?

75
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:16,334
She's not still here, is she?

76
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,334
Ugh, please! She ran away.

77
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,466
I thought you'd handle it.
What, you can't even manage that?

78
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,500
No, because I wasn't expecting
some wimp to

79
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,233
suddenly take courage and
jump into the room again.

80
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,233
Tsk, tsk, tsk…

81
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,400
What? Wimp?

82
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,566
Wait up!

83
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,634
Wimp?

84
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,467
By "wimp," were you referring to me
by any chance?

85
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,067
Then who else is there?

86
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:57,934
Are you stupid?

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,500
S… stupid?

88
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,467
I've never been told such a thing
in my life!

89
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,167
I am a global talent who completed
his MBA at Harvard…

90
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,233
Shut up!

91
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:09,200
That's verbal abuse.
Please correct your wording.

92
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,667
- Whatever.
- Are you kidding me?

93
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:11,767
Ghost!

94
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,900
Where? Where?

95
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:14,100
You are a wimp, alright.

96
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:19,866
Jeez, I thought
she was really there.

97
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:26,100
I'm sorry, I must've made a mistake
while burning the incense.

98
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,700
I'm glad you're alright.

99
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Sure…

100
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:36,367
Ms. Choi, how are you
managing the rooms?

101
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:39,733
What if that dangerous guest
harmed our general manager?

102
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,566
No, it's alright.
I'm sorry to make you worry.

103
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:57,700
Did you see how
I handled that crisis?

104
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,734
Now No. 3 won't ever
have a clue that

105
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,767
we sent him to that room
on purpose.

106
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,100
I don't know.

107
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,266
They say a guilty conscience
needs no accuser.

108
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:09,734
Mr. Koo must be slow to
not catch that.

109
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,700
Even the slowest idiot will have
a clue once no. 4 gets here.

110
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:16,666
We should tell Hyun-joong to
postpone contacting No. 4.

111
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,900
Yu-na, what are you doing?

112
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,733
Move it.

113
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,767
- Did you just see Yu-na?
- Yeah.

114
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,300
It must be true that
she's possessed by Su-jung.

115
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:58,134
They say she'll turn around
if you call out Su-jung.

116
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,700
- For real?
- Really?

117
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:02,034
Let's go and see!

118
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,433
- She really responds?
- That's so creepy.

119
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,600
Jung Su-jung!

120
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,367
Gosh, it must be true!

121
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,533
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- Oh what?

122
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,133
What the…

123
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
- What's going on?
- Oh what?

124
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,767
What are you doing?

125
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,834
I caught you, in case you fell.
You'd be hurt otherwise.

126
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,567
If I was, at least
they'll think I'm human.

127
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,233
Now everyone's going to
think I'm a monster.

128
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,333
Hey!

129
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,900
Wait up!

130
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:21,733
Geez, you're getting mad
at me for saving you?

131
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,900
You… How did you grab me?

132
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,500
Spirits can't just grab people.

133
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:33,200
Well, I'm no ordinary spirit.

134
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:40,900
I also have a rosary
and an amulet in here.

135
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:42,634
Be gone, evil spirit!

136
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,834
Look,

137
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,067
I'm not some spirit who will be
exorcised by the power of religion.

138
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm a spirit who has a valid excuse
to remain in this world,

139
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,500
with a job and an affiliation.

140
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,500
You must be kidding me.

141
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,867
Ghosts with jobs, really?

142
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:58,634
I'm a hotelier! I'm from Del Luna.

143
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,734
Del Luna?

144
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,100
You know our president and
our general manager, right?

145
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,200
They're the ones who helped you to
live in that body.

146
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:06,833
So what? You want me to
get out of here again?

147
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:11,400
You're a very special human.

148
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:13,233
And our special hope.

149
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,200
See, you're No. 4.

150
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:17,467
Number four?

151
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,900
Our fourth candidate for
our general manager position.

152
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,400
We had a problem with No. 3,

153
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,234
so I came to escort you,
who's next on the list.

154
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,600
I don't know what
you're talking about,

155
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,700
but in other words,
you came because you need me.

156
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,766
Yep.

157
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,800
You're a ghost,
and you even have a phone?

158
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:38,134
Of course. I have a job,
so of course I have a number.

159
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,133
I told you, I have
a valid reason to be here.

160
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,600
By the way, your school has
good signal.

161
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:48,133
No. 3 is still fine. Forget about No. 4 for now.
(Scholar Kim)

162
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,034
Oh what? You don't need me anymore?

163
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,900
For now, no.

164
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,400
But I may come back for you
very soon.

165
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,766
So…

166
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,433
Until then, be a good student.

167
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Hey!

168
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,667
Give me your number,
so I can chat with a ghost.

169
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:14,233
I've never given my number to
a living human.

170
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:17,934
So?

171
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,066
You don't want to? Or you can't?

172
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Fine, then.

173
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:41,266
Alright, we're friends now!

174
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,700
General Manager of
Hotel Del Luna, did he say?

175
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,100
Sounds like fun.

176
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,700
Mr. Ji Hyun-joong…

177
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,966
I'm so happy to see you
all sane, Mr. Koo.

178
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,500
I appreciate you receiving
me so happily.

179
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,734
But uh…

180
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,233
It seems like everyone expected me
to emerge from there, insane.

181
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,500
As long as you're still sane,
it's all good.

182
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,867
No. 4 is on standby.

183
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:40,366
Meanwhile, I've drafted up
various plans to remove No. 3.

184
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:47,134
First off, we could send him to
the spirit who is guarding

185
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,266
an abandoned house in Sincheon,
thus locking him up in there.

186
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:50,266
(The Sincheon Spirit)

187
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:57,734
If that spirit don't caught on
the local Grim Reaper,

188
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,033
it will be guaranteed
for at least 30 years.

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,667
Next is to have him meet
with a sudden death,

190
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,466
using a powerful, evil spirit.

191
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,466
(The Uijeongbu Spirit)

192
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:14,000
This spirit has a record of claiming
many lives in Uijeongbu.

193
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,100
The steel bridge he's at is nearby,
so as soon as it's decided…

194
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,433
It's alright. Forget it.

195
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,234
Koo Chan-sung isn't leaving.

196
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,234
I'm going to keep him by my side.

197
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,967
What if keeping him here
keeps on transforming the tree?

198
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,267
Old Mago sent him here deliberately.

199
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,566
You should kick him out.

200
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,400
If Old Mago had set her heart
on sending him here…

201
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,467
Will driving out one human
really change anything?

202
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,200
What if flowers start blooming
at this rate?

203
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:46,100
Flowers?

204
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,600
Let them bloom.

205
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,567
Let them bloom
and shine in all colors,

206
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:55,566
so we can see whether
the day will really come

207
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,533
when I will cross the river
by my own two feet.

208
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,667
Do you think Jang Man-wol has
decided to depart for

209
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:12,867
the underworld on a whim?

210
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:15,934
It sounded more like she meant,

211
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,834
"Like that will have the flowers
blooming!" in a daring manner.

212
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,200
If she was going to be daring,

213
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:22,834
she shouldn't have sent
No. 3 to room 13 in the first place.

214
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,867
So capricious…

215
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:26,334
Now that it's come to this,

216
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm just glad Mr. Koo is a slow man.

217
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,300
If he found out
we deliberately sent him there,

218
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:34,233
imagine how awkward things
would be right now!

219
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,334
You put me in that room
on purpose, didn't you?

220
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,766
So I'll either die or go mad.

221
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:42,967
So you're not an idiot, after all.

222
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,034
That's right.

223
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,000
Everyone's disappointed that
you walked out in one piece.

224
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,866
Ha…

225
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,700
How could you all?

226
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:56,034
I considered all of you
my colleagues,

227
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,134
and I was even starting to
take a liking to you.

228
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,367
Isn't this workplace bullying?

229
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:03,867
Is that why you've come to
tell on them?

230
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,300
So your boss can tell them all off?

231
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:07,566
It's obvious you're on their side.
So why should I bother?

232
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:14,067
You always come and ask questions,
when you already know the answer.

233
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:16,233
You're really weird, you know.

234
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:18,933
Huh?

235
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,166
Where did it go?

236
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:26,400
Koo Chan-sung,
I'm missing the other earring.

237
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:28,534
Take a look around to see
if it's been dropped anywhere.

238
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,666
You…

239
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,400
Let them off this time.

240
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:45,600
They're only jealous that
you're still alive,

241
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,967
while they're all dead.

242
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,900
Do you really take me for
an idiot?

243
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,400
Why did you do it, seriously?

244
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,766
The tree changed
ever since you came, didn't it?

245
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:59,866
They're scared that
they might have to leave.

246
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:13,800
Why did you save me, then?

247
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,634
If you had left me in there,
I would've emerged insane.

248
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,867
That's what I planned,

249
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,100
but there was this one leaf
that was on my mind.

250
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,200
Leaf?

251
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,000
- You mean this?
- Yes.

252
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,266
But that's about how much
you occupied my mind.

253
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:38,000
Does that mean I earned
this much of your heart?

254
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,067
There you go again!

255
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,467
Asking questions when
you already know everything.

256
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,367
Did they teach you to do that,
at Harvard?

257
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,500
It's the Socratic method.

258
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:47,467
Asking and answering questions to

259
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,767
approach the truth.

260
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,634
It's how the lectures are
often run at Harvard.

261
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,500
But we're not at Harvard, are we?

262
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:54,967
Just hurry up and
find me my earring.

263
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:57,767
If I do, will that add another leaf?

264
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,866
Ugh!

265
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,267
Forget it. Put that in your pocket
and don't look.

266
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,233
If you ever find it,
I'm going to kill you.

267
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:09,800
You say you'll kill me
but you have no intention to.

268
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:12,066
And you say you won't look for it,
but really, you want to.

269
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:16,067
You're actions are perverse,
and your words even more perverse.

270
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,400
Is this what happens to spirits
who've been stuck here for too long?

271
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:21,034
No, I was just born with it.

272
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,967
This is me.

273
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,433
What, you didn't see that
in your dreams?

274
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,634
You were kind. And nice.

275
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,000
Me?

276
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,934
Yes, you were extremely devoted.

277
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,500
To that man, especially.
Yeon-woo, was it?

278
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,766
So you saw Yeon-woo too?

279
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:51,033
Yes.

280
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,733
Yeon-woo!

281
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,100
You called his name
with such affection that

282
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,666
that name stayed with me
even after I woke up.

283
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,300
Why?

284
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,733
Do you think you're Yeon-woo
this time?

285
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:19,667
I considered that possibility
very briefly, but…

286
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:20,866
That's probably not the case.

287
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,300
Yeon-woo is…

288
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,100
The person who loved me
the most in the world.

289
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,133
Do you love me, Koo Chan-sung?

290
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
It's clear I'm not him.

291
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:01,766
Get out.

292
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,100
Yeon-woo…

293
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:51,766
Wol!

294
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,200
With your favorite tree,

295
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:03,534
I'm going to build a bigger house
than the biggest house I saw in town.

296
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,900
You can have it.

297
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
What?

298
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,433
You're going to build me
a house with this tree?

299
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,700
Forget it. I have no intention to
build a house to live with you.

300
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,867
Hey, you're getting old now.

301
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:19,033
You can't just
wander around forever.

302
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,933
I can't have you living in a tent
when you're old and wrinkly.

303
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,500
Who knows when we'll be
caught and killed?

304
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,100
I don't even expect to live
until that long.

305
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,966
But you can.

306
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:36,234
The fortune-teller said

307
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,734
my lifespan is
as long as this tree.

308
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,000
He said that's a hundred years,
and you can have it all.

309
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,600
If you do that,
doesn't that mean you'll die?

310
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:48,666
You're right.

311
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,467
But that's okay.

312
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,900
I don't mind dying for you.

313
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,300
You can have all the time
I have left.

314
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,634
With this, we'll find
a living match for

315
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,966
the dead lady.

316
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:01,734
The mortal who picks up
this red pouch that contains

317
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,966
a much powerful force
will become the dead lady's groom.

318
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:13,200
I hope a nice man
picks up that pouch.

319
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:15,967
Su-min…

320
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:21,033
We're marrying you off,
so you won't be lonely there.

321
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,334
No!

322
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,600
I don't want to marry
a complete stranger.

323
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,033
You're off work early today.

324
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:45,700
Yes, I was tired.

325
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:48,067
You are the type
who creates work for yourself.

326
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:51,567
It is a hotelier's duty to
care for his guests.

327
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:53,800
Did you have a change of heart?

328
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:55,900
You used to detest our hotel.

329
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:02,733
I gained the heart of
someone, you see.

330
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,000
Although I don't look it,
I'm a bit of an idiot.

331
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:08,634
When someone gives me one,
I give them ten.

332
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,400
Pardon?

333
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:11,067
If you're good to me,

334
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:13,167
I'll be extremely good to you,
in other words.

335
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,700
So please good to me.

336
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:23,767
Did he catch on?

337
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,400
What did he say?

338
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:27,600
He blackmailed me
in a roundabout way.

339
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:30,800
That it's not an eye for an eye,
but ten teeth for one tooth.

340
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:35,400
Old Mago didn't just pick anyone
after all.

341
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,366
Are you here to check in?

342
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:02,833
Please help…

343
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,033
Are you alright, Miss?

344
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:12,600
Do you think this is
the front desk?

345
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,567
Why do you keep on showing
the guests to my office,

346
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,300
instead of our rooms?

347
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:18,534
She has a story to tell.

348
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,567
Like there isn't a spirit
without a story to tell.

349
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,034
And why's she like that?
Is she drunk?

350
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,233
She says she's exhausted,
after wandering around for too long.

351
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,800
Miss, excuse me!

352
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,534
You can't do this to our staff.

353
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm alright.

354
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:38,433
Fine, then. Hold her tight
all you want.

355
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:45,900
She's being forced to
marry against her will.

356
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:48,834
She doesn't want to
marry a complete stranger,

357
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,100
nor does she want to trouble
a living man by

358
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,500
forcibly tying a knot with him.

359
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:54,700
You mean, a ghost marriage?

360
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,533
(Ghost Marriage:
Posthumous marriage)

361
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:00,734
It's all for your
bereaved family's sake,

362
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,433
so why not just get it done
before you depart?

363
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:12,667
While you make up your mind,
why not check in first?

364
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,867
We also have a wedding hall
here at our hotel.

365
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,700
If you can afford the bill,
we'll even throw a reception.

366
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:20,066
Please do consider it.

367
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,800
Let's go, then.

368
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:39,200
This won't work.
Please excuse me for this.

369
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,300
Ha…!

370
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,834
Koo Chan-sung.

371
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,567
Who knew you had the strength to
pick her up,

372
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:02,000
when you put me in a wheelbarrow
that was full of cabbages.

373
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:12,066
Anyway, a ghost marriage huh?

374
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:31,600
That guest…
Her dress was by Vera Wang.

375
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,833
In other words,
they're quite well-off.

376
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:37,500
Make preparations for the wedding.

377
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:39,100
Yes, President Jang.

378
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:42,434
That means… I have to get a dress!

379
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,900
And that means
a new set of jewelry, too.

380
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:47,234
Shoes, broaches…

381
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,733
What else do I need to buy?

382
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,900
Gosh, there's just so much to buy!

383
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:55,500
That Koo Chan-sung…

384
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:59,700
He better bring me payment for
that Mt. Paekdu painting.

385
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:39,134
Buongiorno!

386
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,867
Buongiorno, Sanchez.

387
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,334
You're up already?

388
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,134
So you managed to
get some sleep last night.

389
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,433
Yes, I had a good sleep.
No dreams this time.

390
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:50,500
Is it because I was tired?

391
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:51,867
Why? Did you buy a lottery ticket?

392
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:53,334
Were you hoping for
an auspicious dream?

393
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,567
No, there was someone
I wanted to see in my dream.

394
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:58,100
Your ex-girlfriend?

395
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:03,067
The ex-boyfriend of
a woman I know.

396
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:04,934
Or is it "ex-boyfriends?"

397
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,200
That's right, there was a call.
From your friend.

398
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:09,266
Friend?

399
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,467
Who?

400
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:12,633
Man-wol.

401
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,000
- Who?
- Man-wol, from your hotel.

402
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:19,334
Your phone kept ringing
so I just picked up.

403
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,534
Man-wol wanted me to ask you

404
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,533
when she's going to get that
payment for the painting.

405
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,734
Sanchez…

406
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,700
Did you really call Man-wol…
Man-wol?

407
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:32,600
She didn't get mad? Or yell at you?

408
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:36,867
She said she'll call me
Sanchez as well.

409
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,934
We're even friends on
social media now.

410
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,867
Anyway, about her…

411
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:44,000
How should I say it?
She's very nice and polite.

412
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,900
Don't you agree?
Is it because she's a hotelier?

413
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,700
She's just so well-mannered.

414
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:56,934
She knew.

415
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,300
That Sanchez is filthy rich.

416
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:02,600
That's why he's still alive.

417
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,400
Man-wol? Ha!

418
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,134
- Set it up like that.
- Yes, President Jang.

419
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,300
Hyun-joong.

420
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,334
You said you can play
the piano, right?

421
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,734
- Well, practice.
- Yes, ma'am!

422
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,100
I'm excited because we haven't had
a party for so long.

423
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,167
Parties are more fun
with more guests,

424
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,700
so how about we also invite
our hotel guests to the wedding?

425
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:28,200
It wouldn't feel like a wedding with
all those ghosts in here, would it?

426
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:29,934
It'd be more like a funeral.

427
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,934
Keep the numbers of guests
to a minimum.

428
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yes, ma'am.

429
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:34,967
By the way, we don't know
who's our groom yet, right?

430
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,967
Whoever's unfortunate enough to
pick up that red pouch

431
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:39,467
will be our groom.

432
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:42,800
But it looks like our bride doesn't
want this arranged marriage.

433
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:44,834
That's why Mr. Koo said
he'll find that red pouch,

434
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,567
give it back to her parents
and try to convince them.

435
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:51,000
If he's the first one to pick it up,
there'll be no wedding, right?

436
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,600
Koo Chan-sung went to look for it?

437
00:33:56,666 --> 00:34:00,267
Yes, he's a diligent man
so he probably found it by now.

438
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:03,266
But isn't it a problem if
Mr. Koo picked it up?

439
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,900
Why?

440
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,134
Uh… If Mr. Koo is the first
to pick it up,

441
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,066
does that mean that
he becomes the groom?

442
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:15,234
After all his sympathizing
with the spirits,

443
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,700
he'll be marrying one now,
it seems.

444
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:19,300
Our bride also did say she doesn't
want to marry a complete stranger,

445
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:22,034
so I assume she'll say yes
if it's Mr. Koo.

446
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,733
Isn't that great, President Jang?

447
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,334
President Jang, are you really
going to marry him off?

448
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,533
Tell him to, I don't care!

449
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,033
She said it fell somewhere
by the lake.

450
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,400
Chan-sung, are you still
looking for it?

451
00:35:05,466 --> 00:35:08,267
What are you looking for?
Let me help.

452
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,867
No, it's okay.

453
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,700
Don't mind me,
you just keep going.

454
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:12,734
Do another lap.

455
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,034
They said it was
going to rain today.

456
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,434
Then… After I do another lap,
let's go back together.

457
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
Alright.

458
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,034
What are you doing here?

459
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,134
Can't you tell? I'm on a picnic.

460
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,100
Exactly, why are you?
It's hot today.

461
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:55,267
Fine.

462
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,900
I'll answer you with your
Harvard method.

463
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,834
I'm here to watch you. Happy?

464
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,600
You… don't look for that pouch.

465
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:04,600
Just leave it.

466
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,300
Are you worried that I'll have to
marry if I pick it up?

467
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:12,067
Koo Chan-sung.
I'm against you marrying.

468
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:13,900
I just can't approve!

469
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:16,567
Leave it for someone else to
pick it up.

470
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,700
But she doesn't want to marry
a total stranger.

471
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:20,167
The person who finds it
will be shocked, too.

472
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,900
That's why I need to pick it up
so that you'll solve this situation.

473
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,866
Oh, so now you'll just count on me
to do whatever you like?

474
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,633
Are you looking for it,
using that?

475
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,600
Can you see where it is?

476
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,966
Ah! I can see it. I can see it.

477
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:55,066
Jeez, what's wrong with this?

478
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,233
Found it.

479
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,067
Koo Chan-sung,

480
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:20,300
looks like you'll be invited to
your friend's wedding.

481
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:31,766
Sanchez!

482
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:53,466
What is this?

483
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:53,133
Sanchez!

484
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,100
Where is he?

485
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:25,567
Are you alright, bro?

486
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:29,400
Is it because it was raining?
Because I'm really cold.

487
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,234
And maybe it's because
it was raining that…

488
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
I just saw something weird.

489
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,934
Chan-sung.

490
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,500
There was a weird woman
inside this house.

491
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:42,134
And I think she's still here.

492
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,366
I'm too scared. What do I do?

493
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,066
Sanchez…

494
00:39:55,766 --> 00:39:57,734
Go inside and get some sleep.

495
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,133
I'll do something about it.

496
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,534
Hello?

497
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,833
Are you Mr. Koo, general manager
at Hotel Del Luna?

498
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
Yes, that's right.

499
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:16,100
I just received a call from
your hotel that

500
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,966
you're happy to host the
wedding for our dear Su-min.

501
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:36,700
You received a call from
our hotel president?

502
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yes.

503
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,933
Did you come to confirm this?

504
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:55,933
I didn't know such
a hotel existed in Seoul.

505
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,167
Ah, you're here.

506
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:05,333
I see our general manager has done
his job well, bringing you here.

507
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,133
Now, then.
Shall we discuss the wedding?

508
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,300
This way.

509
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,834
The ceremony will be held
in this hall.

510
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,267
From the reception to
the honeymoon suite,

511
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,800
we can arrange everything
just like any other wedding.

512
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:27,767
If you'll do that for us,
we'll be able to bid farewell to

513
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,334
Su-min without worrying that
she'll be lonely.

514
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,500
We want the best of everything.

515
00:41:33,566 --> 00:41:35,234
This is for our child,

516
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,334
so we're ready to pay.

517
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,134
So… who is the groom?

518
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,567
This is a wedding
you forced upon him.

519
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:49,433
Are you sure you won't feel guilty
seeing his face?

520
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:52,500
Or what? Are you going to
congratulate him?

521
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:55,300
It's best that
we don't know each other, then.

522
00:41:55,366 --> 00:41:57,767
We'll entrust everything to you.

523
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:01,300
I'll make sure this wedding

524
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:02,933
satisfies both parties.

525
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,267
As I thought, I was right.

526
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,934
The Black Card with
no preset spending limit.

527
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,766
Shows that a parent's love
has no limit.

528
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:25,766
I'm liking this very much.

529
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:31,166
What are you going to do?

530
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:34,400
Make wedding preparations.

531
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,467
Sanchez is so shocked that
he's almost out of it.

532
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:41,434
That's because
he's too faint-hearted.

533
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,634
Which is why we should
have this wedding ASAP,

534
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,034
so we can send the bride off
on her way.

535
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,767
Will Sanchez really be okay,

536
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:48,767
once the wedding is over?

537
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,667
Yes!

538
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:52,900
It's not like she'll be
written into his family register.

539
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:55,933
This is just a short nightmare,
that's all there is.

540
00:42:57,933 --> 00:43:00,700
There's just so much to do!
I'm so busy.

541
00:43:00,766 --> 00:43:02,733
Koo Chan-sung, let's make haste.

542
00:43:07,866 --> 00:43:10,300
Will this wedding really be okay?

543
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:25,767
I'm bursting… I really am…

544
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:29,734
I really am, but I'm too scared to
go to the bathroom.

545
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,700
When is Chan-sung coming?

546
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,767
No.

547
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,500
No, no…

548
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,233
No. Yes. Yes.

549
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,000
You said you're busy,
and you're out shopping?

550
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:44,933
It's a wedding,
so it needs to be bling bling.

551
00:44:55,866 --> 00:44:57,934
Are you here to buy the ring?

552
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,600
Do we really have to go
this far for this wedding?

553
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:02,366
This one's nice, too.

554
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,067
Why do we only have ten fingers?

555
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:06,833
That means we can only wear ten.

556
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,700
What, you're here to shop
for yourself?

557
00:45:09,766 --> 00:45:11,534
You said this is all for Sanchez
and that's why you're busy,

558
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
so how can you be after
bling bling right now?

559
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:16,133
But now I have a Black Card.

560
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,134
If you're just going to nag,

561
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,933
go outside and eat some bread
while you wait.

562
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,167
Gosh, I only have one neck
so I can only wear one.

563
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:35,433
The trend these days is
to layer them.

564
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,300
I like the sound of that!

565
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:39,500
Bring me more.

566
00:45:42,466 --> 00:45:45,967
Her parents didn't give you
that card so you can be bling bling.

567
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:47,500
It's so the wedding is a success.

568
00:45:47,566 --> 00:45:48,634
Exactly.

569
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,400
This is all for the wedding.

570
00:45:51,466 --> 00:45:55,734
Because the more they spend
for this wedding,

571
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,700
the more content
and assured they'll be.

572
00:45:57,766 --> 00:46:00,367
This is why you let the wedding
go ahead, isn't it?

573
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:02,634
Return the card to them.
Meanwhile, I'll burn the pouch.

574
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,634
Do whatever you want.

575
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,034
But if you do,
your friend will have to live with

576
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,400
a ghost bride all his life.

577
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:12,367
That red pouch contains
a powerful force.

578
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:15,834
That's what bound them together
with the red string of fate.

579
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,434
So if you burn it…

580
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,033
the bride will never pass over to
the underworld.

581
00:46:21,366 --> 00:46:24,467
If they're bound by some string,
why can't you just sever it?

582
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:27,434
What, am I God?
Do you know how hard that is?

583
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,167
Just marry them off,
and bid her off.

584
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:33,534
That's the best our hotel can do.

585
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,566
This way, Miss.

You really were here.

596
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,600

I…

598
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,200
I'm Koo Chan-sung from
Hotel Del Luna.

599
00:47:56,266 --> 00:47:57,867
When we met in the subway,

600
00:47:57,933 --> 00:47:59,733
you told me to come find you here.

601
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:05,567
Oh.

602
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,867
That wasn't me.

603
00:48:07,933 --> 00:48:09,566
That's my eldest sister.

604
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:12,734
Sis!

605
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,166
It's so lovely out today!

606
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,766
Who…?

607
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:24,200
He's come looking for
our eldest sister, from Del Luna.

608
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:26,934
Oh, Del Luna!

609
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,800
She goes there to pick
flowers pretty often, huh?

610
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,800
You must be twins….

611
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:35,300
No, triplets.

612
00:48:37,866 --> 00:48:40,466
There are more besides us three.

613
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,600
So, what business do you have
with our eldest sister?

614
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:55,734
A posthumous wedding at Del Luna?

615
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,034
The bride doesn't want to
marry against her will,

616
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,000
and the groom is shivering in fear.

617
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,466
Is there a way, perhaps?

618
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,000
As your president said,

619
00:49:06,066 --> 00:49:08,067
the safest way for
the groom who's still alive,

620
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:11,333
is to hold the wedding
and send the bride off.

621
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:15,500
Then I guess there's no option
but to go ahead with it.

622
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:18,734
Ah! You could also
find another groom.

623
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,200
Not from among the living,

624
00:49:20,266 --> 00:49:23,600
but among the dead.

625
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,234
But where will I find a dead groom?

626
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,133
There are the guests at
your hotel, isn't there?

627
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:33,034
Yes, you're right!

628
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,100
Right?

629
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:38,367
Why don't the bride pick
the man of her choice,

630
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,600
and give him the red pouch?

631
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:44,300
Then once they're matched up,
they can hold hands

632
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:46,767
and depart for
the underworld together.

633
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,600
Alright, we'll do that.

634
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:50,633
Thank you. I'll be on my way now.

635
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:57,666
You there.

tiring, isn't it?

637
00:50:01,533 --> 00:50:03,266
I bet you haven't been
sleeping well, either.

638
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:05,300
Try this.

639
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:06,866
It should help.

640
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:14,034
This is ssanghwatang,
a herbal drink.

641
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,166
Thank you.

642
00:50:22,266 --> 00:50:26,034
Our second eldest sister must have
taken a liking to you.

643
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,934
That potion is very special.

644
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,934
You should be full of energy
even after sleeping a wink.

645
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,200
Oh, really?

646
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,700
Thank you.

647
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,833
Sure.

648
00:50:42,566 --> 00:50:45,567
Here's a shortlist of all our guests
who died single.

649
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:46,633
Alright.

650
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,267
I'll have to visit every one to see

651
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,234
if they have any intention to
get married.

652
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,033
Let's start with
our guest in room 507.

653
00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:00,000
I'm sorry to interrupt.

654
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:03,466
Would you be interested in
going on a blind date?

655
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:09,467
We'll now start the matchmaking

656
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,466
with Ms. Lee Su-min and
our five gentlemen.

657
00:51:16,066 --> 00:51:17,267
Why are you sitting over there?

658
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:19,300
I've always wanted to get married.

659
00:51:19,366 --> 00:51:21,366
Hotel employees are not
allowed to participate. Get out.

660
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:23,466
Out.

661
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:25,300
Oh what?

662
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:27,000
But I even got changed.

663
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:28,300
It's always a no for me
with these things.

664
00:51:28,366 --> 00:51:30,367
Let's continue, then.

665
00:51:30,433 --> 00:51:32,633
Due to time constraints,
I can't give you much time

666
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:35,500
but please do exchange
short greetings

667
00:51:35,566 --> 00:51:37,234
and have an honest,
deep conversation about

668
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,400
what you used to do
when you were still alive.

669
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,534
Goodness, that Koo Chan-sung…

670
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,733
He just had to do something
unnecessary again.

671
00:51:57,933 --> 00:52:03,467
At least our bride now gets to
choose the man she'd like to marry.

672
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:06,966
Well… I wonder if
she'll find her groom there.

673
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:13,066
As for me, I like this one.

674
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:21,167
As you saw,

675
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:23,933
my friend is too faint-hearted,
so a wedding's too much for him.

676
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:28,900
The best I can do for you is to
choose among them

677
00:52:28,966 --> 00:52:30,900
and depart for
the underworld with him.

678
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:42,800
Please keep to your allocated time.

679
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:45,234
Let's start with table no. 1.

680
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,067
After everyone's had a turn,
our bride will hand the red pouch

681
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:49,133
to the man of her choice.

682
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,066
Let's start, then.

683
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Huh?

684
00:53:32,466 --> 00:53:33,900
Please accept it.

685
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,000
If I marry any one of them,
I'll have to go with them.

686
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:39,234
But I want to go alone.

687
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,433
So you accept it,
since you're still alive.

688
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:45,366
But I…

689
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:49,734
If you don't want that,
I'll just proceed as planned.

690
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,966
Bring me your friend.

691
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,300
What?

692
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:25,334
She chose who as her groom?

693
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,400
She wants to marry Mr. Koo.

694
00:54:27,466 --> 00:54:30,166
He accepted too, so now they're
getting ready for the wedding.

695
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:36,334
Will you be the celebrant, then?

696
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,000
Ji Hyun-joong, go to
No. 4 right now!

697
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:41,066
Why?

698
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,334
Are you going to send Mr. Koo
to the underworld

699
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,866
with his new bride?

700
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:06,433
I really don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

701
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:14,767
Alright, let's just say
this a dream.

702
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,267
This is just a dream,
it doesn't mean anything,

703
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,433
and all will disappear
once I wake up.

704
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:33,933
Alright.

705
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,466
This will be a short dream.

706
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,067
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

707
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:49,133
Are you getting married?

708
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:51,934
What are you on about?

709
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,900
I thought you're the one
who's getting married.

710
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,566
(Groom Prep Room)

711
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,167
I must've been really dreaming
just now, then.

712
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:05,300
Koo Chan-sung.

713
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:08,100
How could you decide on getting
married without my permission?

714
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:11,200
Why do I need your permission when
it's me who's getting married?

715
00:57:11,266 --> 00:57:14,634
So you're really going to
go ahead with this wedding?

716
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,167
That's why you should've
helped her from the start

717
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,100
when she came to you,
saying she didn't want this.

718
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,267
Do you really think
she doesn't want to get married?

719
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:25,300
No!

720
00:57:25,366 --> 00:57:28,166
That spirit is desperate to
get married!

721
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,134
The powerful force that's
contained in here…

722
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,366
It's her strong desire to be wed,
before she departs this world!

723
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,166
What a beautiful bride.

724
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:06,166
I heard there's a wedding
at Del Luna, so I dropped by.

725
00:58:09,933 --> 00:58:14,533
This is a wedding gift for
our new bride.

726
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,433
Remember, happiness is
the reason for marriage.

727
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,100
Koo Chan-sung.

728
00:58:37,733 --> 00:58:39,967
I'll protect you this time, too.

729
00:58:40,033 --> 00:58:41,800
You don't have to marry
against your will.

730
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,934
Then what about this?

731
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,900
You said you can't get rid of it.

732
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:48,633
We'll have to get her married,
as she wishes.

733
00:58:49,366 --> 00:58:54,300
I'm going to bring her real groom,

734
00:58:54,366 --> 00:58:56,133
who she can't leave behind.

735
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,866
This is your girlfriend, isn't it?

736
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,333
Apparently, your girlfriend is
marrying some other man.

737
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:22,300
Excuse me, but you shouldn't joke
about something like this.

738
00:59:22,866 --> 00:59:24,034
I'm not joking.

739
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,234
If you want to stop her,

740
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,166
you'll have to go
and marry her yourself.

741
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:30,700
(Hotel Del Luna)

742
00:59:49,066 --> 00:59:53,833
I brought the groom
you truly desired.

743
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:59,900
This is how outstanding
our service is.

744
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:03,734
You get to marry your love,

745
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,133
whom you just can't leave behind.

746
01:00:08,733 --> 01:00:12,600
You must be very happy.

747
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:19,800
He'll be here soon.

748
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:20,333
Su-min…

749
01:02:34,033 --> 01:02:36,834
Once the wedding is over,

750
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,466
he'll die.

751
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:51,366
The bride will drag her groom to
the underworld, in other words.

752
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:57,700
I wonder if Koo Chan-sung
noticed it.

753
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:17,734
No wonder they were
so desperate to

754
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,467
find anyone to hold
a posthumous wedding for her.

755
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:22,066
His parents, I mean.

756
01:03:22,733 --> 01:03:25,633
"His" parents? Not "her" parents?

757
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,467
It's the groom's parents
who commissioned the wedding.

758
01:03:29,533 --> 01:03:33,266
In case that woman
takes their son with her.

759
01:03:38,766 --> 01:03:40,967
Su-min's dead.

760
01:03:41,033 --> 01:03:43,300
You mustn't follow after her.

761
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:57,100
This… This won't come off.

762
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:02,834
Su-min, please let
my son go. Please!

763
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,466
Please let him go.

764
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:38,300
Ms. Lee Su-min, stop!
You mustn't do this.

765
01:04:58,133 --> 01:04:59,933
Let's be together, forever.

766
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,600
Ms. Lee Su-min,
that man is still alive.

767
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:17,233
Please stop this instance!

768
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,133
Ms. Lee Su-min!

769
01:05:44,233 --> 01:05:45,333
No…

770
01:05:49,766 --> 01:05:51,200
We should stop.

771
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:53,633
Go back.

772
01:05:55,066 --> 01:05:56,400
What is it, Su-min?

773
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,400
Go!

774
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:07,800
Su-min…

775
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,900
It takes greater love to let go,

776
01:07:43,966 --> 01:07:47,833
than to hold on.

777
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,466
I love you.

778
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:54,600
May you be happy.

779
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,100
This is much more awesome
than I thought.

780
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:10,767
I'm happy to work as
a general manager right away.

781
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:13,134
Not just yet.
We still have Mr. Koo.

782
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,267
Then I'll start out as
an intern for now.

783
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:17,000
Get me an internship.

784
01:10:19,033 --> 01:10:20,200
Um, friend?

785
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:22,234
It's already too late.

786
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,800
Students need to get some sleep
for another day at school.

787
01:10:27,233 --> 01:10:28,233
My friend?

788
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,266
My friend!

789
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:43,400
I'm sorry for being so vulgar
with you.

790
01:10:43,466 --> 01:10:44,767
I'm sure you didn't survive
all these years

791
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:46,933
since the Tang Dynasty, right?

792
01:11:49,266 --> 01:11:50,433
Mi-ra…

793
01:11:51,966 --> 01:11:53,434
It's been a long time.

794
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,433
I'm here to Chan-sung.

795
01:12:01,933 --> 01:12:05,100
Thanks for helping me to
cut the red string.

796
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:07,300
I hope you leave in peace.

797
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,933
Those scissors belong to
the Third Sister, huh?

798
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,634
Did she drop by at our hotel
without me knowing?

799
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,266
Old Mago has come to
visit him, has she?

800
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:27,200
Now they're all helping out
Koo Chan-sung, are they?

801
01:12:27,266 --> 01:12:29,900
It's you whom Old Mago is helping.

802
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:35,500
You'll be departing this world
with him bidding you farewell.

803
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,500
At the previous hotel,

804
01:13:49,566 --> 01:13:52,300
I'd feel a sense of achievement
every time I sent off my guests,

805
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,433
but here… it's quite saddening.

806
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,200
Because I know that
I'll never see them again.

807
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,733
Koo Chan-sung.

808
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:06,866
You're doing a good job.

809
01:14:08,233 --> 01:14:10,367
Old Mago has chosen well.

810
01:14:10,433 --> 01:14:11,900
No wonder you're being spoiled.

811
01:14:13,066 --> 01:14:15,100
You knew I met her?

812
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,666
She told me to look after you.

813
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:27,100
So that you'll bud sprouts
and bloom flowers.

814
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,200
You…

815
01:14:33,866 --> 01:14:36,100
You're still seeing me
in your dreams, aren't you?

816
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:57,900
Yes.

817
01:15:02,233 --> 01:15:05,467
Take a good look
and take good care of me,

818
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:09,166
until you send me off well.

819
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:11,766
As God wills it.

820
01:15:18,633 --> 01:15:21,534
I'll be your last guest,

821
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,033
because I like you
just the way you are.

822
01:15:34,233 --> 01:15:35,466
Koo Chan-sung.

823
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:40,433
When time comes to send me off,

824
01:15:42,533 --> 01:15:44,300
don't be too sad.

825
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:48,100
(Hotel Del Luna)

826
01:16:48,366 --> 01:16:50,167
Um, he's not picking up.

827
01:16:50,233 --> 01:16:51,000
Who's here, did you say?

828
01:16:51,066 --> 01:16:53,400
Your Majesty!

829
01:16:53,466 --> 01:16:54,800
He was dressed like
a King of Joseon.

830
01:16:54,866 --> 01:16:56,200
So which king, is he?

831
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,200
I'm extremely worried.

832
01:16:58,266 --> 01:16:59,400
Why are you doing this to me?

833
01:16:59,466 --> 01:17:01,634
Because you're not just anyone!

834
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,367
At this rate,
you might get kicked…

835
01:17:03,433 --> 01:17:04,400
You're doing very well.

836
01:17:04,466 --> 01:17:06,634
One, two, three! We can do this!

837
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:07,800
I hate poverty.

838
01:17:07,866 --> 01:17:10,400
I'm going to continue to have
champagne and caviar.

839
01:17:10,466 --> 01:17:11,600
He has a girlfriend?

840
01:17:11,666 --> 01:17:13,167
- I have her picture…
- Enough, shut up!

841
01:17:13,233 --> 01:17:14,700
Why are you telling me this?

842
01:17:14,766 --> 01:17:15,900
Is she pretty?
