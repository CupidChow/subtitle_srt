00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:45,167
(Episode 4)
You probably have things you miss from

8
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:46,700
those moments that
you can't return to, too.

9
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,700
Well, I think I've seen them.

10
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:55,366
I said you were in my dreams.

11
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:56,800
Dream?

12
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:59,966
You were smiling.
Under a big tree.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,500
When someone said
he'll build you a house,

14
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,800
you were being sarcastic
just like you were now,

15
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,400
but still, looked happy.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,633
The person who taught you
how to write "Man-wol."

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,834
Is it him you miss the most

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,200
from those years, long ago?

19
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,033
Why do you…

20
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,566
…see such dreams?

21
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:29,167
Why am I seeing you in my dreams?

22
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,466
I'm scared I might have to
pay a price for that now.

23
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:37,800
What is your heart
still holding onto?

24
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:39,433
Perhaps…

25
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,800
I'm here, beside you,

26
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:45,500
so you can let go of
whatever it is you're holding onto.

27
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:53,333
You're not dead yet.

28
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,200
You're bound to the luna tree,

29
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:59,833
frozen in time
between life and death.

30
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,400
Once the buds sprout and
the flowers bloom and wilt,

31
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:08,833
time will start flowing again.

32
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,333
Something just happened to
the tree.

33
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:15,966
You're right.

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,667
Perhaps you're…

35
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:22,000
More special than being just
our zeroth candidate.

36
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,634
I can't go, not just yet!

37
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,334
If I go, what about my Soon-dol?

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,834
Death waits for no one.

39
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,067
What?

40
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,533
Well, I won't hear it. Nope!

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,934
Come on, you! Bark!

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,567
Bark, so you can live!

43
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,833
If you just stay here,
you'll die, too!

44
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,233
Come on, you…

45
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:11,633
Bark! Bark, so you can live!

46
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:17,267
It's been a week,
and he won't leave.

47
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,600
He can't help it, that's why.

48
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:24,600
At a time like this, it doesn't help
to open a door for him.

49
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:33,367
Soon-dol, go!

50
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:34,867
Go out that door!

51
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,700
Come on, you!

52
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,733
Go out that door! That door!

53
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:40,834
Leave him here.

54
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,600
He won't wander around
for too long.

55
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,500
If it comes to worst,
he'll find Manwoldang.

56
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,900
It's not Manwoldang anymore,
but Hotel Del Luna.

57
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,267
Oh, that's right.

58
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,134
Manwoldang, Manwolgwan,
and Del Luna.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,867
Despite all those name changes,

60
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:59,134
the owner herself won't change.

61
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,800
She's been the same for
over a thousand years.

62
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,867
There's no hope for her.

63
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:07,300
That's why I sent someone
in there.

64
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,233
Are you going to invite
a new owner?

65
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,966
I opened a door for that
obstinate Man-wol, too.

66
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,934
Why did it change like this?

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,734
Why else? Because of you.

68
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
You mean I did this?

69
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:34,367
A piece of shriveled up memory

70
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,900
just resurfaced, because of you.

71
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,600
What did I do, anyway?

72
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,500
I was only complaining to you about

73
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,167
how you'd keep appearing
in my dreams.

74
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:44,467
My responsibilities end at
seeing ghosts,

75
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,734
and they have nothing to
do with my dreams.

76
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
I don’t want to have to
pay a price for

77
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:50,700
a task that was entrusted to me
against my will.

78
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,400
You'll have to,
even if it's unfair.

79
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,666
Because you already triggered me.

80
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,567
Thanks to you, it's now
a hideous green.

81
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,900
I know you're a cynic,
but get your words straight.

82
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,667
You should really be saying
it's now back to life.

83
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,966
That's…!

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,533
…exactly the problem.

85
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:14,466
You brought something back to life
that shouldn't have been.

86
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,734
Seeing you mad like this must mean

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,933
what I saw in my dream is
really your past.

88
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,366
Are you embarrassed that I got
a peek at your past?

89
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,166
Yes.

90
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,266
I'm so ashamed that
my face is pale-blue.

91
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,433
That's why I need to
confirm it for myself.

92
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,900
What are you doing?

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,066
This is really not the way to go.

94
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,700
Just stay like this!

95
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,934
Let's not do this.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,600
Koo Chan-sung, let's go to bed.

97
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:02,766
Ms. Jang Man-wol…

98
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,300
You can't see dreams
unless you go to bed first.

99
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:08,234
I need to confirm it for myself

100
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,367
whether you really did see me
in your dreams or

101
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:13,000
whether you're mocking me with what
you've picked up here and there.

102
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,466
Koo Chan-sung, go to sleep.

103
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,300
You can't expect me to
fall asleep like this.

104
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:21,500
Besides, even if I do,

105
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,000
it's not like
I have dreams every night.

106
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:25,966
Alright, then. Sleep right
next to me until you do.

107
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,534
I don’t want to sleep next to you.

108
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,233
Shut up and sleep,
while I say it nicely!

109
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,334
Fine.

110
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,334
I'll sleep.

111
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,534
You just do whatever you want,
be it sleeping next to me

112
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,700
or watching me sleep.

113
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,200
If you were making it up,
I'm going to kill you.

114
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:47,500
You mean you wish
I was making it all up.

115
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,633
Because you don't want me
seeing your past.

116
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,267
Well, since you hate it so much

117
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,134
I won't say anything
even if I do see something.

118
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,166
So kill me or be done,
do whatever you want.

119
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,366
Forget it, I'm not going to
sleep next to you.

120
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,100
The memories I reminded…

121
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,766
Are they that painful?

122
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:38,300
Because of that man? Because you
can't stop thinking about him?

123
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:41,367
If you don’t want to turn
black and blue, shut your mouth.

124
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,900
Who is that man?

125
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,566
Why? You think you're him?

126
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:53,167
I thought maybe, yes.

127
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,466
What I'm seeing could be
the past I don't remember.

128
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:01,034
There's no way you're him.

129
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,634
Why not?

130
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,333
You've been on my mind
ever since I dreamt about you.

131
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,700
I think we may be bound
by some kind of fate.

132
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,700
You're not him.

133
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,734
You're as calm as a millpond.

134
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,733
If you really were him,
there's no way.

135
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,900
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

136
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,800
The thought that I may be
someone you loved was

137
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,433
making me feel uncomfortable.

138
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,200
You did love him, right?

139
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,667
It seemed like it.

140
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,634
And very much, too.

141
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,300
Koo Chan-sung.

142
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,300
The more nonsense you blabber,

143
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,000
the more you'll have to pay.

144
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,234
Pay? What?

145
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,100
What, you're not going to pay me?

146
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,433
- But I even signed a contract.
- Koo Chan-sung!

147
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,000
From today onward,

148
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,066
start accepting spirits.

149
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,266
How long has it been
since you died?

150
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,634
You must have been
wandering around for long.

151
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,267
Let me help you to check in.

152
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,834
I'll make sure you see
a beautician right away, too.

153
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,800
This way, please.
Take the elevator up.

154
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,634
What is it?

155
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,500
President Jang's still mad,
after all that champagne?

156
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:24,400
I must triggered her,
because she exploded.

157
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,600
Um…

158
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,067
About
President Jang Man-wol's sin…

159
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:33,900
Is it something to do
with a love affair?

160
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,167
I'm not too sure myself.

161
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:38,534
You've heard nothing about
how President Jang Man-wol is

162
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,734
waiting for someone?

163
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,200
No, I haven't.

164
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:43,566
Is that so?

165
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,834
But isn't she waiting for him?

166
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,467
Mr. Koo.

167
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,400
President Jang has been
on your mind, has she?

168
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,767
No, not at all.

169
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,500
President Jang's not the type to
wait for her other two candidates.

170
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:02,667
Besides, who cares if
you were her third choice?

171
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:03,800
You're already here.

172
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:05,267
Mr. Ji Hyun-joong.

173
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,100
I don't care about
President Jang Man-wol at all,

174
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,333
and I was never her third choice.

175
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:13,767
I was her zeroth choice. Zeroth!

176
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,200
Zeroth… Oh, sure.

177
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,433
- I really was!
- Sure. Zeroth.

178
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
What if I was her zeroth choice?

179
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,600
I feel nothing.

180
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:29,934
Why do I feel this chill
down my spine?

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,500
I think we may be expecting
a crowd, soon.

182
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:33,866
Will you be okay?

183
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,433
Not at all.

184
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,667
When our guests first arrive,

185
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,067
some have broken bits
and tears here and there.

186
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,800
And some even come with
an extra bit, sometimes.

187
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:52,000
Still, you should be fine here
as everyone's been made up.

188
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
I can deal with this much
without being startled now.

189
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,766
Can I get a refill?

190
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,034
Ah, we're out of beans.

191
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,466
Please wait, and
we'll bring it right over.

192
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,900
Where are all the foods and
beverages sourced from?

193
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,867
You can't possibly get them from
your local supermarket.

194
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,034
They come from the underworld.

195
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,900
We get paid commission for

196
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:27,667
serving our guests with
great hospitality

197
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,367
until they depart and arrive safely
in the underworld.

198
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,834
So the spirits pay you, then?

199
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,267
They leave behind positive energy.

200
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,167
And that energy is what makes
the flowers in the garden bloom.

201
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,366
The less regret they leave behind,
the more beautiful they bloom.

202
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,400
Once the garden is
full of blooming flowers,

203
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:44,500
Old Mago comes for them.

204
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:48,667
In return, she brings what we need
from the underworld.

205
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,234
Oh.

206
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,234
Then why does President Jang
have the need to

207
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,700
make money through spirits?

208
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:01,200
For self-indulgence.

209
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,634
It's purely for her own champagne,

210
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,467
her expensive clothes,
jewelry and car.

211
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:09,300
How is that the attitude of
someone who's being punished, huh?

212
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,500
You said she's currently
being punished, didn't you?

213
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,300
Someone told me that
I'm proud and foolish.

214
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:21,666
Though I won't admit that.

215
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,533
I saw you in my dreams.

216
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:41,934
Once the buds sprout and
the flowers bloom and wilt,

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,666
time will start flowing again.

218
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:51,566
That old hag had to play
a damn prank on me.

219
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:57,666
The man who taught you
how to write "Man-wol."

220
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,933
Is it him you miss the most

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,233
from those years, long ago?

222
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:18,766
Oh what?

223
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,367
A slave has run away!

224
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,100
She's with a whole gang. Find him!

225
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,700
Who ran away this time?

226
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,900
She's not in here.
Look elsewhere.

227
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,067
I heard news that
the market that trades

228
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:59,000
slaves from
Goguryeo was plundered.

229
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,533
I thought it might be the work of
your lot, so came to have a look.

230
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:04,667
Thank goodness for my reflexes,

231
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,400
otherwise I would have
died by your hands, Sister.

232
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:12,100
It's thanks to my reflexes
that you're still alive.

233
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,866
Well, thank you very much.

234
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,633
But what about this?

235
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,300
My face is worth gold.

236
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:23,067
How will you pay for this, then?

237
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,200
That's too bad.

238
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,934
The Princess quite liked that face.

239
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
How will you win her over now?

240
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,933
Do you think it's only my face
that she likes?

241
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,834
Don't be such a wuss.

242
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,867
Let go! Let go of me!

243
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:47,467
Let go! Hey, let go!

244
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,534
Shut up!

245
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,200
What are you doing?
Drag them over here!

246
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,234
Come on, get up!

247
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,767
Why you bastards…!

248
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,267
Let go! Let go of me!

249
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,366
Yeon-woo…

250
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:58,466
Yeon-woo!

251
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,334
Let go of me!

252
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,266
Yeon-woo! That's Yeon-woo!

253
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,866
- Let go!
- Quiet!

254
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:09,933
If you go out there now,
you'll be caught, too.

255
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,434
I promise.

256
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,200
I'll save him and
bring him to you.

257
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,266
I promise.

258
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:47,800
Yeon-woo…

259
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,433
Yeon-woo!

260
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:11,866
Are you alright?

261
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm alright.

262
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,567
You've been waiting for him here

263
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,500
for all these years, haven't you?

264
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,834
Really…

265
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,200
It's a horrendous green now.

266
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:56,233
It really makes me laugh.

267
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,066
Yeon-woo.

268
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,133
So one of them is Yeon-woo.

269
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:40,300
The man who was
in the same ring as Man-wol.

270
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,567
Uh… is that for sale?

271
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:03,400
How much is it? I'll take one.

272
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,567
No, it's fine.

273
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:08,033
I already gave you one.

274
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,800
Your father almost died
picking flowers, huh?

275
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:25,800
Thanks to that, he amended his ways
and lived an honest life.

276
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:29,133
And raised his son so well, too.

277
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,267
Flowers!

278
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,366
That's right, flowers make
the perfect birthday gift!

279
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,333
You were that…

280
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:43,033
So, how do you like the hotel?

281
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,033
It was your doing?

282
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,367
I merely opened the door,
that's what I did.

283
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:54,234
You mean, it wasn't by coincidence
that you were passing by?

284
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,500
You know, I planted a tree

285
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:05,000
and it's just standing there
with a nasty temper.

286
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:09,066
Why don't you look after it for me?

287
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,233
And when you do get tired
looking after it,

288
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,800
come see me.

(To the Styx)

290
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:38,066
Excuse me!

291
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,300
Wait!

292
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:47,533
Sir.

293
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:53,534
Soon-dol, you…!

294
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Why did you come here, huh?

295
00:23:56,833 --> 00:24:00,000
You're not supposed to
come here, alright?

296
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,100
You…

297
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:05,966
I said, this is no place for you.

298
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:15,467
He died alone.
It must've been a few days.

299
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:18,300
The door's open,
so why didn't he go out?

300
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:19,666
That's strange.

301
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,534
You… you're not
supposed to be here.

302
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
You poor thing.

303
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,467
You…

304
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,100
Alright, come with me.

305
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,433
You come with me.

Old Mago gathers flowers
and hands them out to

308
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,334
those who are on their way to
the underworld.

309
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,000
They say those who are bid
farewell by her

310
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,200
go to a good place.

311
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,234
That lady just now…

312
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,666
Was she Lady Mago?

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,733
Chan-sung! Chan-sung,
come out here and take a look!

315
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,800
Koo Chan-sung!

316
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,300
Chan-sung! I just bought
some amazing bread.

317
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:26,300
Apparently, a ghost was spotted
at our local bakery!

318
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:29,366
They say the ghost kneaded the dough
so I lined up to buy some.

319
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:32,167
Sanchez, don't tell me
these things.

320
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:35,000
I don't want to have to hear
about ghosts, even at home.

321
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:36,634
You know, if this bread was
really baked by a ghost,

322
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,233
I bet it followed me to here.

323

Why are you here?

324
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:44,933
Why did you come here again?

325
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:46,800
Chan-sung.

326
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:48,066
What is it? You're scaring me.

327
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,066
There's no ghost around here.
Only bread.

328
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:52,766
Did you follow him?

329
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,533
You followed the bread?

330
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,067
Chan-sung, I'm sorry about
those unnecessary details.

331
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:04,800
Let's just eat bread, alright?

332
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:06,500
I'm fine, you have it all.

333
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,400
It looks like
I have to get back to work.

334
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,434
Chan-sung! If you act like that,

335
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,100
I feel bad about
having this bread now.

336
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:44,000
Our third choice brought back
a guest who stepped out.

337
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:47,234
Apparently, she went out and
baked some bread.

338
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,367
She can't just do that…

339
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:53,334
She was due to get on the limo
to the underworld today, huh?

340
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,867
Yes, but the general manager has

341
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,534
just gone to see President Jang to
change that reservation.

342
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Did she want some bread before
she left forever, or what?

343
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:04,067
She can't eat bread from
the mortal world, anyway.

344
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,434
Why did she go to a bakery,
instead of calling for room service?

345
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,034
Hyun-joong, can't you keep
an eye on our guests?

346
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,400
Do you want to board the bus
to the underworld, too?

347
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:15,300
We had a whole group
checking in yesterday,

348
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:17,567
so my mind was all over the place.

349
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:19,066
Get it right!

350
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,900
She's so harsh…

351
00:28:30,966 --> 00:28:31,667
Right?

352
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:33,900
How can she say that about
boarding the bus?

353
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:35,867
Yes, that was too harsh.

354
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:38,200
Why is she all edgy today?

355
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:41,034
Ah, it's the 25th soon.

356
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,467
It's already that time of
the year, is it?

357
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:44,034
I hope it passes by quietly
once again this year.

358
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,134
I hope so, too.

359
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,634
If we see anything like
what happened 42 years ago,

360
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,233
Lady Choi will be dragged to the
underworld for sure this time.

361
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:03,700
Ugh, she's a ghost.

362
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:06,033
We can't have ghosts wandering
around the mortal world.

363
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:08,634
Since she didn't do much,

364
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,834
just tell her to leave today,
as scheduled.

365
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,333
Please sign here,

366
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,466
so we can change that schedule.

367
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:15,466
(Confirmation of Schedule Change)

368
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,966
She says there's someone
she desperately wants to see.

369
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,433
Like there isn't any spirit
who doesn't have anyone like that!

370
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,734
She's never seen this person
while she was alive,

371
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,233
that's why she wants to
go and see him.

372
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,367
Because she was blind
when she was alive.

373
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,367
Why does she want to see him
if she's never seen him before?

374
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:35,934
Plus, she doesn't even
know his name!

375
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,300
Why look for someone
who she doesn't even know?

376
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:40,933
Just quit it, and go away.
Don’t bug me.

377
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,667
She remembers his hands.

378
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:45,000
She says she'll be able to tell
the feel of his hands.

379
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,234
It's just nonsense from
a spirit. So go.

380
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,433
Leave!

381
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:57,300
Then was what you said
nonsense, too?

382
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
You said you could just tell.

383
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,600
That there's no way I'm him.

384
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,666
That means you
don’t know either, then.

385
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:09,800
You…

386
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,066
You're not him.
There's just no way.

387
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:23,066
That makes me right, so sign here.

388
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,366
Ugh!

389
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:57,766
(Jang Man-wol)

390
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,334
I'll send her off once she finds
who she wants to see.

391
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,600
She's the first guest
I brought here,

392
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,100
so I want to make sure
she leaves in comfort.

393
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,667
Don't ever think about
ripping money off her.

394
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:22,466
She's not that well-to-do.

395
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,267
Then why do this,
if it won't bring in any money?

396
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,167
That ghost is using you.

397
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:32,733
Look at you, you're such a wimp that
the spirits are using you.

398
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,034
I know, right?

399
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,067
If I had hung in there,
I wouldn't have ended up here.

400
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:40,334
It's really unfortunate that
I'm so fragile

401
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,700
that you just had to like
everything about me.

402
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:45,366
- Are you being sarcastic?
- I'm saying this must be my fate.

403
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,100
Well, it's not so unfortunate for me

404
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,066
that I dragged you into this.

405
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:56,500
Do you think it was your doing?

406
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,700
They say you are the master
of your destiny.

407
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:02,234
It could actually be that
I chose to end up here,

408
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,933
instead of you dragging me here.

409
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,867
Drink.

410
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:10,533
You need to drink as much as
you drank to stay hydrated.

411
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,967
I'll bring you some bread, too.

412
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:19,600
Apparently, that bakery is
quite well-known.

413
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:22,700
That Kim Jun-hyun you're a fan of
has been there, too.

414
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,367
If you want, we can even play that
"Can I have a bite" game.

415
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:26,767
Why are you being so nice?

416
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,300
It's making me uneasy.

417
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:30,666
Are you being sarcastic,
in a nice way?

418
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,034
I'm looking after you.

419
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,200
If I give you bread and water,

420
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:36,300
who knows.

421
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,300
That tree started budding,
so it might even flower.

422
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,200
Don't.

423
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:43,700
Do you think I'm some sprouts
that start budding

424
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:45,266
if you water it regularly?

425
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,933
I'm a shriveled-up tree
that's a thousand years old.

426
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:53,000
You've started budding.
I think it's worth a chance.

427
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,434
Why are you doing this?
It’s creeping me out.

428
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,367
You can't help but
think about me, huh?

429
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,100
You said you're unaffected,
but I guess that's not so true.

430
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:06,533
Why that…!

431
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:08,866
Hey! Hey you, Koo Chan-sung!

432
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,634
Just don't, okay?

433
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,700
Stop coming here.

434
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:14,667
Why not? I have work to do.

435
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:16,300
You don't have to here come anymore!

436
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,600
I'll let you go.

437
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,134
I've nowhere else to go.

438
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,167
Thanks to you, after leaving
my last job like that

439
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,967
my reputation is rock-bottom.
So I can't just go back.

440
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:25,767
There are many other hotels
that Forbes like, aren't there?

441
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:29,000
They wanted me before
they found out I see ghosts.

442
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:30,534
Not anymore.

443
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,333
Besides, you have no one else
other than me.

444
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:35,767
You were our third choice.

445
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:36,767
There were two others before you,

446
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,000
and many more who are
better off than you are!

447
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,900
Oh, those guys?

448
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:42,534
Like you can boss them around
since they're so strong-willed.

449
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,300
What you need is someone
who is weak-hearted enough to be

450
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:47,934
bossed around by spirits
so they'll leave with no regrets.

451
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,333
Admit it, I'm your zeroth choice.

452
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:53,433
Koo Chan-sung.

453
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:57,334
I really don't like it
when you act up like this.

454
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,600
Between "I like you because
you don't get on my nerves"

455
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,667
and "I hate you because
you get on my nerves,"

456
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:03,866
I prefer the latter.

457
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,100
Excuse me then,
I have to go escort our guest.

458
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:17,233
So he'll continue to
trigger me, will he?

459
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,366
Does he think he's above me,
now that the tree started budding?

460
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,800
What kind of bread are you after?

461
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:07,200
The one that you're baking now.

462
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:09,533
It smells so good.

463
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:21,866
This is chestnut bread.

464
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:32,567
It's still warm, isn't it?
And fluffy.

465
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:35,034
I just baked it myself.

466
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,667
He held my hand so warmly
every time.

467
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:41,600
My heart was beating so fast
and I was scared to talk to him,

468
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:43,866
in case he found out
how I felt about him.

469
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,634
You don't know his face
or his name,

470
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,866
but you'll know once
you hold his hand, is it?

471
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:01,400
If you approach him
with those hands,

472
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:03,600
you'll only scare him and won't be
able to feel his hands at all.

473
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,766
Should I explain your situation
and ask for help?

474
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:16,133
Alright, I'll let you borrow me.

475
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:33,333
Gosh, your bread is wonderful.

476
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:36,133
Thank you.

477
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,300
These are the hands that
they were born from, huh?

478
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,000
How wonderful.

479
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:54,033
He's not the one.

480
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,600
Which cake do you recommend?

481
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,134
How about this strawberry cake?

482
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,866
That chocolate one looks good, too.

483
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,166
Oh, you had cheesecake, too.

484
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,933
They're all delicious.

485
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,466
Just one left.
It must be him, then.

486
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:20,200
Can I collect points?

487
00:37:20,266 --> 00:37:22,700
Sure, do you have your card?

488
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:23,967
I don't have it with me now.

489
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,600
Then your phone number, please.

490
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,366
010…

491
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:33,966
No?

492
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:39,933
Who are you?

493
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:42,300
This man was behaving strange
from the beginning.

494
00:37:42,366 --> 00:37:44,000
Who the hell are you?

495
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,766
Chan-sung?

496
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
What are you doing there?

497
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,400
Sanchez!

498
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:55,433
I'm sorry, I'll keep an eye on him.

499
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,300
I'm really sorry.

500
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,433
See you, then.

501
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:06,400
What did you say to them?

502
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:09,434
I just told them
I swear you're not a weird guy.

503
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,633
But they don't want you here
ever again to buy bread.

504
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,733
I'm sorry, Sanchez.

505
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,500
So why did you do it?

506
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:19,900
You said you were off to the hotel.
What are you doing here?

507
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:22,433
I was looking for someone
on behalf of a guest.

508
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:24,700
Then just ask for their name,

509
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:27,833
instead of feeling their hands
in there.

510
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,200
I had my reasons!

511
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,700
If it's someone from this bakery,
you should've asked me.

512
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:36,366
I've been coming here for
many years now.

513
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:41,034
Do you remember everyone
who's worked here?

514
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,333
Of course, bro.

515
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,900
Let go of me.

516
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:53,034
That greenness on the tree…

517
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,234
I'm not the only one
seeing things, am I?

518
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,434
The tree's budding.

519
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,300
Wow, it's really pretty.

520
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:01,700
Should we all take
a photo together?

521
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:05,167
Now's not the time to be in awe,
but to lament.

522
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:07,634
This means an impending
confusion for our hotel.

523
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,500
Why?

524
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:11,567
Jang Man-wol is tied to this tree
as her punishment.

525
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:13,000
The fact that the tree's like this
suggests her punishment is

526
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:14,700
coming to an end.

527
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:16,700
So? What's wrong about that?

528
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:18,567
If Jang Man-wol departs…

529
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:21,434
What do you suppose
will happen to us?

530
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
We'll have to board the bus to
the underworld.

531
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:25,800
No, we can't!

532
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,434
I can't leave just yet.

533
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,167
We're all in the same boat.

534
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,134
Why do you think this happened,
all of a sudden?

535
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,933
What could have possibly changed?

536
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:36,800
Our general manager.
We have a new GM.

537
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:45,700
Our third choice must've done
something for sure.

538
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,834
The person you're looking for…

539
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,134
He's moved to this place since.

540
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,634
Hello, here's the coffee
you ordered.

541
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,934
That's him there.

542
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,634
Stir it before enjoying it,
that way it's more delicious.

543
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,933
Thank you.

544
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:10,066
Do you want to try
holding his hands?

545
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Excuse me.

546
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:19,467
Yes?

547
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:21,634
I'm a regular at the bakery
you used to work for.

548
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,833
It's nice to see you here.

549
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,933
Oh… sure.

550
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,733
I hope you come here often, too.

551
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,800
It's still warm, isn't it?
And fluffy.

552
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,566
I just baked it myself.

553
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,133
You can stay for awhile,
but come back soon.

554
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:58,466
Feeling proud of yourself?

555
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:06,266
I do feel a sense of
achievement, yes.

556
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,534
This car… Is it brand new?

557
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,000
Yes.

558
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:13,967
She's a beauty, huh?

559
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,300
As expected,
poo-color's just a no.

560
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:18,500
Bright colors like this one
is the way to go.

561
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:20,067
You just bought it,
in that short time?

562
00:42:20,133 --> 00:42:22,233
I plan to. I put dibs on it.

563
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:27,133
If you're asking me to come with you
to buy it, I refuse.

564
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,434
I'm going home to get some sleep.

565
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,933
Alright, then.
Let's get some sleep.

566
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,133
What?

567
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,734
Come sleep with me.

568
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,000
This time, I really want to
watch you dream.

569
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:38,600
Your "sleep with me…"

570
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:41,600
That's not an appropriate thing to
say to your employee.

571
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:42,934
I'll ignore it just this once.

572
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,467
If you're not going to sleep,
then let's grab something to eat.

573
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:47,167
Who said I wasn't?
I am, just not with you.

574
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:48,234
When did I ask you to sleep with me?

575
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,734
I only asked you to eat with me.

576
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,333
You realize that you're
contradicting yourself, right?

577
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:54,167
You said you'll look after me!

578
00:42:54,233 --> 00:42:55,167
Putting me into bed, feeding me…

579
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:56,500
Isn't that how you
look after someone?

580
00:42:56,566 --> 00:42:57,733
Koo Chan-sung!

581
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,000
Look after me!

582
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,533
What do you want?

583
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,900
This place is hot on social media.

584
00:43:26,966 --> 00:43:28,434
I've always wanted to come here.

585
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,866
You knew, didn't you?

586
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,167
You knew that
my friend runs this place.

587
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:34,834
If I say I didn't,
will you believe me?

588
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,800
Why even ask
if you're not going to believe me?

589
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:37,934
So, what's good here?

590
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,433
Why ask, if you're not going to
order by my recommendation?

591
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,166
So you know.

592
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:44,634
I'll have…

593
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,034
This one.

594
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,500
You have this one.
I want to try both.

595
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,433
Chan-sung!

596
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,134
Sanchez is my friend
and my housemate.

597
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,500
He's faint-hearted,

598
00:43:57,566 --> 00:43:59,833
so don't ever mention things
like ghosts to him.

599
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:03,866
You lied to Sanchez that
you work for a normal hotel, huh?

600
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,167
- Hey, bro.
- Hey.

601
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:08,834
So did you find
who you were looking for?

602
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,366
Yes, all thanks to you.

603
00:44:11,466 --> 00:44:13,867
This here is my colleague.

604
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:16,834
Oh, so she's a hotelier
just like you.

605
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,567
I admire what you do.

606
00:44:18,633 --> 00:44:20,234
We'll have number 2
and number 15 on the menu.

607
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,400
Will you? Just one moment.

608
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:24,100
Work is pretty tough at
your hotel, huh?

609
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,566
He's been having a hard time
ever since he transferred there.

610
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,234
You said the president was
a piece of you-know-what, huh?

611
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,200
It was a female president, right?
What was her name again?

612
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:37,434
- Jang Man-wol.
- That's right, Jang Man-wol.

613
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,134
I remember it, because even
her name's like you-know-what.

614
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,234
I hear that badmouthing your boss

615
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,334
helps you digest.

616
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,067
I'll bring your pizza here
instead of your crappy boss,

617
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:52,200
so bite and tear her to pieces
as you chew on your pizza.

618
00:44:52,266 --> 00:44:54,200
Tear her down! Got that?

619
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,867
Will one pizza be enough for you?

620
00:45:04,933 --> 00:45:06,166
Order another one.

621
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,734
My exact words weren't,
"My boss is a piece of you-know-what."

622
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,300
but "My boss is someone
who's difficult to deal with."

623
00:45:12,366 --> 00:45:13,700
What's wrong with
"a piece of you-know-what?"

624
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:16,433
Depends on what it is,
it might go well with drinks.

625
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,467
Now that you mention it,

626
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:24,833
I remember that piece of toast
you were supposed to bring me.

627
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,000
So, how was that bakery?

628
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:31,234
It went well.

629
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,700
We found him,
as her hands remembered him.

630
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,533
Really?

631
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,500
But you know, spirits have…

632
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:42,733
…their memories muddled up
most of the time.

633
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:46,500
When you wander around for too long,

634
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:49,266
you end up forgetting
what's really important.

635
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,533
Sometimes you remember
only what you want to remember.

636
00:46:36,866 --> 00:46:39,200
She said all she remembered was
the touch of his hands, did she?

637
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,633
That's very touching,

638
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:48,200
but there's no edge to the story.

639
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:51,200
After all those years she lived,

640
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:54,134
do you think a few encounters
at the bakery

641
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,133
really had her desperate to feel
those hands again?

642
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:01,867
What is it that you want to say?

643
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:04,500
The memories that are
important to spirits are

644
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:05,900
pretty much all the same.

645
00:47:07,633 --> 00:47:08,966
It's the memory of their death.

646
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:55,533
Help…

647
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:03,166
Koo Chan-sung, come to our hotel
if you die.

648
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:44,766
What the hell?

649
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:58,800
If you do this,
you'll be shattered into pieces.

650
00:50:58,866 --> 00:51:00,600
Don't let that be your end.

651
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:07,134
I'll have him punished
right here, right now.

652
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,433
I promise.

653
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,834
So you spotted the motorcyclist
who did a hit-and-run

654
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,800
six months ago, did you?

655
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:17,867
Yes.

656
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:21,000
He ran over a sight-impaired woman
who was trying to cross the street,

657
00:52:21,066 --> 00:52:22,534
and killed her.

658
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,334
Is that right?

659
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,667
Just unbelievable.

660
00:52:27,733 --> 00:52:29,400
So he ran over
a sight-impaired lady

661
00:52:29,466 --> 00:52:31,233
who was trying to cross the street…

662
00:53:04,566 --> 00:53:08,000
You're my first guest to see off
at this hotel.

663
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,566
Receiving that flower means
you'll be going to a good place.

664
00:53:12,933 --> 00:53:14,066
Thank you.

665
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:18,800
The memories of that hand
were horrible and bad,

666
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:21,100
and I almost foolishly
mistook them for

667
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:23,067
something warm and exciting.

668
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,866
That's probably because of
the life you lived.

669
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:30,167
When you were met with
big misfortune and small happiness,

670
00:53:30,233 --> 00:53:32,000
you probably tried hard to
seek the small happiness

671
00:53:32,066 --> 00:53:34,600
and contain it in your life.

672
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,766
(To Heaven)

673
00:54:05,766 --> 00:54:08,400
(Styx)

674
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:48,766
Sir,

675
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,700
would you like more coffee?

676
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:29,100
Son, this place is huge, isn't it?

677
00:55:35,066 --> 00:55:38,034
Continue past the wave pool,
and we have a private beach.

678
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,433
I'm sure your son will love it.

679
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,067
Thank you.

680
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,466
Let's go play in the water!

681
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,534
Want Daddy to lift you up?

682
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,566
There you go!

683
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,300
A father and son's just arrived
together from a traffic accident.

684
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:05,700
Yu-wol! Stop! Stop!

685
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:09,233
Yu-wol, no!

686
00:56:23,933 --> 00:56:26,766
He still hasn't come to
his senses after all that, huh?

687
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:32,266
President Jang.

688
00:56:33,633 --> 00:56:35,433
We saw the tree in the garden.

689
00:56:36,466 --> 00:56:38,433
Everyone is feeling insecure.

690
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:52,900
The tree has been dead for
well over a thousand years,

691
00:56:52,966 --> 00:56:54,967
so why has it started to bud again?

692
00:56:55,033 --> 00:56:58,167
Old Mago said someone was on
their way to send me off.

693
00:56:58,233 --> 00:56:59,467
And I'm guessing he's here.

694
00:56:59,533 --> 00:57:02,134
Is that… General Manager
Koo Chan-sung?

695
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,967
Yes.

696
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:05,067
Then what did Mr. Koo say?

697
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:06,834
He said he'll look after it
with all his heart.

698
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,733
He'll even see it blossom,
now that it's started budding.

699
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,600
And once the flowers wilt…

700
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:14,834
I'll be on my way, too.

701
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,466
Then what about us?
What will happen to us?

702
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,034
Why ask me?

703
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,000
Everyone just goes their own way,
that's what happens.

704
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:24,800
Either give it all up and
board the bus,

705
00:57:24,866 --> 00:57:29,567
or wander around until
you're reduced to dust.

706
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:30,667
It's entirely up to you.

707
00:57:30,733 --> 00:57:33,667
We need to stay
at Hotel Del Luna a little more.

708
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:35,600
You can't go, President Jang.

709
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:38,934
Let's relieve Mr. Koo
of his position.

710
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,233
He was our third choice anyway.
There's still our fourth choice!

711
00:57:44,033 --> 00:57:46,533
Hey, don't you think so?
Don't you think she's too much?

712
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,134
Stop interrupting me,
and go away.

713
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,334
- Sorry.
- We won't interrupt.

714
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,934
Why does she act like
she owns the place?

715
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,400
- Oh what?
- Let's just go.

716
00:57:58,466 --> 00:57:59,566
Unbelievable.

717
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,967
She's possessed,
not scared of anything,

718
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:08,233
and is just a perfect fit.

719
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:12,900
So we had a fourth candidate.

720
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,900
I got her that body,
so I know her weakness.

721
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:20,000
On top of that,
her family's well-off.

722
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:21,533
Let's kick out the third choice.

723
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,400
He won't leave.

724
00:58:24,466 --> 00:58:26,700
I said I'll let him go,
but he doesn't want that.

725
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:28,934
Koo Chan-sung already has
the seeing eye,

726
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,034
plus he's adjusted to this place.

727
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,567
Even if we dig his eyes out,

728
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:34,334
he'll still be able to see
our hotel and the spirits.

729
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,666
Old Mago should be able to
close his seeing eye.

730
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,966
As if she would! She's the one
who sent him here.

731
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:46,100
It's not like we can kill him. But then
we'll have to board the bus.

732
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:48,566
There is a way to solve it
without killing him.

733
00:58:50,366 --> 00:58:51,833
Right now,

734
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:56,033
we have that guest in room 13.

735
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,000
That guest in room 13…!

736
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,200
The guest in room 13 detests even
the sound of a mortal breathing.

737
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:26,767
If he encounters the guest
in room 13,

738
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,034
he'll lose all his senses.

739
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,333
Are you saying
we should drive him mad?

740
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:36,533
Yes.

741
00:59:37,466 --> 00:59:41,167
If he loses all his wits
and wander around,

742
00:59:41,233 --> 00:59:43,300
he'll still see ghosts,
but won't be back here.

743
00:59:43,366 --> 00:59:46,334
The mortals have a system to
quarantine people like that.

744
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,866
It's called the mental hospital.

745
00:59:48,766 --> 00:59:51,166
President Jang, will you approve it?

746
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,466
Where is Koo Chan-sung right now?

747
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,867
This brat keeps on

748
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:45,033
ruining the view of my garden.

749
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,934
Who told you to follow me around
without getting any sleep, huh?

750
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,467
You don't have much time left,

751
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:02,033
and it's all going to be wasted
through sleeping.

752
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,667
How unfortunate.

753
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:12,400
But it's all your fault, really.

754
01:01:12,466 --> 01:01:15,334
Although I like
everything about you,

755
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,266
I don't like you peering into me.

756
01:01:36,966 --> 01:01:38,033
Why are you smiling?

757
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:40,800
Are you here to join me,
is that what it is?

758
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:42,466
Is it fun, watching me dream?

759
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,967
Did you see me again?

760
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:47,200
Are you curious?

761
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:50,667
Sit, and I'll tell you.

762
01:01:50,733 --> 01:01:52,700
About the you I saw in my dreams.

763
01:01:57,866 --> 01:02:00,234
See, this is what I hate.

764
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:04,600
I should really tell you to shut up
else I'll rip your mouth,

765
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:07,000
but I'm thinking why don't I just
sit down next to you?

766
01:02:07,066 --> 01:02:09,266
And I hate that one second of
hesitation.

767
01:02:11,866 --> 01:02:14,767
One second from someone
who was here for a thousand years…

768
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,767
I should be really honored.

769
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,966
Yes, it really means
something big to me.

770
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,333
But that means
you'll pay the price.

771
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:26,600
You admit now that you're
responsible for your ill fate.

772
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:29,500
Whatever happens,
you only have yourself to blame.

773
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,200
If anything happens,
I'm sure you'll protect me.

774
01:02:38,733 --> 01:02:40,567
You said you'll protect me,

775
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:42,366
who's only a fragile mortal.

776
01:02:46,233 --> 01:02:48,433
That motorbike just now, too.
You're the one who stopped it.

777
01:02:49,633 --> 01:02:50,467
No!

778
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,500
I thought I wouldn't care
if you were run over.

779
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,067
I know you don't mean it.

780
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:57,034
I jumped in there,
because I trusted you.

781
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,300
I said, no!

782
01:02:58,366 --> 01:03:01,200
I trust you.
That you'll protect me.

783
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:06,133
So if something happens,
protect me.

784
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,000
I'll be right by your side.

785
01:03:11,966 --> 01:03:13,633
I'm going to kick you out.

786
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,134
Was it from my dream?

787
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,066
That one second,
from Jang Man-wol?

788
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,200
Mr. Koo.

789
01:05:09,266 --> 01:05:12,167
I need your help regarding
one of our guests.

790
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:14,566
Sure, in which room?

791
01:05:16,066 --> 01:05:18,034
It's one of our long-stay guests

792
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,066
who's checked into room 13.

793
01:05:27,866 --> 01:05:30,300
Burn this incense for
our guest in room 13.

794
01:05:31,033 --> 01:05:32,466
Sure, I'll do that.

795
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,467
She's a tricky one…

796
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:37,600
I'm sorry to do this to you.

797
01:05:40,733 --> 01:05:43,400
I've already adjusted to this place.

798
01:05:43,466 --> 01:05:44,600
Don't worry too much.

799
01:05:59,633 --> 01:06:00,933
I'm sorry.

800
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,034
I feel as if I've discarded
my scholarly ways out the window,

801
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,666
which makes me ashamed.

802
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,633
I really like him as a brother.

803
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,834
Mr. Koo is heading to

804
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,500
our guest in room 13 right now.

805
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:27,533
So where is our guest, anyway?

806
01:11:16,633 --> 01:11:17,666
Koo Chan-sung!

807
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,866
Don't look.

808
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,100
And don't let her hear
you breathe, either.

809
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,233
I heard a noise from…

810
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:40,100
Don't listen.

811
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:46,266
What is it?

812
01:13:47,366 --> 01:13:51,133
(Hotel Del Luna)

813
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,167
Koo Chan-sung's not leaving.

814
01:13:53,233 --> 01:13:54,600
I've decided to keep him by my side.

815
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:56,334
You sent me to that room
on purpose, didn't you?

816
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,534
I lost my other earring.

817
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,100
At this rate, you'll be bankrupt.

818
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:02,266
Be kind, and live frugal.

819
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,900
She's been forced into
an unwanted marriage.

820
01:14:05,966 --> 01:14:07,134
Is this the front desk?

821
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,234
Miss, you can't do this
to our employee.

822
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,667
I'm fine.

823
01:14:10,733 --> 01:14:11,700
Ha!

824
01:14:11,766 --> 01:14:13,334
You accept it.

825
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,500
So you'll accept her proposal?

826
01:14:15,966 --> 01:14:17,567
Ms. Jang Man-wol…

827
01:14:17,633 --> 01:14:19,033
Koo Chan-sung, do you love me?
