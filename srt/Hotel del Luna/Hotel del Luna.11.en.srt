(Episode 11)

8
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:10,633
That man, Ko Chung-myung…

9
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,733
Had he been there to see her?

10
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:18,800
Chan-sung! Come on out.

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,566
This came for you.

12
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,300
Man-wol sent it.

13
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,900
- Ms. Jang Man-wol?
- Yes.

14
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,133
(I wanted to say thanks)

15
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,300
"I wanted to say thanks"?

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,600
Don't run.

17
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:43,300
Even if I were ever to
go mad and run wild,

18
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,633
and disappear one day…

19
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,466
Still, stay with me.

20
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,866
I won't ever let you perish.

21
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:57,866
Trust me.

22
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,467
After firing a talent like you
on a whim

23
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,467
but only to re-instate you,

24
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,700
I guess she wanted to
make a good impression.

25
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,500
My sincerity touched her,
that's what this is.

26
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,600
Oh what? A leopard-print suit?

27
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,234
Get me a good price
for this painting.

28
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,500
As a reward,

29
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:28,633
I'll have a new suit tailored for you
in this pattern!

30
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:31,334
Ugh, that woman…!

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,467
Hey, this is a high-end brand.

32
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:34,500
And it's rather sexy, too.

33
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,500
Try it on! You'll look so funny.

34
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:37,634
Ugh, save it.

35
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,200
Who'd wear a leopard-print
suit anyway?

36
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:42,534
But if you don't,
won't Man-wol be disappointed?

37
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,167
I mean,
this looks really expensive.

38
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,467
And I'd be disappointed too,

39
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:47,933
because I want to see you in this.

40
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,334
I'm yet to transfer the money
from the sale.

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,933
So how did she buy this,
with what money?

42
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,767
There's no way she bought something
just for me while out shopping.

43
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,434
You know, this is nicer
than I thought.

44
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,867
Veronica's coming to Korea
next week,

45
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,334
so should I get one too and
greet her in this?

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,267
For that new, wild look…

47
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,433
Don't. You'll scare Veronica.

48
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,534
You really do know nothing
about relationships, huh?

49
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,434
You see, you need a bit of
a surprise in your relationship.

50
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,467
Whatever.

51
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,834
I see now, Man-wol said
she was going shopping last time,

52
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,833
so she must've bought it then.

53
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,267
Sanchez, you saw Ms. Jang Man-wol?

54
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,867
Yes, a few days ago.

55
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,800
She asked me for advice on
dealing with an inheritance

56
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,500
from her grandfather.

57
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,200
What? Inheritance from
her grandfather?

58
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:42,300
I have a pair of purebred
Arabian horses in Qatar.

59
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,867
They're quite sought after by
many royalties, I hear.

60
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,700
Do you think you can help me
with the sale?

61
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:51,200
Oh, that's right. Sanchez,
do you have connections with Mansur?

62
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,734
Mansur?

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,867
No.

64
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:56,167
But purebreeds are rare,

65
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:59,600
so I'm sure someone from my riding
club is bound to be interested.

66
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,734
Great!

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,567
If you can get me
a good price on them,

68
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:08,367
I'll buy you a new suit,
but in white.

69
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,434
But why come to me
when you have Chan-sung?

70
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,367
I can't trust that Koo Chan-sung.

71
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,466
Why not?

72
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,634
He's been extremely busy
ever since he came back.

73
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,600
Anyway, I'll leave this
in your care, then.

74
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,634
If you ever come by
my hotel later… much later,

75
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,300
I'll make sure you are
received very well.

76
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,100
Hey, really?

77
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,700
Of course!

78
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,300
Gosh, I…

79
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,733
President Wang…?

80
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,334
Anyway, I helped her out
and it was for you, too.

81
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,467
Anyway, they were really expensive.

82
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:53,634
So that was it! The horses,
for the call fee.

83
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,467
I mustn't let down my guards.

84
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:57,833
I need to tighten the reins!

85
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:12,933
Mr. Koo, we're bombarded with
our special service request.

86
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:16,067
Thanks to the President Wang,
the word has got around and

87
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:19,100
now many wish to use
our special dream call service.

88
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,767
But this is something President Jang
had only been offering to

89
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,134
an exclusive few
who paid a special fee.

90
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,266
What do we do?

91
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,434
We need to be fair with
our services.

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,800
Let me handle this.

93
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:42,833
Let's see…

94
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,700
Ah, you're here.

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,734
Oh what? Why didn't you wear it?

96
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,334
I was looking forward to you
looking like a tiger.

97
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,767
I'm at work.

98
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,567
All's good as long as
the President says it is.

99
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:08,734
I mean, look! I even bought this

100
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
for a matching look!

101
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,700
Oh, a zebra.

102
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,867
What do you think?
Isn't it gorgeous?

103
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,433
It's getting on my nerves.

104
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,100
You don't like it?

105
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,767
You're very picky, aren't you?

106
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,234
Fine. If neither tiger or zebra
is your thing,

107
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,167
let's go.

108
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,167
I'll get you something to
your taste.

109
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,633
There's no time for that.

110
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,200
We're behind on our
special service requests.

111
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,466
Please take care of these first.

112
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:43,467
The dream call service is
only provided to those

113
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,834
who paid a special price.

114
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,833
You've been paid more than enough.

115
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,767
The horses! You took those horses!

116
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,500
Ugh, that Sanchez…!

117
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,367
I won't say anything about
what you do with that money,

118
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,800
but in return,
help the other customers.

119
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
(Special service request)

120
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,867
Koo Chan-sung. Do you think that
dead people will

121
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,800
only have nice things to say
in other people's dreams?

122
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,800
"I died because of you,
so you come with me!"

123
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:08,800
What if they curse them
and blame them for their deaths?

124
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,400
Curse, blame…

125
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:18,634
That's why I review every case and

126
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,667
provide it to a select few
at a reasonable price.

127
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,633
Money's not the only factor
for consideration!

128
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,134
You're right.

129
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,834
I misunderstood you, President Jang.

130
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,500
You weren't limiting this service
for the money,

131
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,334
but for the moral consequences.

132
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,600
Yes! This is for our guests, too!

133
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,234
That's why I only offer it to
a select few.

134
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,866
What did you take me for, huh?

135
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,700
Then I'll set some
guidelines for the selection,

136
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:47,633
as you just described.

137
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,933
Ugh!

138
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,800
The horses were for me, so why is he
acting like he owns them?

139
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,400
Let me pass on the secrets of
our cold noodles just to you,

140
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:08,834
since you were the most diligent
out of all my stuff.

141
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,433
Listen carefully.

142
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,700
Hey, cold noodles!

143
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,400
I love cold noodles, too.

144
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,866
For the broth…

145
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,366
Ha! So petty.

146
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,567
Oppa!

147
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,100
Oppa, thank you so much!

148
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,634
Your song comforted me
until my very last moment.

149
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,700
So it's not one?

150
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,534
She must have several brothers.

151
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,667
I've always believed that
your music and dance will

152
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:41,600
touch the hearts of everyone
around the globe.

153
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,366
- It's not her real brother!
- But it says here…

154
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,334
(There's something I want to say to
my dear oppa)

155
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,433
(who was my greatest strength
when I was ill)

156
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,500
Oppa, I love you!

157
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:49,633
I'll be your fan forever,
even in heaven!

158
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,534
You think this is funny?

159
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,033
Let's get this straight, alright?

160
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,066
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,334
Our next guest is departing today,

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,867
and he'd like to speak to his wife
before he does.

163
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:20,934
So just one call?

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,733
Yes, just one call.

165
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:27,133
Then I’d like to speak to
someone else.

166
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,100
My son and I died from
a traffic accident.

167
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:40,300
I'd like to speak to that
young truck driver at the time.

168
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:43,434
Our calls may not be used to
resent or curse anyone.

169
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,467
Please leave.

170
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,700
I don't want to resent him
or curse him!

171
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,500
I want to apologize to him.

172
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:01,500
Thank goodness it ended at
a probation order.

173
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:02,734
Thank goodness?

174
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,966
Two people died because of me.

175
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
(Resignation Letter)

176
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,334
I can't do this anymore.

177
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,800
But how will you feed yourself
if you quit like this?

178
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,466
You're the people I killed…

179
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,833
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,667
I'm really sorry!

181
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,100
I did something that is
absolutely unforgivable!

182
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,933
It's us who should be sorry.

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,133
It's our fault for running into
the road all of a sudden.

184
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:02,766
It was a mistake.

185
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,967
It was an unfortunate accident
for us,

186
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:08,900
but we also ended up causing
you great grief and distress.

187
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:10,133
We're sorry.

188
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,567
We don't want your life

189
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:22,433
getting ruined because of us.

190
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,433
I'm sorry…

191
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,600
And thank you.

192
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,766
Now my heart feels lighter.

193
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,433
Shall we go then, son?

194
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:51,666
Thank you.

195
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:10,733
Shall we end it here for tonight?

196
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,734
There's not many to go,
so let's get it over and done with.

197
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Tell them to come in.

198
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,900
The flowers are in full bloom.

199
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:33,134
Let's not worry.

200
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,167
The tree only managed to flower,

201
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:38,567
and who knows, it may stay
like this for a very long time!

202
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:41,834
Old Mago is trying to take
President Jang.

203
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,500
The flowers have bloomed,
so they may wilt.

204
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:50,167
We have to depart this world
before President Jang does,

205
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:52,233
so let's brace ourselves for it.

206
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,533
Ugh, I'm tired.

207
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,434
Do you know how tiring it is to

208
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,966
connect those calls?

209
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,134
Still, thanks to you,

210
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm sure that many have woken up
from their dreams, smiling.

211
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,566
Since you worked hard,
I'll make you smile, too.

212
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,034
What? But how?

213
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,367
Are you going to wear that
tiger suit for me, then?

214
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,467
As I thought!

215
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,867
You sent me that to
make a fool out of me!

216
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,134
Hey, do you think
I'd spend all that money,

217
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,534
just to have one good laugh?
What an effort wasted.

218
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,667
Well, I wasted some effort too,
to make you smile.

219
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:46,567
I booked that rice cake soup place
you gave up on

220
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,900
after trying to wait in line
many times.

221
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:50,267
Let's go.

222
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,433
What?

223
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,300
But that place doesn't take
reservations and

224
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:54,734
you have to wait over 2 hours!

225
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,400
Harvard connections.

226
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:58,967
There's a college of
rice cakes at Harvard?

227
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,966
Their son is a Harvard alumni.

228
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,966
I booked the entire place,
just before they close.

229
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
I suggest you hurry up.

230
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:11,533
Then… wait!

231
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,767
Right, you'll need to change into
an outfit to suit the occasion.

232
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,234
This is not just your average
rice cake soup!

233
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,834
They have
bottle gourd-shaped rice cakes.

234
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,733
So I need to put on
something special!

235
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,866
- Face the camera.
- I'm alright.

236
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,200
I'm only three years
younger than Sanchez,

237
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,434
so if I have three
rice cakes soups,

238
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,034
can I stop using honorifics
like Sanchez?

239
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,033
What?

240
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:17,000
Sanchez calls you Man-wol,
doesn't he?

241
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,533
You want to stop using
honorifics to me?

242
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:25,734
Fine.

243
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,666
But after 1,300 rice cake soups.

244
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,934
Even Kim Jun-hyun can't
eat that much!

245
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,766
Don't underestimate Kim Jun-hyun.

246
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,834
Fine, I'll go easy on you.

247
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,767
One year per rice cake,
not rice cake soup.

248
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,900
Make that one hundred years
per rice cake.

249
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,334
You Harvard swindler!

250
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,566
You think aging is that easy?

251
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
After just 13 rice cakes,

252
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,900
I'm calling you Man-wol.

253
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,067
Alright, go ahead!

254
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,800
But at age 1,300 years,
you're already well dead.

255
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:56,800
I accept the challenge!

256
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,600
To warm up, 200 years.

257
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,034
It tastes extra nice
because that's 200 years.

258
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,233
Alright, let's keep it up and
add another 300 years!

259
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,900
It's beautiful as it is right now,

260
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,933
so why does it have to wilt?

261
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,166
Because that'll be so sad.

262
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,734
Alright, there's just
300 years to go already.

263
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,934
Are you nervous?

264
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,067
Then I'll just add on
another 500 years.

265
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,434
Are you stupid or what?

266
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,634
Sorry, I'm going to eat faster.

267
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,567
No, I'm going to!

268
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,434
Alright,
there's just 100 years left.

269
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,767
Add on 200 more years!

270
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,800
I had a reputation at Harvard for
being a fast eater.

271
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:13,434
Well, I'm already 3,500 years old.

272
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
- 600.
- 3,600 years.

273
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:17,700
You won't be able to beat me,
admit it already.

274
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,167
After I finish this, I'm going to
eat those earrings of yours, too.

275
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,233
Three thousand…

276
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:05,267
We have his motive.

277
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,100
There's this website
called 'HELL-LO.'

278
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,867
"Hello?" Is it some kind of
an online community?

279
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,634
It's a pun on the word Hell,

280
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,534
meaning, "To hell."

281
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,734
So what is this HELL-LO, anyway?

282
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,367
It's a web community with
over 100,000 members

283
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:20,800
that's been around for
quite some time.

284
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:23,067
At first, people confided in
each other and sought advice,

285
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:26,534
but as time went on,
it turned into real hell.

286
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,100
(Angst/Curse)

287
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,700
Currently, it's become
an emotional trash can where

288
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:32,767
the members backstab and curse
other people.

289
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,534
And?

290
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,667
Our suspect had written
many hate posts about his wife.

291
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,767
He'd also written
malicious comments to

292
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,767
hate posts about the
six previous victims.

293
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,667
And these hate posts
about the victims recorded

294
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,133
many number of hits and comments.

295
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,167
Here is one example of such
hate posts and comments

296
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:52,000
about one of the victims.

297
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,666
(Die! Die!)

298
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,367
The purpose of this website is to
write about people you hate,

299
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:59,200
so that everyone can curse
the target with the OP.

300
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:02,533
Then… the suspect made the
curse real, did he?

301
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,000
What, is he the devil?

302
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:07,667
Apart from Ms. Lee Do-yeon,
his wife,

303
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:11,434
he probably was a complete stranger
to the other victims,

304
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,200
who were murdered without
ever knowing why.

305
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,933
So it wasn't this man, was it?

306
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:22,100
See? I told you!

307
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,200
The owner of that car is
the real culprit!

308
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,867
There was even a spirit in
that car.

309
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:30,066
But we can't report him for that
reason, without any other evidence.

310
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,700
Ah! A police sketch!

311
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,667
You know, you always see it
on crime TV shows.

312
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:37,900
Let's try that.

313
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:40,466
Because I'm pretty good at art.

314
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:44,434
If our President catches you
playing detective,

315
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,300
she's going to give you a lecture.

316
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:50,767
Alright, tell me any details
you know about him.

317
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:51,900
Anything.

318
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:07,866
(Jungseok Moving Service)

319
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,500
I never saw Mr. Koo Chan-sung
who made the booking,

320
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,000
but moved all the boxes
with some high school girl.

321
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:14,833
It'd been a long day, too
because my truck broke down.

322
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,934
You don't have her name
or her number?

323
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,767
I don't know her number,

324
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,233
but she contacted us through
social media.

325
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,834
Are you really from
an entertainment agency?

326
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,034
So you're a casting director?

327
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,600
Well…

328
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,934
I wanted to meet her,
because she's quite charming.

329
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,900
She'll never be a celebrity.
She's really weird!

330
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:36,867
What's so weird about her?

331
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:38,734
Her mental state.

332
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,567
She's not really crazy,
but it's that she sees ghosts.

333
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,833
Right!

334
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,500
Ghosts?

335
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:45,667
She sees ghosts.

336
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:47,233
Everyone at our school
knows about that.

337
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:51,400
Hey, you shouldn't label her
weird for that reason.

338
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:52,900
But it's true!

339
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:54,200
She talks to herself,

340
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,633
and she follows ghosts
and goes off on her own.

341
00:21:57,766 --> 00:22:00,500
She… follows ghosts?

342
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:06,866
Interesting.

343
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Mr. Kim, I had a look at
the revised menu,

344
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,634
and you changed the name of
our signature cocktail to

345
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,067
its Korean equivalent, "Nunmulju."

346
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:28,000
President Jang thought
it was pretentious.

347
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,134
But why? I liked the name.

348
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,967
"Tears and cheers!"

349
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:35,200
It even rhymes.

350
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:38,700
Even a Harvard graduate like you
thought it wasn't bad, huh?

351
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,667
President Jang was
nitpicking for nothing.

352
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,500
This is our signature drink,

353
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,567
so I think you could do
a spin-off on them.

354
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:47,434
Like, Angel's Tears or
Devil's Tears.

355
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,133
Really? Angel and Devil?

356
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,967
I'll write a proper proposal.

357
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:56,833
That Harvard place… They sure know
how to teach their students!

358
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,900
So, uh… what are all our guests
doing here, in midday?

359
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:08,967
They're the guests whose bodies
were discovered on the mountain.

360
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:12,500
I did hear about this, yes.

361
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:13,800
And they recently arrested
the murderer, right?

362
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:15,634
Apparently so,

363
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,633
but No. 4 insists
something's not quite right.

364
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:28,134
I don't think the man who was
arrested is the real culprit.

365
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,500
See, there was a spirit
in this car, too.

366
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:32,833
The owner of this car is
definitely suspicious.

367
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:38,066
(81KI-0963)

368
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:43,700
Kim Yu-na, you're still young.

369
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:45,600
So don't involve yourself in
dangerous cases like these.

370
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,733
Yes, just go to your classes.

371
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:53,400
Then… let me at least finish
the sketch I'm working on.

372
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,567
I'll show it to you,
once it's finished.

373
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,200
If something comes up,
I'll look into it

374
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:59,833
- so you must inform me.
- Sure.

375
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,600
(Special service request)

376
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,000
More special service requests
for today.

377
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:10,766
Ugh…

378
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:14,466
What a bother.

379
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,167
I'm sure you saw the flowers.
So why aren't you saying anything?

380
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,433
Or have you all decided to
board the bus?

381
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,700
We're bracing ourselves for it.

382
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:31,500
However, I…

383
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:36,100
…won't leave until that family's line
is discontinued.

384
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,367
You said your daughter died,
right?

385
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:46,566
So that this family may continue.

386
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:53,334
Even if you're feeling anxious,

387
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,833
you mustn't repeat
what you did 42 years ago.

388
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:03,733
If you were to perish
as an evil spirit…

389
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:08,233
The past 200 years you spent here
doing good would go to waste.

390
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,166
My grudge is deep enough to
give that all up.

391
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,734
There will be a lunar eclipse
on the next full moon.

392
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,934
Yes.

393
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,134
I hear this one
will be unusually long.

394
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,500
I will make sure we are prepared.

395
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:49,833
Sir.

396
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,600
Did you need something?

397
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:56,134
I'm a bit thirsty.

398
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,400
I'll bring something up
to your room.

399
00:25:58,466 --> 00:25:59,666
This way.

400
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:18,866
A long lunar eclipse…

401
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:02,133
Mr. Koo Chan-sung,
you'll need to come with us.

402
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:22,700
We've brought him, sir.

403
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:28,633
Come closer.

404
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:36,866
Who are you,
and why did you want to see me?

405
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,066
Huh?

406
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,200
Do you know who I am?

407
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,766
I saw you in the morning papers
this morning.

408
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:55,500
I highly respect you, ma'am.

409
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:58,134
But what business
would you have with me?

410
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,967
You're the director of a hotel

411
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,066
whose address is registered in
Jung-gu, am I correct?

412
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:08,533
Yes, that's right.

413
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,934
Will you take me to that hotel?

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'd like to meet your president.

415
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:20,134
Do you know our president?

416
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,166
President Jang Man-wol of
Hotel Del Luna.

417
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:30,834
I was once a general manager

418
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,666
who worked under her.

419
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,634
Didn’t you say
you're going home early?

420
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,833
I brought a guest
you might want to meet.

421
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:03,034
Ji Hyun-joong!

422
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,433
Do you still vacate the front desk
during work hours?

423
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,833
Ms. Hwang!

424
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,000
My goodness!

425
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,833
How did you come here?

426
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:18,100
Don't tell me… you haven't
passed away, have you?

427
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,700
You still can't make the distinction?
I'm still alive!

428
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:22,233
Oh, jeez.

429
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,867
Anyway, is it now
Secretary-General Hwang?

430
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,666
I'm still just a candidate.

431
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,067
Mr. Kim! Ms. Choi!

432
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,833
Ms. Hwang's here.

433
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:40,500
Goodness! You two are still here.

434
00:29:40,566 --> 00:29:41,833
Ms. Hwang.

435
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,967
- It's been a long time.
- It has been a long time.

436
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:48,034
Has it been 30 years since
we last saw each other?

437
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,500
You've aged quite a bit.

438
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:51,566
You're still as direct as ever!

439
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,933
Do you have many guests
who are staying at the moment?

440
00:29:57,066 --> 00:30:00,533
I can't see anyone else other than
the hotel staff anymore.

441
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,100
We have a few.

442
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:09,033
There's President Jang Man-wol
right there.

443
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,800
The hotel's much bigger now.

444
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,867
It's all thanks to you, Moon-sook.

445
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,667
Thanks to your investments,

446
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,300
we purchased this piece of land
and moved to Myeong-dong.

447
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,667
I hear you've grown
quite a bit, too.

448
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:43,300
I've seen your name mentioned
often on smartphone news.

449
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:46,900
So you're going to be
Secretary-General for some huge place?

450
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,734
I'm still a candidate,

451
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,900
and it's all thanks to you
letting go of me.

452
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:55,467
Do you think I ever
wanted to let go of you?

453
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:59,034
After insisting that a talent like you
shouldn't go to waste here,

454
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,000
Old Mago fed you that potion
behind my back and

455
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:04,700
took away your all-seeing eye.
So I had no other choice.

456
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:09,200
Moon-sook, if you'd stayed
another few years,

457
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:12,900
I would own so much land
in Gangnam right now…

458
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:15,467
Thanks to my experience here,

459
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:20,266
I've taken on a whole new
perspective of the world.

460
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,133
Yes. It seems like you've been doing
many good things.

461
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,733
So, what brings you here?

462
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:29,966
I have a favor to ask.

463
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:33,666
A favor?

464
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,334
Of course.

465
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,834
Like you came here,
for the memories.

466
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,266
It's all because of
an ulterior motive.

467
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:43,733
Ah!

468
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,134
I prepared a little gift

469
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
that will look very nice on you.

470
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:52,734
Gosh,

471
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,466
you really didn't have to…

472
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,900
Oh my goodness!

473
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,500
So, what is it that
you wanted to ask me?

474
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:09,033
It's something small,
but very important for me.

475
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:15,166
After all, the next lunar eclipse
will be the biggest in 39 years.

476
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:22,034
Back when our economy was
experiencing accelerated growth,

477
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,000
along came Hwang Moon-sook

478
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:26,634
and President Jang was able to
say goodbye to scouring

479
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,767
the mountains for food and
enjoy a life of luxury.

480
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,534
She was here for
about seven to eight years.

481
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,134
I could've never imagined
she was a general manager here.

482
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,267
President Jang doesn’t leave behind
traces of human general managers

483
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,200
who've passed this hotel by.

484
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,700
But…

485
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:51,133
Why did she visit us here before
such an important election?

486
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,534
Accept human guests?

487
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,767
Is that even possible?

488
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:57,500
Yes, because it'll be
the lunar eclipse soon.

489
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:59,400
Does that change anything?

490
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:00,900
When the moon eclipses,

491
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:04,367
the existence of this hotel
will be revealed.

492
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:07,867
So during this time, we have
a few human guests stumbling in.

493
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:09,800
And once they come in,

494
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:11,600
sometimes they're able to see
our other guests, too.

495
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:14,267
Then… do we allow human guests
to check in on that night?

496
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,667
Of course not, we turn them away
at the front desk.

497
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,634
But…

498
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,000
Was it in 1981?

499
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,800
When Moon-sook was still here,

500
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,700
a newlywed couple stayed the night
on the night of the lunar eclipse.

501
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:32,634
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
it's the curfew hours already.

502
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,567
I'm really sorry.

503
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:34,966
- This way?
- This way, this way!

504
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,300
(Hotel Del Luna)

505
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:39,466
It looks like this place is a hotel.

506
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:45,033
I hope the lunar eclipse ends soon…

507
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:51,466
- Excuse me…
- Do you have any rooms?

508
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,100
Uh…

509
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,534
Newlyweds?

510
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,034
They came to Seoul for
their honeymoon,

511
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,534
but found themselves stranded
in curfew hours.

512
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,000
If we turn them out,

513
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:04,300
they'll have to spend their
first night at the police station.

514
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:05,766
That'll be pitiful.

515
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,100
Fine, let them in.

516
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,966
It's this room right here.

517
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,434
Please.

518
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,167
Thank you.

519
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:36,233
Thank you so much!

520
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,567
That night, those newlyweds spent
their first night at our hotel

521
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:52,200
and for the first time
at this ghost hotel that night,

522
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:54,000
a child was conceived.

523
00:34:56,233 --> 00:35:00,866
And this child is the soccer genius
born by Korea.

524
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:14,900
Really?

525
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,867
Wow, he was conceived right here?

526
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:21,100
Apparently so. I was quite surprised
when I heard it earlier.

527
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,167
Anyway, he's going to be
Moon-sook's son-in-law.

528
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,034
Son-in-law?

529
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,700
That couple from that night
and Moon-sook had a surprise

530
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:31,300
of their life when they finally met
to discuss the wedding.

531
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:34,700
What a coincidence.

532
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:35,900
But then again,

533
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:38,967
this place is overflowing with
mystical energy,

534
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:41,634
so a child who was conceived here
could turn out to be quite special.

535
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,000
That's what she's hoping for
once more.

536
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:46,534
She wants to send her children here
for their honeymoon,

537
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
and have them spend
just one night here.

538
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,667
Then should I prepare
our VIP room where

539
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,567
we hosted His Majesty?

540
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:54,667
No.

541
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:57,800
They're humans.
So it has to be room 404.

542
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,866
Room 404?

543
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:10,633
But while you can check into
that room, you can't check out.

544
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,567
Checking out of our hotel means
you're off to the underworld.

545
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,566
Then where do the guests of
room 404 check out?

546
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:22,066
Are you worried for the guests
who'll check in there?

547
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,566
Then why don't you go in there
and see for yourself?

548
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:15,666
On the night of
the next lunar eclipse,

549
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,733
we'll be expecting human guests.

550
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:23,466
They're newlyweds
on their honeymoon!

551
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:25,900
Goodness.

552
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:30,200
This time, our guests made
a proper reservation,

553
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:31,734
so get ready to show them
our best hospitality.

554
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,766
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

555
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:41,734
We'll have to prepare food and
decorations for humans.

556
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,967
It excites me to receive
guests who are still alive.

557
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:46,200
But I don't see our general manager
who's still alive.

558
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,933
He went into room 404.

559
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,833
Then he won't be
coming back tonight.

560
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:53,833
Anyway…

561
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:08,866
Veronica!

562
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,000
So you're at the Bund in Shanghai?

563
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:14,400
Yes, I just stepped out for lunch
while in a meeting.

564
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:16,134
Sanchez, you're so bad!

565
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,034
Why, Veronica? What is it?

566
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,867
Because I miss you so much!

567
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:25,100
Sanchez, you always distract me
from my work.

568
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:26,934
I'm going to have to
teach you a lesson!

569
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,766
You know Veronica, I can't wait
until you do punish me.

570
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:35,000
And… Veronica?

571
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:38,300
I just found a way to receive
life-long punishment from you.

572
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:40,100
- You can look forward to it!
- Oh what?

573
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:43,066
How are you going to
surprise me this time, huh?

574
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:46,034
I'm not going to say it!
So hurry over and see for yourself.

575
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,167
Alright?

576
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:48,666
Ah, Chan-sung's here.

577
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,700
Say hello, Veronica.

578
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,767
Hi, Chan-sung!

579
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,033
Hello Veronica.

580
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,166
Veronica, I'll call you again.

581
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,367
Ti amo!

582
00:38:59,433 --> 00:39:01,566
Adios, my Sanchez!

583
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:03,200
Bye!

584
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:06,967
- Is Veronica coming to Korea?
- Yes.

585
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:10,134
She's in Shanghai right now, but
she's coming the day after tomorrow.

586
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,700
So I was thinking…

587
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,234
I'm planning this really
important event right now,

588
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,500
and I was thinking that
your hotel may be the perfect place.

589
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,834
Our hotel?

590
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,234
Veronica's been to all kinds of
hotel in this world.

591
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,467
I told her that you work for
a very special hotel,

592
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,800
and she wants to check it out.
And so do I.

593
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,566
No, not our hotel.

594
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:35,067
Chan-sung.

595
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,834
Things aren't so normal
at your hotel, right?

596
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,834
Pardon?

597
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,000
Well, you call people to your house
to sell that painting,

598
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:43,067
and then Man-wol asks me to
sell off her horses…

599
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,066
Are you in a difficult
financial situation, or what?

600
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:48,667
It's not, no.

601
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:50,866
Tsk, tsk…

602
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:55,800
Chan-sung, tell me
if it gets too much for you.

603
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:59,167
That's not something you should
put up with, for love.

604
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,466
Alright?

605
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Right.

606
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:05,700
Fine, let's just end this!

607
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:07,434
My goodness.

608
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,100
Mi-ra's always like that.

609
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,600
Was that police officer
her mortal enemy

610
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,300
in her previous life?
They always fight to death.

611
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:14,800
But then she always goes out
to see him.

612
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:15,834
What?

613
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,133
You're not the only one
who's busy. I'm busy, too!

614
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,767
What, are you saving the world?

615
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,666
Are you some Marvel superhero?

616
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,467
What?

617
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:29,433
They were mortal enemies
in their previous life, yes.

618
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,167
Sanchez.

619
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:35,734
Once Veronica arrives,
let's have dinner sometime.

620
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
So she's coming
the day after tomorrow?

621
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:39,700
- Yes.
- It's the lunar eclipse that night.

622
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:41,900
Yes, it's going to be
a full lunar eclipse

623
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:46,100
so I wanted to see it from that
sky bar you've been bragging about.

624
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:47,633
But I guess it can't be helped.

625
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,633
Sorry.

626
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,767
They might be terrified if
they bump into our guests

627
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:55,600
who haven't yet been groomed,

628
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,567
so it may be best to leave
the adjacent rooms empty.

629
00:40:57,633 --> 00:41:00,600
We've been asking our current
guests on the fourth floor

630
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,066
for their understanding and
have been re-assigning rooms.

631
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:14,766
I knew I could count on you.

632
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:18,433
The dinner menu is
well put together.

633
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,100
What about the drinks?

634
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:23,600
You'll go with these?

635
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:27,567
I took your advice and did
a spin-off on our signature menu.

636
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:29,200
Angel, and Devil.

637
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:30,600
Wow.

638
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,000
This is great.

639
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:35,567
But I'm not sure how our
human guests will find it.

640
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:37,900
- Will you have a taste for me?
- Sure.

641
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:55,634
Let's put half in the dining room
and half in their room.

642
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,633
Alright!

643
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:02,233
Bees!

644
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:05,667
Wow, because the flowers are
still alive,

645
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:07,434
we have bees who
followed them here.

646
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,700
Right, the flowers here
aren't alive so

647
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:12,166
we didn't have bees or butterflies.

648
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:25,600
So, uh… are there even
insect spirits?

649
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:26,700
Like fireflies.

650
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:29,367
I've never heard of such a thing.

651
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:31,033
Oh, really?

652
00:42:33,466 --> 00:42:34,834
Then what was that?

653
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,100
Then should I put these
in the room?

654
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:40,166
Yes. They look more romantic.

655
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:42,533
Hold on.

656
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,166
I'll have one in my office, too.

657
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,000
Oh… this way.

658
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,066
Ugh, I'm beat.

659
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,967
There were a lot of requests for
our special service again, huh?

660
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:31,767
How is it that me, the president,
is the only one taking care of

661
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:35,567
our guests because everyone else is
hyped up about human guests?

662
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:40,400
Gosh, I feel like
I've been woken up 12 times!

663
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:42,666
Ugh, I'm so tired.

664
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,933
Then here's something to
wake you up.

665
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:53,933
This is a real flower,
so it even has fragrance.

666
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,500
There are plenty of flowers
in the garden.

667
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:00,900
But none of them are living,
are they?

668
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:02,700
Oh, maybe all except for one.

669
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,166
The Jang Man-wol flowers.

670
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:09,000
Your tree has bloomed
beautifully, hasn't it?

671
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:11,067
What's wrong with you?
You're embarrassing me.

672
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:12,500
Getting all cocky, are you?

673
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,767
But I have a reason to, don't I?

674
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,866
The flowers bloomed as soon as
I took you in my arms.

675
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:18,467
If I'd known that,
I would've hugged you more

676
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:20,566
instead of just
buying you champagne.

677
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:25,867
What are you trying here?

678
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:27,200
Who said I asked for a hug?

679
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:29,166
You must be out of your mind.

680
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,600
I only wanted to
get that phone from you.

681
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:37,500
But alright, I'll give you a hug.

682
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:41,967
Ha! Hey, forget it!

683
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:44,800
You cocky, shameless and
greedy Harvard swindler…

684
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,100
Aw, that's pretty.

685
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:54,734
I put some more request forms
on your desk.

686
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,700
Take a break, and once
you're fully awake,

687
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:58,166
go back to work.

688
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,566
Ugh!

689
00:45:28,066 --> 00:45:30,500
I won't ever let you perish.

690
00:45:31,066 --> 00:45:32,500
Trust me.

691
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,266
It really is alive.

692
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,500
I'm letting you off this once,
because you're weak.

693
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,834
The lunar eclipse has begun.

694
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,566
Tonight, we'll be receiving
some very special guests.

695
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:53,066
Everyone, get ready to greet them.

696
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:04,067
They all look excited.

697
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:06,900
Well, they're feeling how
our existence is revealed

698
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:08,933
to the world,
with the moon eclipsing.

699
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:12,634
And with human guests arriving,

700
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,466
they all feel as if
they're alive again.

701
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:30,766
Welcome sir, and madam.

702
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:33,500
You have a reservation,
is that correct?

703
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:35,000
How long has it been
since you passed…

704
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:41,533
I mean, how long has it been
since you got married?

705
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,934
Oh! Your wedding was only today!

706
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,667
Congratulations.

707
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:52,133
This way, please.

708
00:48:03,233 --> 00:48:05,534
We'll bring your bags to your room.

709
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,566
Meanwhile, please enjoy your dinner.

710
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,500
This is our hotel's
signature cocktail, Tears.

711
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,033
The Angel's Tears of beauty,

712
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,933
and the Devil's Tears of passion.

713
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:41,733
Why are you in such a good mood?

714
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,100
I've always hated that full moon.

715
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:49,100
But look! It's now eclipsing.

716
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:50,934
Ah, that feels so good!

717
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,833
I just love this moment!

718
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,434
The full moon has eclipsed.

719
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,300
Once it emerges,
it'll be a new moon.

720
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:07,233
A better moon that's frugal.

721
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:12,134
Once our guests go back,
how about we go outside

722
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,567
and see the new full moon
that's just been reborn?

723
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:15,967
How about it, bad old Man-wol?

724
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:17,500
Hey!

725
00:49:17,566 --> 00:49:19,567
You want to die, Chan-sung?

726
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:20,900
So you agreed, alright?

727
00:49:20,966 --> 00:49:22,367
This is what I like about my name.

728
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:24,700
When people call my name,
it means they agree.

729
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:27,467
It's just perfect!

730
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:31,800
Your zeroth preference!
Koo Chan-sung.

731
00:49:33,133 --> 00:49:34,467
Fine, whatever.

732
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:36,600
So Mr. Koo, who's our
zeroth preference,

733
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:38,933
is actually Mr. Okay, is it?

734
00:49:39,766 --> 00:49:41,034
What's with that?

735
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,467
Besides, my English name is Andrew.

736
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:46,834
And the English word for Chan-sung
isn't "okay," but "agreement."

737
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,534
Agreement or Andrew, whatever!

738
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,967
You're just Mr. Okay Koo, alright?

739
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:53,033
Mr. Okay Koo!

740
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:59,133
Mr. Okay!
The moon's disappeared completely.

741
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:05,933
You're right.

742
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:25,066
This symbol means that
it belongs to you, right?

743
00:50:26,366 --> 00:50:27,500
That's right.

744
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,766
Had he been waiting, then?

745
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:57,733
President Jang.

746
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,066
Our guests are ready to
go to their rooms.

747
00:51:04,366 --> 00:51:07,900
Alright. The moon's just eclipsed,
so perfect timing.

748
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:09,867
Take them up to room 404.

749
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:10,766
Yes, President Jang.

750
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,867
Once you go in,

751
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:31,234
please do not leave the room
until you check out.

752
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,766
We heard about the room
from our parents, too.

753
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,966
Then please enjoy your stay.

754
00:51:59,566 --> 00:52:01,500
We had
a world-famous soccer player,

755
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:02,800
so what do you think will be next?

756
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:05,000
You wouldn't know because
you've been a kid for 70 years,

757
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:07,167
but it's not something that
happens overnight.

758
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:10,666
I know that much, that
it doesn't happen overnight.

759
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,800
What are you smiling about?

760
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,834
I know that much, too.

761
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,000
Really?

762
00:52:26,433 --> 00:52:28,300
Don't presume that
I won't know anything.

763
00:52:28,366 --> 00:52:30,034
We're talking about new life here,

764
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,766
so I suggest the Grim Reaper
stays out of this conversation.

765
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:39,700
Anyway, I hope we have
a great scholar this time.

766
00:52:39,766 --> 00:52:41,867
It's time we have a Nobel laureate,
whatever they call it.

767
00:52:41,933 --> 00:52:44,100
I'm hoping it'll be triplets,

768
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:46,333
so we'll have
three Nobel laureates!

769
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,266
All the hotel staff are
cheering for room 404 right now.

770
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:54,733
Veronica's still not here?

771
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:57,834
I waited in case
her flight was delayed,

772
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,834
but it turns out it wasn't.

773
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,266
And she's not picking up either.

774
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:07,134
Chan-sung,

775
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,534
do you think that Veronica knows
I'll be proposing to her,

776
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,666
and that's why she's not here?
Because she's not ready?

777
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:15,167
No, Veronica loves you
more than you love her, Sanchez.

778
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,233
No, I love her
more than she loves me.

779
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,700
Veronica's never stood me up…

780
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,567
Hey, I got a text.
It must be Veronica.

781
00:53:28,633 --> 00:53:30,233
I'll talk to you later.

782
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,466
Sanchez!

783
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:07,933
Sanchez!

784
00:54:09,133 --> 00:54:10,166
Sanchez!

785
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:13,500
What do you mean, an accident?

786
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:15,634
Veronica's hurt.

787
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,733
There must've been
an accident in Shanghai.

788
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:19,734
I should go now.

789
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,200
How badly is she hurt?

790
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:24,067
I'll have to go there and see.

791
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,734
- She'll be alright.
- Of course.

792
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,033
I think I'll have to stay there
until she recovers.

793
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:35,166
Now, where's the car key?

794
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,200
Hey, I'm off.

795
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,900
You won't see Veronica…

796
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:59,233
…even if you go.

797
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:03,566
Hey, don't… Don't say that.

798
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:05,733
You won't be able to see her!

799
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,066
It's too late.

800
00:55:13,733 --> 00:55:15,633
Hey, what's wrong with you?

801
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,467
What do you mean, it's too late?

802
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:20,500
I'll see her, if I go.

803
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:35,166
Sanchez!

804
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,734
I'll let you meet her.

805
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,666
What?

806
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:42,667
If you go to our hotel right now,

807
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:44,500
you'll be able to see Veronica.

808
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:49,000
Hey, what are you on about?

809
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:51,100
You trust me, right?

810
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:52,600
There's not much time.

811
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:54,533
If we're late, even just a little,
you won't be able to see Veronica!

812
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,334
Mr. Koo!

813
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,934
There's a female guest
who'll be coming in soon.

814
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,300
We'll be waiting at the sky lounge,

815
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,100
so make sure she's refreshed first
before showing her up.

816
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,033
Yes, sir.

817
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,166
Let go of me!

818
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:11,200
What are we doing here?

819
00:57:11,266 --> 00:57:13,134
You'll see, once you go out.

820
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,733
I'll explain later, once you do.

821
00:57:29,766 --> 00:57:32,567
Hey, how is this possible?

822
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:35,000
This is a very special hotel.

823
00:57:35,066 --> 00:57:37,100
It's for the dead.

824
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:38,066
What?

825
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,534
There's no time to explain, Sanchez.

826
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,967
Until the lunar eclipse is over,
you're also able to see the dead.

827
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:49,266
So…

828
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:54,966
Your farewell with Veronica
will have to be very short.

829
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:01,933
Don't joke with me.
Why would Veronica come here?

830
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,166
Because she's dead.

831
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,266
She's here now.

832
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,000
Sanchez, Veronica is dead.

833
00:59:24,466 --> 00:59:25,900
I'm sorry.

834
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,333
I'm sorry to surprise you like this.

835
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,600
Don't cry…

836
01:00:07,066 --> 01:00:09,266
Don't cry too much, because of me.

837
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:18,233
I was happy thanks to you.

838
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:50,933
My dear love…

839
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:55,900
Goodbye.

840
01:02:14,766 --> 01:02:17,167
Mr. Koo's friend is

841
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,133
bidding farewell to his love.

842
01:02:19,933 --> 01:02:24,200
A death that
approaches so suddenly

843
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:26,800
leaves those left behind in
great sadness.

844
01:02:28,766 --> 01:02:31,133
After seeing just dead people,

845
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,000
it's been a long time
seeing the sadness of

846
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:38,900
those who are left behind.

847
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,766
Yes, come in.

848
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:49,567
Did you have a pleasant stay?

849
01:03:49,633 --> 01:03:50,934
Yes.

850
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,200
We won't ever forget
the time we spent here.

851
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:58,166
Thank you, goodbye.

852
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:20,134
It's as our parents said.

853
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,034
A hotel that can't be found again.

854
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,500
Once we have children of our own,

855
01:04:25,566 --> 01:04:27,934
let's try find this hotel again

856
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,766
and send them on honeymoon here.

857
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,900
Let's do that.

858
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:14,967
Veronica's funeral will be
held in Italy.

859
01:05:15,033 --> 01:05:17,667
Sanchez is going to
spend some time there.

860
01:05:17,733 --> 01:05:19,966
Poor Sanchez…

861
01:05:20,633 --> 01:05:24,134
He never got to see her
one last time to

862
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,833
say goodbye to her.

863
01:05:26,233 --> 01:05:28,733
He saw her, and bid her farewell.

864
01:05:30,266 --> 01:05:33,567
He saw that death isn't the end,

865
01:05:33,633 --> 01:05:35,866
so I'm sure he'll pull through.

866
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,100
So he did get to say his farewell.

867
01:05:41,766 --> 01:05:43,233
But how did he see her?

868
01:05:44,266 --> 01:05:46,166
Didn't she die in Shanghai?

869
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:51,333
Hey, the coffee smells so nice.
You should have another one.

870
01:06:19,133 --> 01:06:20,667
Whoa, I'm sorry.

871
01:06:20,733 --> 01:06:22,166
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

872
01:07:06,266 --> 01:07:07,700
She's really following me.

873
01:07:14,933 --> 01:07:17,300
Why is that cute girl
following after me?

874
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,600
I should ask her.

875
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,267
Our children said
they had a pleasant stay.

876
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:31,900
Thank you.

877
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:36,667
If you ever quit working
at Del Luna,

878
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:38,700
come to me.

879
01:07:38,766 --> 01:07:42,700
President Jang
highly recommended you,

880
01:07:42,766 --> 01:07:44,766
saying that
you're an exceptional talent.

881
01:07:45,933 --> 01:07:47,966
I won't be leaving the hotel.

882
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:52,700
But President Jang said
you'll have to, soon.

883
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,600
There's a guest Koo Chan-sung
needs to send off himself.

884
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,533
Once he does that,

885
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,133
he'll probably leave this place.

886
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,800
She said that, did she?

887
01:08:11,866 --> 01:08:15,667
Is there a new rule for
the general managers?

888
01:08:15,733 --> 01:08:19,766
Who is this guest
you'll need to send off?

889
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:30,266
Someone whom I like very much.

890
01:08:38,933 --> 01:08:40,566
It must be hard, then.

891
01:08:46,133 --> 01:08:47,700
It must be, yes.

892
01:08:51,233 --> 01:08:53,833
I think it'll be extremely hard to
simply say that

893
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,133
it's alright,
because I know it's coming.

894
01:09:43,566 --> 01:09:45,833
What were you up to?
Were you sleeping?

895
01:09:48,866 --> 01:09:50,767
I'm up,

896
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,166
looking at the moon.

897
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,333
The moon?

898
01:09:56,766 --> 01:09:58,266
You can't see the moon
during the day.

899
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:00,633
Right.

900
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,300
It'll be pretty hard
if you start to miss it,

901
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:09,000
when you can't see it.

902
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:22,066
Where are you?

903
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,000
I'm on my way home.

904
01:10:27,066 --> 01:10:30,300
Wait right there.
I'll come over so you can see me.

905
01:10:48,133 --> 01:10:50,200
Kim Yu-na, what is it?

906
01:10:51,933 --> 01:10:53,766
(81KI-0963)

907
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,000
I found that car.

908
01:11:02,866 --> 01:11:05,567
Where are you? Where?

909
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:06,900
Don’t move, but stay right there!

910
01:12:09,866 --> 01:12:12,300
What did she see to
follow me all the way here?

911
01:12:21,266 --> 01:12:22,300
Kim Yu-na.

912
01:12:25,733 --> 01:12:27,867
The sketch I made…

913
01:12:27,933 --> 01:12:29,933
It looks very much like
the owner of this car.

914
01:12:31,466 --> 01:12:33,900
Do you think he's the killer?

915
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:43,600
What is it?

916
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:48,200
This highly resembles
someone I know.

917
01:12:58,766 --> 01:13:01,566
I'll take over from here,
so you go home.

918
01:13:02,033 --> 01:13:03,000
Alright.

919
01:13:37,733 --> 01:13:40,900
I told him to wait,
but he makes me wait instead.

920
01:13:50,966 --> 01:13:52,166
Are you in?

921
01:14:07,733 --> 01:14:08,933
Is anyone there?

922
01:15:27,233 --> 01:15:29,367
Instead of the man I'm waiting for,
here comes Old Mago instead,

923
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:31,667
whom I'm not so happy to see.

924
01:15:31,733 --> 01:15:33,834
Why not?

925
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:38,066
Am I not the face of God
you've been waiting for the most?

926
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,033
You'd scoffed at reincarnation,
destiny, and untying the knots.

927
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,033
All you've been wishing for
is to meet me, and perish.

928
01:15:51,466 --> 01:15:54,166
So? You're here to
do that for me, are you?

929
01:15:56,233 --> 01:15:57,933
I hear the flowers have bloomed.

930
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:03,600
Now you finally have
something to lose.

931
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,867
Do you think I'm scared of
those flowers wilting?

932
01:16:07,933 --> 01:16:09,966
The man who bloomed
those flowers for you.

933
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,733
What about losing him, then?

934
01:16:25,233 --> 01:16:26,866
It's been a long time,
Koo Chan-sung.

935
01:16:38,033 --> 01:16:41,034
Man-wol, you proud and
foolish soul.

936
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:44,300
Did you say you don't fear
the flowers wilting?

937
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:45,733
No.

938
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,567
It's when you hold fear
in your heart,

939
01:16:48,633 --> 01:16:51,000
that the flowers start to wilt.

940
01:18:08,766 --> 01:18:12,533
(Hotel Del Luna)

941
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:16,100
The price that
Koo Chan-sung must pay

942
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:18,900
isn't fair, nor just.

943
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:22,234
Stroke my head in your room,

944
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,034
so I can fall asleep.

945
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,867
What's wrong with you?
You're being so lewd.

946
01:18:25,933 --> 01:18:27,200
You scared me.

947
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,734
I don't want you to
have to pay the price,

948
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,934
so I'll clear all the debts

949
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,034
to the best of my ability.

950
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,167
Don't be scared
to leave me behind.

951
01:18:36,233 --> 01:18:38,834
I may be a weak, feeble human

952
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,066
but I'm loving you with
all my might.
