Koo Chan-sung.

9
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:03,466
When time comes to send me off,

10
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,333
don't be too sad.

11
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:11,800
Take a good look
and take good care of me,

12
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:14,833
until you send me off well.

13
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,400
As God wills it.

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
What is it?

15
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,333
What?

16
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,633
You want me to go right now?

17
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:40,534
Don't rush it. Now's not the time.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,066
Do you think I'll leave you
so easily like that?

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,633
I'm going to torture you
to your wit's end,

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,767
so that when the time comes
for me to depart,

21
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:54,366
you'll be smiling wide
in full bliss.

22
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,834
Sir.

23
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,533
You can't do this here.

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,100
Sir,

25
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,367
you can see me, can't you?

26
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:00,467
I know you can hear me.

27
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,400
Ugh, please!

28
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,466
Please don't spit!

29
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,267
Please stop.

30
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,200
How much has he had to drink?

31
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,634
I don't think it's the alcohol.
He's not right in the head.

32
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,767
Sir!

33
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,234
Many young ones have
lost it these days.

34
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,900
Please calm down,

35
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,600
and follow me.

36
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,767
What a pity. He's still young, too…

37
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,766
Hey, hey, hey! Quiet.
What if he follows us?

38
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:33,867
As I promised, here's your beer.

39
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,166
Thank you.

40
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,866
Have a drink, and go to
the hotel I told you about.

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,467
Just follow the moon,
and you'll find it.

42
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:43,566
Alright.

43
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,033
- Wow, it's really him!
- Amazing!

44
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:51,733
Kim Jun-hyun?

45
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,066
Huh? Ah, this is
the sausage alright.

46
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,066
Hello.

47
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,700
That'll be $2.80.

48
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,834
- He's so fat.
- I'm your fan.

49
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,767
Are you filming your show nearby?

50
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,166
I really like that.
Your "Can I have a bite?"

51
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:12,500
That's really good, you know.

52
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:14,700
- Here he comes!
- I'm your fan.

53
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:17,734
- Can I get your autograph?
- Thank you.

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,967
Sure, sure.

55
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,033
Your autograph, please!

56
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,766
Now's not the time to
chase after a celebrity!

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,766
That guy's popular among
spirits, is he?

58
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,534
This place was featured on
"Eat Till You Drop."

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,100
That Kim Jun-hyun,

60
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,500
he can fit five rice cakes
in his mouth at once!

61
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:42,466
I'm telling you,
he's not your average guy.

62
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,600
Ms. Jang Man-wol is
a fan of his, too.

63
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:56,834
- The legs are all tangled.
- This is how you do it.

64
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,100
So you want to taste the real,
original spicy stir-fried octopus?

65
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,233
Yes!

66
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,634
The student who's number 4
on our list came by today,

67
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,167
and she's very smart.

68
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,867
She volunteered to train
as an intern here,

69
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,233
why don’t we say yes?

70
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,734
She says she wants to,
so alright.

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,567
Then I'll leave it to
Hyun-joong to train her.

72
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,467
I'll make sure
she's ready to step in at any time,

73
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,667
should Mr. Koo leave us
without notice.

74
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,067
Has Koo Chan-sung already left
for the day?

75
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:21,834
Yes.

76
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,366
He asked for
an early leave tonight.

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,733
Can I have one bite?

78
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:32,233
(Here comes Kim Jun-hyun's
"Can I have a bite?")

79
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,500
Would you like that?

80
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,566
Should I have the intern
get some for you?

81
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,700
It's alright.

82
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,033
I'm not quite in the mood tonight.

83
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,267
This earring…

84
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,333
Did you find its pair?

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,233
No.

86
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,933
One of them had been missing…

87
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:16,033
If I find you your earring,
will it be two leaves, then?

88
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,334
If I want to show him this,

89
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,633
I'll have to be in the mood
for some spicy stir-fried octopus.

90
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,134
Hello? Hey, Man-wol.

91
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,800
Chan-sung? No, he's not here yet.

92
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,067
Um, he's not picking up.

93
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,834
When he gets home,
tell him to wait right there

94
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,667
because I'm on my way to pick him up
in my brand-new, turdy car.

95
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,834
Man-wol, Chan-sung
might be late tonight.

96
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,167
Huh? Why?

97
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,966
His girlfriend dropped by today.

98
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,067
Who came?

99
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:03,667
His girlfriend he was seeing
in the States came by.

100
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,067
She'd come to see Chan-sung,

101
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,733
and it looks like she bumped
into him on her way out.

102
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,733
Jeez!

103
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:12,033
What, you're already here?

104
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:17,533
Koo Chan-sung has a girlfriend?

105
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,334
Who is she? Is she pretty?

106
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,867
Well, uh…

107
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,166
No need to tell me!

108
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,667
I mean, why tell me this?
Who said I was curious?

109
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,066
I'm not interested.

110
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,467
- I'll get going, then.
- I didn't say anything.

111
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,234
Fine. If you want to say it
so badly, tell me.

112
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,666
I'll hear you out.

113
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,566
So, is she pretty?

114
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,900
I asked, is she pretty?

115
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,033
She's pretty, yes. Pretty… very.

116
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,366
Sanchez.

117
00:07:56,266 --> 00:08:00,233
You can be so clueless at times.

118
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:05,434
Oh Sanchez, you really know nothing.

119
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,300
You stupid idiot, you.

120
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,133
So, she's that pretty, is she?

121
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,934
She's… she's really pretty.
And smart.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,534
And she's perfect for
Chan-sung, too.

123
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
I have her photo. Want to see?

124
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,166
I'll go get it. Wait right there.

125
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,866
If she's really pretty,

126
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,900
you're so dead, Sanchez.

127
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,533
Hey, Man-wol! Take a look at this.

128
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:47,900
Man-wol?

129
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,033
Did you leave?

130
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,766
Is Chan-sung late because
he's seeing Mi-ra?

131
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:07,866
An encounter from the past has
led to what it is today.

132
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,866
I hope he takes good care of her,

133
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,233
so she doesn't suffer
as badly as she did.

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,534
- I guess he must be filming here.
- Wicked.

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,566
So when's Kim Jun-hyun coming?

136
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:42,666
Whoa, amazing!

137
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,700
Excuse me.

138
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,300
Are they filming that show,
'Can I Have a Bite?'

139
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:51,433
Yes. Are you here to get
Kim Jun-hyun's autograph, too?

140
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,467
I, well…
Someone I know is his fan.

141
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,867
Oh. Same for him,
his girlfriend's a fan of his.

142
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:58,400
- As for me, it's my mom.
- And me, it's my dad.

143
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,966
As for me, it's my boss.
My boss is a fan of his.

144
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,434
Hey guys!

145
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,367
He's in the van over there,
and will give out autographs.

146
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:08,667
Let's go, let's go!

147
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,100
You should hurry, too!

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,733
Maybe I should've
gotten his autograph.

149
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,066
She would've been thrilled.

150
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:40,566
Ms. Jang Man-wol?

151
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,667
What brings you here?

152
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,366
You knew it's here
at this neighborhood?

153
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:49,800
I heard, yes.

154
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:51,900
So… did you two meet?

155
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:54,333
Yes, I just did.

156
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,633
I'm sure you were thrilled.

157
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:59,034
So, what did you think?

158
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,600
Not so overweight, as I thought.

159
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,234
And tiny face, and great skin.

160
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,634
Why not see for yourself?

161
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,667
If you hurry,
you might just catch them.

162
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,034
No thank you. Why would I want to?

163
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm here to have some
spicy stir-fried octopus.

164
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:12,833
Spicy stir-fried octopus?

165
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:17,000
What, at this hour?
Dressed like that?

166
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:20,733
Yes, octopus! Octopus is the
only reason why I'm here!

167
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,300
That's the earring I found
for you.

168
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,300
Yes.

169
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:32,234
I bought these so I could wear
them when I go for octopus next.

170
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,667
So here I am, for the octopus.

171
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,967
And since it was you who found it
for me, you have to join me.

172
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:39,000
Just admit it, you felt like
spicy stir-fried octopus.

173
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,634
Don't feel so compelled to come up
with such excuses each time.

174
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,900
Why? Are you sick and tired of it?

175
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:45,733
Are you, huh?

176
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,867
If you want to have spicy
stir-fried octopus at this hour,

177
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:54,634
we'll have to go to Noryangjin.

178
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,334
Actually, the West Coast.

179
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
You want to head to the beach?

180
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,733
Well, whatever.

181
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,967
And while we're there,
let's see the sunrise.

182
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:09,100
I'm not sure if the sun
will rise from the west,

183
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,266
but okay.

184
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,000
Alright.

185
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,067
Let's go for a drive in
your favorite turd-colored car,

186
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,100
and go have spicy stir-fried octopus.

187
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:22,267
Let's go.

188
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,533
But are you sure you're okay
not seeing Kim Jun-hyun?

189
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:27,766
Kim Jun-hyun?

190
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,234
How do I see him?

191
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,934
Aren't you here to see him?

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,333
He's filming his show
just around here.

193
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,533
Jeez, why are you only
mentioning that now?

194
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,166
So she knows how to run.

195
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:43,166
Ms. Jang Man-wol!

196
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,200
Apparently, he downed
that much hangover soup.

197
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,866
And it was Kim Jun-hyun
who was the MVP…

198
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,400
I can't I believe I missed it.

199
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, they say that's where he sat,

200
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,400
so let's be satisfied with having
hangover soup in that seat.

201
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,167
Here, eat while it's still warm.

202
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,900
Then you do what he does
on the show for me.

203
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:18,934
Put some radish kimchi on there,
and down the whole thing.

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,167
Don't overestimate me.

205
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,133
I'll eat it slowly, thank you.

206
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,567
This place will be swarming
with customers

207
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,266
now that Kim Jun-hyun's been here.

208
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:37,134
This place would've done just fine
without him in the first place.

209
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,233
Thanks to her.

210
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,534
What about the baby?

211
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,500
She's a bundle of luck.

212
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:47,967
With all her good deeds
in her previous life,

213
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:50,334
she was born into this life
with great fortunes.

214
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,100
And families with children
like her bound to flourish.

215
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,800
So good deeds will bring
good fortune in your next life.

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,167
Then what about the opposite?

217
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:02,100
You'll be born poor,
or as some animal.

218
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,266
Then Ms. Jang Man-wol,
in your next life, you…

219
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:10,800
What?

220
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:15,034
You just thought,
'She'll be an animal for sure,' huh?

221
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,234
It's not 100%,
but I'm still worried.

222
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,700
You do have
a high chance, after all.

223
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:21,500
I've already atoned for my sin,

224
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:22,667
managing the hotel for
over a thousand years now.

225
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:25,300
But you weren't particularly
hospitable to your guests.

226
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,333
I wasn't hospitable? How?

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,600
You'd ignore them,
saying you couldn't be bothered.

228
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,800
And if they had any money,
you'd rip them off to

229
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,933
pay for your champagne
and your new car!

230
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,834
So I'm extremely worried.

231
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,734
There's no need for you to
worry about such a thing.

232
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
No, I should from now on.

233
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:41,834
Because I don’t want you to be
an animal in your next life.

234
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,967
Why should you care?

235
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,967
I don't want you to be
a pig in your next life,

236
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:48,100
so I won't have to meet you
like this, in my soup.

237
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,566
So be good.

238
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:51,834
Ugh, forget it.

239
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,500
I just lost my appetite,
thanks to you.

240
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,767
I saw a stray spirit nearby.

241
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,200
I told him to go to the hotel,

242
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,467
but since you're here,
why not escort our guest?

243
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,933
So you can be good.

244
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:07,000
Koo Chan-sung.

245
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:12,000
Don't just approach spirits
you don't know

246
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,834
and talk to them.

247
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,700
They could be evil spirits.

248
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,000
And it could get dangerous.

249
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,034
Do all spirits who wander around
for long turn into one?

250
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,600
Once they harm humans,
they become evil.

251
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,000
And spirits like that
not only prey on the living,

252
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:32,834
but other spirits, too.

253
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,067
And once the Grim Reaper
gets a hold of them,

254
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:38,600
there's no good life or
bad life for them next.

255
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,066
They'll just extinguish,
without a chance of reincarnation.

256
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,067
Why didn't you report to me
that the guest in this room

257
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,067
had left this hotel?

258
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:56,100
It was our general manager's fault.

259
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,633
Besides, what can we do
now that she's left?

260
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:05,100
This spirit is full of hate and
anger toward humans.

261
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,067
If she causes any trouble,

262
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,033
I will hold this hotel responsible.

263
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,300
This is not good.

264
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm sure the Grim Reaper
will bring her back.

265
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:21,700
But what do we do
if she causes trouble before then,

266
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:23,700
and turns into an evil spirit?

267
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,033
Though she's dangerous,
she is a tragic soul…

268
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:31,700
I hope our guest in room 13
comes back safely.

269
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,933
(A new hot video is out! Enjoy)

270
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,033
Should I have a break, then?

271
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,633
(This is killer)

272
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:52,800
What's this one?

273
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:04,900
She's taking it of… Off!

274
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,700
Turn around,
so I can see your face.

275
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:24,566
You like that?

276
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Do you?

277
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,566
What a killer, right?

278
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,900
(Are you going to
come pick me up today again?)

279
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:48,200
(When are you coming?)

280
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:51,433
(I can always skip the
afternoon classes)

281
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,433
I can't believe he's ignoring me,
when he's a spirit!

282
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,567
I'm telling you,
Yu-na's possessed!

283
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,233
It was really creepy back then.

284
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,834
Should I chuck this at her?

285
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,000
- You should, you should!
- Why not?

286
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:06,067
Will she dodge it this time, too?

287
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,666
Alright, here it goes!

288
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:11,833
One moment.

289
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,734
Hey, did you get a text?

290
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,200
- No, it's not me.
- Not me, either.

291
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,867
- Not me.
- Not me, either.

292
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,233
- Then what's this?
- Oh what?

293
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,400
She's sure hated, isn't she?

294
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:34,733
(I'm here! Behind you)

295
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:52,667
Our President gave her permission.

296
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,034
Alright, then. Let's go.

297
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,067
What, now? What about school?

298
00:19:57,133 --> 00:20:00,667
You just saw, didn’t you?
I don't fit here.

299
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,166
In fact,
I don't care if I drop out.

300
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,566
You're just having a hard time
being bullied, aren't you?

301
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:10,533
It's a little frustrating,
but it's okay.

302
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:15,067
Because the real Kim Yu-na…
She was really nasty.

303
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:19,266
I'm kind of enjoying how
she's being hated now.

304
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:26,300
It's just that… School's no fun.

305
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:28,534
How is school no fun?

306
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,867
I used to love going to school.

307
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:33,534
The studying, the playing sports…

308
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,034
I'd never come home from school,

309
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,066
so our man servant would always
come to look for me.

310
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:40,833
Man servant?

311
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,867
Yes, a live-in man servant.

312
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:46,734
He used to date my sister's nanny,

313
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,667
so he never got on with
my dad's chauffeur.

314
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,433
It was a love triangle.

315
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,900
A live-in man servant,
a nanny, and a chauffeur, too?

316
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,300
You must've been a rich boy
when you were still alive.

317
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,567
So you were born with
a gold spoon in your mouth?

318
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,800
No, a silver spoon.

319
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:11,333
All the spoons in our house were
made out of silver.

320
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,867
Too bad that Mr. Rich Boy who was
born with a silver spoon

321
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,033
in his mouth had to die so young.

322
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,433
Yes, that's why
I still hold a grudge.

323
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,234
I can't go to school
even if I wanted to,

324
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,900
so you should appreciate it
and be a good student.

325
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,200
Anyway, schools are great
these days.

326
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,166
The uniforms are pretty,

327
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,700
and you even have a piano
like this one here.

328
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:45,566
Man…

329
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,833
This one looks much nicer than
the one we had at home.

330
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,800
So, uh…

331
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:56,033
Mr. Rich Boy also played
some piano, did he?

332
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,566
Go on, then.

333
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,467
I can't play the piano,
but I'll hear you out.

334
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,134
No, I probably forgot how to play.

335
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,333
I said, play, Rich Boy.

336
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,733
Who are you talking to?

337
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:21,966
What are you talking about?
I was only playing the piano.

338
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:26,266
Oh, were you? Then go on. Play.

339
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,834
Yes, Yu-na.
You're great at the piano.

340
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,166
So go on, play.

341
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,400
- See?
- I told you I was right.

342
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,866
She's really playing it.

343
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,467
Not bad, Rich Boy.

344
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:37,500
See? You didn't forget.

345
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,800
Right.

346
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,166
I haven't been able to, I guess.

347
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,066
Brother!

348
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,367
Hyun-mi, are you going to ride
a bicycle with me

349
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,134
even when you get older?

350
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Yes!

351
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,233
You have to, alright?
It's a promise.

352
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,967
Young Master!

353
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,233
Young Lady!

354
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:04,934
I think it's better for me to
mentor No. 4,

355
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,500
since Hyun-joong is still young
and I am much older than he.

356
00:25:07,566 --> 00:25:10,467
With you and your
'Thus spoke Confucius' teachings,

357
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,767
I think Hyun-joong will
understand her better,

358
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,600
since he was educated in
the Western way.

359
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:17,400
But Hyun-joong sides more with
No.3 than us.

360
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:20,967
Though he is closer to Mr. Koo,

361
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:23,600
he also holds grudges in his heart
which he needs to let go of.

362
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:27,067
I'm sure he won't side with Mr. Koo

363
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:29,134
when he knows there is a chance
that the hotel may be no more.

364
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,833
You're right. Hyun-joong needs to
stick around until then.

365
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,367
I'm relieved there have been
no further changes to the tree,

366
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:37,566
since it budded.

367
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:47,500
Why is it doing that, you think?

368
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:49,400
President Jang must be mad.

369
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,434
But she's with Mr. Koo right now.

370
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,134
Then No. 3 must have angered her.

371
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I hope he infuriates her to
the point those leaves fall off.

372
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:08,733
We need to dispose of cars
we don't need.

373
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,934
I said, there aren't any cars
that aren't needed.

374
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,934
But from what I heard,
seven out of the 14 cars here

375
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
have never been on the road
this past year.

376
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:19,367
They're a part of the scene.

377
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:23,667
Look, they're all laid out,
all in different colors,

378
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:26,800
as part of the scene
in my parking lot.

379
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:28,367
I mean, this place is so huge!

380
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,934
So imagine how it would look
with just three cars.

381
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,600
It would look so empty!

382
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,600
Exactly.

383
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,667
There's just one person
who needs a car,

384
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:39,166
and she doesn't need
all this parking space!

385
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,634
Let's just have three,
and park them in the garage.

386
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,200
As for this space here,
we'll use it for our guests.

387
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,367
Why are you doing this to me?

388
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,600
Why do you want me to
sell off my cars?

389
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:56,000
Because your financial situation is
totally screwed up.

390
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,733
You're heading for bankruptcy!

391
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,567
With your current bank balance,

392
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:15,034
you'll have a hard time paying off
the next round of bills.

393
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,134
The Mt. Paekdu painting!

394
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,400
It's not selling.
It's not as popular as we thought.

395
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,000
Then the gold bars we received
from Kim Yu-na's parents!

396
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:23,300
You bought a car
with those, remember?

397
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:24,766
Ah! Then what about
the Black Card?

398
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:26,967
I sent it back.

399
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,867
It's up to you to pay for
all the goods that you purchased

400
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:30,466
with that wedding as your excuse.

401
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,800
Are you out of your mind?
Why did you send it back?

402
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:36,266
Because I can't you make
a dog or a pig in your next life!

403
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:39,067
From this point onward,

404
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:41,467
I won't cooperate with you
ripping people off.

405
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:44,266
Be good, and be frugal.

406
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,834
Hey, Koo Chan-sung.

407
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,734
There's no need for you to
do this.

408
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,334
A dog or a pig, did you say?

409
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,667
I don't mind being a chicken, even!

410
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:58,167
Even if I meet you next
as chicken noodle soup,

411
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:01,800
I'll say to you,
"Hello, I taste much better with

412
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:04,200
some of that kimchi." Really!

413
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,667
If you don't sell off your car to
pay all this back,

414
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:10,000
you won't even have the money
for chicken noodle soup.

415
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,134
Am I going to be poor again?

416
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,166
I don't want any more hungry season!

417
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:26,367
Koo Chan-sung!
You're lying, right?

418
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,033
You were only trying to
scare me, right?

419
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:32,334
President Jang wasn't
always well off.

420
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,900
Things were very hard
when I'd just joined the hotel.

421
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,267
Things were very, very hard.

422
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,767
It was chaos and
with no human general manager,

423
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:44,566
President Jang had
a really hard time.

424
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:56,667
Man, I'd really kill for a drink
with some pickled radish.

425
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:59,534
We'll try get something for you,

426
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,400
when we next see a U.S. army jeep.

427
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,367
Our new recruit received
Western education,

428
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,033
so he can speak some English.

429
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,500
Give me the chocolate!

430
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,866
Thank you very much.

431
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:14,166
(Manwolgwan)

432
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:16,034
I'm impressed.

433
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,000
You can keep working here.

434
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,700
Thank you very much!

435
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,066
I hate being poor.

436
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm going to keep drinking
champagne with caviar.

437
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,667
So she did just fine,

438
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:46,200
doing with what little she had,
drinking makgeolli instead.

439
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:48,466
I say we could tighten the belt.

440
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,467
But if you do that,
President Jang will hate you.

441
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:54,133
And you might get kicked out…

442
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:58,234
You're doing very well, Mr. Koo.
You're what she needs.

443
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,234
I can manage her personal finances,

444
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,867
but what about the hotel?
Can it ever go into trouble?

445
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:07,867
In chaos like that, you have
more dead than the living.

446
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,800
And what soul wouldn't have died
without a grudge amongst them?

447
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:13,467
At that time, the gate to the
underworld flung open wide,

448
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:16,066
which meant less spirits
dropped by.

449
00:30:16,766 --> 00:30:19,200
We really pulled through well
together through those hard times.

450
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:22,600
You did a great job, Mr. Kim.

451
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,433
No, it was you
who had it the hardest.

452
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,600
So no matter
what guest arrives here next,

453
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,700
let's guard and protect this hotel

454
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:32,867
until the day we're able to
lay down our grudges.

455
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:33,933
Alright.

456
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,800
One, two, three. Let's do this!

457
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,134
Your Majesty.

458
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,400
The night is deep.

459
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:46,034
Who is there?

460
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,433
Be gone, you…

461
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:49,933
Cut!

462
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:56,467
Yu Oh.

463
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:58,800
You're a king,
but that was not majestic.

464
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,734
I'm sorry.

465
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,466
Let's take a break!

466
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:05,100
You need to show dignity like a king.

467
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,534
Practice that, alright?

468
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,733
Sure. Dignity…

469
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:10,766
Who…?

470
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,200
What impertinence!

471
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,500
Who goes there?

472
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,866
Man, this always…

473
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:38,933
Who are you?

474
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:43,233
What impertinence!

475
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,934
Who are you?

476
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,300
How dare you! Be gone!

477
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:56,433
Yu Oh, what's wrong? Yu Oh!

478
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:58,966
Yu Oh!

479
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:00,667
Yu Oh!

480
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:03,034
Yu Oh, are you alright?
Can you hear me?

481
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,434
- Yu Oh, wake up!
- Yu Oh, open your eyes!

482
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,467
Call his manager, quick!

483
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:09,234
Yu Oh, can you hear me?

484
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:14,234
Why is that no one is
able to hear me?

485
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,933
Yu Oh, can you hear me?

486
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:29,833
(Hotel Del Luna)

487
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:43,066
Welcome.

488
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:52,533
A king?

489
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:56,366
Tsk! How dare you!

490
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:08,134
Ms. Choi. Did something happen?

491
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,233
We have a VVIP here at our hotel.

492
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:18,933
VVIP…?

493
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,034
His Highness has arrived!

494
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,534
At last, I will have the honor of
seeing him up close,

495
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,067
which I never had
when I was still alive!

496
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,800
We have a big shot.

497
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,134
Gather all our staff.

498
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,700
Let's serve our VVIP guest
with our best hospitality,

499
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:34,166
and bring out
the best satisfaction.

500
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,366
Your Majesty.

501
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:58,100
It is my great pleasure and
honor to have you here.

502
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,767
I am Jang Man-wol,

503
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:04,400
the owner of this hotel.

504
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:10,233
The king?

505
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,933
King Taejo, King Jeongjong,
King Taejong, King Sejong the Great…

506
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:16,400
Which one?

507
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:20,600
Your room is ready, Your Majesty.
You must be greatly exhausted.

508
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:03,300
Your Majesty,
your dinner is served.

509
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,666
(VVIP)

510
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:20,734
Wait, this is…

511
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,267
The chamber pot.

512
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,967
Though he won't have
the need for it,

513
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:26,067
I thought he might miss
sitting on one.

514
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:29,034
I see. How considerate.

515
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,900
Now that I'm serving the king,
even if I die now I'll have…

516
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:36,000
I mean, I'm dead already,
but I have no regrets.

517
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:41,600
Your Majesty…

518
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,867
From today onward,

519
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:47,367
don't take any guests
in case they bring in bad energy.

520
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,667
Tell them to come back
after he leaves.

521
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:50,733
Yes, ma'am!

522
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:57,466
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

523
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,500
You shouldn't
discriminate your guests!

524
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,500
Hey, it's my choice.

525
00:37:02,566 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm busy, so if you're just
going to nag, go home.

526
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:09,067
He was dressed like a king
of Joseon. So which one is he?

527
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:10,933
You should know that
some were tyrants.

528
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,834
No! He didn't give out
any bad vibe.

529
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,433
Then did he have the vibe
of a good king?

530
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,733
Well…

531
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:24,034
Why do you keep challenging
my words?

532
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,167
What are you so
unhappy about, this time?

533
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:27,934
So you're not sure, huh?

534
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,466
But then again, this must be
your first time serving a king.

535
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:36,567
Then did you ever serve one,
in your previous jobs?

536
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:37,633
Yes.

537
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:41,400
A few of the Dubai royals.

538
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:42,534
Ha!

539
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,667
So?

540
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:46,134
Are you showing off that
you served Mansour?

541
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,567
- It wasn’t Mansour…
- Whatever.

542
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,300
Don't show off then,
if you never met Mansour.

543
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:51,366
Go home!

544
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,934
Oh, and Koo Chan-sung.

545
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,667
Try selling that Mt. Paekdu
painting at half-price, then.

546
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,533
You don't have to come into work
until it's sold.

547
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:09,566
Everyone's all excited over
a king coming here, huh?

548
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:14,134
The garden will be in full bloom
now that we have such a noble guest.

549
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,600
It will be important to
show him our best hospitality.

550
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,434
President Jang!

551
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,833
I have his signature.

552
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
(Check-in Form)

553
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,933
So his name is Lee Hyun.

554
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:29,566
Lee Hyun?

555
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,834
Which king had the name, Lee Hyun?

556
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,134
I don't quite remember that name.

557
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,534
Let's see.

558
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Lee Do is Han Seok-kyu,
Lee San is Lee Seo-jin,

559
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:42,434
- and Lee Hwon, Kim Soo-hyun…
- Not Kim Soo-hyun.

560
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,100
The king he played was
a fictitious one.

561
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,766
Right! Those historical dramas
with a modern twist. I know.

562
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,134
So, who's Lee Hyun?
Did you find him?

563
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,567
We do have a Lee Hyun.

564
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,434
Right? There is one, right?

565
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
I was right.

566
00:38:58,566 --> 00:39:01,166
But… He's also
a king from a TV show.

567
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:05,900
Let me see.

568
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:09,266
'The Woman Who Became Queen.'

569
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,000
Yes, that's right!

570
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:15,967
The king in this drama!
His name is Lee Hyun.

571
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:18,534
So he is a king.

572
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,734
President Jang…

573
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,000
Lee Hyun belongs to the
same category as Lee Hwon.

574
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:27,000
"Historical dramas with
a modern... twist."

575
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,966
What did you say?

576
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,400
The drama,
'The Woman Who Became Queen,'

577
00:39:37,466 --> 00:39:39,100
is a fictional story
with a historical setting

578
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,534
where the queen, who suffers
from threats of assassination,

579
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,334
has a gisaeng that looks
just like her to act on her behalf.

580
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,600
For your information, Lee Hyun is
the name of the king in the show.

581
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,367
Then who's that king just now?

582
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:54,167
Why did he say he's Lee Hyun?

583
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:56,634
Our hotel guest is,
in other words…

584
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,633
Actor Bang Tae-woo.

585
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,367
(A Surprise Casting for 'The Woman Who Became Queen')
After many various minor roles,

586
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:07,000
Actor Bang Tae-woo had
landed his first major role

587
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:05,200
(Bang Tae-woo lands
his first major role)

588
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:09,100
and that was Lee Hyun,
the king in the story.

589
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:12,167
But tragically,
he met with a sudden death

590
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:15,334
due to cardiac arrest
while exercising,

591
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,866
even before the cameras
started rolling.

592
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:21,200
In other words, he's not a king,

593
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:26,100
but a passionate actor
who was to play the king?

594
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:29,067
But the way he carried himself
and even his speech too,

595
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:30,500
he was just like a king!

596
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:33,034
It seems he was too
absorbed in his role that

597
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,200
he now believes
himself to be a real king.

598
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,967
I'm really embarrassed
about this whole thing,

599
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:50,267
so once he finishes his breakfast,
get him on the bus

600
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:51,466
and send him off.

601
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,333
Ugh, damnit.

602
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:13,333
So I heard… he's not the real king!

603
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,700
You should've seen him through
the moment I raised the suspicions.

604
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,900
Yes, you're so smart.

605
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:20,400
I knew this might happen,

606
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:22,000
so I didn't turn away
the guests who just arrived.

607
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:24,067
In other words, I was wise.

608
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,867
Yes, you're so smart!

609
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:29,100
You see, I noted
this tiny scar on his face.

610
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,034
Did you see it? No, huh?

611
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,634
Because there's no way that
a Joseon king would have

612
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,534
a scar on his face!

613
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,934
You know Queen Yoon,
who was dethroned.

614
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,934
I'm sure you do,
because you love dramas.

615
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,067
Yes, she was
the mother of Gwanghaegun.

616
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:42,634
It's Yeonsangun.

617
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,567
That's why you should've done your
research about which king he was.

618
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,567
You said you could feel his vibe.

619
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:49,500
Or were you fooled by his acting?

620
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:54,034
Well, his acting was damn good!

621
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,167
Do you know what passion
it takes for that?

622
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:59,667
I mean, the guy must've been
so desperate to play king that

623
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:02,400
he now thinks he really is a king!

624
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,334
Why are you looking down
on actors like that?

625
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,566
Who are you to, anyway?
You think you're above them, do you?

626
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,267
I was only trying to say that
I could tell he wasn't a king.

627
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:15,234
A hotelier should treat
all of his guests like kings!

628
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,200
Whether he's Mansour or
a king from a historical drama.

629
00:42:17,266 --> 00:42:19,300
all our guests are kings
at our hotel!

630
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,066
Since when did she treat
all our guests as kings?

631
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,666
(I'm so tired of seeing
Yu Oh's bad acting)

632
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:42,267
The actor who replaced him
is a bad actor,

633
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,800
and he's getting bashed.

634
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,367
If he had played that role,

635
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,866
people would've thought he was
possessed by a royal spirit.

636
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,866
Wait, do you think that's possible?

637
00:43:10,466 --> 00:43:13,567
I thought about what you said
and reflected on myself.

638
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,034
I was even touched when you said

639
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,600
all our guests are kings
at our hotel.

640
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,900
If you were, then be good.

641
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:22,400
That's why I thought,

642
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,700
if our guest wants to
be a part of the show,

643
00:43:25,766 --> 00:43:27,300
we should grant his wish.

644
00:43:30,466 --> 00:43:31,900
As a hotelier,

645
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:34,500
our task is to make him a king
if he wants it

646
00:43:34,566 --> 00:43:36,767
whether he's Mansour,

647
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,566
or a king from a historical drama.

648
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:51,167
One more take.

649
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,733
We need pictures for proof.

650
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,767
Show them that it's really good.

651
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,033
One, two, three!

652
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:02,334
Yu Oh's fan club ordered
pizzas for the crew

653
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,634
from Sanchez's pizza chain.

654
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,166
Thanks to him, we were able to
get in without problems.

655
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,600
Is there any meaning to
possessing the actor?

656
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,534
It's not like his face will be
on the camera.

657
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,033
(Enjoy your pizza and
show us some unreal acting!)

658
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,267
I really should act better,
now that we got pizza…

659
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,534
- I'm really sorry.
- No, this is really delicious.

660
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,700
Tell him to just
take a look around the set,

661
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:23,200
treat the crews to pizza and go.

662
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,567
President Jang.

663
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:27,367
This is what our guest wants.

664
00:44:27,433 --> 00:44:29,000
He's anticipating this very much.

665
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,767
- A hotelier…
- Ugh.

666
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:32,666
Alright, fine.

667
00:44:34,566 --> 00:44:35,834
Guard the pizza truck.

668
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,733
I'm going to go and
get their filming schedule.

669
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:42,800
(Food Staff)

670
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:45,833
Excuse me, pizza lady.

671
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,234
Can you deliver five pizzas to
our costumes staff?

672
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,434
Thanks!

673
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,800
Stop right there.

674
00:44:56,733 --> 00:45:00,267
Excuse me, I don’t do deliveries.

675
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,733
If they want pizza, they can
come and get it themselves.

676
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
Sure…

677
00:45:10,066 --> 00:45:11,400
How rude!

678
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:14,933
(Enjoy your pizza and
show us some unreal acting!)

679
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:18,466
If this human was an actor
who could act…

680
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,633
Yes, sir. It's me, Yu Oh.

681
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,867
Are you sure the writer agreed to
write me out of that scene?

682
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:31,233
That means I have the
last two weeks free, right?

683
00:45:31,866 --> 00:45:35,034
Why should I care if
the drama is a flop?

684
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,000
Or just tell them that
I'm seriously injured!

685
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:39,000
Ugh, this is too tight.

686
00:45:39,066 --> 00:45:40,066
What?

687
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,900
But how can she become a queen
if there is no king?

688
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:45,400
My guarantee?

689
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:47,467
I don't need
a few hundred thousand dollars,

690
00:45:47,533 --> 00:45:49,667
I just want to be out.

691
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:50,767
A few hundred thousand dollars?

692
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,200
I'm happy for my character to die.
Or be killed, even.

693
00:45:53,266 --> 00:45:55,100
Or just say that I died.
That Yu Oh is dead!

694
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,433
Anyway, I just can't.

695
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,833
Hold on.

696
00:45:59,866 --> 00:46:01,100
Yes!

697
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,400
Even if his face may not
make it on the air,

698
00:46:04,466 --> 00:46:06,900
he might be paid a guarantee.

699
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:15,533
The king doesn’t appear
all that often.

700
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,700
It's just one scene,
so let's help him.

701
00:46:20,766 --> 00:46:22,867
Let's take this one scene,

702
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:26,633
and show them what
soulful acting's all about.

703
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,633
How did scene 17 end?

704
00:46:38,233 --> 00:46:41,266
Then… He can exit right here.

705
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,366
Let's start!

706
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,666
My Queen, you are
the only woman I've loved.

707
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,134
Wow, I'm really bad.

708
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,566
This is driving me crazy!

709
00:46:55,233 --> 00:46:57,233
You are the only… You…

710
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:01,733
…My Queen.

711
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:03,933
I should ask for help.

712
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:10,066
Excuse me! Uh, My Queen?

713
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,134
Um, My Queen!

714
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,966
Why don't we go through
this together? Hello?

715
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:16,066
My Queen!

716
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,100
My Queen.

717
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:30,834
Uh, My Queen?

718
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,600
Why don't we go through
this together, just once?

719
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:34,300
The director's starting to
lose his patience with me.

720
00:47:34,366 --> 00:47:35,366
So help me out, please.

721
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,434
This scene 42 here.
There's so much emotion here.

722
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,566
Jeez!

723
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:53,966
Who are you?

724
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,100
Look in to my eyes, Your Majesty.

725
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:03,333
Your Majesty…

726
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:35,200
Your Majesty?

727
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:41,533
What is it, My Queen?

728
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,066
You are the king of this country,
the one who stands above us all.

729
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:50,234
That's right.

730
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,433
I am Lee Hyun,
the king of this country.

731
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:08,500
Your Majesty…

732
00:49:09,933 --> 00:49:11,900
I am a fake.

733
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:14,466
I am not your queen.

734
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:18,367
Is that why you tried to leave me?

735
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:20,500
If I remain by your side…

736
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,566
You will be in danger,
Your Majesty.

737
00:49:23,566 --> 00:49:25,700
If you hide in the mountains,

738
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:27,967
I will cut down all the trees
until I find you.

739
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:30,267
And if you depart for the sea,

740
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,600
I will dry up all its waters
to stop you!

741
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,900
Your Majesty…

742
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,266
By my royal command,

743
00:49:42,466 --> 00:49:44,400
do not leave me.

744
00:49:54,766 --> 00:49:55,867
Cut!

745
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:57,333
All right!

746
00:49:58,233 --> 00:50:01,267
Wow, that was great.
That was really good!

747
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,267
You were awesome just now.

748
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,434
My Queen…

749
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,966
Yu Oh, you're great today.

750
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,533
Well done!

751
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,034
- It worked out well, right?
- Yu Oh, you were great!

752
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,066
- Oh what?
- Pardon?

753
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,666
We're done?

754
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,533
Well done, Yu Oh!

755
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,033
You were truly amazing,
Your Majesty.

756
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:55,033
Make way for
His Majesty, the king!

757
00:51:13,366 --> 00:51:15,200
Do not

758
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:17,634
bring up the queen's dethronement
from this point onward.

759
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,000
But Your Majesty,

760
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:22,000
how could she set an example
for our people,

761
00:51:22,066 --> 00:51:26,434
when her background is lowly?

762
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,600
Do give it another thought,
Your Majesty.

763
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,133
I will not put up
with this insolence!

764
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,067
What? Our guest will be
possessing the actor

765
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:38,833
until the end of the show?

766
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:47,300
Yes, apparently so.

767
00:51:47,366 --> 00:51:50,766
Why? I thought she was going to
put him on the bus right away.

768
00:51:51,933 --> 00:51:53,367
See, if he acts,

769
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:56,666
there's something for us,
if not for him.

770
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:02,034
Amazing! How could this be?

771
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,267
You know, after
we rehearsed together,

772
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,167
I was able to show
some unreal acting.

773
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:07,767
You know.

774
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,900
It was as if I had
switched souls with someone!

775
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:14,334
Or… are you an acting teacher?

776
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,666
Do you…

777
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,600
…want to continue
acting like that?

778
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:20,167
Why, of course!
I'll be in your care.

779
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,167
So please, help me out. Please?

780
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:26,300
Then let's start by
negotiating your guarantee.

781
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:28,434
My guarantee?

782
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,067
Right, my guarantee!
So you know about it.

783
00:52:31,133 --> 00:52:32,734
Sure, you can have it all.

784
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,834
How much are you paid
per episode, exactly?

785
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,000
It's $120,000 per episode,

786
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:37,500
but now I'm back in for
those last two weeks.

787
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:39,834
That's 4 episodes,
meaning $480,000…

788
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,434
You could almost buy
a house with that.

789
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,866
But you can have it all.
It's fine with me!

790
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,834
Since our guest has also
given his consent and

791
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,034
is genuinely acting for
this guarantee,

792
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,467
I don’t see that it's a problem.

793
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:57,200
You know, I never knew
actors got paid that much!

794
00:52:58,033 --> 00:53:00,334
Koo Chan-sung, how about
you go into acting?

795
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,166
It's not for me.
I don't have the talent.

796
00:53:03,933 --> 00:53:05,200
Right,

797
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,900
you just don't have
the actor vibe.

798
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:09,567
So be honest with me.

799
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:12,834
When you said to me last time
about how I had no money,

800
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,100
not even for a chicken noodle soup,

801
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,200
you were lying, weren't you?

802
00:53:16,266 --> 00:53:19,167
I wasn't lying when I said
you're behind on loan payments,

803
00:53:19,233 --> 00:53:21,000
but the chicken noodle soup was
a little stretching it, yes.

804
00:53:21,066 --> 00:53:23,767
You can afford some
spicy stir-fried octopus at least.

805
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,334
That's right, octopus!

806
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,400
Because of you,
I never got my octopus.

807
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:31,100
Sure, sure. It's all my fault.

808
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,466
I'll forgive you, since you're
so quick to reflect on yourself.

809
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,267
Let's go then, to the West Coast.

810
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,534
Though I'm still not sure
if it will, let's see the sun rise

811
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,000
and have some octopus.

812
00:53:42,066 --> 00:53:44,866
Oh what? Why are you being
so nice to me now?

813
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:49,467
Oh, is it because
I'm going to be your last guest?

814
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,733
Is that the reason for
your sudden change of attitude?

815
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,434
You'll give me all you want, huh?

816
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,733
What an outstanding
hotelier you are.

817
00:53:58,933 --> 00:54:00,800
I'm not that outstanding, actually.

818
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:02,600
Because a hotelier

819
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:05,200
shouldn't let his personal feelings
interfere when serving his guests.

820
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:07,900
What?

821
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,100
When did you let your
personal feelings interfere?

822
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:15,500
The leaves.

823
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,034
You showed me how
there's two now.

824
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,700
How could I just ignore that, right?

825
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:30,134
I've had too much champagne
today, so no.

826
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,533
But we could always go
tomorrow, if you wanted.

827
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,867
I have to be on the set tomorrow.

828
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:38,834
You don't have to.

829
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,566
We have an intern for that.

830
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,300
(The Woman Who Became Queen)

831
00:54:51,733 --> 00:54:53,267
You're our intern?

832
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,467
Yes.

833
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:57,367
You can quit whenever you want to.

834
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:59,100
Because I can always replace you.

835
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,167
A student should just
diligently go to school.

836
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:03,866
I'm trying to, yes.

837
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,933
As courtesy to someone who had
fantasies about school.

838
00:55:11,733 --> 00:55:13,834
But since school's over for
the day, can I join you?

839
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,534
I still can't find it
during the day.

840
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,867
Let's go another time.
I'm meeting someone here today.

841
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:20,700
You are? Who?

842
00:55:20,766 --> 00:55:21,700
A spirit?

843
00:55:21,766 --> 00:55:23,633
A human. A friend.

844
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,366
Not interested in humans.
I'm leaving.

845
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,534
I should've taken off
this "take out" bit.

846
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,634
- Thanks for the pizza.
- Sure.

847
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,900
So you're a relative of Man-wol?
Come by often.

848
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:38,966
Sure.

849
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:41,633
Ah, Mi-ra. You're here.

850
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,300
Chan-sung's already here,
he's inside.

851
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:08,700
He said a friend,
but it's his girlfriend.

852
00:56:14,566 --> 00:56:16,000
It's been a long time.

853
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,233
Yes.

854
00:56:28,366 --> 00:56:29,700
President Jang,
are you going somewhere?

855
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:31,567
You seem to be in high spirits.

856
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,834
Yes, to the beach.

857
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,500
The beach?
But we have one here at our hotel.

858
00:56:36,566 --> 00:56:38,800
They're not the same beach!

859
00:56:38,866 --> 00:56:40,067
How are they different?

860
00:56:40,133 --> 00:56:41,200
Well, the beach here…

861
00:56:44,566 --> 00:56:47,834
Octopus! There's no octopus here.

862
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,833
I'm going to eat octopus today.

863
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:52,900
Should I tell Yu-na to
get some for you?

864
00:56:52,966 --> 00:56:53,967
Don’t.

865
00:56:54,033 --> 00:56:55,800
I'm going to go
and get some myself.

866
00:56:55,866 --> 00:56:58,834
Mr. Koo should really take you.

867
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,534
Should I call him?

868
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,500
He'll come, no need.

869
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:04,534
But then again,
I don't want to interrupt him

870
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,633
when he's with his girlfriend.

871
00:57:07,266 --> 00:57:10,300
Yu-na saw her, and
said she's really pretty.

872
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:13,267
Mr. Koo's always
surrounded by spirits,

873
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,833
so he should hang out with humans
when he's not at work.

874
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,567
Otherwise it'll be so tragic,

875
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:23,500
if he ages like Mr. Noh
with no one by his side.

876
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,400
Anyway, enjoy your time
at the beach, President Jang.

877
00:57:30,466 --> 00:57:31,867
Ji Hyun-joong.

878
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:33,334
If there are any guests
at our outdoor pool,

879
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,900
tell them they have 30 minutes.

880
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:37,300
I'm going to take a break there.

881
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:40,100
I thought you're going to
the beach that's far away.

882
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,300
They're the same beach,
so why bother?

883
00:57:43,066 --> 00:57:46,700
I choose not to go.

884
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,466
Should I go bring you
some spicy stir-fried octopus?

885
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:56,334
I thought you'd never return
to Korea, but here you are.

886
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,067
Why? Does seeing me here
make you nervous now?

887
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:01,166
I'm just happy to see you,
that's all.

888
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,867
I thought it was fishy that
you came to see me first,

889
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:05,200
so I did some asking around.

890
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:07,534
I heard your family kicked you out
because of all your debts.

891
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,200
It's not much, really!

892
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:11,467
I'm a doctor.
I'll pay it back in no time.

893
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:14,100
In no time? Great.

894
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:16,300
I don't have much time,
so let's settle this quick.

895
00:58:16,366 --> 00:58:18,634
Pay me back first.
My five thousand dollars.

896
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,167
It's been so long, so do we really
have to talk about money?

897
00:58:21,233 --> 00:58:24,034
It's been so long and that's why
we're talking about money.

898
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,834
If it hasn't been,

899
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,000
I would've sued you.

900
00:58:27,066 --> 00:58:29,234
Whatever, not buying it.

901
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,534
I know just how much you loved me.

902
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,766
There's no way you'd sue me.

903
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,100
Fine. When you asked me to
lend you five thousand dollars

904
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:41,134
and I did, out of
what was my tuition fees,

905
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,700
I loved you, Lee Mi-ra.

906
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:44,100
Chan-sung.

907
00:58:44,166 --> 00:58:47,800
Try and remember
just how much you loved me.

908
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,634
Before that, let me calculate
how much you owe me now.

909
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,634
Alright, I'll give it to you!

910
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,800
But I mean it. I called you
because I really missed you.

911
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,334
Anyway, it's so nice seeing you.

912
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,867
You're really as clueless as ever.

913
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:01,366
You still like me, right?

914
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,933
Fine.

915
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,300
Don't sprinkle too much.
You have a weak stomach.

916
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:13,333
I see you haven't changed.

917
00:59:14,533 --> 00:59:18,400
Chan-sung, I heard
you're not seeing anyone…

918
00:59:18,466 --> 00:59:19,466
One moment.

919
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,300
Excuse me!

920
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Please wait.

921
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,300
- Yes?
- Mr. Kim Jun-hyun?

922
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:03,400
Yes?

923
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,434
May I have your autograph?

924
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,666
Ah, sure.

925
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:10,633
So you ran here, did you?

926
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,767
Wait, let me borrow your back.

927
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:16,433
- My back?
- I need a flat surface.

928
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,567
So, who should I address it to?

929
01:00:18,633 --> 01:00:20,767
- Jang Man-wol.
- Jang Man-wol…

930
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:23,333
She's a big fan of yours,
Mr. Kim Jun-hyun.

931
01:00:24,066 --> 01:00:25,700
Please pass on my thanks.

932
01:00:25,766 --> 01:00:27,234
What a nice name.

933
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,400
Okay, that's done!

934
01:00:29,933 --> 01:00:31,267
Alright, then.

935
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:33,434
- Um…
- Yes?

936
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,067
Can I have a photo, too?

937
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:36,700
She's always so full of suspicions.

938
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,667
So she is, is she?

939
01:00:38,733 --> 01:00:40,834
Sure, let's take one.

940
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,500
It's all about photos for proof
these days, huh?

941
01:00:43,366 --> 01:00:45,200
How should we pose?

942
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,366
One, two, three!

943
01:00:58,966 --> 01:01:00,566
(President Jang Man-wol)

944
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:04,600
I was just about to call you.

945
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:06,067
Guess who I met!

946
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:07,200
Koo Chan-sung.

947
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:10,100
You can have a day off.
No need to come in.

948
01:01:11,966 --> 01:01:14,033
But weren't we supposed to
go to the beach together?

949
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:16,834
I have the beach right here
at the hotel.

950
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,834
They're the same beach.

951
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,566
So no need to come in.
Have a day off.

952
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,733
(To: Ms. Jang Man-wol
I love you)

953
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:05,200
So this is where you were.

954
01:03:05,266 --> 01:03:06,966
How did you know where I was?

955
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:09,066
I heard from Yeon-woo.

956
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,834
Man, if you knew
a fine place like this,

957
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,467
you should've told
your brother first thing.

958
01:03:15,533 --> 01:03:17,467
Don't just keep it to yourself.

959
01:03:17,533 --> 01:03:20,034
This is a great place to
drink by yourself.

960
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,166
So get lost.

961
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:44,033
Can you tell the scenery's
just gotten better?

962
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,067
The same old fireflies.
Is there a difference?

963
01:04:51,133 --> 01:04:52,500
Of course there is.

964
01:04:52,566 --> 01:04:54,334
You were alone before,

965
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,566
but now I'm here with you.

966
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,633
From now on, every scene you see
with me will be different.

967
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:13,200
And you won't enjoy it anymore,
drinking here by yourself.

968
01:05:14,233 --> 01:05:17,034
Because I guarantee,

969
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,900
you'll be waiting for me to show up
out of the blue, just like tonight.

970
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:55,500
The tree I've been growing
at the lunar inn

971
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:57,934
stood so obstinate for
all these years,

972
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,300
but recently, it's become
more and more beautiful.

973
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:05,834
It seems that young man you sent
her is taking good care of her.

974
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,100
You think he might be
the right medication,

975
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:09,900
but he may turn out to be poison.

976
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:15,300
Love can be medicine or poison,
depending on the circumstances.

977
01:07:15,366 --> 01:07:18,033
Anyway, it's really hard work.

978
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:22,733
Gosh, this has
become tangled again!

979
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,234
Just what to do…

980
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,066
Just what!

981
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,466
(How about you join me for
a sandwich, Rich Boy?)

982
01:07:37,466 --> 01:07:38,500
Actually, no.

983
01:07:38,566 --> 01:07:41,566
It's ridiculous, asking out
a spirit for a sandwich.

984
01:07:44,033 --> 01:07:45,366
What should I say?

985
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:56,400
What was that just now?

986
01:07:56,466 --> 01:07:58,766
That was really creepy.

987
01:08:01,066 --> 01:08:02,300
(Hey, anything interesting
these days?)

988
01:08:02,366 --> 01:08:03,434
(Somebody send us something)

989
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,867
(How about this one?)

990
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:06,067
(It's the hottest video right now,)

991
01:08:06,133 --> 01:08:07,267
(but don't tap on it
if you're too faint-hearted)

992
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,133
(Oh, that rumored video?
I haven't seen it yet)

993
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,100
Oh, he's scaring me?

994
01:08:19,533 --> 01:08:20,533
You like that?

995
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:22,700
Do you?

996
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:26,766
What a killer, right?

997
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,867
President Jang is
at the beach, alone?

998
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:03,300
Yes, and she doesn't want
any interruptions.

999
01:09:24,133 --> 01:09:26,334
Is this operations?
I'm at the beach right now.

1000
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,567
Why's the sun so strong?

1001
01:09:28,633 --> 01:09:30,300
I don't want midday,

1002
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:34,800
I want… 6 p.m.
Switch it to sunset mode.

1003
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:50,233
Whether the sun's high up
or setting,

1004
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,633
the beach is still the same.

1005
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,933
Maybe I should ask for
some big waves.

1006
01:10:00,766 --> 01:10:02,266
Like that will change anything.

1007
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,567
Why are you here?

1008
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:08,366
I thought you don't want to
go to the beach with me.

1009
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,734
I just thought it was funny.

1010
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,234
Funny?

1011
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,766
You and your whims…

1012
01:10:21,066 --> 01:10:22,733
Why are you here?
I said you have the day off.

1013
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:26,134
I did something really funny,

1014
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,366
but now I can't say it
in case you'll laugh at me.

1015
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,900
- What is it?
- Don't laugh.

1016
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:34,166
I'm not in the mood to laugh.
What is it?

1017
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,233
(To: Ms. Jang Man-wol
I love you)

1018
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:51,233
You don't like it?

1019
01:10:52,533 --> 01:10:55,733
"To Ms. Jang Man-wol, I love you?"

1020
01:10:56,933 --> 01:10:58,800
Are you confessing your love
to me?

1021
01:10:58,866 --> 01:11:00,200
No!

1022
01:11:00,266 --> 01:11:02,534
It's not me who wrote this.

1023
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,033
This is Kim Jun-hyun's autograph.
Kim Jun-hyun!

1024
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:06,866
Kim Jun-hyun?

1025
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:11,067
It is!

1026
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,400
I ran and got it for you,

1027
01:11:12,466 --> 01:11:15,567
although it was so embarrassing
for me on the street.

1028
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:16,933
Because I knew you'd like it.

1029
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,633
Or don't you?

1030
01:11:28,733 --> 01:11:29,800
I do like it.

1031
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,600
I like it very much.

1032
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,966
I knew you'd like it.

1033
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:47,400
It was really embarrassing,
asking for his autograph.

1034
01:11:54,133 --> 01:11:57,100
Anyway, just staying here is
still nice.

1035
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,533
Although there's no octopus.

1036
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,233
It's okay.

1037
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,066
You're here, after all.

1038
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,366
The sea's beautiful.

1039
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:25,866
Right.

1040
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:30,966
It's so sad.

1041
01:12:41,933 --> 01:12:43,533
I'm…

1042
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:47,700
…a bit sad now.

1043
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,366
Because the sea I'm looking at

1044
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:57,500
now seems more beautiful

1045
01:13:01,433 --> 01:13:03,066
than the sea
I was staring at before.

1046
01:14:08,366 --> 01:14:12,200
(Hotel Del Luna)

1047
01:14:12,933 --> 01:14:14,734
You have the ability to
look into me,

1048
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,333
so you'll slowly find out
how bad I was.

1049
01:14:18,733 --> 01:14:19,866
You shouldn't do this!

1050
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:21,700
Just let him be.

1051
01:14:21,766 --> 01:14:24,034
Kill all you want,
until you're satisfied.

1052
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,266
Here, take your pick.

1053
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,834
Lee Mi-ra…

1054
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,600
I invited you to this hotel.

1055
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:31,667
This isn't a place you can come
in your dreams,

1056
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:32,933
but only through death.
