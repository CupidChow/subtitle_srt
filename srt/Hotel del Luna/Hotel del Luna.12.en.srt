(Episode 12)

8
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,100
The man who bloomed
those flowers for you.

9
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,700
What about losing him, then?

10
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:57,934
Man-wol, you proud and
foolish soul.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,333
Did you say you don't fear
the flowers wilting?

12
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,266
No.

13
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,300
It's when you hold fear
in your heart,

14
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:09,633
that the flowers start to wilt.

15
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,333
It's been a long time,
Koo Chan-sung.

16
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:32,367
Oh, I get it. So when I'm all,

17
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:34,967
"Why are you doing this to me?
I'm so scared?"

18
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:37,500
and shiver like
a poor puppy in the rain,

19
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,834
the flower petals start
raining down and

20
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,600
that's when you'll drag me to
the underworld, is it?

21
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,900
Right.

22
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:48,700
You've always been so uptight.

23
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,900
But you know, no need for that.

24
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:59,600
Bring him to me right now,
right here.

25
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,734
I'll gladly put an end to it all,

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,700
and perish for good.

27
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:09,234
Just as I wished for
all these years,

28
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,333
hanging onto the hope
that day will come.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,500
That man too,

30
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,767
will be brought to you
by Koo Chan-sung.

31
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,767
Why involve him in this?

32
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,233
It wasn't me who got him
involved in this.

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
It's my other face who wishes to
send you off nicely.

34
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:31,134
For all these thousand years
you've been around,

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,967
all you've wished for is
to perish.

36
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,267
The price that
Koo Chan-sung must pay

37
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,467
for someone like you is unfair.

38
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,966
It is unjust, and unreasonable.

39
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,500
I tried to stop him,
but he took it on himself.

40
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,267
You wicked thing!

41
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,234
Yes, yes.

42
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,534
I'm bad and wicked for keeping him
by my side, despite it all.

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,867
You are. Very wicked.

44
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,500
Because of you,

45
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:01,500
that child had to face a past
connection that was severed.

46
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,434
What more unfairness

47
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,800
must you put him through?

48
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,234
It pleases to see you

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,566
quivering like that.

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,200
It's you, isn't it? Chan-sung.

51
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:58,334
Don't you remember me?

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,833
Your friend,
Seol Ji-won from Boston.

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,900
Right, Seol Ji-won. So it was you.

54
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,267
What brings you here?

55
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,900
Oh, you heard from Sanchez?

56
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,633
Or maybe Mi-ra, perhaps?

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,534
No, someone else.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,400
I was told you were back in Korea,

59
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,366
but I'm surprised to see
that you're really here.

60
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,800
Really?

61
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,867
You couldn't have come here
because you missed me.

62
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,233
Why did you come here?

63
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,434
I heard you were preparing to
go to law school.

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,534
Or that's no longer the case?

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,700
Did your father, who's a judge,
finally give up on you?

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,300
He didn't give up on me,
but he passed away.

67
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:51,934
Now I'm just doing what I like
right here.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,733
And what is it that
you're happily up to?

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,166
I see, wine!

70
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,866
Do you have any good wines here?

71
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,233
Give me a glass.

72
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,266
Sure, why not?

73
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:29,367
Is that him?

74
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:30,966
The person who killed you?

75
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,633
What are you doing here?

76
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800
What were you doing here?

77
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,400
Is murder…

78
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,800
…what you've been enjoying?

79
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:02,866
Your call cannot be
connected right now. Please…

80
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,433
Why isn't he picking up?

81
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,667
I should go to his place again.

82
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:16,167
You've been going back and forth
plenty of times already.

83
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:16,966
I'm sure he'll come.

84
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,900
We promised to meet,
but he's not here and

85
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,500
he's not picking up.
Something's not right!

86
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,067
But how will I find him,
unless I know where he is?

87
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:25,667
I'm sure he has his reason.

88
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,500
Why are you so worried?

89
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,034
The man who bloomed
those flowers for you.

90
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,666
What about losing him, then?

91
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:49,366
Someone told me
something terrible.

92
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm going to find him.

93
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:57,666
President Jang.

94
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,266
He's not picking up.

95
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,600
- Hello?
- What do we do?

96
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,434
What is it, Yu-na?

97
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,900
I think Mr. Koo is hurt.

98
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,366
What if he's dead?

99
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:32,234
What?

100
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,267
No. 3 is dead?

101
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,633
It seems he died while he was off to
catch the murderer.

102
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,367
President Jang. President Jang!

103
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:46,500
What are we to do?

104
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,266
Mr. Koo is dead.

105
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,866
What?

106
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:04,134
The guests who are here…

107
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,900
Yu-na followed a car to
find their murderer,

108
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:11,267
but Mr. Koo went in her stead

109
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,966
saying it was dangerous. And now…

110
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,300
Don't talk nonsense.

111
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,567
Why would Koo Chan-sung die?

112
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:28,200
Yu-na saw the ambulance
take him away.

113
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,833
Tell me clearly.

114
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,666
What happened, exactly?

115
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:25,900
Stop crying!

116
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,866
Mr. Koo?

117
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,834
Ji Hyun-joong, you little…!

118
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,167
- Come here!
- President Jang. President Jang!

119
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,200
President Jang!

120
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:18,366
You…

121
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,666
You're not dead. Thank goodness.

122
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:46,866
Mr. Koo.

123
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,900
You're alive.

124
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,467
We thought you'd come here
as our guest.

125
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,500
What? Guest?

126
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,900
We were told you went in alone to
meet the murderer,

127
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:11,534
but then you wouldn't pick up
your phone.

128
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,300
And when we heard someone
got hurt, we thought it was you.

129
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,400
I didn't act recklessly,

130
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,934
clearly knowing that
it could get dangerous.

131
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,366
I called a police officer I know
before going in.

132
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,400
Stop right there!

133
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,933
Good work. So who got hurt?

134
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,266
The culprit.

135
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,167
Mr. Seol Ji-won,
you are under arrest

136
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,600
as a suspect of murder.

137
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:54,666
Put it down.

138
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,434
It wasn't
a life-threatening injury,

139
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,366
so he'll pay for his sin
while he's still alive.

140
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:17,600
Thank goodness!

141
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,100
We thought you'd come here
as our guest earlier.

142
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,834
I knew it wasn't the case
as soon as he stepped in.

143
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,300
Whatever. You were crying!

144
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,167
I saw you wipe those tears.

145
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,667
It was snot.

146
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,533
You should talk for yourself.
Your legs almost gave out!

147
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,300
I'm sorry to startle you all.

148
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:39,334
And… thank you for
worrying about me.

149
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,167
You almost stopped our
already stopped hearts.

150
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,734
What a shock, that was.

151
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,600
Now we'll have another wave of
President Jang's hysteria,

152
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,167
so let's brace ourselves for it.

153
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,200
Here.

154
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,266
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

155
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,500
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

156
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,166
Where'd she go?

157
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:13,300
I brought these, in case

158
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,200
a few bottles wouldn't be enough
to calm her down.

159
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:22,200
Ms. Jang Man-wol,
where have you been?

160
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,766
- Have you been out shopping?
- Have a seat, Koo Chan-sung.

161
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,934
You were at the pharmacist's?

162
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,900
Yes, because we don't have
a first-aid kit for the living here.

163
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,234
Did you empty the entire place?

164
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,400
I said, sit.

165
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,366
Let me see.

166
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:58,700
Goodness… look at you.

167
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,833
But which one?

168
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,400
Let's go with the
most expensive one.

169
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,800
- Ouch, that hurts.
- Does it sting?

170
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,734
I guess this one's no good.

171
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,733
Let me see.

172
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:29,167
Hey, this is for hemorrhoids!

173
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,200
Huh?

174
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,766
Sorry. I used something that's for
your ass on your face.

175
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:37,834
Come here.

176
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,300
It's alright.

177
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,267
If it heals down there, I'm sure
it'll do the same for the face.

178
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,900
You think your butthole and
your face are the same thing?

179
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,266
Give it to me.
Let's try another one.

180
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:52,334
Were you shocked?

181
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,466
Because you thought
I'd died and come as a guest?

182
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,400
How could you mistake
something like that?

183
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,766
Because I was scared.

184
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,300
I was so frightened, as if
the whole world had gone black.

185
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:28,533
I'd never got it wrong, even when
I'd lost my cool over money.

186
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,667
You made me a laughing stock.

187
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,234
All my employees were
watching, too…

188
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,833
Ugh, how embarrassing!

189
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,233
Just which is which?

190
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,367
Wait right here.

191
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:46,366
I'll see if we have a former
pharmacist among our guests.

192
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,700
You had quite a fright, too.

193
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:53,300
Shouldn't you also have something?

194
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,500
What, do you have anything
that'll calm me down?

195
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:08,666
It was quite a shock for you,
right?

196
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,233
Are you the pharmacist, or what?

197
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:22,866
Well, I am supposed to be
taking care of you.

198
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,467
It's when you hold fear
in your heart,

199
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,700
that the flowers start to wilt.

200
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:58,400
I have good news, too.

201
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,567
Your Yeon-woo…

202
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,400
I mean, Detective Park Young-soo
arrested the culprit.

203
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,400
He'll probably get
a special promotion.

204
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,266
We found all the drugs and
the needles he used for the murder.

205
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:22,834
It seems he smuggled the drugs
while importing wine.

206
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
This must represent that
website, "Hell-lo."

207
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,833
Did you find Seol Ji-won by
searching this site?

208
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,833
To tell you the truth…

209
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,833
There was a tip-off.

210
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,966
Who?

211
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:38,934
You're the late Ms. Lee Do-yeon?

212
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,800
My husband is not the murderer.

213
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,434
The murderer is still here.

214
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,267
You shouldn't be prank-calling.

215
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,200
Blood… there's blood.

216
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:49,267
He draws blood from the dead
and keeps a collection.

217
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,466
Please come here, quick!
It's getting dangerous.

218
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,567
We never made it public that
there were traces of

219
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:56,633
blood being drawn from
the victims' bodies.

220
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,500
That bothered me,
so I came here, and…

221
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,867
There really is blood, right here.

222
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,966
That guy's truly a devil!

223
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:09,334
To keep a collection among
his wine…

224
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,334
So who do you suppose was
the caller?

225
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,966
It really couldn't have been
the dead.

226
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:18,333
It's so strange.

227
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,933
Don't lend your bodies to
spirits so recklessly like that.

228
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,400
Promise me,

229
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:32,200
that you won't ever do that
while I'm not around.

230
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:33,700
I only got her help to

231
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:35,600
report him and find evidence.

232
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,400
Take these.

233
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,866
And go home, and get some rest.

234
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,700
The bags of medicine have
gotten bigger.

235
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:48,634
- What's this?
- A massager.

236
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,867
Use it here before you go to bed,
it relaxes your muscles.

237
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:55,134
Here's also a sleep shade,
and a bottle of champagne.

238
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,300
Ah, and caviar.
This is expensive stuff, you know.

239
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,534
Take it easy on them.

240
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,866
You've shared some very
precious things with me, huh?

241
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:06,433
Since you have a lot to carry,
how about you take…

242
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,200
Actually, no.

243
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:11,733
Why don't you just take
one of the cars for yourself?

244
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,900
Really?

245
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,900
Then the red one!
Can I take the red one?

246
00:22:16,966 --> 00:22:17,900
What?

247
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:24,167
What? But you don't like… red.
Or do you?

248
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,366
I do.

249
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,866
Really?

250
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,900
Is that so?

251
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,366
Fine, then.

252
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,534
You can have it.

253
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,900
Though there's just one red one…

254
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,833
Fine, you can have it.

255
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:44,366
Why, thanks!

256
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,334
This isn't the key.

257
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,733
It's that one, over there.

258
00:22:58,866 --> 00:22:59,866
Here.

259
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,633
It's so nice to be alive after
being on the verge of death.

260
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,200
I'll just take this car.

261
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,367
Are you kidding me?

262
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:07,467
I was just testing you.

263
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,167
The red car versus me.
Looks like I won!

264
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,567
If the turd one was the new one,
you would've lost.

265
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,667
I know that the red one
is your favorite.

266
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:16,600
If I beat the red car,
then I pretty much beat everything.

267
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:21,200
You sly Harvard grad!

268
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,867
I'll still have to make a few trips to
the police station.

269
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,567
And I'll really have to be
a sly Harvard grad,

270
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:31,000
in order to explain all this to
Detective Park Young-soo

271
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,534
without mentioning the spirits.

272
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,800
Anyway,
Yeon-woo must be bewildered.

273
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:38,433
He got a call from the dead
not once, but twice.

274
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:42,000
He may be big,

275
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:45,600
but he's a scaredy-cat, and
awfully scared of ghosts, too.

276
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,300
Was he?

277
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Seems like you grew up with him.

278
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,366
Yeon-woo's mother raised me.

279
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,800
When I was very, very little…

280
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:01,800
A merchant saved me

281
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:04,200
from the brink of death
in the wilderness.

282
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,466
And Yeon-woo's mother took me in.

283
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,367
But she also passed away
not long after that,

284
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:17,800
so Yeon-woo and I
grew up together,

285
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,533
depending on each other
like siblings.

286
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,367
He was really talented
with his hands,

287
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:27,233
so he'd make me clothes
and everything.

288
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,266
It seems he's doing well now too,
as a police officer.

289
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,500
I think this is my first time
talking to you about this.

290
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:45,733
Yes.

291
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,566
- Because the flowers have bloomed..
- Because they're about to wilt.

292
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:21,433
I'll get going, then.

293
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:26,966
Um…

294
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,766
Is it because the flowers are
really about to wilt?

295
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,800
Take a good look
and take good care of me,

296
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:15,633
until you send me off well.

297
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:17,833
As God wills it.

298
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:21,400
It seems you're doing well.

299
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:23,900
It looks like flowers
will be blooming soon.

300
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,500
Take good care of her,

301
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:29,866
so you can send her off well.

302
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:34,366
Who is this guest
you'll need to send off?

303
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,533
I'll be your last guest.

304
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,866
When time comes to send me off,

305
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,900
don't be too sad.

306
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:19,834
When do you think he'll wake up?

307
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,766
In about an hour or so.

308
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,334
Has he regained consciousness?

309
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,833
Yes, he'll be waking up soon.

310
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,334
- Where'd he go?
- He was here a moment ago.

311
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,667
What are you doing? Go find him!

312
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:55,733
I'm sorry.

313
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,533
Is murder…

314
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,700
…what you've been enjoying?

315
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:27,167
What do you mean?

316
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:30,466
You killed people.

317
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:36,167
- Says who?
- The people you killed.

318
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,600
They're right here.

319
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,833
You must be crazy.

320
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:45,966
Do you think it's the end
once people die?

321
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,833
Their souls are still here.

322
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,666
The spirit that's here…
is your seventh victim.

323
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,566
And this…

324
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,700
…is her blood.

325
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,200
Will you only believe me
after I find all six for you?

326
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,167
Who are you?

327
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:46,667
It wasn't me who found them.

328
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,134
It was the person you killed
who brought me here.

329
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,534
Don’t lie to me.
That's just impossible!

330
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,200
You may not see her,

331
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:54,933
but she's been beside you,
all this time.

332
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:09,000
She's even telling me
what you have behind your back.

333
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,933
So ghosts do exist?

334
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,400
You'll be here soon, right?

335
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,500
At what time?

336
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,233
It'll be too late by then.

337
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,133
(Detective Park Young-soo)

338
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,934
Hello, Detective.

339
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,466
Mr. Koo, you'll need to come to
the hospital right now.

340
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,067
- Hello.
- You're here.

341
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:49,467
As I explained, Mr. Seol Ji-won
wishes to speak to you only.

342
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,966
Will that be okay?

343
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,300
Yes.

344
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:27,833
You're here.

345
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,500
Thanks to you,
I ended up coming all this way.

346
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,700
Not because of me,
but because of what you did.

347
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:41,566
What pushed you here was
the person you killed.

348
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:47,066
You said there were ghosts.

349
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,566
Is there any around here right now
helping you out?

350
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,666
Yes. There's someone beside me,
who's here to protect me.

351
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:04,433
Is that him?

352
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:08,666
Should I just push him off?

353
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:10,900
No.

354
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:14,000
He needs to live and
pay for his sin.

355
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:17,234
Right. I don't want to
have to pay an unfair price for

356
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,534
trash like him.

357
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,266
- Of course not.
- Hey!

358
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,000
What are you doing?

359
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:26,466
Consulting with my guardian,
about you.

360
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,500
Oh.

361
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:32,800
Ha… Koo Chan-sung.

362
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:35,934
Looking back, you're the reason
why my life started to fall apart.

363
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,566
Your life fell apart,
because of your own actions.

364
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:52,133
How cute.

365
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,534
Do you have proof that
I sent this?

366
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,233
Besides, who'd believe you?

367
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:04,967
You're always so cocky
when you know nothing.

368
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:06,166
Ugh, you just piss me off.

369
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,467
It doesn't matter even if
no one here believes me,

370
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,300
as long as just
this one person does.

371
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,967
That one person who learned
the true nature of his youngest son,

372
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:26,233
and sent him to the States,
as if to expel him.

373
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,333
I'm talking about your father.

374
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:40,400
How about a bet?

375
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,334
Between a son
he's embarrassed about,

376
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,234
and a smart, diligent student
from a prestigious university…

377
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,133
Whose words would he believe?

378
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,534
Before I tell on your father,

379
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,166
get lost.

380
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:31,166
I should've just shot you then.

381
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,166
Hey.

382
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:45,100
Do you know him?

383
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:48,533
He's a long acquaintance.

384
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:53,133
I thought I'd never see him again,
but here we meet again.

385
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,867
Because of you,

386
00:35:56,933 --> 00:36:00,534
that child had to face a past
connection that was severed.

387
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,267
What more unfairness

388
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,500
must you put him through?

389
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:13,434
What you did will stay with you,
even after you die.

390
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,967
The only way to lighten
the weight of your sin is to

391
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,634
live, and pay the price.

392
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,100
How is that my sin?

393
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,666
I was only exercising the curse
on behalf of others.

394
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:28,134
Do you know just how much
people rave and cheer for

395
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,134
hatred and cursing?

396
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,300
They were going wild over
their deaths as if

397
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:37,467
someone scored a goal,
so that's why I killed them.

398
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:39,367
So how is that my sin?

399
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:42,367
That place was a trash can
full of filthy emotions.

400
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,967
But no one ever wishes for
anyone to

401
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:46,300
spoon-feed the garbage
they'd tossed away.

402
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:47,900
Seol Ji-won, get down!

403
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:55,666
Well, I've just thrown you
into that trash can.

404
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,200
I hope may cheer for your death.

405
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,467
Now you'll be able to see me.

406
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,666
So it's true.

407
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,600
Death isn't the end.

408
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,233
No.

409
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,100
And you're a ghost now.

410
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,800
Koo Chan-sung probably
didn't wish for it,

411
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:06,333
but I was hoping you'd fall off
and die already.

412
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,434
See, laying my hands on you
while you're still alive

413
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,300
would mean trouble for me,

414
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:16,033
but not when you're
an evil spirit.

415
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:19,166
Evil spirit?

416
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:29,300
You belong in the garbage truck.

417
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,067
I'll smash you to pieces.

418
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:36,000
Turn into trash,
and go to the underworld.

419
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:57,200
What is this?

420
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:59,200
What is this and
why is it shielding you?

421
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,334
It's my grudge.

422
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,266
People are raving and cheering
for the hate I hold!

423
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,367
With all my life,

424
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:16,634
I curse Koo Chan-sung

425
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,166
who ruined my life.

426
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:22,000
(Post)

427
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:23,700
(Your post has been uploaded)

428
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:30,067
(I hope he dies)

429
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,467
(I'll curse him for you)

430
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:33,166
(Die, die, die!)

431
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,867
You've been feeding off
ugly and evil energy

432
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:41,166
from this emotional trash can.

433
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,300
Who are you,
Koo Chan-sung's guardian?

434
00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:46,133
Shut up, you trash.

435
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,066
You stink.

436
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,067
I'm going to get rid of
your disgusting shield,

437
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:55,266
and tear you to pieces.

438
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:57,533
Look forward to it.

439
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,100
I'm going to become bigger,
and my tricks dirtier.

440
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:29,667
We've deleted the post that

441
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:31,600
Seol Ji-won uploaded onto
the Hell-lo site.

442
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:36,234
But we couldn't stop the post from
spreading elsewhere.

443
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,267
I'm sorry.

444
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,266
You shouldn't be the one
apologizing, Detective Park.

445
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,700
May I go, then?

446
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:43,533
Yes.

447
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Um, excuse me.

448
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:51,567
At the wine bar…

449
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:53,466
was there a woman with you,
perhaps?

450
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,400
You see, um…

451
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,567
I got a call from that wine bar

452
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:03,600
and the caller said
she's the late Ms. Lee Do-yeon.

453
00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:07,167
I know it doesn't make sense, but…

454
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,666
It could just be her, yes.

455
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:13,600
I believe in ghosts and spirits.

456
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:15,400
And I believe in
reincarnation, too.

457
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,500
Oh, reincarnation… I see.

458
00:42:21,266 --> 00:42:23,033
You're quite the artist.

459
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,334
You're very skilled with
your hands, aren't you?

460
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,433
Thank you.

461
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:30,400
Then…

462
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:50,667
Seol Ji-won is dead.

463
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:53,533
I know, I met him in ghost-form.

464
00:42:56,933 --> 00:42:58,067
He's become an evil spirit.

465
00:42:58,133 --> 00:42:59,966
And he holds a grudge against you.

466
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,134
I know.

467
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,166
I read the post where
he cursed me.

468
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:07,566
I'm a bit shocked by
the support he received.

469
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:12,200
Ugh, damnit!

470
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:15,033
I should've turned him into dust
as soon as he died.

471
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,133
I should've brought a gun,
not my fan.

472
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:20,500
Is he that powerful,
to be able to escape you?

473
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:23,467
I want to laugh it off and
say he's nothing, but…

474
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:24,933
This is not the time for that.

475
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:28,900
Koo Chan-sung.

476
00:43:28,966 --> 00:43:31,100
Don't you go home
before we catch him.

477
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:32,933
Stick right by my side.

478
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:46,100
Do you think President Jang
won't have me again?

479
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,667
I'm sure she's forgotten
about it already.

480
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:51,367
Mr. Koo's fine, so it's alright.

481
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,100
- Really?
- Of course!

482
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:56,167
Besides, it's all thanks to you that

483
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,200
the truth about our guests'
deaths was revealed.

484
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:00,000
So well done, Yu-na.

485
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:03,667
Thank goodness.

486
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:06,834
That's right. The guest
who arrive last night

487
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,167
wanted to meet you.

488
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,233
Huh?

489
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:24,033
You're that…

490
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:31,400
Thank you for following me
to the very end.

491
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:43,333
(Jung Su-jung)

492
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:50,667
This is where the real me is,

493
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:53,000
but all this time
I'd been too scared to come here.

494
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:55,733
I'd been murdered, too.

495
00:44:56,933 --> 00:44:58,566
I think this case somewhat…

496
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,566
…comforted me, too.

497
00:45:09,433 --> 00:45:12,267
I picked one secretly from
the hotel garden.

498
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:13,633
Let's put it here.

499
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:18,034
- Ji Hyun-joong.
- Yes?

500
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,734
Where are you buried?

501
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,266
Me?
Just somewhere on the mountain.

502
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,966
There's no grave.

503
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:32,600
Then let's have you here, too.

504
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:45,033
It's me.

505
00:45:46,633 --> 00:45:49,033
I was just practicing portraits.

506
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,700
This is our couple grave now!

507
00:46:02,766 --> 00:46:04,166
Do you like it?

508
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:06,233
You don't?

509
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:10,567
Well… fine.

510
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:14,034
After all, you just brushed it off
when I told you I like you.

511
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,700
I didn't brush it off.

512
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,967
Yu-na.

513
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:22,600
Your boyfriend should be…

514
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:24,166
someone who's kind,

515
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:28,167
and someone who's still alive.

516
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:29,300
But I…

517
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,366
I like you.

518
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,300
So can't you just like me back?

519
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,000
Koo Chan-sung.

520
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,300
Hey, wake up.

521
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,366
So why did you have to sleep here
where it's uncomfortable?

522
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:48,467
As a living human, the only place
where I can sleep in in this hotel

523
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,334
is room 404 and your room,
isn't it?

524
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,434
If I sleep in room 404 and
wake up in Incheon,

525
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,867
it'll be a tiring commute.

526
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:58,267
Who ever told you to sleep in
room 404? Sleep in my room.

527
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,167
Use that massager I gave you,

528
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:02,500
slap that eye mask on, and
you're guaranteed good sleep!

529
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:05,667
Do you think using that
massager like this,

530
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:07,266
would help me fall asleep?

531
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:10,767
Right.

532
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:13,566
You are full of energy.

533
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:19,834
Tsk, tsk… A good night's
sleep is important.

534
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,133
Poor you.

535
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:24,867
Then let's go.

536
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:27,500
Let me get some good sleep
in your room.

537
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:30,667
I'm okay with the massager,
let me borrow your arms instead.

538
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:33,334
If I can use your arm
as a pillow instead,

539
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,967
I won't need an eye mask!

540
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:36,500
And stroke my hair, too.

541
00:48:37,433 --> 00:48:40,333
So I can really fall asleep.

542
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,233
What's wrong with you?
You're so lewd.

543
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,133
Here, cool yourself down.

544
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,200
You cool yourself down.

545
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:04,600
Your face is all red.

546
00:49:07,433 --> 00:49:09,666
Gosh, I'm aching all over.
Should I try that massager?

547
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:13,600
What…

548
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:15,466
My face is red? Really?

549
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,200
Koo Chan-sung!

550
00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:22,767
Forget the massager.
Let's go see an acupuncturist.

551
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:23,467
What?

552
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:25,900
Let's go for acupuncture
and cupping, too.

553
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,533
There's a really good clinic I know.

554
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,200
A famous doctor who's known to
wake up the dead!

555
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,433
Gosh, you really took
those needles well.

556
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:37,666
(Hyosaeng Acupuncture & Herbs)

557
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:39,534
You'll need to come in every day
for a while.

558
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,300
Doctor, I think these
herbs are too expensive.

559
00:49:42,366 --> 00:49:45,300
Why, that's because
they work marvels!

560
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:48,000
I even gave you a little
extra on the house, didn't I?

561
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:49,066
Thank you.

562
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:53,734
So you're saying that
that doctor saved the dead?

563
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,367
He's kept a patient alive

564
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:56,733
who was supposed to be dead
three years ago.

565
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,467
That's some skills!

566
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:01,000
I wish you good health.

567
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,600
Is he the reincarnation of
Hua Tuo?

568
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,067
Who knows.

569
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:07,667
No need to think any more,

570
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:09,600
have some made for your family, too.

571
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:12,600
I'll give you
a special 10% discount.

572
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:15,500
- Let me think about it.
- Sure, sure.

573
00:50:15,566 --> 00:50:16,800
Alright, bye.

574
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:20,734
Ms. Kim. Keep recommending
those herbs to that lady.

575
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,867
But to keep praising him,

576
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:25,766
he's rather greedy for money
like someone I know.

577
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:30,534
Honey, a patient.

578
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,967
Thank you for coming.

579
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:33,566
Here, this way.

580
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:37,200
Gosh, you seem to have
poor blood circulation.

581
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:39,000
That must be his wife.

582
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:40,000
They're quite alike.

583
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:43,900
Anyway, we have to drag
the patient he's kept alive

584
00:50:43,966 --> 00:50:45,200
to Hotel Del Luna.

585
00:50:45,266 --> 00:50:47,267
But you said this patient is
still alive.

586
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,266
How will we have him
or her as our guest, then?

587
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,266
By killing him.

588
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:54,100
The Grim Reaper said to kill him
and bring him, no matter what.

589
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:57,766
Ms. Jang Man-wol, do you run errands
for the Grim Reaper now?

590
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,067
I'm not running errands.

591
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:02,333
We made a deal.

592
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,000
There's someone
I need you to take care of.

593
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:08,167
I'd like to ask for your help.

594
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:11,200
If it's someone you couldn't
handle on your own,

595
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:13,167
he must be quite powerful.

596
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:15,834
His grudge is pretty deep,

597
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,733
so if I act rashly, someone
I treasure may get hurt.

598
00:51:21,466 --> 00:51:24,200
Catch him, and bring him
to me quietly.

599
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:29,200
Alright, since it's coming from you.

600
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:33,800
However…

601
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:36,133
I'll need you to do
a favor for me as well.

602
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,200
Go on.

603
00:51:49,266 --> 00:51:51,234
There's a soul who's been
causing quite a headache.

604
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,700
He's what you can call a cold case.
He's brought shame to us all.

605
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,367
If you can bring him to Del Luna,

606
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:00,133
I will bring that…

607
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,366
…evil spirit to you.

608
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,100
Deal!

609
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,367
Is Seol Ji-won that dangerous?

610
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:17,367
It's probably because of me that
this evil spirit,

611
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,133
who was your ill fate,
is now after you.

612
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:21,534
That's what Old Mago said.

613
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,700
That you need to pay the price for
looking after me.

614
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:28,434
The price I must pay for
for having the flowers bloom,

615
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,100
is to have an evil spirit
hunt me down?

616
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:32,934
I don't want you to
have to pay such a price,

617
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,500
so I'll clear all the debts

618
00:52:34,566 --> 00:52:36,700
to the best of my ability.

619
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,533
I'm grateful to hear that.

620
00:52:42,233 --> 00:52:43,333
(Quick loans)

621
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,600
Mr. Koo Chan-sung?

622
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,600
- Yes.
- You're next.

623
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:51,066
Then while I'm being treated,
do I see how skilled he is?

624
00:52:53,033 --> 00:52:54,500
Take this and go in.

625
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:56,066
Tell him you saw this,
and that's why you came.

626
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:02,233
A-ha!

627
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:07,600
All this internal heat has
slowed down your bowels,

628
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:11,600
leading to indigestion
and heartburns.

629
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:13,734
You must receive a lot of stress.

630
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,767
Yes.

631
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:17,534
I've been burdened with
quite a bit of worries lately.

632
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,867
Right?

633
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:20,500
Then let's lie down for
an acupuncture session,

634
00:53:20,566 --> 00:53:21,600
and after that,
I'll write you a prescription.

635
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:25,600
It's best to have
some herbs with that, too.

636
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:28,533
What I need isn't acupuncture
or herbs.

637
00:53:29,466 --> 00:53:32,233
The root of my problems is
purely financial.

638
00:53:33,033 --> 00:53:34,634
That's why…

639
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,866
I'm here, because of this.
I need money.

640
00:53:36,866 --> 00:53:38,366
(Quick loans)

641
00:53:45,366 --> 00:53:47,567
This is your number, isn't it?

642
00:53:47,633 --> 00:53:50,800
What timing.
I just needed someone, too.

643
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:54,400
I need to check something first.

644
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:04,734
You have a good palm.

645
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,600
Your life line is long, too.

646
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:13,934
Give me one centimeter
of your life line.

647
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,733
If you'll do that,

648
00:54:17,066 --> 00:54:18,800
I'll pay you $50,000.

649
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:27,167
He bought other people's
life lines and

650
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:29,867
prolonged the life of someone
who should've been dead?

651
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,433
He really has skills, that doctor.

652
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,734
Is it even possible to
trade your life line?

653
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,167
Well, a fair price was
paid for the trade.

654
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,100
He didn't deceive them, and
he paid a hell of a lot, too.

655
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,266
That's probably why the
Grim Reaper couldn't help it.

656
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,734
The people who sold them
would've never thought that

657
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,200
they were really selling off
their time, for real.

658
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:53,334
They probably thought they were
bagging $50,000 for nothing.

659
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,134
It's the buyer who's the
desperate one in this case.

660
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,333
And I guess with this excess time,
he's making more money.

661
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:01,166
Do you think he's selling them to
chaebols or politicians?

662
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:06,067
I'm sure he's giving them to
someone who's worth his time.

663
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:08,734
Koo Chan-sung, you have
a transplant surgery coming up,

664
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,700
so let's go have some meat.

665
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:12,733
You mean you're in
the mood for meat.

666
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:14,567
Around here somewhere…

667
00:55:14,633 --> 00:55:16,700
…is a restaurant that
Kim Jun-hyun was at.

668
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,166
I know, I know. Let's go.

669
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,300
I managed to find someone for
the life line graft surgery.

670
00:55:30,366 --> 00:55:33,600
I'd been so worried after
the previous person cancelled…

671
00:55:35,066 --> 00:55:36,334
Thank goodness.

672
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,400
We'll have to spend the money

673
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,300
we've saved up until now, then.

674
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:46,034
Is money so important?

675
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,633
It's all right, as long as
we can save him.

676
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,366
But you're always
overworking yourself.

677
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:55,400
Tonight will be the surgery,

678
00:55:55,466 --> 00:55:57,066
so let's check on him.

679
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:08,766
Our dear Hyun-jin's asleep.

680
00:56:31,366 --> 00:56:33,366
As long as we operate on him
again tonight…

681
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,433
A child?

682
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:46,300
Yes, the person we must kill
and bring to Del Luna

683
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:48,133
is the child of that couple.

684
00:56:53,966 --> 00:56:57,500
Who knew Man-wol was this beautiful!

685
00:56:58,666 --> 00:56:59,900
Once the flowers wilt,

686
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:02,733
will that be the end for
this luna tree?

687
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,734
That's right.

688
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,666
And that…

689
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,400
…is that child's death,
which I've bound here.

690
00:57:12,466 --> 00:57:16,967
So President Jang will be off to
the underworld, at last.

691
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,100
It's been too long.

692
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,267
Both Man-wol, who's at her fullest,

693
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:30,000
and that little soul,

694
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:31,700
who's become that
tiny speck of light…

695
00:57:44,266 --> 00:57:47,600
He turned back from
his journey to the underworld,

696
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,300
and remained here for all this time.

697
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,266
But you, too…

698
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:21,100
…need to be on your way.

699
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,067
You live as a traitor.

700
00:59:19,133 --> 00:59:21,100
That way, Man-wol will live.

701
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:51,467
I left him there after
you told me not to take him,

702
00:59:51,533 --> 00:59:53,467
but even so, it amazes me that
a human spirit has

703
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:58,000
lasted all that time
as a tiny speck of light.

704
00:59:58,066 --> 01:00:00,466
It's a curse he put on himself.

705
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:03,900
He brought it upon himself,

706
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:07,967
because of that last promise

707
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:10,000
he made to Man-wol.

708
01:00:10,366 --> 01:00:12,234
President Jang Man-wol has
agreed to run an errand for me,

709
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,934
to try lighten the price
Koo Chan-sung must pay for

710
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,133
making her flowers bloom.

711
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,867
So Man-wol still doesn't know

712
01:00:22,933 --> 01:00:26,633
what the price is
that he has to pay.

713
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:31,034
If she did, however…

714
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:36,266
She'd be enveloped by
sadness and fear.

715
01:00:55,533 --> 01:00:56,900
(Hyosaeng Acupuncture & Herbs)

716
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:08,000
Are you nervous?
In case he takes your time?

717
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You want to live that long, do you?

718
01:01:12,066 --> 01:01:14,333
Don't worry, you'll live
very, very long.

719
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,233
I was just thinking about…

720
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,500
…how those parents may have felt,

721
01:01:23,566 --> 01:01:25,133
grafting other peoples' time
onto their child.

722
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,433
I'll protect you, so they don't
take away what's yours.

723
01:01:46,133 --> 01:01:48,233
I'll guard your life line, alright?

724
01:01:52,866 --> 01:01:54,666
They probably don’t want to let go.

725
01:01:56,933 --> 01:01:59,366
They're desperate to hold on,
and to never let go.

726
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,300
You're here already.

727
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,333
Let's go to my office.

728
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,300
I won't make it hurt,
nor make it dangerous for you.

729
01:02:27,366 --> 01:02:29,166
One centimeter is
all I'll ever take.

730
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,333
After cutting it from me,

731
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:40,266
you're giving it to
your child, are you?

732
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:46,734
Earlier today…

733
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,133
I heard you have a sick son.

734
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:59,500
My son has been very sick.

735
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:04,734
Then we heard about this
life line transplant surgery,

736
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,766
and tried it, like a drowning man
clutching at a straw, and…

737
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,466
Like a miracle, he lived.

738
01:03:14,766 --> 01:03:16,833
You two are still young,

739
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,133
but have gone through a lot.

740
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:23,700
Our child is still young,

741
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:26,033
but my wife and I have aged
quite a bit, haven't we?

742
01:03:28,033 --> 01:03:29,633
People think…

743
01:03:31,366 --> 01:03:33,733
We're his grandparents.

744
01:04:33,066 --> 01:04:34,300
Hello.

745
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,700
(Damien)

746
01:04:38,233 --> 01:04:39,700
Were you reading a book?

747
01:04:41,433 --> 01:04:43,233
That's quite a difficult book.

748
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:46,034
It's not that hard.

749
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,400
Right.

750
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,100
I don't really hate kids
who are actually smart

751
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:52,034
and brag about it.

752
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,600
I like you, kid.

753
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:56,566
Lady, are you the Grim Reaper?

754
01:04:58,233 --> 01:05:01,234
Every night in my dreams
after the surgery,

755
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,666
I saw a man dressed in black.

756
01:05:06,533 --> 01:05:10,667
He and I dress totally different!

757
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:12,467
He wears black,

758
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:16,233
but this is midnight black with
a touch of dark blue.

759
01:05:17,366 --> 01:05:21,067
That's the same thing.

760
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:22,133
Is it?

761
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,300
Anyway, you're right in that
I'm here for the same reason.

762
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,834
I can't take you by force.

763
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:35,567
So listen to what I have to say
and make your decision,

764
01:05:35,633 --> 01:05:37,533
since you're smart enough
to do that.

765
01:05:42,533 --> 01:05:44,600
You've realized that
your Mom and Dad have…

766
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:47,533
…aged so much,
all of a sudden, right?

767
01:05:56,566 --> 01:05:58,533
Is it because of this?

768
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,366
That's right.

769
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:08,200
What they've grafted there

770
01:06:08,266 --> 01:06:10,433
are their own life line.

771
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,267
Because you paid a fair price,

772
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:17,867
your desperate wish came true.

773
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:20,634
But really, you hadn't been
buying other people's time,

774
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,867
you've been giving your own
to your child.

775
01:06:22,933 --> 01:06:25,133
That's why you two have
aged more quickly.

776
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,200
I don't know how much you know,

777
01:06:30,266 --> 01:06:33,534
but we don't care,
as long as our son lives.

778
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,266
I'm afraid the decision is
now left to your child.

779
01:06:39,066 --> 01:06:41,033
And if he decides,

780
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:44,666
you need to let him go.

781
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:13,300
Hyun-jin…

782
01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:14,500
Hyun-jin…

783
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,634
Hyun-jin, wake up. Hyun-jin!

784
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,367
Honey, what's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?

785
01:07:22,433 --> 01:07:23,667
Hyun-jin…

786
01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:25,667
Honey… Honey!
What's wrong with him?

787
01:07:25,733 --> 01:07:27,200
No, not yet… Honey!

788
01:07:27,266 --> 01:07:29,433
Honey, what's wrong with him?

789
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:32,434
No, Hyun-jin! No!

790
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,266
Hyun-jin, wake up! Hyun-jin!

791
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:37,500
I'm glad you took care of it,
President Jang.

792
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:39,100
Had we been a little more late,

793
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:41,700
I may have had to
take all three of them.

794
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:44,767
In a way…

795
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:47,733
That's what that couple
may have wanted.

796
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,300
If I leave…

797
01:08:52,366 --> 01:08:55,833
My parents will have
a harder time.

798
01:08:58,166 --> 01:09:00,500
That's not for you to worry about.

799
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,800
That's for the left behind.

800
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,633
But…

801
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:28,566
I'm really scared of it.

802
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,533
Scared…

803
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:02,767
Don't be scared.

804
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:06,433
I'll find that evil spirit
as promised.

805
01:10:10,566 --> 01:10:11,633
Yes.

806
01:10:12,466 --> 01:10:15,266
Find him for me for now,
to lighten my fears.

807
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,600
I just can't let go,

808
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:37,166
even if I must offer
everything I have.

809
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:50,034
After "i" is "-ness." Not "-ly"!

810
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,766
- Isn't this it?
- Get ready.

811
01:11:02,066 --> 01:11:04,634
- You did that on purpose!
- Just blow on it.

812
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,067
How does that look to you,
in your eyes?

813
01:11:07,133 --> 01:11:11,067
Our intern and our frontman
are dating.

814
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,767
Goodness.

815
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,934
It hasn't been long since
she joined us, too!

816
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,667
They're young.

817
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:20,234
I guess the old saying goes for
both worlds.

818
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,267
Put a boy and a girl in
one room, and they'll lock eyes.

819
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,400
Goodness…

820
01:11:25,466 --> 01:11:27,734
But our relationship has been
strictly business,

821
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,633
even after spending
200 years together.

822
01:11:31,466 --> 01:11:33,634
Even 2,000 years won't do.

823
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,767
You're just not my type, Mr. Kim.

824
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,600
So don't you ever dream about it.

825
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:39,833
Dream about it? You've got me wrong!

826
01:11:40,766 --> 01:11:42,234
Hear me out before you go.

827
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,066
You're certainly not
my type, either!

828
01:12:04,233 --> 01:12:05,466
You're back already.

829
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:08,100
Yes.

830
01:12:22,566 --> 01:12:27,100
Has Sanchez gone crazy
after attending her funeral?

831
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:28,366
What's wrong with him?

832
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,100
There's a bit of a story.

833
01:12:38,133 --> 01:12:40,334
Did you see her off?

834
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,100
You should've stayed longer.

835
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:43,666
I couldn't do that.

836
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,400
Not with
Veronica still at your hotel.

837
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:52,500
Right, Chan-sung?

838
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:55,700
She's still there, right?

839
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:01,566
He sounded so desperate that
I couldn't say no.

840
01:13:02,566 --> 01:13:04,700
But he did accept that
he can't go to the hotel,

841
01:13:04,766 --> 01:13:06,800
and that even if he does go there,
he won't be able to see her.

842
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,600
He thinks that
Veronica is still here,

843
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:13,666
even though he can't see her.

844
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:18,667
So just play along with me,
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

845
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:20,167
Until he's all right again.

846
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:22,033
When will he be all right?

847
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:39,800
Man-wol, thanks for
what you did for me last time.

848
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,700
Thanks to you,
I got to say farewell.

849
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:49,766
I was just baking
Veronica's favorite.

850
01:13:50,466 --> 01:13:53,367
She'd love it
when I'd make it for her.

851
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:55,533
Do you suppose
you can bring it to her?

852
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:59,833
Sure, we can do that.

853
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,166
Koo Chan-sung.

854
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:08,467
You really can't act, can you?

855
01:14:08,533 --> 01:14:10,233
If that how it's going to be,
do it right.

856
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,834
Sanchez, anything else
we should take other than pizza?

857
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:22,334
Like… Veronica's favorite shoes
or jewels, for example.

858
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,800
Or even a car would be nice.

859
01:14:25,266 --> 01:14:27,067
Can you really bring that all to her?

860
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:28,300
Of course.

861
01:14:28,366 --> 01:14:31,034
Bring it all to me.
I'll pass them on.

862
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,134
Oh, we also have
a beach at our hotel.

863
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,234
Do you want to
give me your yacht, too?

864
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:38,000
It'd be nice to have Veronica
on that yacht, right?

865
01:14:38,066 --> 01:14:40,033
- Ms. Jang Man-wol!
- What?

866
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:44,200
I'm comforting him.

867
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,434
If Sanchez doesn't come back
to his senses soon,

868
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,233
he's going to go bankrupt
giving me all his wealth.

869
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:08,634
Why are you doing this?

870
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,467
It's because of you. Because
you didn't set the facts straight.

871
01:15:11,533 --> 01:15:15,134
Do you find it funny that
I'm trying to be considerate?

872
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,433
Yes, I think it's ridiculous.

873
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:21,000
Not just the couple who's been
extending their child's life line,

874
01:15:21,066 --> 01:15:23,766
but your friend too, who's baking
pizza for his dead girlfriend.

875
01:15:25,033 --> 01:15:26,400
You're all pathetic.

876
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,800
When I watch you be so pathetic,
it appalls me to the point I'm mad.

877
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:36,666
So Koo Chan-sung,
don't you ever do that.

878
01:15:41,866 --> 01:15:44,100
Why do you assume
I'll be any different?

879
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,067
I don't want to let you go,

880
01:15:49,133 --> 01:15:50,134
and I don't want to
have to see you off!

881
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,066
The thought of not being able to
see you drives me crazy!

882
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,833
So how…

883
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,800
So how can you tell me
to be all right?

884
01:16:08,066 --> 01:16:10,533
Because you're someone
who's supposed to see me off.

885
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,633
So tell me you'll be fine.

886
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:28,634
If you won't,

887
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,266
then I…

888
01:16:32,633 --> 01:16:34,133
I'll be too scared.

889
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,800
Before…

890
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,433
You said you were scared that
I may have to pay a price for

891
01:16:51,533 --> 01:16:54,233
being by your side and
peering into your past.

892
01:16:59,433 --> 01:17:01,266
I guess that's what this is.

893
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:08,266
Becoming something so pathetic

894
01:17:10,366 --> 01:17:12,400
which you loathe so much.

895
01:17:20,433 --> 01:17:21,533
You should go.

896
01:17:23,133 --> 01:17:25,300
And I should get back to
my friend, too.

897
01:18:32,566 --> 01:18:34,066
She's not there, huh?

898
01:18:35,466 --> 01:18:37,433
Veronica's no longer there, huh?

899
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:31,400
It's when you hold fear
in your heart,

900
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,666
that the flowers start to wilt.

901
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,533
When I first met you,

902
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:24,700
the flowers in this neighborhood
had bloomed so beautifully.

903
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,166
But now they're nowhere to be seen.

904
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,400
At that time,

905
01:20:39,466 --> 01:20:42,733
you'd been so frightened,
after seeing a ghost here.

906
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,600
But today, it's the
other way around.

907
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,266
The flowers are…

908
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:09,433
…wilting.

909
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,433
I see.

910
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:31,233
They wouldn't even
remain as loose petals.

911
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,100
They'd disappear even before
touching the ground.

912
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,766
It looks like…

913
01:21:51,633 --> 01:21:53,533
it's going to leave
nothing behind.

914
01:21:58,366 --> 01:21:59,566
Maybe…

915
01:22:03,233 --> 01:22:05,666
Those flowers of yours
that are wilting…

916
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,100
Just like that first leaf,

917
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,600
their loose petals are
dropping onto me.

918
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,133
And they keep piling up and up,

919
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:33,166
to the point where it's
so heavy it's painful.

920
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:40,266
But I'll just take it as
a burden I have to bear.

921
01:22:47,766 --> 01:22:49,200
So…

922
01:22:53,633 --> 01:22:55,833
Don't be scared
to leave me behind.

923
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:14,733
I may be a weak, feeble human

924
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,500
but I'm loving you

925
01:23:29,733 --> 01:23:31,366
with all my might.

926
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,133
Just leaving you with petals
that'll soon fade away

927
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,333
is too tragic, so…
