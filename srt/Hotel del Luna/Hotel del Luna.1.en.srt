(Episode 1)

8
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:01,700
You're lucky.

9
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,500
There's nowhere else to
quench your thirst around here.

10
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:06,533
Are you from Wu Zhou?

11
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,933
You certainly don't look like
a Khitan…

12
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,466
Are you a Mohe, then?

13
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:16,400
Tsk, from that sword
on your waist…

14
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:17,633
Are you a swordsman?

15
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,667
You serve me terrible wine,

16
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,666
and you can't hold your tongue.

17
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,600
Did someone die?

18
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:43,033
Or… you killed someone?

19
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:48,434
In this rough weather,

20
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,067
only two kinds of people
ever pass through here.

21
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,267
People who are
returning from a kill,

22
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,000
or people who are
on their way to be killed.

23
00:03:56,066 --> 00:04:01,100
You've survived long enough

24
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,433
when you don't know how to
hold onto your useless tongue.

25
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,400
Should I cut off that
tongue of yours

26
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:07,300
so you may expect to live longer?

27
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,767
Come on, this old lady's tongue…

28
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,567
It may not be able to
tell a good wine,

29
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,434
but it can give you
useful information.

30
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,834
You seem to have
wandered for long.

31
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,666
Are you looking for something?

32
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:25,834
I'm looking for an inn.

33
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,967
I hear that somewhere
in this wilderness is

34
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:31,033
an inn that is a resting place
for the dead.

35
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,400
I see you're after the
inn of the moon.

36
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,534
You know it?

37
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,667
I hear it's a place where
wandering spirits stop by.

38
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,467
Where is this place?

39
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,634
Where can I find it?

40
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,700
You can't!

41
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,367
That place is only for the dead.

42
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:52,100
Just like those folks over there.

43
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:03,033
How many souls did you
bring in that coffin?

44
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:12,267
They have lost their lives
because of me.

45
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:16,433
And who else did you kill for
the dead?

46
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,634
Shut up and tell me the way!

47
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,467
Man-wol, is it?

48
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,134
A full moon with
deep-seated grudge.

49
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
Tell me.

50
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:34,367
I want to take responsibility for

51
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,867
those who I have killed.

52
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,167
You can't even handle yourself,

53
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,967
so who are you to say

54
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,567
you'll take responsibility for
someone else's life?

55
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,666
Any more idle talk,

56
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,666
and I said I'll cut off
your tongue.

57
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,900
Just say where I must go.

58
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:51,066
If I need to,

59
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,300
I'm willing to
give up my own life right now.

60
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:57,434
You poor thing…

61
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,600
You hope to repay them all
with your life, but it's in vain.

62
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,433
The only thing
I have left now to offer

63
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,066
is my life.

64
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
The inn of the moon is…

65
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:17,400
…where the dead gather.

66
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,733
The wandering spirits do not
need to be told to gather there.

67
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,200
They too, have been slain by you.

68
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,533
So this is the place, was it?

69
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,866
After slaying them all,
I had become an evil spirit

70
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:01,433
and had found my own way to
this place, have I?

71
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,400
Proud, foolish…

72
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:09,966
You wallow in self-pity,
you poor human.

73
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:15,134
I have found a place for you to
repent your sins,

74
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,000
so go pay the price.

75
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,466
(Inn)

76
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:44,234
The inn of the moon that serves
as a rest stop for the dead

77
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,566
have just welcomed a new owner.

78
00:11:54,533 --> 00:12:00,300
As for you, let's cross over to
the land of peace.

79

(Hotel Del Luna)

00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:09,633
(1998)

81
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,200
Son.

82
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:22,600
It's your birthday today,

83
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,533
yet I couldn't even buy you
a bowl of black bean noodles.

84
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,967
It's alright.

85
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:27,400
I'm not hungry.

86
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,500
Let's eat black bean noodles.
Black bean noodles!

87
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,967
- Mister!
- Hey, son!

88
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,066
- You dropped some money.
- Hey, thanks.

89
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,834
Now aren't you a good boy!

90
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,167
You have a prominent forehead
and eyes that shine.

91
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,334
A face of a noble, yes.

92
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Ugh.

93
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:58,800
So it's your birthday today, is it?

94
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:00,567
What year were you born in,
and at what time?

95
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:01,667
Excuse me, lady.

96
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,367
We're not buying any flowers.
So go!

97
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:04,634
My goodness!

98
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,334
I could see that your early years
would be in hardship,

99
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,900
and it's because
you were born under such a father!

100
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:11,000
Still, he's not someone
who'll do you harm.

101
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,434
Hardships early in life are

102
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,300
usually the price you pay for
forestalling any evils

103
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:16,967
when you are rewarded greatly
later on, so…

104
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,434
What? Price he must pay?

105
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,934
You're up to all sorts to
sell your flowers, aren't you?

106
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,934
Just you wait, son.

107
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,200
I'll earn a lot of money and
buy you a birthday present.

108
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,767
- A present?
- Flowers!

109
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,400
Flowers make perfect
birthday gifts.

110
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,467
I said, we're not buying them!

111
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,567
I'm alright with flowers too, Dad.

112
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:34,234
Instead of buying them,

113
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,534
you could just pick some for me.

114
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,067
So don't do anything dangerous
to earn money.

115
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,600
My goodness!

116
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,666
You're too young to
worry about that sort of thing.

117
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,366
Shoo!

118
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,634
Poke hard!

119
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,766
Check everywhere.

120
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,366
Now poke hard!

121
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:23,366
(911 Ambulance)

122
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:12,033

(Manwolgwan)

124
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:00,600
Are you up, President Jang?

125
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,734
Tonight's the full moon,
so we're expecting a lot of guests.

126
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,967
When the moon's bright,
we'll be visible from even very far,

127
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:12,100
so I expect they'll come crawling from
here and there.

128
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,966
Then I'll light up the sign.

129
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,100
Open up.

130
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:21,067
Seeing the full moon always
puts me in a bad mood,

131
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,234
and tonight, I'm in
an extra bad mood.

132
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,167
Don't accept those
who died too gruesomely.

133
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,567
But we shouldn't discriminate…

134
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:28,700
I said, don't.

135
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:30,967
They're all dead anyway,
so what's the rush?

136
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,867
I will make sure that

137
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,400
they remain out of your sight.

138
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,766
That bloody moon…

139
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,766
It pisses me off.

140
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,500
(Hotel Del Luna)

141
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,166
Stop right there!

142
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:08,566
Stop right there!

143
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,466
Jeez, I almost killed myself.

144
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,166
What is that?

145
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:20,833
Will they charge me
an entrance fee?

146
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:48,566
Are you on your own?

147
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,966
Do you remember how long
you've been dead for?

148
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:55,800
About ten days.

149
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:07,600
Oh, so I see that's what
you take to go up.

150
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:36,400
Wow, it's bigger than
what it looks from outside.

151
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,933
Will they charge me for
sitting down?

152
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,133
Are you alright?
You're rather pale.

153
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:56,400
Where did you
get yourself all wet?

154
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,234
The Han River.

155
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Han River?

156
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,133
Did you go wading in the
middle of the night?

157
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,900
Is this place expensive?

158
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:11,500
Do these places charge you for
just sitting in the lobby?

159
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:14,934
Well, this is also
my first time, so…

160
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,100
Oh.

161
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,134
So… What happened to you?

162
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,633
I rolled down the stairs.

163
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,100
Ouch.

164
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,434
We have someone
who drowned in a long while.

165
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,067
- Someone who drowned?
- Yes.

166
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,900
Does she look a little rough,
by any chance?

167
00:22:57,966 --> 00:22:59,467
A little.

168
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:01,534
The owner's not in a good mood,

169
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,867
so we should check our guest in
before she sees her.

170
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes, sir.

171
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,034
What is it, sir?

172
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,434
That guest just now…

173
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,234
He shouldn't be here.
I guess he's lost.

174
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,100
Then… He's not dead yet?

175
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:28,600
He's still alive?

176
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:32,000
He'll be dead if
the President spots him.

177
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:33,900
We need to find him quick
and throw him out.

178
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,134
Even for just a few hours,
I need to hide here.

179
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,234
Should I hide in the bathroom?

180
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,366
Yes, the bathroom. Yes.

181
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,233
Is this gold?

182
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,766
Whoa this looks hell of
a lot expensive.

183
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,234
No, no, no!

184
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,866
That's not what's important
right now.

185
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,033
I hope we meet again.

186
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,066
(Outdoor Pool)

187
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,466
Why's the beach here?

188
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,933
Man.

189
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:06,567
Sir, will you be using the beach?

190
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,766
We can rent you swimwear.

191
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:10,533
What is your room number?

192
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,200
No! I, uh…

193
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:28,766
Welcome.

194
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,433
Was this place this high up?

195
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,966
That's strange.

196
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,966
Ugh, scary!

197
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,734
A living man has
entered this hotel?

198
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,367
I believe he's wandering
around the place,

199
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:12,800
unaware of
what this place is exactly.

200
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,100
If he doesn’t leave soon,

201
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,334
he'll die.

202
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,234
Who cares about him dying?

203
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,634
The President will throw a fit
if she finds out.

204
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,900
She'll harass us for
50 years over this.

205
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:23,666
You know what she always says.

206
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,433
Are you going to do
your job properly, or no?

207
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,266
You think I'm a joke, don't you?

208
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:36,034
If I see something like
this again,

209
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,100
I'm going to have you all board
the bus to hell!

210
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,200
Do you understand me?

211
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,933
Brrr!

212
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,134
I think it's my fault he came in.

213
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,366
What do I do?

214
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,167
Yes, it's all your fault,

215
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:53,367
so we'll say it's your fault.

216
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,500
- But…
- I'm not sharing responsibility.

217
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,134
I still have things left to do
in the mortal world,

218
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,634
so I can't board the bus to
the afterlife yet.

219
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,400
This is the end!

220
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:02,434
That stupid human!

221
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,700
Why did he have to come
crawling in here?

222
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,400
There's no way the President
wouldn't notice

223
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:09,734
a mortal wandering around
this place.

224
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,167
If he's busted,

225
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,134
he won't be able to leave,
for eternity.

226
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,933
He'll die.

227
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,533
A thief has come crawling in,

228
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,566
at my hotel.

229
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,800
Wow, what's this place?

230
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:04,800
Wow.

231
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:07,366
Whoa!

232
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,633
Hey, flower…

233
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,134
I'm alright with flowers too, Dad.

234
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,400
Instead of buying them,
you could just pick some for me.

235
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,334
Great!

236
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,534
I'll pick some for Chan-sung.

237
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,067
The tree looks like
it's dead already,

238
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:29,900
but what beautiful flowers.

239
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:03,433
Who are you?

240
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:07,034
You still feel pain…

241
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,200
Does that mean you're still alive?

242
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,167
Who are you?

243
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:12,733
Why are you doing this to me?
Get that off me!

244
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:14,767
You were thieving.

245
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,600
I didn't do anything!

246
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,867
I didn't steal anything from
this place, alright?

247
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:19,967
Really now?

248
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:21,400
Then what is this?

249
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,566
Well, uh…

250
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,167
You tried to steal it.

251
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:33,233
Well, uh…

252
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,033
Do you want to be bitten
and end up dead?

253
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,134
Um… I'm sorry. Please forgive me!

254
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,800
I deserve to die for
what I have done!

255
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,267
Then die.

256
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,334
Uh… No, no!

257
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,967
I can't die right now,
not just yet.

258
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:51,700
Humans all die someday.

259
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:54,067
Why not save yourself the
trouble of going back and forth

260
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,666
and just die, while you're here?

261
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,000
I guess you still don't realize it,

262
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,933
but you're already dying right now.

263
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:10,133
What… What's wrong with me?

264
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,567
Check his pulse and oxygen saturation.

265
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:19,567
Oxygen saturation...

266
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:20,900
It is V-fib.

267
00:30:20,966 --> 00:30:22,400
Get the defibrillator ready.

268
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:24,400
200 joule, charge!

269
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:25,500
All stand clear.

270
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,634
I can't die right now.

271
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,033
Please spare me!

272
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,134
I have a son who's waiting for me.

273
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,700
That's too bad for him.

274
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:42,900
What is this?

275
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,367
Today's my son's birthday,

276
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,634
and he wanted flowers for
his birthday.

277
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,267
So I picked it from the tree.

278
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,200
I… I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!

279
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,534
That tree doesn't flower at all.

280
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,567
I swear I picked it from there.

281
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,566
I didn't touch anything else!

282
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:05,833
You blossomed for this human
and even spared him a branch.

283
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:11,066
Is it telling me to let you go?

284
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:18,467
So, this is for your son?

285
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:22,634
He's a good, smart boy.
I don't deserve him, really.

286
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,734
If you'll forgive me,
I'll amend my ways and

287
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,600
raise my son well.

288
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,100
Fine.

289
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,433
Alright.

290
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:35,866
I'll let you go.

291
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,400
Thank you. Thank you so much!

292
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:41,566
You go back, and raise your son.

293
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,200
Raise him well,

294
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,933
and give him to me.

295
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,400
- Pardon?
- I saved his father,

296
00:31:49,466 --> 00:31:51,167
so he should repay me,
shouldn't he?

297
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:52,734
You said he's still young, did you?

298
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,534
For him to do his share,

299
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,934
you'll need to feed him and
raise him for another 20 years.

300
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,934
Promise me that
you'll give him to me then.

301
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,234
What - my son?

302
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,433
If you won't, you'll die tonight.

303
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,933
W-wait… Wait!

304
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,700
Make up your mind now.

305
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:19,967
You only have a few minutes

306
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,633
until your chance to live is gone.

307
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,700
If I die, Chan-sung will be
all alone…

308
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:30,300
So, what will it be?

309
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:33,834
Will you give your son to me,

310
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,033
or will you die?

311
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:38,800
I promise.

312
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:40,166
So please save me!

313
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,767
Fine.

314
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:44,866
Alright, then.

315
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,133
20 years from now,
I'll come for your son.

316
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,033
Go!

317
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,666
Dad…

318
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,033
Chan-sung…

319
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,900
My Dad didn't die!

320
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:15,600
What?

321
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,167
He's regained consciousness.

322
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,600
Call surgery and
move him to an operating room.

323
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,800
- Yes, doctor.
- Wait right here.

324
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,266
Dad…

325
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:31,400
Chan-sung…

326
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,800
Come here.

327
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,366
He left his birthday present
for his son.

328
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,966
That woman…

329
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:42,700
Well, this is also
my first time, so…

330
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,600
Dad, do you know that
police officer?

331
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,900
No, I don't.

332
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,700
But it seems like
I've seen her somewhere.

333
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,966
Then it wasn't a dream…?

334
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:10,834
I was a police officer.
I was busted while undercover,

335
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,867
and they got me.

336
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:13,900
That's too bad.

337
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,400
You died for a just cause,

338
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:19,267
so the underworld will send
a special limousine for you.

339
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,934
Get some rest until it arrives.

340
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,633
But I can't leave like this.

341
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:27,134
Most of our guests say that.

342
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,934
So, what is it that you want?
Revenge?

343
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,300
For your information,
if it's revenge you want

344
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:33,167
you can't take someone's life.

345
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,167
You can torture them
a little however,

346
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:39,300
but that will come back to you
as karma.

347
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:42,367
You're already qualified to be
reborn with great conditions.

348
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,967
Hold a grudge over
a life that's already over,

349
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:46,634
and you might just be reborn
as a dog or a pig.

350
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,734
So I suggest you be wise.

351
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,334
It's not revenge I'm after.

352
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,200
The bastard I was after is
above the law. That’s why…

353
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:57,866
I want to catch him.

354
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:02,900
You sure have
a strong sense of responsibility.

355
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,634
In order to use the services
related to the mortal world,

356
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,800
you must pay in mortal currency.

357
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:10,866
Do you have any cash
you’ve stashed away somewhere?

358
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,833
So…

359
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,300
What would you like me
to do, then?

360
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,833
Mr. Park Gyu-ho, Mayor of
Beomcheon City is here.

361
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,267
We will now begin awarding the
economists who led

362
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:58,800
innovative growth in
Beomcheon City.

363
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:02,034
President Kim Dong-hwan of
Beomin C&T.

364
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,200
Congratulations!

365
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,967
Mayor Park will present the plaque.

366
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,667
- Kim Dong-hwan!
- The city of Beomcheon

367
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:14,167
commends you for being
a role-model to other economists

368
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,866
through your hard sacrifice in
leading Beomin C&T.

369
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,967
- What's this noise?
- What's this?

370
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:32,267
- What's going on?
- What is this?

371
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,333
Oi!

372
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,133
Why's no one taking pictures?

373
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:56,133
Who's that woman?

374
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:05,000
There's a woman right there,
walking toward me with a gun!

375
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:07,000
Why aren't you stopping her?

376
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,800
She's got a gun with her,
right there!

377
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,600
Excuse me! What…!

378
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,166
The gun… Put your gun down!

379
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:54,100
Mayor Park!

380
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,466
I… I've been shot.

381
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,133
Mayor Park? What gun?

382
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,300
That woman shot me!

383
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,700
Huh?

384
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,333
But I'm sure she shot me. What?

385
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:17,933
Argh!

386
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,700
Detective Lee?
But… but you're dead!

387
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,533
Don't come near me, don't!

388
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:27,466
Don't come near me! Don't… argh!

389
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:34,067
President Kim, you got rid of
Detective Lee, didn't you?

390
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,367
Mayor Park, what's with you?
Please, calm down!

391
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:37,666
Why, you bastard!

392
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Don't come near me!

393
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,833
Don't take pictures!

394
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:43,000
Don't take pictures!

395
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,166
Don't take pictures!

396
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,500
She's getting away!

397
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,166
Don't come near me! Don't!

398
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:15,067
You fired her grudge at
the heart of the man

399
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:16,567
she could never arrest,

400
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:19,700
and locked him up in a prison
that's far worse than prison.

401
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm sure she'll come back to
the hotel,

402
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:24,666
after she's done messing him up
by sticking close to him.

403
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,534
Did you retrieve
what that woman told us?

404
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,666
Yes.

405
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,300
I found this inside the locker
at the train station.

406
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,800
It seems they're smuggled goods

407
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,500
she obtained during
her investigation.

408
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:46,467
This means I can drink
all the champagne I want!

409
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:50,200
We're behind in our debt payments.

410
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,066
We're that much in debt?

411
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,734
Well, this much will
still be enough.

412
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,667
We need to put more aside for
the future payments, too.

413
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:03,033
We're that heavily in debt?

414
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:06,500
What… How have you been
managing the hotel?

415
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:10,467
We had taken out that loan for
your car, shopping,

416
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:12,500
and your champagne.

417
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,733
Managing the hotel
doesn't cost a cent.

418
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:23,634
The person before you had
a knack for managing money,

419
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
so I never had to
worry about money.

420
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:28,067
I heard the person before that
left you digging for

421
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:32,934
kudzu roots during
the barley hump.

422
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,800
When I think about that bastard…!

423
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:39,634
Why not invest in your
next general manager?

424
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,867
I'll send these to him as
20 years' worth of child support.

425
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:43,867
Hold on.

426
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:46,466
Does it really cost this much to
raise a child?

427
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:54,066
Fine, send it all to him.

428
00:41:54,766 --> 00:41:56,834
Once that child grows up,

429
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,233
I'll bring him in here and
make sure he does his share.

430
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,000
(Noh Jun-seok
$100,000 deposited)

431
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:14,166
That night must not have
been a dream.

432
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,766
I really must have
sold you, after all.

433
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:20,934
I need to find that hotel.

434
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,367
I need to return this money,

435
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:23,733
and back out on that promise.

436
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,866
Be careful.

437
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,666
It was around here somewhere…

438
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,833
Son! Wait right here,
and don't go anywhere.

439
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,600
Keep sending flowers
on his birthday.

440
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,400
So he doesn't forget.

441
00:43:34,366 --> 00:43:36,233
An evening primrose
will be just perfect.

442
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:06,000
(2019)

443
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,233
(Present)

444
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:14,000
(Royal Pacific)

445
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,200
Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

446
00:44:51,266 --> 00:44:52,867
The President is here.

447
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:54,167
Please come in.

448
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,233
Alright.

449
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,800
You won't regret turning down
Singapore Palace Hotel

450
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:07,467
and coming to ours instead.

451
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:08,933
I look forward to
working with you.

452
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:14,000
Thank you for inviting me
here today.

453
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,367
You turned us down when
we made an offer last year,

454
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:21,567
but this year,
you changed your mind.

455
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:23,767
It's been 20 years, after all.

456
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:26,734
I promised my father
who passed away 20 years ago,

457
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,200
that I wouldn't come to Korea for
the next 20 years.

458
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,400
Last year was the 20th year,

459
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:34,800
and this year is the 21st.
Hence the reason why I'm here.

460
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,734
So you had a particular reason?

461
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,667
It's not something like
crime or debt, I promise.

462
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:42,600
It's more of superstition,

463
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:44,300
so I stay away from misfortune.

464
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,700
Yes, the older generation is
particular about those things.

465
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:50,200
You know, like the three
big misfortunes or the great nines.

466
00:45:50,266 --> 00:45:53,066
Well, I guess it doesn't hurt to
avoid them.

467
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,167
Then… Do you know of
a hotel in Seoul,

468
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:01,634
whose facade is covered by ivy,

469
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,934
with a sky bar that's at least
one hundred floors up,

470
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,666
and with a wave pool so large
you'd mistake it for the beach?

471
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:11,500
Anything like that 20 years ago?

472
00:46:12,766 --> 00:46:13,800
Pardon?

473
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:17,200
No, right?

474
00:46:18,966 --> 00:46:21,200
I put your belongings
in your office.

475
00:46:21,266 --> 00:46:23,567
- Thank you.
- Did you find a place yet?

476
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:25,534
I'll be staying with
a friend in the meantime.

477
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,700
I see, so that's why
your birthday present came to us.

478
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:30,700
Happy birthday.
Today is your birthday, right?

479
00:46:30,766 --> 00:46:33,634
The front desk is
holding onto your present.

480
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,700
Excuse me!

481
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,633
By any chance, were they…

482
00:46:38,033 --> 00:46:39,134
Flowers, yes.

483
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,034
What were they again?

484
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,333
Evening primrose,

485
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:45,266
I assume.

486
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:53,000
It's been 20 years,
so why did they arrive again?

487
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,600
No need to get anxious.
You received them every year!

488
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:09,600
What's this?

489
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:11,166
"Hotel Del Luna?"

490
00:47:18,366 --> 00:47:19,167
(Dear Mr. Koo Chan-sung,)

491
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:20,067
(We're pleased to offer you
a position at Hotel Del Luna)

492
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:20,934
(We hope to see you from tomorrow)

493
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,900
(Jang Man-wol,
President of Hotel Del Luna)

494
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,933
Damnit! So the hotel does exist.

495
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:26,900
There's even an address.

496
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,866
Myeong-dong…?

497
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,000
(Line 4 Myeong-dong)

498
00:47:39,033 --> 00:47:41,733
Should I go to Myeong-dong?

499
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:48,600
(Dear Mr. Koo Chan-sung,
Happy birthday)

500
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:08,933
Excuse me, coming through.

501
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,034
Excuse me, oops!

502
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,133
Excuse me.

503
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:10,700
Is it you?

504
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:12,600
The person who bought me?

505
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,266
You've been preparing yourself,
have you?

506
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,300
I thought you'd ask,
'Who are you?'

507
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:21,734
There was no need to.

508
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,866
You're exactly as
how my father described you.

509
00:49:24,966 --> 00:49:28,100
You're President Jang Man-wol of
Hotel Del Luna, aren't you?

510
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,200
The one who's been sending me
those flowers every year.

511
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:35,634
Did you throw the flowers
I sent you every year

512
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,667
in the trash can, like this time?

513
00:49:37,733 --> 00:49:39,834
I was afraid every time
I received them.

514
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,533
That what my father said
might be true.

515
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:44,466
And that you'd come for me,
like this.

516
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,466
So that's why you've been
jumping countries, have you?

517
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,466
So that I won't come for you.

518
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:52,834
I admit I've been running away,

519
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,600
but I really didn't expect you to
come for me.

520
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:57,600
I let my guard down, thinking
it all expired last year.

521
00:49:57,666 --> 00:50:00,167
I came this year and not last year,
so I'd catch you unguarded.

522
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:03,500
I let you off for a year,

523
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,166
so come work for me,
starting tomorrow.

524
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,000
My father said
you're a terrifying person.

525
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,633
Will you kill me, if I refuse?

526
00:50:15,033 --> 00:50:16,100
You…

527
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,000
You're not scared of me, are you?

528
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:25,066
But then again,
I guess I'm too beautiful.

529
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,133
I'll admit it, yes.

530
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:31,934
So I won't let myself be scared,

531
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,300
and refuse you.

532
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,100
I shouldn't have sent you
flowers on your birthday.

533
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:41,433
I should have sent you
headless canaries instead.

534
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,833
I'll give you something else for
your birthday this year.

535
00:51:17,466 --> 00:51:19,133
(Dear Mr. Koo Chan-sung,
Happy birthday)

536
00:51:20,466 --> 00:51:22,200
You're a powerful existence,

537
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:24,034
and the same must be for
your hotel, too.

538
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,933
So what would you do with
a feeble human like me?

539
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,766
Can't you just give up?

540
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:41,100
Don't tell me…

541
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,300
Are you going to turn me into
a headless canary?

542
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:16,000
Don't worry, little Koo Chan-sung.

543
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:19,366
You'll keep your head.

544
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:27,300
What did you do to me?

545
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:28,700
I gave you a gift.

546
00:52:31,866 --> 00:52:33,434
Happy birthday.

547
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,466
Your birthday present this year is
a very special one.

548
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:39,533
(Dear Mr. Koo Chan-sung,
Happy birthday)

549
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,600
Aren't you getting off?

550
00:53:11,366 --> 00:53:12,933
You want to stay with me
a little longer, do you?

551
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:22,666
I didn't throw away the flowers
you sent me, on purpose.

552
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,333
Strict biosecurity laws are in place
at the borders, so…

553
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:59,033
What did she do to me just now?

554
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:04,766
What does she plan to
do with me, anyway?

555
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,100
Is she going to make me
her plaything?

556
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,333
Chan-sung, run!

557
00:54:19,866 --> 00:54:21,433
That place is scary!

558
00:54:23,066 --> 00:54:26,633
I saw dead people in there.

559
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,566
Chan-sung, run!

560
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,200
When you meet that woman,
you must run, alright?

561
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:39,633
Yes, Dad.

562
00:54:43,566 --> 00:54:46,466
Run! You must run!

563
00:55:13,966 --> 00:55:15,700
I'm sorry, but due to
personal circumstances,

564
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:17,534
I won't be able to
start work next week.

565
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,166
I'll explain the details in
an email.

566
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:55,033
I wonder if he's opened his eyes
to a new world yet.

567
00:55:55,433 --> 00:56:00,400
When he starts seeing dead people,
he'll be panicking at first.

568
00:56:00,466 --> 00:56:01,834
But he has to bear it.

569
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,667
He needs to see our guests if
he's going to work here.

570
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:08,200
But you didn't even
tip him off, did you?

571
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:10,467
He may run into an accident

572
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,767
out of panic at seeing them
all of a sudden.

573
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:14,933
Do you think so?

574
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,000
I can't have him dead,
not just yet.

575
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:34,434
Excuse me! I was here first.

576
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,466
Once the taxi is here,
I'm getting on it first.

577
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:42,066
You saw me standing here,
didn't you?

578
00:56:45,266 --> 00:56:46,833
You did, right?

579
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,833
No, I didn't.

580
00:56:49,866 --> 00:56:50,866
I can't see.

581
00:56:54,266 --> 00:56:55,234
Argh!

582
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,534
Happy birthday.

583
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,233
Your birthday present this year is
a very special one.

584
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,533
I saw dead people in there.

585
00:57:05,866 --> 00:57:06,966
Where are you?

586
00:57:08,966 --> 00:57:10,000
Speak.

587
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:19,433
Sir, are you getting in or not?

588
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:21,333
Y-yes, I'm getting in!

589
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,033
Argh!

590
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:45,300
His first one just had to be
a scary one.

591
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:57,133
It's a dead end, no!

592
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:06,366
Argh!

593
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:21,066
Don't come here.

594
00:58:21,433 --> 00:58:23,300
Don't come here, don't!

595
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,100
Why do you keep on following me?
Why?

596
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,600
Go away! Go!

597
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:12,700
Go!

598
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,466
Go! Go!

599
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,934
Don't be so hard on him.

600
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,500
Go away! Go!

601
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:22,134
Our little Koo Chan-sung is
about to have a heart attack.

602
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,866
Go! Go away!

603
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,467
Don't take them off!

604
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:29,334
Not your sunglasses!

605
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,900
I know you don't have eyes.

606
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:33,100
You're really scary
if you take them off, alright?

607
00:59:33,266 --> 00:59:35,400
Go away! Go!

608
00:59:35,466 --> 00:59:36,533
Go!

609
01:00:17,266 --> 01:00:18,933
Going somewhere far?

610
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:26,433
Yes.

611
01:00:27,266 --> 01:00:29,200
The gift I gave you this time

612
01:00:29,266 --> 01:00:32,334
won't have you stopped at
the border.

613
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,200
You can't get rid of it.

614
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:35,433
Too bad.

615
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:38,567
Are you the one who sent me that
weird thing just now?

616
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:39,634
Uh-huh.

617
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,833
I didn't send it to you,
you can just start seeing them.

618
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:46,900
You're now starting to see
the things you couldn't.

619
01:00:47,766 --> 01:00:48,933
What are these "things?"

620
01:00:49,266 --> 01:00:50,300
Ghosts.

621
01:00:54,266 --> 01:00:55,400
Damnit!

622
01:00:56,266 --> 01:00:58,967
There's a nice restaurant
around here that was on TV.

623
01:00:59,033 --> 01:01:00,466
While we're here,
let's check it out.

624
01:01:01,066 --> 01:01:04,534
- Restaurant?
- I've been wanting to go there.

625
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,300
What are you doing? Come on!

626
01:01:08,366 --> 01:01:09,733
If I don't come with you…

627
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:13,134
Will something like that
come for me, and kill me?

628
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,734
You're not going to die.

629
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,734
Something like that just now
don't have the power to.

630
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,367
Unless you die of
heart attack first.

631
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:21,433
Happy now?

632
01:01:22,566 --> 01:01:25,067
They're going to close soon.

633
01:01:25,133 --> 01:01:26,267
Let them close!

634
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:27,967
And put my eyes back to
how they were before.

635
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:30,066
You're not going anywhere
until then!

636
01:01:34,366 --> 01:01:38,600
If that restaurant closes before
we can get there,

637
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:41,333
I'll make sure your eyes
are closed, too.

638
01:01:44,466 --> 01:01:46,233
Forever!

639
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,667
Open your eyes.

640
01:01:56,733 --> 01:01:59,100
Humans die when they starve.

641
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:01,434
I didn't want that to happen
to you, so I brought you here.

642
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,367
You've heard of the show,
'Eat Till You Drop,' right?

643
01:02:03,966 --> 01:02:07,333
('I'll lick my plate clean!'
Eat Till You Drop)

644
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:07,133
They cleared
30 servings in this place.

645
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,933
If you come late,
they may be sold out.

646
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,366
(Sold out!
We're out of ingredients for the day)

647
01:02:14,366 --> 01:02:15,566
Hey, see?

648
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,566
Had we been a little later,
we would've missed out.

649
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,566
Gosh, someone needs to
get rid of that.

650
01:02:58,533 --> 01:03:01,233
It's that wench who shot me!

651
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,967
Do I have to keep seeing
scary things like just now?

652
01:03:12,033 --> 01:03:13,667
You were just unlucky back then.

653
01:03:13,733 --> 01:03:16,200
She was extra gruesome,

654
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:18,033
but they're not all that scary.

655
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:21,167
Ah, over there.

656
01:03:21,233 --> 01:03:22,233
Look at that kid there.

657
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:25,167
He's not all that scary, is he?

658
01:03:25,233 --> 01:03:30,600
You might pass him by and
think he's still alive.

659
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:32,700
Most are like that,

660
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:33,900
so don't be such a wuss.

661
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,567
Why's he there, like that?

662
01:03:35,633 --> 01:03:37,334
Some don't realize that
they're dead,

663
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,000
so they're still
wandering around here.

664
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,434
Some choose to stay here,
still obsessed with the

665
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,100
things they were obsessed about
when they were still alive.

666
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:46,400
I guess it's dumplings for that kid.

667
01:03:46,733 --> 01:03:47,800
Who knows.

668
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:50,233
Why do you have to make me
see those things?

669
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,433
You'll find your answer at
Del Luna.

670
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:58,334
If you had come
when you were supposed to,

671
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,800
you wouldn't have gotten
yourself into this mess.

672
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,400
Ah, hot.

673
01:04:03,933 --> 01:04:06,434
How did Kim Jun-hyun shove down
five of these at once,

674
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,700
when they're so hot?

675
01:04:08,933 --> 01:04:10,600
It's a wonder.

676
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,000
You try it, too.

677
01:04:14,866 --> 01:04:16,933
That should be my line.

678
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,834
I would've thought
you were a human, too.

679
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,500
Are you sure you're dead?

680
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:26,800
I'm not dead yet.

681
01:04:26,866 --> 01:04:30,500
I'm just here, like this.

682
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,700
By "yet"…
Do you mean you will, someday?

683
01:04:41,866 --> 01:04:43,166
Why, what if I can die?

684
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:46,833
Do you want to try killing me?

685
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,766
Here, have a bite.

686
01:04:55,633 --> 01:04:57,333
If you succeed,
I'll give you a chance.

687
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:07,566
I just want you to
disappear from my sight.

688
01:05:21,466 --> 01:05:24,167
Mr. Koo Chan-sung, who can't
stand the sight of me.

689
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:27,167
Go get me some milk tea,
so I can drink it and die.

690
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:29,467
You just had
so many of those dumplings.

691
01:05:29,533 --> 01:05:31,734
Are you that same person
who marveled at Kim Jun-hyun?

692
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,400
Wait, are you even human?

693
01:05:33,466 --> 01:05:34,734
Hurry up.

694
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,900
If they close,
I'm going to kill you.

695
01:06:05,933 --> 01:06:08,100
You shot me, didn't you?

696
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:09,833
Didn't you?

697
01:06:12,233 --> 01:06:14,966
You've become a mess
as much as your sin.

698
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:18,700
Just you wait. What's waiting for
you in the underworld is

699
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,433
even more dreadful.

700
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,233
It's all your fault. Your fault!

701
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,400
Die!

702
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,100
What's going on here?

703
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,900
Have you been stabbed?

704
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:25,366
Why do people…

705
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:29,667
…always blame others,
and not realize their own faults?

706
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:30,900
I said, are you alright?

707
01:07:36,233 --> 01:07:39,200
I can't laugh at
that disgusting man.

708
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:46,500
I was once
wild with my sword, too.

709
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:49,566
Koo Chan-sung.

710
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,600
Though you didn't succeed
at the dumplings,

711
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:52,800
I'll still give you a chance.

712
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:56,733
If you want to run, run.

713
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,100
Turn back and run,

714
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:09,800
and I'll disappear from your sight

715
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:13,833
as you wished, from then on.

716
01:08:18,033 --> 01:08:19,066
Go.

717
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,566
If you go now,
it still won't be too late.

718
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,167
What is that?

719
01:09:35,233 --> 01:09:37,633
I'll help you up. Get on here.

720
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:41,767
I'll take you to a hospital or
that Del Luna, or whatever!

721
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:42,833
So let's go.

722
01:09:45,566 --> 01:09:47,000
- What are you doing?
- I don't have the strength to

723
01:09:47,066 --> 01:09:48,767
carry you and run.

724
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:50,366
It's not that filthy, so get on it.

725
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:04,766
This is…

726
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,600
You're fine.

727
01:10:12,733 --> 01:10:13,833
Koo Chan-sung.

728
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,900
You're really…

729
01:10:19,733 --> 01:10:21,066
…weak, aren't you?

730
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,467
I really like that
delicate side of yours,

731
01:10:31,533 --> 01:10:35,900
bringing a cart for me.

732
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,467
I guess what this feeble human did
was absolutely unnecessary,

733
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:40,700
when a sword can't even kill you.

734
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:44,067
I'll just go my way, then.

735
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:45,233
You can't go.

736
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:05,833
What are you doing?

737
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:18,733
You…

738
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,733
Are you really going to…

739
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,133
You just missed your last chance
for me to give you up.

740
01:12:11,133 --> 01:12:12,666
From this moment on,
if you run away,

741
01:12:15,066 --> 01:12:16,333
I will kill you.

742
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:02,266
(Hotel Del Luna)

743
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,700
What are you going to
have me do there, anyway?

744
01:13:05,766 --> 01:13:06,800
Exorcism?

745
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:09,834
Exorcism? No!
It's called "freshening up."

746
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,934
Wouldn't it be dangerous for me
to get close?

747
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,634
Then start by
addressing me properly.

748
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,634
"President."

749
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,434
Someone like me, who has
an MBA from Harvard…

750
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,400
We don't need an MBA graduate.

751
01:13:17,466 --> 01:13:19,067
You can see ghosts now.

752
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:22,667
How can my life stay ordinary
when I can see ghosts now?

753
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:25,567
Go tell the President
you'll get rid of the tiger,

754
01:13:25,633 --> 01:13:26,534
and claim your reward.

755
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,900
You said this wouldn't
be dangerous.

756
01:13:27,966 --> 01:13:29,100
Come to Del Luna.

757
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:31,033
You'll be safe right beside me.
