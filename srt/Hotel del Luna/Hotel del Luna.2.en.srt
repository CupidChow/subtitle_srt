00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,366
(Lee Ji-eun)

00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,533
(Yeo Jin-goo)

00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,834
(Shin Jung-geun/Bae Hae-sun)

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,300
(Pyo Ji-hoon/
Kang Mi-na/Cho Hyun-chul)

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,366
(Seo Yi-sook/Kang Hong-suk)

6
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:41,066
(Hotel Del Luna)

7
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:14,366
You lost the last chance
for me to give you up.

8
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:18,133
From this moment on,
if you run away,

9
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:22,100
I will kill you.

10
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,633
(Episode 2)
Did you just kill that old man?

11
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,500
What the heck?

12
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,134
What is that?

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
The trash left after that
vengeful ghost was burnt.

14
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,267
Was that guy a ghost?

15
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,034
I told you, some of them
look like humans.

16
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,866
Ugh, you said those ones
aren't dangerous.

17
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:28,500
If you're attacked by
vengeful ones, you may die.

18
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,834
Make sure to tell them apart.

19
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,634
You said you can't
tell them apart.

20
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,934
So don't look at them briefly.
Look at them carefully.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,200
Ugh, but it's scary to
look at them… closely.

22
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,100
I'm right here with you.
No need to be scared.

23
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:45,766
Excuse me.

24
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,633
That.

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,966
Get it, please.

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Won't it be dangerous
for me to get closer?

27
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,600
I…

28
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,734
Then address me properly first.

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,200
"President."

30
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:10,000
You're not my president.

31
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,467
I told you, I don't wish to
work at your hotel.

32
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:14,733
You need to get scared
a bit more, huh?

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,734
Hey.

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,467
If you leave that there…

35
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,934
Won't it be dangerous to
the humans passing by?

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,667
That trash will be cleaned up
by someone else.

37
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,034
Who?

38
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,666
A Grim Reaper.

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,966
Are you going to
put that back on?

40
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,067
Why?

41
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,700
Is it dangerous?

42
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,700
But I bought them recently.

43
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:47,867
Can't I just wipe it
and wear it again?

44
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:50,566
Throw that away.
Let's go get new shoes.

45
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,133
What about my luggage?

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,266
(Death)

47
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,066
(Death)

48
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,233
Let's see.

49
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Oh.

50
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,100
These look good. Put these on.

51
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,934
No, thanks. Those aren't
my type of shoes.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,400
They're better than those
tacky poo-colored ones.

53
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:39,100
Don’t wear anything like those.

54
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't like poo-color.

55
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,100
Uh, you.

56
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,834
You just told me to throw
the shoes away because…

57
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,700
It's tacky and poo-colored.

58
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,500
Not because it's dangerous?

59
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:52,367
I never said that.

60
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:55,533
Ah, if you don’t like them,
then wear those.

61
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,334
Ugh, no, thanks.

62
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,834
I will pick the ones same as

63
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,734
the sophisticated brown one
from earlier.

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,367
Just wear them.

65
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,200
The store will be closed soon.

66
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,266
No, thanks.

67
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:12,466
Thank you for visiting…

68
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,567
Because of picky Koo Chan-sung,

69
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,634
I couldn't even take time
to find shoes for me.

70
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,067
If I had more time,

71
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,867
I would've never worn such shoes.

72
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,834
Even if you aren't satisfied,
you can't help it.

73
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,066
All stores have closing times.

74
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,034
I bought you new shoes,
so start working tomorrow.

75
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,300
Let's get things straight.

76
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,234
You just picked them.
I paid for them.

77
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,534
And I will not work at your hotel.

78
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,500
What are you trying to
make me do at that place?

79
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,467
Comforting the ones who
closed their doors

80
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,933
with sadness and regrets.

81
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,900
Closed their doors?

82
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,000
About a human being's time…

83
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,566
ending.

84
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,400
The death.

85
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,000
Mr. Kim Byung-doo.

86
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,166
I'm here to pick you up.

87
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,166
(To Heaven)

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,033
He went on a long trip
in peace and quiet.

89
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:16,200
I hope you have a safe trip
over the bridge, too.

90
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,434
When their times are over,
most of the humans

91
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,934
cross Yudo Bridge over the Styx

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,633
and go to the underworld.

93
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:35,333
But some of them
lose that way and can't go.

94
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,900
You saw them, too.

95
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,033
Those who still remain
and wander around,

96
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,366
even when their time
in this world is over.

97
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,834
Like you, who is still wandering

98
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,166
in front of
a closed department store?

99
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,600
That's a good metaphor.

100
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,567
You do understand it.

101
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,134
The guests at my hotel

102
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,833
are the dead ones who lost
their ways to the underworld.

103
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,334
So the guests at your hotel

104
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,834
are ghosts, huh?

105
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,433
So you made me see
those scary things.

106
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,700
Come to Del Luna.

107
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,733
It's safe if you stay by my side.

108
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,467
Trying to run away from me
without permission

109
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,934
is the most dangerous thing to do.

110
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,766
Don't do that.

111
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,034
Koo Chan-sung,
put your new shoes on,

112
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,400
take Subway Line 4 and
come tomorrow.

113
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,633
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

114
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,300
I said, address me properly.

115
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,500
"President."

116
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:06,866
Which side are you at?

117
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:11,200
Before the door is closed?

118
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,900
Or wandering after it closed,
out of regrets?

119
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,400
I know that you're not
a normal human like me,

120
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,934
because I suffered so much today.

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,734
You said they can kill people

122
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,267
if they have strong
vengeance, right?

123
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,834
And you said you'd kill me,

124
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,100
so are you a vengeful ghost, too?

125
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,334
A vengeful ghost…

126
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,533
would be that girl
right next to you.

127
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,566
You shut your mouth voluntarily.

128
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,366
You truly are perfect.

129
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,866
Ah, uh…

130
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,166
Vengeful ghost?

131
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Here's your food.
I'll get you some more.

132
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,200
Here's your food. Come here.

133
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,433
Kitties, eat some more.

134
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,800
Huh? Yoon-seo.

135
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,500
Yoon-seo.

136
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:42,267
Meow.

137
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,833
A big kitty. A big kitty.

138
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,467
Yoon-seo.

139
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,267
What were you looking at?

140
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,066
I saw a big kitty. Meow.

141
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,866
Mommy was worried about you.

142
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:14,966
Is it dead or alive?

143
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:20,367
No leaves, and no flowers
for more than a thousand years.

144
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,934
Is it really dead?

145
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,800
Which side are you at?

146
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:28,267
Before the door is closed?

147
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,133
Or wandering after it closed,
out of regrets?

148
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,400
It is alive.

149
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,334
You said

150
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,166
that tree is you.

151
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,200
So,

152
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:46,366
I guess I can say that
I am alive, huh?

153
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,800
I prepared a quality Champagne.
Would you like some?

154
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:58,400
Sure. But bring a whole box,
not a tiny bottle.

155
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,566
Someone's here.

156
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,000
A very special guest is here.

157
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:14,900
I must go greet this one.

158
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,867
Wow, that guest just now
is a tiger, right?

159
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:48,067
It’s dangerous…

160
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:51,400
for a soul of a sacred animal to
wander outside like that.

161
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:53,366
Did you kick it out again?

162
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:57,967
Can't you do your job right?

163
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:00,000
You should've noticed beforehand
and escorted it.

164
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,034
Ugh, for 60 years of
my career here,

165
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,734
I've never had a tiger
as a guest before.

166
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,500
Do it right.

167
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:06,634
There are millions of ghosts

168
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,334
who want to work here, so they
can stay in this world.

169
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,134
If you're not happy about it,
then take the bus.

170
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,367
- I won't stop you.
- You got Mr. Koo

171
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:16,400
because I'm bad at this job.

172
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:17,867
I may not be a good employee,

173
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,300
but I'm lucky.

174
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,766
Was my dying early from good luck?

175
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,600
How mean.

176
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,833
President, I will work hard, okay?

177
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:31,266
(Dear Mr. Koo Chan-sung,
Happy birthday)

178
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,734
Hey, when did you come?

179
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,600
You said you're going
somewhere. Didn't you go?

180
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,467
Hey, you said you're staying
at my house,

181
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,467
so I was super happy,
but got disappointed.

182
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,634
Hey, let's have a welcoming
party. What would you like?

183
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,733
Beer, spirits, soju. Pick one.

184
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,566
Why are you so quiet?

185
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,100
Chan-sung.

186
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,133
Hey, Chan-sung.

187
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:02,600
No response.
Let's just drink beer.

188
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,800
(We hope to see you from tomorrow)

189
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,900
Are you a vengeful ghost, too?

190
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:15,966
Was it too harsh to call her
a vengeful ghost?

191
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,867
It was a nice looking hotel,

192
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,600
with a flashing sign

193
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,600
and covered in ivy.

194
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,167
Hotel Del Luna.

195
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,366
It's a lot more ordinary
than I thought.

196
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,333
Is it closed during daytime?

197
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:32,200
Looks like I scared you.

198
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,733
You're alive, aren’t you?

199
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,500
- I am.
- See the prices first.

200
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:46,233
(Price Chart)

201
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,634
The price is incredibly
expensive here.

202
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,334
Yes, they are super
expensive, aren't they?

203
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,800
It's the hotel rule. No discounts.

204
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,367
That sounds like telling me
not to come in.

205
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,200
I recommend you to stay at
a luxury hotel nearby

206
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,834
with that money.

207
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,200
I would've done that
if I was a guest,

208
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:05,200
but I'm not a guest.

209
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:07,700
(We hope to see you from tomorrow)

210
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,400
"We're pleased to offer you…"

211
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,067
You're Mr. Koo Chan-sung,
the new manager.

212
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,667
I'm not a new manager.
I'm just visiting.

213
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,100
The president is waiting.

214
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,333
Please go up this way,
Mr. Manager.

215
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,800
I'm not the manager here.

216
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:25,900
Okay, please go up this way.

217
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,367
Are there no guests here
at this moment?

218
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,400
We're fully booked.

219
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,866
But it's time for them to sleep,
so it's quiet.

220
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,800
It's a lot more ordinary
than I heard.

221
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:11,000
I heard about an outdoor pool
that looks like the sea,

222
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,500
and a sky bar on
a skyscraping floor.

223
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:15,267
They are the signature
features of our hotel.

224
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,500
You really have those?

225
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,034
Want to take a look around
in prior?

226
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,067
Mr. Manager?

227
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,033
No, thanks. I don't need to.

228
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,100
And I'm not the manager.

229
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,534
Then, Chan-sung?

230
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Mr. Koo Chan-sung?

231
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,200
The president is waiting.

232
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,467
Think of it like

233
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,434
it's 3 a.m. at

234
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,867
regular hotels at this moment.

235
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,400
He said it's fully booked,

236
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:53,100
so it must be filled with ghosts.

237
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,634
I'm a human.

238
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,100
Just like you, Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

239
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,133
From this moment on,

240
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,133
to this moment.

241
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,000
This woman existed.

242
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,334
She will be here soon.

243
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
Excuse me.

244
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,100
Have you worked here
for a long time?

245
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,967
I started working in the year
I turned 40,

246
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,334
so it's been more than 30 years.

247
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,167
30… 30 years?

248
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,966
I'm the only one
who ages in this hotel.

249
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,767
And you, Mr. Koo,

250
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,933
will do my job from now on.

251
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:28,766
30 years?

252
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,866
I have to stay here until
I get old like him, too?

253
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,100
What took you so long?

254
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,900
You didn't wear the shoes
we bought yesterday.

255
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,867
Those flashy shoes
we bought yesterday

256
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,634
don't match the hotel I work at.

257
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,767
I just need to stop by here,
and then go to work.

258
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,900
The girl with the sunglasses
must've made you comfortable.

259
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:01,867
Did you send that ghost to me?

260
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:04,434
You made her follow me, when
she has no grudge on me?

261
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,667
Oh, that.

262
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:08,767
She's wandering around the human
with a matching energy.

263
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:12,934
Once you're connected, it’s
automatic from that moment on.

264
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,066
What am I? A Wi-Fi router?

265
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,800
What a perfect metaphor.

266
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:21,134
You understand so well, too.
You are perfect. I like you.

267
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,067
I don't want you to like me.

268
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,500
And I don’t want to
see weird things.

269
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:26,167
You must see them.

270
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:27,700
And you must get used to them.

271
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,067
Those ghosts…

272
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,966
are the guests you will
serve at this hotel.

273
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,534
Is this some kind of
a new religion?

274
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,067
This place called Del Luna.

275
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:38,700
Is this a shaman's house
where you serve ghosts?

276
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,634
It's a hotel.

277
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,166
It's even registered at
the Jung-gu District Office.

278
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,000
(Jung-gu District Office, Seoul)

279
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,800
(Business Declaration
Hotel Del Luna)

280
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,800
I searched on all of the
hotel websites all night long.

281
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:52,234
There was no sign of
a hotel named Del Luna

282
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,834
being in business.

283
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,134
Of course you can't find it
on a hotel website.

284
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,133
I told you this hotel isn’t
for humans.

285
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:05,867
Ah, you said
you comfort ghosts, right?

286
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:10,300
Then do you provide
shamanistic rituals as services?

287
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:12,200
They're not shamanistic rituals.

288
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,200
They're healing activities.

289
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:34,866
Here's your room service.

290
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:44,866
Eat all the food you couldn't
in this world before you go.

291
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:48,500
We have plenty of food.

292
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:13,000
Sir.

293
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:15,333
Does it feel warm now?

294
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,866
We will burn firewood until
you feel warm.

295
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,667
Are you reading foreign
language books now?

296
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,400
You might read all of
the books here soon.

297
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:48,600
Study as much as you want.

298
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,034
We will get you all the books
you want to read.

299
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,166
Thank you.

300
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,100
Del Luna is where those
who were once humans

301
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:05,267
do what they couldn't do when
they were humans,

302
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,200
relaxing themselves.

303
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,033
It's called healing these days.

304
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,167
Not only humans do that.

305
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:18,933
Ghosts have to do it to
leave in peace.

306
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:22,967
You ghosts can deal with
the ghost customers.

307
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,600
Why do you need me, a human?

308
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:28,267
Ugh, it’s because there are
things only a human can do.

309
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,334
Declaring business, paying taxes,

310
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,034
getting sanitary checkups,
and so on.

311
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,267
You have so much work to do.

312
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,633
I want to solve this in
a human way.

313
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,067
This is the money I prepared
to pay back to you.

314
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:46,900
It's the money you gave
my father, with interest.

315
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:48,866
Please let me go with this.

316
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,800
You did collect a lot.

317
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,566
So you're diligent and smart.

318
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,400
You won't need to worry
about starving to death.

319
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:13,366
You said this is for me,
so I'll accept it.

320
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,266
That means I paid it off, right?

321
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:22,500
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

322
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:23,800
I was waiting
so I could go with you

323
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:25,934
when you came. Let's go.

324
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,100
I didn't think of
going with you at all.

325
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:31,234
So you're going outside alone?

326
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,600
Yes.

327
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,534
Okay, then.

328
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,433
Go on.

329
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,167
3rd floor, please.

330
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,966
Ah, okay.

331
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,234
Why!

332
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,434
Why.

333
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,100
Why am I keep seeing those things?

334
00:27:57,166 --> 00:28:00,300
I paid the money back, so
I shouldn't see them anymore.

335
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:02,667
You paid off debt.

336
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:05,134
And I gave you a birthday gift.

337
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,267
Keep it as a souvenir.

338
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,000
That makes no sense.

339
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:12,367
How can I live a normal life

340
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:14,600
when I see those things?

341
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,567
Well then, you can't help it.

342
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,867
Work here.

343
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:21,866
Return my eyes to a normal state.

344
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:26,200
I'm going out now.
What will you do?

345
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:27,966
Want me to take you with me?

346
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,634
If you don't want, then stay here.

347
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,833
Let's talk more after

348
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:37,333
we get out of here.

349
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,700
This human seems to have
weak body and soul,

350
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:58,467
therefore I am worried.

351
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:01,533
He looks fearless to me.

352
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,434
I was scared of the boss more
than I was of the ghosts.

353
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,867
But,

354
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:12,800
that young man isn't afraid

355
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:14,600
to talk to the boss.

356
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,967
It's because he doesn't know why

357
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:18,800
Ms. Jang is the owner
of this place.

358
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:21,133
Hurry.

359
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,667
Jang Man-wol is the scariest,
the most horrifying

360
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:27,566
of all of the ghosts here.

361
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,567
- This car, right?
- For today…

362
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,366
It's this car.

363
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:53,200
Are all these cars yours?

364
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:55,634
I told you, all of the guests at
the hotel are ghosts.

365
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,666
What kind of ghost drives a car?

366
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:16,734
You have so many good cars.

367
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,500
Do I look like a human for
riding a sports car,

368
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,567
though you thought
I was a vengeful ghost?

369
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:21,866
You must make a lot of money
for doing rituals…

370
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:25,400
I mean, providing healing
for all of them.

371
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,800
You might hate to see ghosts,

372
00:30:28,866 --> 00:30:31,267
but isn't it good to see
such expensive things?

373
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,700
Doesn't it make you
want to work there?

374
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:34,700
I just can't connect that

375
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,034
you can gain materialistic wealth

376
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,700
through supernatural healing.

377
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:40,900
So you're now interested in
this hotel's profit model.

378
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:43,634
I should've shown you the cars
before the ghosts.

379
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,733
I'm not interested.

380
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,034
Why are you laughing?

381
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,166
A ghost and a seat belt.

382
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
I'll drive you to
your destination,

383
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:58,600
so please fix my eyes.

384
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:00,267
Why are you laughing?

385
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,500
Just because.

386
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:04,667
It's funny that you believe
I'd fix your eyes.

387
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,034
We made an agreement.

388
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,634
If my eyes aren't fixed,
I can't go to work.

389
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,900
No, you can't.

390
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:11,100
You're going to do
different work right now.

391
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,900
Where are we going?

392
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,900
To catch a tiger.

393
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,566
You're trying to be funny, right?

394
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,266
It's…

395
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:46,767
it's here, like this.

396
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:50,167
Can a tiger be a guest
at your hotel, too?

397
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:51,866
Because it's a sacred animal.

398
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,000
This is the last tiger of
Mr. Paektu

399
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,734
caught in the Korean Peninsula.

400
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,200
I remember seeing a news about
a tiger given as a gift

401
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:02,167
from North Korea.

402
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:04,667
When it came here, it didn't
get along with other tigers,

403
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,167
didn't find a mate,

404
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:08,366
and lived alone until its death.

405
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,300
It's dead,

406
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:15,566
but it's being like this,

407
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,066
like it's alive.

408
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:24,767
I'm not dead.

409
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,800
I'm not dead yet, I'm just…

410
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:28,700
I'm just staying like this.

411
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:23,500
President, did you have
that nightmare again?

412
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,134
The one who brought that
tiger from North Korea

413
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,900
is the president of our
hotel group.

414
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:47,367
He received it
as a gift of friendship

415
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,934
when he visited
North Korea before.

416
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,666
I see.

417
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:56,234
By the way, you said we're
looking for a tiger.

418
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,467
So why are we at
a red bean porridge shop?

419
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,067
What does this place
have to do with that?

420
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:02,800
Red bean porridge is
tiger's favorite food.

421
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,234
Isn't it obvious to think of
red bean porridge

422
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,533
when you think of a tiger?

423
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,900
I don't know why that's obvious.

424
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:16,234
You just wanted to eat
red bean porridge, huh?

425
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,734
This place was on TV show
'Eat Till You Drop.'

426
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,367
- Kim Jun-hyun can…
- That Kim Jun-hyun.

427
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:25,034
He can put five rice cake balls
in his mouth all at once.

428
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,966
He really is something.

429
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,100
How many do you think you can
put in your mouth?

430
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,567
I told you, I have to go to work.

431
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:35,567
This is no time to be lazy
and eat red bean porridge.

432
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:38,034
You need to be lazy when
you eat red bean porridge.

433
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,167
If you hurry when you eat it,

434
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:41,367
you'll burn your mouth on
the hot rice cake ball.

435
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:42,534
I paid you.

436
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,100
You received it,
so please solve this.

437
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,000
Do you know why…

438
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:56,567
the rice cake seller was eaten
by the tiger?

439
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:59,934
When the tiger said it won't
eat her if she gave it rice cake,

440
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,167
she just gave it rice cake.

441
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,867
That's why she was eaten.

442
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,133
She should've made
negotiations first.

443
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,900
Then do I have to

444
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:14,034
live with that woman
in sunglasses forever?

445
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,367
Bring her to our hotel.

446
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:18,167
We can let her stay for a few days
and send her on a bus.

447
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:21,700
Well, if she lived a good life,
she'll ride a limousine.

448
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:29,134
(Styx)

449
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,266
(World of Humans/Underworld)

450
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,666
(To Heaven)

451
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:48,133
(Styx)

452
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,867
I heard about a new manager.

453
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:59,967
Yes. I am going to retire soon.

454
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:03,100
I just wish to go fishing
as much as I want.

455
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:07,600
You don't have much time to spend.

456
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,000
Are you saying a car will…

457
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:13,866
come to pick me up soon?

458
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,100
I guess I should
wrap things up, then.

459
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,467
I'm not going to that hotel.

460
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:34,367
I was offered to work at
three of the 100 hotels

461
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,900
selected by Forbes.

462
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:38,734
This hotel called Del Luna

463
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,300
doesn't need someone who got MBA

464
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,967
at Harvard University, like me.

465
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:45,267
We don’t need an MBA.

466
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,000
You see ghosts now.

467
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:50,100
You're perfect for our hotel.

468
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,600
And what? Forbes?

469
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:53,434
I'm sure they wanted
to recruit you

470
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,634
when they didn't know
you can see ghosts.

471
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,167
If you don't come to our hotel,

472
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:59,366
you got no other options
but being a shaman.

473
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,400
If you know how to put
the pastry in your mouth at once,

474
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:04,266
you might become a comedian, but…

475
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,067
Are you going to hold rituals?

476
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,300
I just can get used to it.

477
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:09,967
If I get used to seeing them,

478
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,900
I'm sure I'll be able to
ignore them, too.

479
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:14,000
Oh, yeah?

480
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,233
Then let's see if you can…

481
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,100
ignore them.

482
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:48,167
Go get the coffee.

483
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,867
Like you said,

484
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,800
if you can ignore them

485
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:54,800
and bring it without spilling
even a single drop,

486
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:56,566
I will approve it.

487
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,467
Do you think the hotels
loved by Forbes

488
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:34,066
will like you, who can't even
serve a cup of coffee quickly?

489
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:46,400
By the way, when is our
new manager coming?

490
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:48,900
If he comes, then will you

491
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:51,434
leave Del Luna immediately,
Manager Noh?

492
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,867
You've been caught for a long
time, and you'll now live your life.

493
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:58,567
Please come and tell us about
a human life sometimes.

494
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:01,734
Why do you need to hear
about a life? You're dead.

495
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,500
Have fun.

496
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:07,200
Come here much later.

497
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:10,500
All of you should relieve
your regrets of this world,

498
00:40:10,566 --> 00:40:14,400
and go to the underworld
to live your next life.

499
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:20,234
I wanted to send you away
while I'm here,

500
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,800
but I can't see that.

501
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:23,867
Without you, Manager Noh,

502
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:26,734
who will comfort her cranky,
picky temper?

503
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,934
I just don't have faith in
the new person.

504
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,733
Where's everyone at?

505
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,167
We were saying goodbye

506
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:43,533
before I quit.

507
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:48,267
Scholar Kim, you got the top score
for a government exam, right?

508
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,934
I did.

509
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,100
- You see, I once was…
- Enough.

510
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,934
Isn't that better than
MBA at Harvard

511
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,700
if you compare it to
the recent days?

512
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:58,000
It can't even compare.

513
00:40:58,066 --> 00:41:01,067
Lady Choi, did you say you had
99 rooms in your house?

514
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:02,700
I did.

515
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:05,367
I had hundreds of mouths to feed.

516
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,134
- Hey, kid. You…
- Ah, I…

517
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,800
I was the son of the richest
family in Gyeongseong,

518
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,300
and went to the most
prestigious school.

519
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:12,567
Right? You guys are all dead,

520
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:15,600
but you were more successful
than Koo Chan-sung when alive.

521
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,600
And he bragged about
being liked by

522
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,500
that Forbes thing.

523
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:29,867
President, I think I should
stay at the hospital

524
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:34,900
for a few days, like last time.

525
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:36,067
Aren't you feeling well?

526
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:39,867
When will this
Koo Chan-sung come?

527
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:42,034
He said he'd hold it,
so I told him to do so.

528
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,700
But he won't hold it that long.

529
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:46,866
He's quite weak.

530
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:50,434
We got a new human
to take your place,

531
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,134
and I said I'll let you go.

532
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,833
Enjoy the rest of your time
as a human,

533
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,333
and then leave.

534
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:15,134
He got sick after serving her
for decades,

535
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,400
but she doesn't ask if he's okay
or say he's done so much.

536
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,766
(Royal Pacific)

537
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:34,600
Thank you so much.

538
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:35,834
Sure.

539
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,766
Thank you so much.

540
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,333
(Four Seasons of Paektu Mountain)

541
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,933
(Tiger of Paektu Mountain)

542
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:26,300
Let' be calm. I just need to
ignore him.

543
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,634
Thank you for visiting our hotel.

544
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,400
It's my pleasure.

545
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:46,400
Ah, Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

546
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,100
Yes, my guests are
world class VIPs, like them.

547
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,900
Not ghosts.

548
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,200
I have to say, we've been
fortunate to have

549
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:13,467
an experienced manager
at our hotel.

550
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:17,900
He's right there, actually.
Let me introduce him to you.

551
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:20,766
Mr. Koo Chan-sung?

552
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:24,267
I just shouldn't make any sound.

553
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:27,700
If I don't make a sound,
I'll let it slide this time, too.

554
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,300
Come and say hi.

555
00:44:32,933 --> 00:44:35,534
Oh, no. I had an eye contact
with the president already,

556
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,467
so I can't ignore her and
turn away.

557
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,500
But if I talk, this woman will
take her sunglasses off

558
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:41,566
and run to me again.

559
00:44:42,733 --> 00:44:44,634
Mr. Koo Chan-sung?

560
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,067
If my president talks to me,
I have to talk.

561
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:49,534
But if this woman takes
her sunglasses off,

562
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,300
I don't think I can ignore her.

563
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:54,200
I…

564
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,766
I…

565
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,266
Ugh, what the heck?

566
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,400
You said you'd ignore them,

567
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:29,400
and you jumped into the water
on your own?

568
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:33,534
Wow, what will you do next time?

569
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,866
Jump off the rooftop?

570
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:42,100
Then I can go to
your hotel as a guest.

571
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,767
I will not go there before that.

572
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,700
I will ignore them,
no matter what I see.

573
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:50,066
What is this?

574
00:45:51,466 --> 00:45:54,367
Looks like you couldn't
ignore this one.

575
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:56,167
Are you curious?

576
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:59,533
About what happened to
this last tiger?

577
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,966
What happened?

578
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,566
Let's go find out.

579
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,266
Ring the bell.

580
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,767
This makes no sense.

581
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,367
This is President Wang
of our group.

582
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,000
It makes no sense for an employee
whom he never met

583
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:33,467
- to come say hi.
- Why not?

584
00:46:33,533 --> 00:46:36,733
You said you chose them, when
everyone wanted you.

585
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:40,267
Be confident.

586
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,367
Then let's call
the secretary team,

587
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,200
and get permission for
a visit first… Hey!

588
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,800
This is the first time an employee

589
00:46:51,866 --> 00:46:53,734
came to visit me to
pray for my well-being.

590
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,334
I heard that you're ill,

591
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,767
and I've always admired you, so…

592
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,400
I'm sorry for an unexpected visit.

593
00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:00,667
It's okay.

594
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:03,133
Is she your wife?

595
00:47:06,433 --> 00:47:07,667
Yes.

596
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:10,234
She wanted to say hi, too.

597
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,834
You two are a wonderful couple.

598
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,267
I've been sick these days,

599
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,134
so I couldn't go outside.

600
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,300
I didn't even have
anyone to talk to.

601
00:47:19,366 --> 00:47:21,033
This is a lot of fun.

602
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,433
Looks like she's going
to the restroom.

603
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,434
This looks expensive.

604
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,633
Is this real?

605
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:48,334
She lived overseas
for a long time,

606
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,700
so she didn't learn how to
speak in honorifics.

607
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:53,600
Oh, is, is that so?

608
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,634
Honey?

609
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,466
Honey.

610
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,634
Come sit here.

611
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,967
Sit down, please.

612
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:05,400
Please.

613
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:08,467
You know how to recognize
a great painting.

614
00:48:08,533 --> 00:48:13,300
This was painted by a famous
North Korean painter.

615
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:16,667
I got it as a gift, along with
the tiger of Paektu Mountain

616
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:19,200
- from my visit to North Korea.
- I see.

617
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:21,867
I saw that tiger being exhibited.

618
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:24,266
Was that tiger…

619
00:48:26,366 --> 00:48:30,734
I did bring it from North Korea,

620
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,300
but it didn't find a mate here,

621
00:48:34,366 --> 00:48:37,967
and lived alone until its death.

622
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:41,433
Because it didn't need to make
anything meaningful here.

623
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:45,900
Everything that was precious to it

624
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:48,233
all remained there, where
it couldn't go back to.

625
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:52,700
I feel so bad in my heart.

626
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:56,300
I keep seeing that tiger
in my dreams as well.

627
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:00,334
The one who brought it
must send it back.

628
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,067
The taxidermied tiger is already
a symbol of exchange.

629
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:08,034
I can't get rid of it,

630
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,166
or send it back.

631
00:49:58,566 --> 00:50:01,333
The times I have spent…

632
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,933
will only remain in this photo.

633
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:13,733
Will she remember a human
just passing by?

634
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:40,667
The tiger really stood
next to the President.

635
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:42,634
Why didn't you catch it,
and let it run away?

636
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,034
Ugh, how can I bring it,
when it refuses to come?

637
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,100
It was obvious it was waiting

638
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:48,567
for that President's death.

639
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:50,800
Is the President sick
because of that tiger?

640
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,367
Then it's really dangerous.

641
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:54,900
This is no time to be lazy
and eat raw fish.

642
00:50:54,966 --> 00:50:58,200
Ugh, I craved for raw fish after
seeing Paektu Mountain.

643
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Why raw fish,
after seeing a mountain?

644
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:05,300
"East Sea and Paektu Mountain."
The National Anthem.

645
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:07,167
Those two always come together.

646
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:08,834
Come on, isn't it obvious to
crave for seafood

647
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,800
when you see Paektu Mountain?

648
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:12,933
You just wanted to eat raw fish.

649
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,034
Tiger or what,

650
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,500
this is about a ghost
harassing a human.

651
00:51:17,566 --> 00:51:19,766
- We should go back.
- Sure.

652
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:22,800
You do have to go back.

653
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:26,033
Go to the President, tell him
you'll get the tiger removed,

654
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,966
and receive a price.

655
00:51:30,566 --> 00:51:31,634
A price?

656
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,434
That painting. The expensive one.

657
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,267
- Get that.
- What?

658
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:39,767
If he's sick because of
the tiger, he'll give it to you.

659
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:43,633
That old man is filthy rich,
anyway.

660
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,934
I now understand
the profit model of the hotel.

661
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,834
It's about going to the people
suffering because of ghosts

662
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,200
and ripping them off.

663
00:51:52,266 --> 00:51:54,600
Is this what I have to do
as a human?

664
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:56,400
That's right.

665
00:51:56,466 --> 00:51:58,666
That will be your job from now on.

666
00:52:01,033 --> 00:52:03,533
I will never commit fraud
for a job and trick people.

667
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:14,466
Is this how you tricked
my father as well?

668
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,734
I saved your father's life.

669
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,767
And I got you as the price.

670
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:26,334
That's why I'm
still protecting you.

671
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,466
If I don't stay by your side…

672
00:52:29,466 --> 00:52:31,334
you will die.

673
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,100
Will I be attacked by
vengeful ghosts?

674
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,233
I think I've been attacked
by you enough already.

675
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,300
My promise with you is over.

676
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,766
I will now go live my time
as a human.

677
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,134
Take those sunglasses off
if you want!

678
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,767
I even saw a tiger. I got no
reason to hesitate now.

679
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:27,266
I'm not scared anymore.
Take them off!

680
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,200
I've been waiting for you.

681
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,234
You worked there for
30 years, right?

682
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,300
Did that woman trap you
for 30 years here?

683
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:03,367
No.

684
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:06,334
I chose to stay there.

685
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,867
You stayed at such place
for your whole life?

686
00:54:08,933 --> 00:54:14,034
Del Luna was worth staying at.

687
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,434
I don't know the worth of
that kind of hotel.

688
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,867
And I don't want to
go rip off millions

689
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:21,633
from the President, under
that woman's orders.

690
00:54:22,866 --> 00:54:24,300
I've got no confidence
to do so, either.

691
00:54:24,366 --> 00:54:27,100
Del Luna isn't a place that can be

692
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:29,667
explained with the logics
of the human world.

693
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:34,500
The value of money and power
are different at that place.

694
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:37,400
So I couldn't judge
what the president does

695
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:40,800
with the humans' standards.

696
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,334
I know you hate it at this moment,

697
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,234
and you don't want to face it.

698
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,767
I'm sure you want to avoid it.

699
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:56,167
But if you take courage
and face it,

700
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:58,300
perhaps you might

701
00:54:58,366 --> 00:54:59,800
find the value and worth

702
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:02,500
of that place as well, like I did.

703
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:08,100
Chan-sung.

704
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:10,467
What are you doing
all by yourself?

705
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:12,267
I'm talking.

706
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:14,300
All by yourself?

707
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,533
He's lonely, that's why.

708
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:41,233
You get to know
the world of secrets

709
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,633
the others do not know about.

710
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,900
Don't you think it sounds fun?

711
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,866
(Hotel Del Luna)

712
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:32,933
Manager Noh.

713
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,167
President.

714
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,900
Manager Noh is here as a guest.

715
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:02,867
President.

716
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:05,134
I used to be here every day,

717
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,967
but it's weird to come here
as a guest.

718
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:10,400
Are you dead?

719
00:57:10,466 --> 00:57:11,634
I'm sorry.

720
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,700
I lost my life
while I was outside.

721
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:20,234
I finally could let you go,

722
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,800
but you didn’t get a chance
to live as a human.

723
00:57:22,866 --> 00:57:25,534
I lived a meaningful life,

724
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,433
serving the guests here.

725
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:35,500
If I didn't meet you
when I tried to

726
00:57:35,566 --> 00:57:38,200
end my own life,

727
00:57:38,266 --> 00:57:39,867
my life would've been short,

728
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:42,533
and miserable.

729
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,600
I think I was glad to

730
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:49,500
work at Del Luna.

731
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,634
No, you're not.

732
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,167
You don't even have a family to
hold your memorial rituals.

733
00:57:55,233 --> 00:57:58,066
As I was the only one who aged,

734
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:02,833
you were my only sister,

735
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:06,766
my only daughter,

736
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:10,533
and my only granddaughter.

737
00:58:13,766 --> 00:58:16,166
Since you got a trustworthy
guy I can count on,

738
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,833
I can leave in peace and relief.

739
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,466
I…

740
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:36,566
I don't die,

741
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,000
so I can't say things like

742
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,066
"let’s meet again."

743
00:58:53,266 --> 00:58:55,434
I do hope that

744
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,600
your time can flow again someday.

745
01:00:25,766 --> 01:00:29,267
I'm sorry for another visit,
at this late hour.

746
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:31,900
I'm here to tell you
something important.

747
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:34,534
Is it about the tiger?

748
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,534
That woman named Jang Man-wol

749
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,467
who came with you earlier
came to see me.

750
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:41,434
Did she say…

751
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,933
that the tiger is
staying by your side?

752
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:49,866
I felt so guilty about bringing
it to a place where it can

753
01:00:50,566 --> 01:00:54,167
never leave while alive, and
holding onto

754
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,900
its dead body as well.

755
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,634
Come out.

756
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,666
Don't stay here and be like
you're not dead, though you're dead.

757
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,267
Come out.

758
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,300
I'll take you there.

759
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,767
She said she must
take that painting

760
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:15,233
as a price for bringing the tiger.

761
01:01:16,733 --> 01:01:18,734
I know it's hard to believe,

762
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,766
but the tiger was really there.

763
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,933
I gave her the painting.

764
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,434
If I can lift the burden
in my heart,

765
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,966
that painting can go.

766
01:01:35,966 --> 01:01:38,400
It was a painting of
Paektu Mountain.

767
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:40,634
Paektu Mountain and a tiger.

768
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,433
They always come together.

769
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,900
Why couldn’t I
think of that earlier?

770
01:02:06,866 --> 01:02:08,766
The place you want to go

771
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:12,433
doesn't exist in reality anymore.

772
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:16,133
The one who brought you
got a place for you to stay.

773
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,333
So go there,

774
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:21,933
and rest.

775
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,566
Hey.

776
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,400
I know where

777
01:04:28,466 --> 01:04:30,300
you have to go to.

778
01:04:33,733 --> 01:04:35,566
I'll take you there.

779
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,234
I only avoided you because
I hated you following me,

780
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,800
and I didn't ask you why
you were following me.

781
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,567
I thought about it.

782
01:05:00,633 --> 01:05:02,534
Even though you couldn’t see
when you were alive,

783
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,300
perhaps you might be
able to see now.

784
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:06,500
How about stop thinking
that you can't see,

785
01:05:06,566 --> 01:05:08,433
and try to see?

786
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,700
See?

787
01:05:26,766 --> 01:05:28,466
You have eyes now.

788

(Four Seasons of Paektu Mountain)

789
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:28,366
Because it didn't need to make
anything meaningful here.

790
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,867
Everything that was precious to it

791
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:34,133
all remained there, where
it couldn't go back to.

792
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:44,933
Did the tiger get to
Paektu Mountain safely?

793
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,200
I'm so sorry about
the misunderstanding.

794
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:57,600
Yes, the President said,
a burden in your heart

795
01:06:57,666 --> 01:06:58,666
can be a disease.

799
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,033
Good. At least I acted polite.

800
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:11,100
No.

801
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,834
You're not supposed to touch it.

802
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,034
Oh, I'm sorry.

803
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,700
Let's go.

804
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,667
I just need to ignore it.

805
01:07:41,733 --> 01:07:43,500
I can do this.

the misunderstanding)

808

809
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:45,166

Is the swimming pool still open?

811
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:52,034
Ah, yes.

812
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,834
It's open late night these days.

813
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,234
This way.

814
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,866
Ah, thank you.

815
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:18,000
If you're attacked by
vengeful ones, you may die.

816
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:19,933
Make sure to tell them apart.

817
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:18,566
The tiger went to
Paektu Mountain safely,

818
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,066
and I'm here to
forgive you in person.

819
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:27,800
Thank you.

820
01:11:47,366 --> 01:11:49,767
I envy the trees.

821
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:52,000
They can just settle down and
live comfortably,

822
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:54,266
with no need to walk around.

823
01:11:56,433 --> 01:11:59,200
What? You'll build a house
with this tree?

824
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:01,767
No, thanks.

825
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:04,133
I don't want to build
a house and live with you.

826
01:12:30,366 --> 01:12:31,934
Are you awake?

827
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,034
The president is waiting. Mr. Manager.

828
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,966
I'm not the manager here…

829
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:44,566
Ah, is this your first time
here at night?

830
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:47,333
This is how Del Luna
truly looks like.

831
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:55,967
You get to know
the world of secrets

832
01:13:56,033 --> 01:13:59,267
the others do not know about.

833
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,633
Don't you think it sounds fun?

834
01:14:10,966 --> 01:14:12,900
Oh, the president is here.

835
01:15:21,533 --> 01:15:25,833
(Hotel Del Luna)

836
01:15:25,833 --> 01:15:28,700
So this is how it felt about

837
01:15:28,766 --> 01:15:29,834
a warm body with
a beating heart, right?

838
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,234
Did you cast a spell on me?

839
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,367
And made me dream about you?

840
01:15:34,433 --> 01:15:37,734
Koo Chan-sung, I thought
you were weak,

841
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,367
but you're actually very healthy.

842
01:15:39,433 --> 01:15:40,967
Do you know about how
Ms. Jang Man-wol was

843
01:15:41,033 --> 01:15:42,400
when she was alive?

844
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:43,700
A leaf grew on it.

845
01:15:43,766 --> 01:15:46,534
Your time will flow again.

846
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,600
Let's dismiss Manager Koo.

847
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:51,367
If you lose your mind and
wander around,

848
01:15:51,433 --> 01:15:53,700
you may see ghosts,
but never find this place.
