(Episode 3)

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,967
Are you alive?

9
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,400
Or dead?

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,566
I just…

11
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,866
…exist.

12
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:03,533
Not as a living being,

13
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,833
and not as the dead,
who fade away.

14
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,266
I'm fixed in time,

15
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:12,666
and trapped in the moment

16
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:16,166
that cannot be rewound.

17
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:35,800
Let's go!

18
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:24,900
It was you who led the bandits,
wasn't it?

19
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,333
You must be the ringleader.

20
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:05,733
Oi.

21
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,200
You're the Gaorichon bandits,
aren't you?

22
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,900
That must mean
you're Goguryeo nomads.

23
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:13,266
You understand me, huh?

24
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,500
Oi!

25
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,766
Shut up.

26
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,567
I'm of the same breed.

27
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:22,800
Hey, brother.

28
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,233
I mean… sister.

29
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,333
Sister?

30
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,166
Sister.

31
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,766
Free your brother, will you?

32
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:53,700
I'm just an underdog
who escorts the higher-ups,

33
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:56,267
so you won't get anything out of
keeping me as a hostage.

34
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,000
- I don't think so.
- What?

35
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,600
That noble lady didn't seem bothered
when her silk pouch was taken,

36
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,133
because what she treasured was
something else.

37
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,866
I see our underdog officer
didn't just escort her.

38
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,867
I kept her company in case
she found the long journey tedious,

39
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:31,300
but as you can see,
because of my good looks,

40
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,366
things just turned out that way
after exchanging a few words.

41
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,000
I might get something out of
your face, then.

42
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,933
Why don't you free me, then?

43
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,567
If my hands were any freer,

44
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,966
I may just be more convincing.

45
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,866
If I cut off that tongue of yours,

46
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,933
would your worth drop?

47
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,533
Don't say something scary
like that.

48
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,833
Ugh!

49
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Pull me up!

50
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,667
What are you doing?
Can't you hear me?

51
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,800
Even if I did,
how can I possibly help?

52
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:53,900
Although… if my hands were free,
I might be able to help.

53
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,366
Throw me your dagger.

54
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,866
Don't move. If you do,
you'll be sucked in more quickly.

55
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,700
Throw me your dagger!

56
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,533
Where… where are you going?

57
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,400
Come back!

58
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,233
Hold onto it.

59
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,366
Come on!

60
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,834
Now you're my hostage.

61
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,867
At least I'll be of more worth
as a hostage,

62
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:37,166
than some underdog officer
with nothing but fine looks.

63
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:41,334
Sister.

64
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,600
To tell you the truth,
I'm not some petty officer.

65
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,967
The lady I was escorting is
a princess,

66
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,533
and I am the captain of
her guards.

67
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,800
What you're seeing…

68
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,967
Is it
the moon that shines tonight,

69
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:49,300
or the moon that shined
more than a thousand years ago?

70
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,800
They're both the same moon.
Are they any different?

71
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:59,767
The flowers in the garden are
in full bloom!

72
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,867
Looks like our inn master has
served her guests

73
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,567
with fine hospitality.

74
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:07,300
Ah, the name's changed.

75
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,333
We're not an inn anymore,
but a hotel! Hotel Del Luna.

76
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,167
And stop calling me an inn master.

77
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,034
I'm a president now.

78
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,900
President or inn master… same thing.

79
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:21,300
I see the mortal who served you
has departed.

80
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:26,233
But then again, after death
comes life once again.

81
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,733
I'm dead too, aren't I?

82
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,334
Why won't you take me?

83
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,867
Oh no, you're not dead yet.

84
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:36,434
You're bound to the luna tree,

85
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,834
frozen in time
between life and death.

86
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,700
How long will you keep me there?

87
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:44,700
It's you who won't budge from
where you are!

88
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:47,200
I've already shriveled up and died.

89
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,934
Cut it down and set it on fire,

90
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,533
and I should be on my way.

91
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:57,200
Once the buds sprout and
the flowers bloom and wilt,

92
00:11:57,266 --> 00:12:01,167
time will start flowing again.

93
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:06,400
Don't you want to leave behind
a fine accomplishment?

94
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,700
I have nothing to leave behind,
at least nothing colorful like that.

95
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,367
Just pick your flowers,

96
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:19,000
and bid the poor spirits goodbye.

97
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:31,166
The moon's always full for her.

98
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:38,866
Now, I can't leave you
like this forever.

99
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,867
Thank you for saving me just now.

100
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,800
You should consider yourself lucky.

101
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,034
I wouldn't have saved you,

102
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,433
if you were wearing
some other shoes.

103
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:39,034
They're much better than those
tacky poo-colored shoes.

104
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,800
You were waiting for me,

105
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,733
wearing the shoes
I picked out for you, weren't you?

106
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,334
I never waited for you.

107
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,900
Come on!

108
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,700
You even sent me that text
about that tiger as an excuse.

109
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,100
I was only curious, that's all.

110
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,900
I bet you were.

111
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:55,900
Because you were full of
thoughts about me, all this time.

112
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,067
Did you perhaps…

113
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,434
…curse me, by any chance?

114
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,466
Is that why I dreamt about you?

115
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,100
You even dreamt about me?

116
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,534
Seeing ghosts is
enough for me already.

117
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,434
I don't want to see you
in my dreams, too!

118
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,633
Why? Did I eat you up
in your dreams?

119
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:27,334
Forget it.

120
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,267
I don't think it was you
who was in my dreams.

121
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,566
Because if it really was you,
you wouldn't have acted so.

122
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,466
Alright, I'll forgive you.

123
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:41,233
You're a grown-up man,
so I understand.

124
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,934
What…!

125
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,266
It was nothing like that.

126
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,867
Koo Chan-sung.

127
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:51,200
I thought you were frail,

128
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:53,166
but you're very healthy, aren't you?

129
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,434
Yes, as you can see, I am.

130
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,667
Alright, then stay that way.

131
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:03,066
It'll be annoying
if you faint like that just now.

132
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,034
How did you bring me here?

133
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,233
Don't tell me… you teleported?

134
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,767
Well…

135
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,034
Just as you got
a wheelbarrow last time,

136
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,933
I used something to
move you here.

137
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,666
Go in.

138
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,233
Let's move him.

139
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:41,134
I'm in, President Jang.

140
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Let's go.

141
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,700
Wait for me!

142
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,600
President Jang… President Jang!

143
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,400
Now get out.

144
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:53,900
Since I'm in here and all,

145
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,900
can I go and have some fun?

146
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:56,900
Come on out.

147
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,134
But I really don't want to!

148
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,767
President Jang… President Jang!

149
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,866
Get out of there!

150
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:13,000
That must hurt.

151
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,066
Go.

152
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:16,533
Leave!

153
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,900
I just… carried you here fine,
and that's all you need to know.

154
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:32,167
By the way, is your head alright?

155
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,233
Yes.

156
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,700
Why?

157
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,134
As long as you're fine.

158
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,367
Let's go.

159
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,500
I'll show you around,
since you're here at the hotel.

160
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:52,567
Does this place even exist
in the real world?

161
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,134
I already told you, haven't I?

162
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,867
We're registered as a business
with the Jung-gu District Office,

163
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:58,733
and we even pay taxes regularly.

164
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:06,934
Although we exist in the real world,
we don't have a presence

165
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,266
so those who are alive
don't notice us.

166
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,167
Very rarely, under terrible weather

167
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,933
or by extremely sensitive mortals,
we do get noticed.

168
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,867
- Who knew there's a hotel here.
- Right?

169
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,100
It's kind of spooky, though.
Let's just go.

170
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:28,934
But three to four times a year,

171
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,133
there are people who just have to
come in to take a look.

172
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh jeez!

173
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,400
Our rates are pretty high.

174
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,000
What do you do about those people
who still won't be discouraged?

175
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,733
I'll check in.

176
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:54,733
We have special rooms to
cater to them.

177
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,967
Please go in.

178
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,033
Sure.

179
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,334
Many have checked into this room,

180
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,633
but none have checked out.

181
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,500
What did you do to them?

182
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,000
Are you curious?

183
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,833
Do you want to go in?

184
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,034
I've got
many other places to show you.

185
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,200
Alright, then let's continue on.

186
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,833
(Outdoor Pool)

187
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,466
Why sunglasses
in the middle of the night?

188
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,966
What the…

189
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:15,867
I don't come here very often,
because the sun's too strong.

190
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,634
We're in the middle of the night
in Seoul. So what's this place?

191
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,934
Inside the hotel is not the
world as you know it.

192
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,700
The laws of time and space
from your world

193
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,600
don't apply here.

194
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:29,033
Maps and clocks are
all useless in here.

195
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,534
So you're saying
this isn't the reality?

196
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
No.

197
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,234
Everything inside this hotel

198
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,966
doesn't exist in the real world.

199
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,933
No matter how beautiful it is,
it doesn't exist.

200
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,966
Does that include you?

201
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:17,900
That's right.

202
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:20,733
That includes me, too.

203
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:43,100
Then we won't die,
even if we fall from here?

204
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,667
Careful, you're still alive.

205
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,100
The fragile body of a living human

206
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,566
will fall to death.

207
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,067
That's right, this is
what it's like to have

208
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,600
a warm heart, still beating.

209
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,166
There are many things you need to
do for me while still alive.

210
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:27,600
So stay next to me, Koo Chan-sung.

211
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,767
If I say I don't want to,

212
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,466
will you push me off from here?

213
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:51,534
Even if this is not the reality,

214
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
treat me as you would
in the real world.

215
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,600
And I'll wear the shoes
I want to wear, thank you.

216
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,067
Did you change your mind,
because you were scared

217
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:07,200
I might push you off from here?

218
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:08,867
I came this far,

219
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:11,433
so is there any meaning in
running away, I thought.

220
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,300
And to be honest, I'm curious.

221
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:19,400
And it looks like fun, too.

222
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,734
I want to know.

223
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,900
About you, and this hotel.

224
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:42,733
Alright.

225
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,334
You know, I was going to give you
another chance and maybe more,

226
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,133
even if you said no and ran away.

227
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,866
Like I said,
I like everything about you.

228
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:20,666
Ah,

229
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:24,133
so it was her.

230
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:34,966
Do you offer free refills?

231
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,234
- Oh, that's right, honey.
- Hmmm?

232
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,734
Let's drop by the supermarket
on our way.

233
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,734
But I have to make
a U-turn for that.

234
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,100
Let's go there next time.

235
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,433
Oh what? What?

236
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:20,400
Oh my gosh!

237
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:21,567
- Hello?
- Oh no!

238
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:22,900
- Is this 911?
- Is she dead?

239
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:25,434
Someone's just been run over.

240
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,067
No, it wasn't me.

241
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:29,434
She just fell from the overpass,
all of a sudden.

242
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,267
Please come quick. Hurry!

243
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,100
Where this is, is…

244
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:36,400
Oh no! Oh no!

245
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:38,500
The exact location is…

246
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,333
Ugh, that idiot!

247
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,800
I'm about to go nuts!

248
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,266
Ugh, I don't know anymore.

249
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:15,266
W-what?

250
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,966
What happened to me?

251
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:28,533
Who are you?

252
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,600
This is mine.

253
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,134
We have a new human
as our general manager.

254
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,134
I managed to snatch him from
a hotel that Forbes likes,

255
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,334
so he should be competent.

256
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,734
I hear he graduated
from Harvard or whatever,

257
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,134
but it's not brains
you need to work here,

258
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,900
but nerves.

259
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:08,967
I'm worried that
he may be too faint-hearted.

260
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,867
Why not keep the position
vacant for a little longer,

261
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:15,100
and hire our first or
second-choice candidate?

262
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:18,134
We had candidates other than
Koo Chan-sung?

263
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,300
Of course.

264
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:22,300
And wasn't our first choice
also trained in exorcism?

265
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:24,467
Does it matter now?

266
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:26,466
He went his way to find
some spirit.

267
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,367
In the Name of God: Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit, I ask you.

268
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:32,700
Why are you here?

269
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:34,100
What is your name?

270
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:47,433
- That's enough already!
- Don't interrupt!

271
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:51,634
I cannot go there

272
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,200
until I catch this spirit.

273
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:55,600
So leave.

274
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,534
In the Name of God: Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit, I ask you.

275
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,767
What is your name?

276
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,434
Speak. Speak!

277
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,600
That bastard scares me more.

278
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,000
Tell me your name!

279
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:12,367
I make him see spirits,

280
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:13,900
and he's off to catch
some other spirit.

281
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:15,300
Won't he come back
once he catches him?

282
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:16,400
He won't catch him.

283
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:18,134
That spirit, Park Il-do…

284
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,633
He's super powerful.

285
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,367
Who was the second on the list?

286
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:25,167
He was a combat pilot.

287
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,900
She went all the way to
the States to get him,

288
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:30,167
but he left.

289
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:31,566
On what?

290
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Let's go.

291
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,434
Come on, let's go!

292
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,700
No!

293
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,067
Forget about the other candidates.

294
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,634
It's all good now,
now that we have Koo Chan-sung.

295
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,267
His office is ready.

296
00:31:56,333 --> 00:32:00,134
General Manager Noh had tidied it up
knowing he was due to leave.

297
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,634
He was with us for 30 years,
but didn't leave a trace behind.

298
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,866
He did.

299
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:06,833
Over there.

300
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,566
He took that picture.

301
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,100
Many mortals have worked here,

302
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,334
but all are dim in my memories.

303
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,734
How many were there
before him again?

304
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,934
Only President Jang
would know that.

305
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,966
They're all the same
and not that special.

306
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:29,800
What are you doing? Go work.

307
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,266
He was merely the
98th mortal to work here.

308
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,900
Same for Koo Chan-sung.

309
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,533
He's the 99th mortal,
and no more than that.

310
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,966
(General Manager Koo Chan-sung)

311
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,266
I slumped so easily,
which was not like me at all.

312
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:00,966
Why did I do that?

313
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:11,200
That's right, this is
what it's like to have

314
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,733
a warm heart, still beating.

315
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,033
I was carried along by
the atmosphere.

316
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:33,700
President Jang told us to say
hello to our new general manager.

317
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,667
If you work here…

318
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:39,867
That must mean
you're all ghosts, right?

319
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:42,033
I died about 500 years ago.

320
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,033
She's been dead for 200 years,

321
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:48,733
and him, for 70 years.
He's the baby.

322
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,167
I was a scholar who dedicated
his life to learning.

323
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,434
I had just achieved my long dream of
placing first in the

324
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,766
state examinations,

325
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,300
and was looking forward to
returning home

326
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:10,000
when I met with a sudden death.

327
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,666
While wandering,
I stumbled into Manwoldang.

328
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:21,766
(Manwoldang)

329
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:25,867
I've been at this hotel for
the longest.

330
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:28,600
If you were in academia,
then what do you do here now?

331
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:31,367
I have a flair for poetry,

332
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:32,934
so now I am…

333
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,466
…a bartender.

334
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:39,767
Oh.

335
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,900
So our scholar is now a bartender.

336
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:43,334
In charge of foods and beverages.

337
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,966
I was the wife of the eldest son
of a noble family.

338
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,800
But my family killed me,

339
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:52,400
and I died an unjust death.

340
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,367
I am going to stay here,

341
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:20,800
and watch with my own two eyes

342
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:23,600
until that vile,
wicked family dies out.

343
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:27,433
I see your heart is
full of resentment.

344
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:30,566
I am in charge of the rooms.

345
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,634
I see, Ms. Choi.

346
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,966
I died during the Korean War.

347
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:07,134
This place was "Manwolgwan"
back then,

348
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,767
and things were pretty rough
for this place, too.

349
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,667
I am waiting for my sister
who is still alive,

350
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,966
so we can cross over to
the afterlife together.

351
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,734
We all have our stories
and tales to tell.

352
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,300
For example, I…

353
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:22,400
All the staff here
first arrived here as guests,

354
00:37:22,466 --> 00:37:24,934
but have since
started working here.

355
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,400
Us three have been here the longest
beside President Jang.

356
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:32,100
Then did President Jang
also first arrive here

357
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,134
as a guest, like you did?

358
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,334
No.

359
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,600
President Jang is the owner of
Hotel Del Luna.

360
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,034
Owner? Please.

361
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,034
She's just tied down here as
punishment from Old Mago.

362
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,067
Tied down?

363
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:46,033
There's this huge tree
in the garden.

364
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,967
There's even a garden here?

365
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:52,400
I think we vacated the front desk
and the bar for too long.

366
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:54,666
We should get going.

367
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:58,034
Slacking off means
a one-way ticket to the underworld.

368
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,234
As for my story,

369
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,300
I'll tell it to you at the bar
over a glass of martini, on me.

370
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,634
You should get back today.

371
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,267
Where is the garden
with the big tree?

372
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,634
I didn't get to see it today.

373
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,766
She probably didn't show it to you,
because there was no need to.

374
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:29,000
What does that tree have to do
with President Jang?

375
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:34,667
Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

376
00:38:34,733 --> 00:38:37,933
How long do you wish to stay here?

377
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:42,600
As short as possible.
I'm not here on my own will.

378
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:45,966
Then I suggest you keep
your list of questions short.

379
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:49,967
The more I know,

380
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:52,334
the more I'll be bound here,
in other words.

381
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
We will handle
all guest-related matters.

382
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,667
You, Mr. Koo, only need to

383
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:00,666
deal with matters concerning
the mortal world.

384
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,966
Alright, then.

385
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:22,500
Chan-sung, you're off to
work already?

386
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,534
No, I just got off work.

387
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,800
You were working late last night?

388
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,434
No.

389
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,333
I have to resign from
the hotel I was at.

390
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:31,900
Why?

391
00:40:31,966 --> 00:40:33,200
Because I'll be working at
some other hotel.

392
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:34,500
Which hotel?

393
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,767
Where else would you go,
if not the best hotel in Seoul?

394
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:40,900
A hotel with a private beach
and a sky bar.

395
00:40:40,966 --> 00:40:42,200
Someplace like that.

396
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:44,833
There's a hotel like that in Seoul?

397
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,533
I want to visit, too.

398
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:48,666
Sorry, no.

399
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,700
If you do come Sanchez,
you'll be checking into room 404.

400
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
What's room 404?

401
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,400
Is it a suite?

402
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:01,866
Ugh, I'm dying…

403
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:07,233
Yoo-hoo!

404
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:18,500
Yes, this is reality.

405
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:20,634
I have a house, friends,

406
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,234
and other places who want me, too.

407
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,733
Let's not forget that.

408
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:31,466
Now I've calmed down.

409
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,600
This is good.

410
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,966
Something strange has followed me
to the real world.

411
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:01,733
It's the moon.

412
00:43:03,066 --> 00:43:04,600
It means it belongs to me.

413
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:28,066
"Man meaning full,"

414
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:32,233
and "Wol meaning moon."

415
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,366
This is how you write it.

416
00:43:35,366 --> 00:43:38,666
(Man-wol: Full moon)

417
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,133
This is for the wine.

418
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,500
(Del Luna)

419
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:02,200
She was in my dreams
and now she's calling me.

420
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,700
She's really confusing me,
isn't she?

421
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,533
Pick up right away, will you?

422
00:45:11,766 --> 00:45:12,766
What is it?

423
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:17,267
I have your first assignment.

424
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,333
What is it?

425
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:21,600
I need to sell the
Mt. Paektu painting.

426
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:25,233
What?

427
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,567
Thanks to that spiritual creature,

428
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:39,167
this picture now has more
positive energy than before.

429
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:41,566
I say we can expect to get
two times its original price.

430
00:45:42,566 --> 00:45:43,766
If we sell this off,

431
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:47,600
what about the tiger inside?

432
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:50,000
The tiger just left.

433
00:45:50,066 --> 00:45:51,667
This is an empty painting now.

434
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:52,733
It left?

435
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,434
That tiger spent
its entire life in a zoo.

436
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,167
Even Mt. Paektu is only fun
for the first couple of days.

437
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:01,500
It crossed over to the underworld
after a few days.

438
00:46:01,566 --> 00:46:02,567
Since it was a spiritual creature,

439
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:03,767
it should have a decent new life
after reincarnation.

440
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,567
That's why you accepted
this painting, huh?

441
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:06,534
To sell it.

442
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,400
You cared nothing about
the tiger at all.

443
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,567
What do you mean,
I didn't care about the tiger?

444
00:46:11,633 --> 00:46:13,633
I even wore these to remember him!

445
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:15,533
Ugh, please!

446
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:18,100
Anyway, get me a good price.

447
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,700
As a reward,

448
00:46:19,766 --> 00:46:22,833
I'll have a new suit tailored for you
in this pattern!

449
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,600
No thank you.

450
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:26,367
Who would wear a leopard suit?

451
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:28,900
Why? You like turdy colors.

452
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:31,500
I even got a new car
in an elegant poo-color,

453
00:46:31,566 --> 00:46:33,134
just for you.

454
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:33,934
A new car?

455
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,534
Go sell it by the end of today.

456
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,900
I need to get my new car.

457
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:38,967
You bought a new car?

458
00:46:39,033 --> 00:46:40,567
The car you were in last time
was brand-new, too!

459
00:46:40,633 --> 00:46:44,133
Yes, and now I'm broke
because of my new car.

460
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,167
So go and get me a good price.

461
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:49,166
I want twice the amount of
what I paid for it!

462
00:46:56,266 --> 00:47:01,400
Let's go get my new car…

463
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,566
I must've lost it temporarily.

464
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,434
What more do I want to
know about her?

465
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,366
She's just a money-crazy spirit!

466
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:15,900
Did it really go away?
Is it no longer here?

467
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:23,433
Rawr!

468
00:47:25,466 --> 00:47:26,466
Rawr!

469
00:47:26,933 --> 00:47:27,867
Rawr!

470
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:29,033
Rawr!

471
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,000
(Kim Yu-na)

472
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,267
That's me.

473
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,066
You died here!

474
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,966
Give me my body back!

475
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:24,234
Yes, Director.
Thank you for the contacts.

476
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,700
Yes, I'm on my way to
the gallery now.

477
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:28,066
I'll see you soon.

478
00:48:31,566 --> 00:48:32,833
Give me my body back!

479
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,234
Our third candidate on the list
just had to bring

480
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,700
a guest that calls for trouble
in the middle of the day!

481
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:44,434
She must have a story, though.

482
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,200
She keeps insisting that
she's not dead.

483
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:49,267
She's not our first guest to
make that claim.

484
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,900
"I'm not dead." "I can't die yet."
"Why did I die?"

485
00:49:51,966 --> 00:49:53,700
We've heard them
too often, haven't we?

486
00:49:53,766 --> 00:49:55,600
I'm sure President Jang
will deal with her.

487
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:02,934
I tell you to go sell a painting,

488
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,367
so why bring back a guest
I didn't even ask for?

489
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:06,967
Are you a tout?

490
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:08,233
What? A tout?

491
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:12,367
You say you look after
troubled souls here.

492
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:14,367
I think that girl has
run into a problem,

493
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:16,067
so why don't you suggest a solution?

494
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:17,467
So you say there was another girl
who looks just like her,

495
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:18,467
and who's still alive?

496
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:19,867
She said her body was stolen.

497
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,167
If it's true, we should help her.

498
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:25,200
What you brought back is
a living soul who's left her body.

499
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:31,034
Then her body's walking around,
soul-less?

500
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,534
You said her body was stolen!

501
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,066
So I bet some other spirit is
occupying it right now.

502
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:43,434
What's wrong with Kim Yu-na?

503
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,867
She used to bully her,
saying she loathed poor kids.

504
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:48,467
She must have a pang of
conscience after what she's done.

505
00:50:48,533 --> 00:50:50,200
I bet she's just pretending to
regret it, though.

506
00:50:57,333 --> 00:50:58,934
So this is where she lives?

507
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,934
Yes.

508
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,666
Kim Yu-na is the only daughter
of this household.

509
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:07,167
So their only daughter
just had her body stolen.

510
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:08,334
We should go help.

511
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,334
Uh…

512
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,634
I'm asking this to
confirm my assumption, but…

513
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,400
Are you going to rip
money off her parents?

514
00:51:14,466 --> 00:51:17,134
These people aren't just rich.

515
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,334
That's the turdy car that
I've been after.

516
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,967
I only managed to
get on the waiting list,

517
00:51:21,033 --> 00:51:23,333
so the fact that they're already
driving it around means...

518
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,833
They're filthy rich.

519
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:33,500
Once we go in, we'll have to
find out why it happened, huh?

520
00:51:33,566 --> 00:51:34,734
It's because of the necklace.

521
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,900
She said it belongs to her
dead friend who stole her body.

522
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:39,734
Her great resentment was
contained in that necklace,

523
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,100
which allowed her to
take over her body.

524
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,967
Why do you think she did that,
if she was her friend?

525
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,534
Don't ask questions.

526
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,400
All we need to do is
return her body, right?

527
00:51:46,466 --> 00:51:48,633
Then that's all we need to do.

528
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:57,166
After her.

529
00:51:58,733 --> 00:51:59,766
Excuse me!

530
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:13,200
Let go of me!

531
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,200
I'm going to kill her.

532
00:52:17,266 --> 00:52:18,634
It's not even your body.

533
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,033
Why do this to your friend?

534
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,500
She's not my friend.

535
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,200
She killed me.

536
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,633
(Jung Su-jung)

537
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:39,467
Give it back.

538
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:41,000
You live on government subsidy.

539
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:43,466
So do you really want to use
that money to buy this?

540
00:52:44,266 --> 00:52:46,500
I mean, do you even have
a conscience?

541
00:52:46,566 --> 00:52:48,800
That money's paid out to you
so you can feed yourself.

542
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,200
You're what they call "tax leeches."

543
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:55,733
Give it back.

544
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,567
Give it back! Give it back!

545
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,000
Take it if you can.

546
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:01,900
- Give it back.
- I'll give it to you.

547
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:02,900
Give it back!

548
00:53:02,966 --> 00:53:03,966
Give it back!

549
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:05,966
Give it back!

550
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,166
Give it back!

551
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,300
Why you…!

552
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:18,266
Let go of me!

553
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:36,100
I don’t remember anything
after I fell.

554
00:53:36,166 --> 00:53:38,066
When I'd come to my senses,

555
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:40,933
I was already inside her body,

556
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:45,133
holding onto
this necklace in my hand.

557
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:52,834
Are you here for Kim Yu-na,
so she can get her body back?

558
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,566
When she killed me?

559
00:54:01,566 --> 00:54:03,234
That's it.

560
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,334
Do something with it
so I can have my body back.

561
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,200
The resentment here…

562
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,134
It's not something
that'll disappear easily.

563
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,234
Talk to my mom and dad.

564
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,600
They'll do anything.

565
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,600
They'll have to.

566
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,966
Because they're the ones
who made you.

567
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,366
What is it that you have to
tell us about our daughter?

568
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:39,633
Your daughter, Yu-na…
murdered someone.

569
00:54:43,466 --> 00:54:44,967
Did you hear that
one of Yu-na's classmates

570
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:48,166
committed suicide
at an overpass near here?

571
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,466
Well apparently,
that's not what happened.

572
00:54:52,266 --> 00:54:54,033
Your daughter killed her.

573
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,533
And this necklace here is proof.

574
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:10,033
What is it that you want from us?

575
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,433
I'm here for a quid pro quo.

576
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:22,267
Do you think it's wrong that
I kill her?

577
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:24,000
Let's think of a way.

578
00:55:24,933 --> 00:55:26,666
What way?

579
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,200
Whatever you do,
I won't come back to life.

580
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:36,833
I wanted to live, too.

581
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:41,734
I tried my best to live,

582
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,233
even if I was called a parasite.

583
00:55:50,966 --> 00:55:52,366
Let go of me!

584
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:55,266
Let go!

585
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,133
I can't just have her
come back in this body

586
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,533
and laugh as if nothing happened.

587
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:08,833
Let go of me.

588
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:22,200
Wait just a minute.

589
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:24,133
I'll go retrieve your necklace.

590
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,266
You just live in that body, alright?

591
00:56:37,866 --> 00:56:39,233
Where's the necklace?

592
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,200
You can't have her return
her body, not just yet!

593
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:45,967
Otherwise, this is just too
unfair for her!

594
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:48,634
I returned the necklace.

595
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,233
It's in her parents' hands, now.

596
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,933
So that's the dead girl's
necklace, is it?

597
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:29,933
She said this is
the only evidence.

598
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,100
You have two options.

599
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:36,900
The first is to take
this necklace,

600
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:39,634
expose your daughter's wrongdoings,
punish her,

601
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,267
and have her apologize to
her dead classmate.

602
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,434
The second is to…

603
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,467
Shut me up,

604
00:57:46,533 --> 00:57:48,366
and destroy this necklace.

605
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:06,500
We'll give you
as much as you want.

606
00:58:07,533 --> 00:58:08,600
So…

607
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,966
…hand this necklace over to us.

608
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,433
So you opted for the second.

609
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:21,500
But you'll have to pay
a hefty price for it.

610
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,767
So everything will go back to
how it should be, huh?

611
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:34,833
Of course.

612
00:58:35,733 --> 00:58:38,267
As long as that necklace is gone,

613
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,700
no one will know that
you killed her.

614
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,966
No one will know, right?

615
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:47,300
I did say that necklace bears
heavy resentment, right?

616
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:49,434
That means once
the necklace is burned,

617
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,433
so will your only chance of
asking for forgiveness.

618
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:56,266
I don't care.

619
00:58:58,466 --> 00:58:59,533
Oh, but you should.

620
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:02,700
Because you can't ever go back.

621
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:03,766
What?

622
00:59:04,533 --> 00:59:08,667
Your soul…

623
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:11,600
…will die, without
anyone ever knowing.

624
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,200
Damnit!

625
00:59:27,766 --> 00:59:29,534
The dead girl's already dead.

626
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,233
But our Yu-na's still alive,
with much to look forward to.

627
00:59:33,066 --> 00:59:34,534
Yes.

628
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,666
This never happened, okay?

629
00:59:37,566 --> 00:59:39,033
But that woman…

630
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:43,100
What do you think
her last words meant?

631
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:46,534
Oh.

632
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,867
But you should know that

633
00:59:47,933 --> 00:59:51,833
the choice you made
will kill your daughter's soul.

634
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,866
No!

635
01:00:01,933 --> 01:00:03,367
No!

636
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,533
What do I do…

637
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:07,600
Mom, please put that fire out.

638
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:09,734
Mom, please!

639
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,000
Please take it out, Mom!

640
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,367
Take it out!

641
01:00:13,433 --> 01:00:15,166
Please, take it out!

642
01:00:40,066 --> 01:00:42,134
Now you live in that body.

643
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,900
Though it means
you're practically a parasite,

644
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:48,600
do your best at
your second chance in life.

645
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:11,400
Now she's a real parasite.

646
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,000
Still,

647
01:01:16,066 --> 01:01:18,266
at least she got
a golden host out of it.

648
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:20,734
They'll have the parasite
suck off them gladly,

649
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,000
who has the shell of
their daughter.

650
01:01:23,066 --> 01:01:24,967
But that girl…

651
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:27,767
She'll have a hard time,
looking at her shell every day.

652
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,467
I pity her.

653
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:32,666
Every action comes at a price.

654
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:39,133
She's just tied down here as
punishment from Old Mago.

655
01:01:41,466 --> 01:01:44,866
Are you perhaps…
also paying your price?

656
01:01:53,766 --> 01:01:55,400
I heard you're being punished.

657
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,066
That's right.

658
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,533
Someone told me that
I'm proud and foolish.

659
01:02:04,566 --> 01:02:06,033
Though I won't admit that.

660
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:10,833
Ah…

661
01:02:11,533 --> 01:02:12,634
What was that?

662
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,967
What was that, "Ah?"

663
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:16,466
Was that to mock me?

664
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,000
It's nothing like that.

665
01:02:18,633 --> 01:02:21,433
It's just that…
sometimes, very rarely,

666
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,066
I feel sorry for you.

667
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:42,167
What the…
(Your car purchase reservation has been canceled)

668
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:44,733
I've been dropped off
the waitlist for my new car.

669
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,300
What kind of
a crappy situation is this?

670
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,300
What the hell?
Are they looking down at me?

671
01:02:53,366 --> 01:02:54,967
They're so dead!

672
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:56,800
Are you looking down at me?

673
01:02:56,866 --> 01:02:58,166
Actually, I don't want to
talk to you.

674
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,767
I want to talk to your manager.

675
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,533
Put your manager on, now!

676
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:10,167
President Jang drinks champagne
by the box when she's mad.

677
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:12,366
General Manager Noh used to
have them ready for her.

678
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:15,834
I didn't know this position entailed

679
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,500
looking after President Jang's
alcohol needs.

680
01:03:17,566 --> 01:03:19,434
You're extremely unfortunate.

681
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,000
None of us knew that
his vacancy would be filled by

682
01:03:22,066 --> 01:03:24,934
someone who was third
on our candidacy list!

683
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,133
Third? What do you mean?

684
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,600
Oops, I was told not to
mention you were third.

685
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,367
You mean I was third on
your list of candidates?

686
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:41,767
- Well…
- So in other words,

687
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:44,600
you had two other
candidates before me.

688
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:46,634
But now that you're here,
you're the final winner.

689
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,633
Well, this is a victory
I'm not too happy about.

690
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,600
I see… Here it is.

691
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,067
What is this?

692
01:03:58,133 --> 01:04:00,067
This means it belongs to
President Jang.

693
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:02,166
Anything that bears this mark
is for President Jang.

694
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,066
It's the moon.

695
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,466
It means it belongs to me.

696
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,500
Follow me.

697
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,300
Ms. Choi.

698
01:04:35,866 --> 01:04:37,734
Do you know what kind of
a person President Jang was

699
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,800
when she was still alive?

700
01:04:39,866 --> 01:04:42,934
And what do you mean
she's tied here under punishment?

701
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,800
You're only passing by here.

702
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,867
Like all the others before you,

703
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:52,200
think of this as only temporary,

704
01:04:52,266 --> 01:04:55,233
and do your best to get out
as soon as possible.

705
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:43,200
Why are you still here,

706
01:05:43,266 --> 01:05:45,300
after all these years?

707
01:06:06,933 --> 01:06:08,100
Is this the tree?

708
01:06:41,266 --> 01:06:42,900
There are no leaves.

709
01:06:47,266 --> 01:06:48,400
What are you doing here?

710
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:58,834
You didn't show me the garden,
so I came to take a look.

711
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,500
Guests aren't allowed here.

712
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:01,800
So there's no need
for you to see it.

713
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,934
Is this the tree?

714
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,134
The tree that my father
laid his hands on.

715
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,700
The reason I was sold off to here.

716
01:07:09,766 --> 01:07:10,967
That's right.

717
01:07:11,033 --> 01:07:13,200
You're paying that price, too.

718
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,867
It didn't have to me though, did it?

719
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:19,533
I heard I was third on
your list of candidates.

720
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:23,600
I really thought it had to be me
or no one else.

721
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:25,167
You even said you liked
everything about me,

722
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:26,600
and that's why I'd made
this big decision.

723
01:07:26,666 --> 01:07:28,500
But I was only a substitute for
your first and second choices.

724
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:31,900
That's right.

725
01:07:32,566 --> 01:07:34,566
We had two others before you.

726
01:07:35,933 --> 01:07:37,400
Are you sure I was
your third choice, even?

727
01:07:37,466 --> 01:07:39,700
And not your fourth or fifth?

728
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:42,200
Who told you that?
That you were the third choice?

729
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:43,467
So there were more before me?

730
01:07:43,533 --> 01:07:46,133
You were the zeroth.

731
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,400
Zeroth, alright?

732
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:51,300
And it's true that
it had to be you, or no-one else.

733
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:53,066
Because I like everything about you.

734
01:07:56,633 --> 01:07:58,166
Do you want a glass, too?

735
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,300
You promised to get me
a good price for the painting,

736
01:08:01,366 --> 01:08:02,800
so this is your reward.

737
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:06,933
Do you think that tiger saw
what it wanted to, inside?

738
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,100
It crossed over without regrets,
so I'm sure it did.

739
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:15,400
He was in that dreamlike moment
he can never return to.

740
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,333
He was pretty lucky.

741
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:24,267
You probably have things
you miss from

742
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,033
those moments that
you can't return to, too.

743
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,433
Well, I think I've seen them.

744
01:08:38,266 --> 01:08:40,534
I said you were in my dreams.

745
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,600
Dream?

746
01:08:42,766 --> 01:08:46,100
You were smiling.
Under a big tree.

747
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:48,534
When someone said
he'll build you a house,

748
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,967
you were being sarcastic
just like you were now,

749
01:08:51,033 --> 01:08:52,566
but still, looked happy.

750
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,400
You were drinking in
the moon-lit wilderness,

751
01:08:59,266 --> 01:09:01,200
and the night was filled
with music,

752
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:03,066
along with your laughter.

753
01:09:10,433 --> 01:09:13,267
You were happy and smiling.

754
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:16,633
Because you weren't alone like now,
but had someone next to you.

755
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,800
The person who taught you
how to write "Man-wol."

756
01:09:22,133 --> 01:09:25,200
Is it him you miss the most

757
01:09:25,266 --> 01:09:26,666
from those years, long ago?

758
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,133
You…

759
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:44,733
You really…

760
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:48,000
…saw him.

761
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:54,900
You've been waiting for him here

762
01:09:54,966 --> 01:09:57,033
for all these years, haven't you?

763
01:11:34,966 --> 01:11:36,866
Why do you…

764
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,400
…see such dreams?

765
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,266
My questions exactly.

766
01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:45,500
Why am I seeing you in my dreams?

767
01:11:45,566 --> 01:11:47,866
I'm scared I might have to
pay a price for that now.

768
01:11:50,566 --> 01:11:51,900
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

769
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,933
Ever since seeing you,

770
01:12:00,033 --> 01:12:01,600
I've been very much…

771
01:12:02,933 --> 01:12:05,033
…thinking about you.

772
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:11,800
Ms. Jang Man-wol,

773
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:18,000
you're eating up
my night and my dreams.

774
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:16,466
(Hotel Del Luna)

775
01:13:17,066 --> 01:13:19,600
A piece of shriveled up memory

776
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:22,400
just resurfaced, because of you.

777
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:23,967
I need to confirm it for myself.

778
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:27,400
Koo Chan-sung, start accepting
spirits from today onward.

779
01:13:28,366 --> 01:13:30,467
She has someone
she desperately wants to see.

780
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:32,200
Like there isn't any spirit
who doesn't have anyone like that!

781
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:35,334
I hear the owner there is
really something, huh?

782
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:35,967
Is that so?

783
01:13:36,033 --> 01:13:37,534
Life started budding
from this tree,

784
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,066
so I thought I'd look after it.

785
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:40,933
I'm sorry.

786
01:13:41,466 --> 01:13:42,767
Koo Chan-sung,

787
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,600
come to our hotel once you die.
