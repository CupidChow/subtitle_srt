(Episode 13)

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,066
Aw, are you tired?

9
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,000
- Chatting with the intern?
- Yes.

10
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:06,034
Yu-na says she needs to
do her homework,

11
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,466
but she's falling asleep
so I was just waking her up.

12
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,066
Hyun-joong.

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,500
Does Yu-na know that
you'll depart with your sister

14
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:20,733
once she's here?

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,167
She... doesn't know yet.

16
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:27,633
I only told her that
I'm waiting for her.

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,666
Is that so?

18
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,033
- Welcome.
- Welcome, sir.

19
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:49,767
Do you remember how long
it has been since your death?

20
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,267
I'm not too sure, but…

21
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,667
About two days?

22
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,433
- Then…
- Sir.

23
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,833
Let me show you the way.

24
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:01,166
This way.

25
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,534
Sir,

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,667
you are Mr. Yoon Seung-beom,

27
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,267
the last grandson of
the Myungju Yoon family

28
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,567
who are based in Beomcheon City.
Am I correct?

29
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,500
You're 42 years old?

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,300
Yes, that's right.

31
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,700
And I take it that
you're still single?

32
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,666
Yes.

33
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,366
I never got married.

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,166
I see.

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,334
Your family must be devastated,
seeing their only grandson off

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,466
before he was able to
produce an heir.

37
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,066
Ms. Choi?

38
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,267
I thought you were
President Jang for a second.

39
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,634
What are you doing,
dressed like that?

40
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,234
Mr. Kim. I may be able to
depart very soon.

41
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,300
I'm on my way to satisfy
my long grudge of 200 years.

42
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,100
Does that mean…?

43
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,266
He died.

44
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,567
Their last remaining son has died,
and has arrived here as a guest.

45
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:26,833
Finally!

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,400
The day has finally arrived when
that cursed family will die out.

47
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:36,133
I'm off to the funeral hall,
to witness with my own eyes,

48
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,366
blood running down from
the eyes of the Myungju Yoon family!

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,467
Ms. Choi.

50
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:46,534
You mustn't repeat what happened
42 years ago.

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,434
Back then, I'd rushed over
in anger and frustration,

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,766
but now, I'm doing so
in exhilaration.

53
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,600
Sanchez is still at
the restaurant.

54
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,467
So… All I have to do is,

55
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,733
go to Sanchez and
tell him I'm sorry, right?

56
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,266
Ugh… I can do this so much better
with a glass of liquor.

57
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:19,066
This is soda water,

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,300
so think of it as champagne.

59
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,967
This is pretty strong stuff.

60
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,167
Don't you have soju?

61
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:34,000
Add some soju to this for me.
I want to try it out.

62
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:37,734
If you like it, then from now on,
drink this instead of champagne.

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Taking champagne and
caviar away from me is like

64
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,534
taking away Tabasco sauce and
pickles from your pizza delivery.

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,567
Tsk.

66
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:47,100
Mentioning pizza has now got me
worried about Sanchez.

67
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,200
Fine, alright. Let's go shopping.

68
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,434
The department store's
going to close soon.

69
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
How did you reach that conclusion?

70
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:54,600
You told me to apologize.

71
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,034
I could turn up empty-handed
and say, 'Sorry Sanchez,'

72
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,100
or get him something nice
and say, 'Sorry, Sanchez.'

73
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,800
There's a big difference there,
don't you think?

74
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,366
You just want to go shopping,
that's what this is about.

75
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,334
All you need to tell Sanchez is
Veronica went in peace,

76
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,634
and that you saw her off
at the bridge at the Styx.

77
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,400
The bridge at the Styx?

78
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,533
How can I see her off there
when I've never been there myself?

79
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,600
You've never been to the bridge?

80
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,234
If I had, do you think
I'd still be there?

81
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,500
Once you step foot on that bridge,

82
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,767
you can never go back.

83
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,534
So I guess you could tell
Sanchez that

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,634
his girlfriend is probably crossing
that bridge right now.

85
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,434
She's still crossing it?

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,333
Is that bridge that long?

87
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:48,767
The current of time there is
different to where we are now.

88
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,200
To cross that bridge and reach
the underworld,

89
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:54,700
it takes a minimum of 49 days,
our time.

90
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,500
And as you're crossing
that bridge,

91
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,967
your memories from this life
fade away little by little.

92
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:03,234
It's not that spirits don't return
because something's stopping them.

93
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,100
But it's because that their memories
have all faded, that they don't.

94
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:14,000
Sanchez's girlfriend, too, is
probably crossing the bridge

95
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:17,266
right now, erasing her memories of
Sanchez with each step.

96
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,666
That's a bitter story for
those who are left behind.

97
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,066
Koo Chan-sung.

98
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,300
Let me promise you one thing.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,134
I've been here 1,300 years.

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,467
If I ever cross that bridge,

101
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,766
many things would fade
from my memories,

102
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,366
but I'll hold onto
my memories of you to the end.

103
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:57,833
Though I can't quite guarantee it
by the time I'm on the other side,

104
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,633
but until I take my last step,

105
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
I'll remember you.

106
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,400
Alright.

107
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:28,100
I'm sure you can, because
you've lasted 1,300 years.

108
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,433
I'll trust you.

109
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:38,633
But what will you remember me by?

110
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,100
Well… All those times
you worried about me,

111
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,333
in case I reincarnate as
an animal in my next life.

112
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,800
Or about how you sold off
all my cars, wouldn't let me

113
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,333
buy a yacht, and
confiscated my credit cards.

114
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,533
And your suggestion that I switch
from champagne to soda water.

115
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:59,834
Goodness, now that I look back
it's just all been so crappy.

116
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,700
I sure have done many things
for you, haven't I?

117
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:05,667
But most of all, I won't ever
forget your arrogance.

118
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,700
In fact, at the very last moment,
instead of your name,

119
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,766
Koo Chan-sung,
"Harvard" is what I may remember!

120
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,433
Hey, this is mine.

121
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,167
Yes.

122
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,767
I know it's your favorite fragrance
so I tried to re-order it,

123
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,400
but the store had shut down.

124
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,400
So I brought it with me to
look elsewhere.

125
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:29,066
I thought you'd stolen
from our hotel.

126
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,734
I might have, yes.

127
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,500
Take a look around and see if
I've taken anything else.

128
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,633
Did you really take something
that's mine?

129
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,666
Take a good look around to see
if there's anything that's yours.

130
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,766
Here it is, right here. Yours.

131
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,234
This is called "imprinting."

132
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,967
I don't mind being remembered
as a crappy general manager

133
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,334
or an arrogant Harvard graduate,

134
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,734
but do include in that list,

135
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,100
this man who's smiling
at you right now.

136
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,166
Alright.

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,300
Remember these moments.

138
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,800
It looks like Sanchez may be late,

139
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:44,366
so let's go to him instead.

140
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,533
It's Hyun-joong.

141
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,834
Ms. Choi looked a bit weird

142
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,100
ever since a male guest
stepped into our lobby,

143
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,634
and it turns out this male guest is
the last surviving son of

144
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,300
the family she holds
a deep grudge against!

145
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,067
And she's at that
man's funeral right now?

146
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,167
Yes.

147
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:21,700
Mr. Kim's extremely worried, too.

148
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:23,467
President Jang.

149
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,467
You don't suppose what happened
42 years ago

150
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:26,700
will happen again, right?

151
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,567
Why? What happened 42 years ago?

152
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,467
Ms. Choi Seo-hee stepped out,

153
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:39,266
and almost became an evil spirit
before perishing.

154
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,734
Are we talking about that
calm and collected Ms. Choi?

155
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,100
Ms. Choi's biggest grief and
sorrow is her daughter,

156
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,400
and that family dug up her grave.

157
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,700
This is the spot,

158
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:56,734
where the girl who died on
the 25th of this month was buried.

159
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,834
And it's because of
where this grave lies that

160
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,167
misfortune will befall on
your descendants.

161
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:00,834
You must dig this up,

162
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,234
for your unborn grandchild to

163
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,834
come in to this world safely.

164
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,300
But I was told you should never
dig up old graves of children.

165
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:12,300
Our family will be discontinued
at this rate.

166
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:13,766
Dig it up!

167
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,700
Don't…

168
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:37,833
Don't touch my child's grave!

169
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:45,334
Ye descendents of the Yoon family…

170
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,666
Die, all of you!

171
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,634
I will see that your family is
no more!

172
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,833
Die!

173
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:10,500
If Old Mago had been there
a step before the Grim Reaper,

174
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:12,633
Ms. Choi would've perished.

175
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,667
She also owes it to President Jang
talking it out with the Grim Reaper

176
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:20,134
for being allowed to stay here
and work a little longer,

177
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,233
without being dragged to
the underworld.

178
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,534
In return, you offered 10 months' of
flowers from the garden, right?

179
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,834
12 months.

180
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,267
That's right. This was also when
all the flowers withered,

181
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,000
and the general manager before
Ms. Hwang blew all of

182
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:35,367
President Jang's money away.

183
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,600
It was our worst of times.

184
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,767
You know, when I think about
how President Jang would go to

185
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,733
the mountains with her hoe,
scouring for food…

186
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,334
Hey!

187
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,567
- Don't think about it.
- Yes, ma'am.

188
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,634
So you're saying that
this grandson born 42 years ago,

189
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,600
has now died without
producing a child.

190
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,300
Nothing should happen
even if she does see this family

191
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:58,634
at the funeral, right?

192
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,834
She'll see her 200-year-old wish
come true right there,

193
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,700
so like she'll do anything.

194
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:07,733
Then… That means Ms. Choi
will be leaving us soon.

195
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:52,234
Are you done?

196
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,334
This family is now over.

197
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,166
I am ready to leave,
without regrets.

198
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600
You came.

199
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:18,100
He is this child's father,
after all.

200
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,500
I thought we should at least
bid our last goodbyes.

201
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,166
Didn't you say he was single?

202
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:33,600
It looks like
he left behind an heir.

203
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:37,800
If the child she's carrying is
a boy,

204
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,800
then the Myungju Yoon family…

205
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,433
…will continue on.

206
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
I'm sorry to vacate my position

207
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,200
without informing you first.

208
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,634
What happened?

209
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,766
They still have an heir.

210
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:24,400
Ms. Choi…

211
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,500
Is anyone there?

212
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,134
My child is dying… please!

213
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,300
Please open the door…

214
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,800
Please, open the door!

215
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,067
The door…

216
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,500
Please open the door…

217
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:12,400
No physician will open
his doors for you.

218
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,100
You must not let that child live.

219
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,766
My baby…

220
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,066
Please, save my baby!

221
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:50,334
I just checked again
with Mr. Yoon,

222
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,500
and he said he'd fathered
a child to his lover

223
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:55,200
whom he had to let go of due to
opposition from his parents.

224
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:57,466
That's why he couldn't depart for
the underworld right away.

225
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:01,500
Ms. Choi must be
very disappointed.

226
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,434
Our guest's story is
quite pitiful,

227
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,234
but none can compare to
our very own Ms. Choi's,

228
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,233
who's been tied here for 200 years
after losing her child.

229
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,666
I know the flowers are withering.

230
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,300
Is there no way to stop them?

231
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,100
It's Ms. Choi who's more anxious
than any one of us.

232
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:35,866
I was very worried about you.

233
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,766
In case I hurt anyone?

234
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,066
In case you got hurt, Ms. Choi.

235
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,133
That's not something
you should worry about, Mr. Koo.

236
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,566
What is this peculiar outfit?

237
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,200
It's a leopard-print.

238
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,867
Where did you even find
a suit like that?

239
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:05,634
I got it as a gift,
so I thought I should try it.

240
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,766
How do I look?

241
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,334
You look funny.

242
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
What's with that?

243
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:12,566
Take it off, quick!

244
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,267
But I was told this is
a designer brand.

245
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,734
What if it is? It just screams,
'Roar, Serengeti!'

246
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,667
Is it that weird?
I can't wear this out, then.

247
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:25,833
Of course not! All our
dead guests will be laughing.

248
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,367
Should I wear this suit
when I see our guests off?

249
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:30,633
So they can go, laughing?

250
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,400
Mr. Koo, we have class!

251
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:40,034
That's right. Has our guest from
room 403 checked out already?

252
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,834
I should really see him off.

253
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,100
Now that you mention it,
he'd been wanting to see you.

254
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,133
Why don't we go down to
the bus stop together?

255
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:50,300
You're seriously not going to
wear that, are you?

256
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,800
Let's go, Ms. Choi.

257
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:57,100
Get away from me.

258
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,534
It looks like Mr. Koo
decided to play the clown

259
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,500
so he would melt away
Ms. Choi's frozen heart.

260
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:07,467
He told me he'd never wear it,

261
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,600
but that's how
he'll play that card, huh?

262
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,734
President Jang.

263
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,500
I asked why things didn't work out
between Koo and that

264
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:17,266
President's daughter, and it seems
he already has another in his heart.

265
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:21,866
The woman who's claimed his heart
must be truly happy.

266
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:24,233
Yes, I'm very happy.

267
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,866
Why would you be happy?

268
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,234
Now that you know,
don't be a crane.

269
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,000
You hate it when I call you
bird-head, so hence the crane.

270
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,134
Anyway, don't be a crane!

271
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,967
This may sound like
a crane-like question,

272
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:43,233
then you also feel…?

273
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,233
You asked me whether it's possible
to stop the flowers from wilting.

274
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,100
Well, it seems like it isn't.

275
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:53,566
Is it because I feel
that much for him?

276
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:57,100
I just can't stop.

277
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,466
I should apologize to you, too.

278
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:05,600
Leaves raining down on love…

279
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,633
Should I serve you
a glass of Tears, then?

280
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,200
No, anything but that.

281
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,466
That cocktail's horrible.

282
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,334
She's always been so rude,

283
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,266
so how on earth did she change?

284
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,366
Koo Chan-sung!

285
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:43,267
Oh what? Why did you
get changed already?

286
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,333
I wanted to take a picture to
commemorate this.

287
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:50,200
Thanks for the suit,
it was a pleasure wearing it.

288
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,634
But I don't want to
leave behind a picture.

289
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,767
Why not? I just loved it!

290
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,167
Next time, I'll have you in…

291
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,534
…a zebra one next time!

292
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,567
Whatever you wish.

293
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,834
Whether it's tiger or zebra,
bring it on.

294
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,100
You were awesome.

295
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,334
That tiger standing in front of
Ms. Choi back then,

296
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,366
was finer than the tiger
on Mt. Paektu.

297
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,866
I always knew you're
an excellent hotelier.

298
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,634
I'd been forgetting,

299
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,900
that Ms. Choi too,
is a guest at this hotel

300
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:26,666
who needs to be comforted
before she departs.

301
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:32,800
She is our long guest,
with a deep grudge.

302
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:39,467
Could her deep grudge and wish to
see that family's line discontinue

303
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,233
become a curse?

304
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,666
Because things have turned out
just as she wished for that family.

305
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,634
I told you that everything
comes at a price, right?

306
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,667
For driving Ms. Choi to
harbor such a deep grudge,

307
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:57,234
they have invited misfortune
upon themselves.

308
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,866
Even when 200 years has
passed already?

309
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,000
Does time hold any significance
for the dead?

310
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:06,234
While harboring that grudge,

311
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,767
200 years could pass by,

312
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,200
or 500 years…

313
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,833
Or even, 1,000 years.

314
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:55,534
But waiting for all those years,
bound by the uncertainty of

315
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,766
not knowing when you'll be
able to finally let it go, is…

316
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,233
…perhaps a curse itself.

317
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,233
Even now,

318
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,300
are you waiting for him to come?

319
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:13,700
Koo Chan-sung.

320
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,766
When he does come,

321
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:21,233
will you be a tiger for me,

322
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:24,500
just like you were for Ms. Choi?

323
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,767
I told you to trust me.

324
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,366
Anything for you.

325
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,100
Because I'm yours.

326
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,133
Right.

327
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:43,800
Then let's wear that,

328
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:46,566
and go for galbi soup,
which is the tiger's favorite!

329
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,634
But isn't the tiger's favorite,
red bean congee?

330
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,667
Says who?

331
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:52,034
Says you. You said the tigers like
red bean congee.

332
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,334
Please… why would tigers like
red bean congee?

333
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,600
What, are they vegetarian?

334
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:59,200
Tigers should at least
feast on cows.

335
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:02,100
Alright, let's go for galbi soup!

336
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:09,300
Here, let's put it on.

337
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,600
No.

338
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:14,567
Hey, if you don't wear this,

339
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,200
I'm going to strip you naked!

340
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,566
Whatever, do as you wish.

341
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,233
But will you be able to handle it?

342
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,733
Because I think no.

343
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,767
Let's have galbi soup tomorrow.

344
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:38,866
Right now, I should go home
and check on Sanchez.

345
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,833
What are you doing?

346
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,200
Not telling you!

347
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:58,134
Flowers wilting on love…

348
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,800
But there are plenty of flowers
that are still in bloom.

349
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,900
It took over a thousand years for
them to blossom,

350
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,666
so they can't possibly
wilt that rapidly.

351
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,700
Whoa, a firefly!

352
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,066
I've spotted it quite often
ever since the tree transformed.

353
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:19,000
See? The flowers have even
attracted fireflies!

354
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:21,666
But… can something like that
even come in here?

355
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:23,634
Who knows…

356
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,066
But since we're inside the hotel,
it can't possibly be alive.

357
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:30,166
Is that what Mr. Koo
had been talking about?

358
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,100
Hmmm?

359
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:34,334
He asked me,

360
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,133
about whether there are spirits
that glow like the firefly's light.

361
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,234
But why's there just one?

362
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,733
It's so lonely.

363
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:18,100
For all those years,
he remained by her side

364
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:21,600
without even being able to
reveal his existence…

365
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,466
But it looks like
he'll finally be noticed.

366
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,834
Now that the flowers have bloomed,

367
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,866
I wonder if his story
will be heard, too.

368
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,066
Gosh!

369
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,734
When hearts get tangled up,

370
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,100
it becomes so hard to
untangle them again.

371
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,766
This time, I'm going to knit them
together very well!

372
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,534
Ohhh, after eating that galbi soup
until my stomach burst,

373
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,167
I'm having heartburns.

374
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,666
That's just your excuse to
come and see that woman.

375
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,167
The child she's carrying…

376
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:10,800
It's the child of the family
Ms. Choi's cursing, isn't it?

377
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:11,834
That's right.

378
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,067
The bloodline of the family
that continues to persist,

379
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:17,266
and disappoint Ms. Choi.

380
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
If it weren't for that child,

381
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,333
Ms. Choi would be liberated
from her long grudge.

382
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:29,233
Do you really think so?

383
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,866
Do you really think everything
will be solved, without that child?

384
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,700
Then shall I get rid of that child,
right here, right now?

385
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:46,466
It seems like the child's not
doing that well, anyway.

386
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,266
Are you alright?

387
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,034
I just had a cramp…

388
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,700
Please be careful.
Let me help you.

389
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
I told him that child is
Ms. Choi's enemy, but…

390
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,733
Ugh, he just doesn't listen.

391
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,466
What's this?

392
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:26,900
Nice car. I'd been wanting to
buy this model.

393
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,067
But what if the car's nice?

394
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:30,434
Don't park shit like this!

395
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,333
- What are you…
- Sorry!

396
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:36,200
Isn't that Old Mago, too?

397
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:38,000
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

398
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:39,600
Sis!

399
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,334
Man-wol!

400
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,867
Oh my gosh, how long has it been?

401
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,267
Sis, you used to come by often
when Moon-sook was around,

402
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:48,167
but why not so much these days?

403
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:51,067
Ever since you stopped coming,
we stopped seeing money piling up.

404
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:52,567
So drop by more often, alright?

405
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:54,634
Gosh, where are you poking me?

406
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,134
I'm a bit busy these days,
you see.

407
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,534
Even now, I'm on my way to
an opening.

408
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
I don't know who
the lucky owners are,

409
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,767
but their business will be booming
thanks to you inviting in money.

410
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:07,067
A bunch of young people
have just started

411
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,167
a computer business
at a tiny office in here.

412
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:10,467
A computer business?

413
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:12,567
Yes, a computer business!

414
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:15,734
They're working so hard,
so I'm cheering for them.

415
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,533
Gosh, I envy them…

416
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:21,334
So, who…

417
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,333
- Oh, your new general manager?
- Yes.

418
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:26,633
Nice to meet you.

419
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:30,500
Hurry up and take her hand,
money will rush in.

420
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,666
I'm Koo Chan-sung.

421
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,866
Gosh, so firm…

422
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:41,866
Well, it looks like this pleasant
man will be seeing me often.

423
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,500
Ah, be good to your guests.

424
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:49,433
Especially your first one.

425
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,067
My first guest?

426
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,466
Yes, your first guests are
always very important.

427
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:59,466
That's why I'm going there to cheer
for them, as their first guest!

428
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,734
Then… Man-wol,

429
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,066
see you!

430
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:07,134
Take care.

431
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,133
Thanks to you,
I had a lot of champagne.

432
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:11,067
Sure, sure.

433
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:14,733
By the way,
you've gotten so beautiful!

434
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:23,567
You're going to be rich.

435
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,767
The God of Money shook your hand
and even gave you compliments.

436
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,100
If it's the God of Money,

437
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,967
it's not Old Mago
but your friend, is it?

438
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:29,867
Of course!

439
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,034
If you're handsome,
you're always an oppa,

440
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,433
and if you're rich,
you're always my sister.

441
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,633
Then you should start
calling me oppa.

442
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:40,634
Fine,
since you're going to be rich,

443
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,234
I'll call you Sis.

444
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,766
Let's go, Sis!

445
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:53,233
First guest?

446
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,067
Is there a guest at our hotel
whom our staff and

447
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:02,567
even President Jang, isn't
aware of?

448
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,800
Even those who do not
make their presence known

449
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:06,367
have a reason for their presence.

450
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:09,500
My answer is to let this
existence be,

451
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:11,333
in the form they wish to exist.

452
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,233
Why not
just tell me you don't know?

453
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,266
Then… do you know where that
serial killer spirit is right now?

454
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,800
It's not an easy task,
locating an evil spirit.

455
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:23,634
So you don't know the
answer to that, either.

456
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,267
Seven of our guests
who were his victims are

457
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,500
refusing to board the bus,
before you bring him in.

458
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,900
If I end up taking much time…

459
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:41,167
Tell them they will be upgraded to
limousines, from buses.

460
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,733
You're implying that
it'll take some time.

461
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:46,800
Evil spirits…

462
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:49,400
Hide in darkness.

463
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:05,067
If there is darkness that isn't
a shade created by light,

464
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:06,800
that's where they linger.

465
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:13,567
Don't be late for the movie.

466
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:15,034
If you're going to be late again,
just don't come.

467
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,266
Let's end it here, alright?

468
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,467
If you ever felt a stare from
between a deep, dark crevice…

469
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,800
That's what they are.

470
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:21,600
Hello Sanchez.

471
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,333
(Veronica)

472
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:15,233
I almost had him.

473
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,167
He won't approach Koo Chan-sung
because you're with him,

474
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:22,466
so instead he's been targeting
those around him.

475
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:26,034
I will have him soon,
but just in case…

476
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,433
Tell him to take precaution.

477
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:29,767
Mr. Kim.

478
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:32,000
Yu-na's been with Hyun-joong
all the time, hasn't she?

479
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:33,600
They're together right now,
even this minute.

480
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,700
My dearest.

481
00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:42,767
My dearest…

482
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,333
- That's right.
- Yes.

483
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,167
Good work, huh?

484
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:48,200
- Yes, good work.
- Right?

485
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:57,633
Geez, you scared me!

486
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,733
Man-wol.

487
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:02,767
I heard you got hurt.

488
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:03,966
Here's some medication.

489
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,433
Thanks.

490
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,100
How did you know I got hurt?

491
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,167
I didn't even call Chan-sung.

492
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:12,434
I have my own sources.

493
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,533
Who?

494
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,534
The Grim Reaper.

495
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,666
Oh.

496
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:21,500
So you have connections with
those existences, too.

497
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:25,334
Who knew I'd befriended
such a magnate.

498
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,133
Light this up in your house.

499
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,100
Make sure it's lit up bright,
and don't go anywhere dark.

500
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:35,633
How I got hurt wasn't an accident
or due to bad luck, was it?

501
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,634
Right…

502
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,534
I even went to your hotel,
so there's nothing I can't believe.

503
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,133
I'll do as you say.

504
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,400
Thanks.

505
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:51,266
And I'm sorry.

506
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
For being cynical back then,
instead of being nice.

507
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,600
I never thought that…

508
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:03,467
That pizza would actually
reach Veronica, anyway.

509
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,866
It's just that I wanted to believe
it's possible.

510
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:17,333
Sanchez, you're Chan-sung's
best friend, right?

511
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,333
Later…

512
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:26,034
Later, when Chan-sung has to

513
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,433
experience the same sadness
that you did…

514
00:37:29,266 --> 00:37:31,333
You comfort him for me, Sanchez.

515
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,833
I better get going, then.
We have a lot of guests.

516
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:44,567
Burn all those incenses too,
in every room.

517
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:46,667
In every room?

518
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:49,133
Then I should tell Mi-ra to
burn one in her room, too.

519
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:54,533
There was that woman too, yes.

520
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,600
Sanchez.

521
00:37:56,666 --> 00:38:00,600
Do that dead guy, Seol Ji-won,
and Lee Mi-ra know each other?

522
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:03,433
Yeah, they knew each other
from the States. Why?

523
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,200
Where is she right now?

524
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:08,534
Mi-ra has a boyfriend.

525
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,400
She went to the movie theater to
go see a movie with him.

526
00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:12,633
The movie theater?

527
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:16,067
Mi-ra and Chan-sung are
just friends now.

528
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:17,800
Mi-ra's new boyfriend is
really handsome, too.

529
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:19,700
Do you want to see his picture?
Wait right here.

530
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:30,366
Movie theater…
That's going to be pretty dark.

531
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:34,100
Should I care?

532
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,266
Man-wol, take a look at…

533
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:43,466
She left already.

534
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:46,166
So she doesn't just
walk around, does she?

535
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:50,267
Anyway, if Mi-ra
didn't get a boyfriend,

536
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,333
she would've had to
watch out for Man-wol.

537
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,900
Ah, Young-soo.
When will you be here?

538
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:01,633
The movie's about to start.

539
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,100
Do you have to keep
giving me these excuses?

540
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,700
Oh alright, hurry up.

541
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:17,333
Looks like I won't have to
dirty my own hands.

542
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,267
What are you doing?

543
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:34,600
Were you out somewhere?

544
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:36,833
Hmmm?

545
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,700
Oh, yes. To apologize to Sanchez.

546
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:42,700
You went by yourself?
You should've taken me with you.

547
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:44,466
I wanted to
get it over and done with.

548
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,234
You've become a better person.

549
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,300
Not really.

550
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,900
Thank you, for even
minding my friends now.

551
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:53,366
You've really become
a better person.

552
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,867
Koo Chan-sung.

553
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,700
You may have made me sprout leaves,
bloom flowers, and

554
00:39:57,766 --> 00:39:59,634
changed many things about me,

555
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,667
but you can't change
who I am, fundamentally.

556
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,234
So don’t even get your hopes up.

557
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,400
Must I bother you again, then?

558
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:07,600
No!

559
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:09,834
I didn't do anything.

560
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,034
I'm not lying.

561
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,133
So even if something does happen,
it's not because of me.

562
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,834
We have a lot of guests today
so I'm quite busy.

563
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,800
But I'll drop by
before I get off work.

564
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:21,133
See you later.

565
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,233
Damnit!

566
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:01,766
Ji-seon!

567
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:16,767
Sir, you'd left the hotel.

568
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:18,400
If you ever leave the hotel
without informing us beforehand…

569
00:41:18,466 --> 00:41:19,533
Please help me.

570
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,934
I hear this hotel has
a living general manager

571
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,834
who helps with the affairs
in this world.

572
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,134
What is it, sir?

573
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,434
My girlfriend's not well,
but there's no one to help her.

574
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,200
If we let her be,
my child will be in danger, too!

575
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,767
Sir, please go back to your room.

576
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:42,233
I'll go find Mr. Koo and help you.

577
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,400
Thank you.

578
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:08,534
I'm not going to call for Mr. Koo.

579
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,733
I'm going to let
the last of their children die.

580
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:16,200
Whatever your decision is,
I won't stop you.

581
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:20,534
Now it's all finally
going to be over.

582
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,134
Why not watch with your own eyes,

583
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,800
the last of their family die out?

584
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,534
I know where.

585
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,767
All you have to do is go
and watch.

586
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,566
You don't even need
to do anything.

587
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,867
Someone told me, you see.

588
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:48,233
That watching it won't
liberate you.

589
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:55,867
So will you prove to me,

590
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:58,500
that he's wrong?

591
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,266
My baby…

592
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,266
My baby…

593
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,266
Sweetie.

594
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,233
Sweetie!

595
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:50,233
My baby…

596
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,233
My baby…

597
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,233
Please go tell Mr. Koo.

598
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,400
That this woman is in danger.

599
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:50,034
Ms. Choi,

600
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,467
we were able to get her to
the hospital in time.

601
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:57,433
Both the mother and
her baby are safe.

602
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,400
I married the eldest son of
a prestigious family,

603
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:18,233
but remained childless
until very late.

604
00:45:20,966 --> 00:45:23,566
And when I was finally blessed
with a child in my later years,

605
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,633
I gave birth to a daughter.

606
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:45,466
No!

607
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:52,034
My husband had to see son to
continue the family line

608
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,466
by taking in another woman, and…

609
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,367
Leaving my baby girl behind,

610
00:45:58,433 --> 00:46:01,700
I had to go to
a temple to pray that…

611
00:46:01,766 --> 00:46:05,800
His unborn child is a boy.

612
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:08,533
However…

613
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,734
If you wish for this child to
be born a son,

614
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,867
you must get rid of your daughter.

615
00:46:15,933 --> 00:46:18,734
Your daughter is
preventing all male forces

616
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,600
from entering your household.

617
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:24,367
So with a girl like that
in your house,

618
00:46:24,433 --> 00:46:27,666
you will never expect to see
a son.

619
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:35,667
My baby was…

620
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:39,200
denied even
a drop of water for days,

621
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:42,700
and had no one
changing her diapers.

622
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:47,234
By the time I had heard the news
and run home,

623
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,833
my daughter was dying.

624
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,534
Please, open the door!

625
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,400
My daughter is dying.

626
00:46:55,466 --> 00:46:56,866
Is there no one there?

627
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,300
Please, open the door!

628
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:04,800
No physician will open
his doors for you.

629
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:06,733
You must not let that child live.

630
00:47:09,466 --> 00:47:10,866
My daughter…

631
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:14,334
My daughter died,

632
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,566
but I was powerless to do anything

633
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:20,700
and in the end, I just lost it all.

634
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:25,433
The family of Yoon will die out!

635
00:47:26,366 --> 00:47:30,400
That poor missus,
she was so refined…

636
00:47:30,466 --> 00:47:34,100
The Yoon family is
so heartless and cruel.

637
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:36,500
How could they drive
someone to that state?

638
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:47,334
No… what do you think
you're doing?

639
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,700
Get your hands off her!

640
00:47:48,766 --> 00:47:51,300
Get your hands off
from my daughter!

641
00:47:51,366 --> 00:47:54,067
Get your hands off!

642
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,633
Not my daughter…

643
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,366
The family of Yoon will die out.

644
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:16,900
Even after I die,

645
00:48:16,966 --> 00:48:19,500
I will watch it happen,
with my own eyes.

646
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,866
With my own eyes…

647
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,266
I wrote my determination in blood,

648
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:52,566
yet I failed
to watch that child go…

649
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,466
…to the very end.

650
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,200
As long as the child's gone,
will it solve everything?

651
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,533
Do you really think that way?

652
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,300
(My Young-soo)

653
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,266
I'm going to be a little late.
You go ahead first.

654
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:31,233
(Power off)

655
00:51:03,633 --> 00:51:04,866
You were right.

656
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:11,066
I was wrong,
so I'll tell you something.

657
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:13,666
Your friend…

658
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:18,800
Lee Mi-ra… She may be in danger.

659
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,334
The number you are trying to reach…

660
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,867
Her phone's turned off.

661
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:29,734
If it's the nearest cinema,
it should be this one.

662
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,267
No need to make
such a fuss about it.

663
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:35,334
That evil spirit doesn't yet have
the power to kill anyone.

664
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,434
At the worst, she'll suffer
a tear or a burn.

665
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,867
You didn't tell me because
you wanted to see

666
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:42,300
Mi-ra get hurt, didn't you?

667
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,666
Why did you change your mind?

668
00:51:48,766 --> 00:51:50,300
Did you feel
your fundamentals shifting

669
00:51:50,366 --> 00:51:52,567
after watching Ms. Choi?

670
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:55,333
Yes, that's right!
I really did feel a pang!

671
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,100
Chan-sung.

672
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,300
Mi-ra.

673
00:52:00,366 --> 00:52:02,200
Oh what? Are you two here
to see a movie?

674
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:03,767
What about you?

675
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:05,866
She's sure lucky.

676
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,467
I've been stood up.

677
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,534
I was in there alone, but got
so angry so I just got up.

678
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,467
I guess he didn't come here.
Thank goodness.

679
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:16,567
What do you mean, thank goodness?

680
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,567
I was so mad after
my boyfriend stood me up,

681
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:20,467
and suddenly, this pervert
came up to me from behind

682
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:22,366
and whispered hello!

683
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,266
He must've been here, alright.

684
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,866
What about Young-soo?
Are you sure he didn't come?

685
00:53:33,466 --> 00:53:35,466
Hello, Koo Chan-sung.

686
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:43,400
Looking for me?

687
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,733
Now this is fun.

688
00:53:49,766 --> 00:53:51,233
Keep looking, then.

689
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:09,200
Yeon-woo…

690
00:54:09,266 --> 00:54:10,466
Young-soo!

691
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,467
Young-soo, are you alright?

692
00:54:15,533 --> 00:54:17,800
Get up, quick! Young-soo…

693
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:21,400
Young-soo…

694
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:24,600
Are you alright?

695
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,800
Young-soo, are you alright?

696
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:33,034
I'm alright.

697
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,467
I work out regularly,
so I'm perfectly fine.

698
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:38,700
You didn't break anything,
so that's a relief.

699
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:41,500
Thanks to you, I had a great rest.
I'll get going, then.

700
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:43,433
No!

701
00:54:44,466 --> 00:54:47,333
You can rest here a little longer.
Make yourself comfortable.

702
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:49,734
But this is Chan-sung's house.

703
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,400
This is the cleanest room
in our place.

704
00:54:52,466 --> 00:54:54,334
Mi-ra, this isn't "our" place.

705
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,234
And it's more that
your room is messy, Mi-ra.

706
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,467
Young-soo, are your teeth alright?

707
00:54:58,533 --> 00:55:01,300
What about your tongue?
You didn't bite on your tongue?

708
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,733
I'm fine, Mi-ra.

709
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:06,300
Sanchez, go and get us
more iced water.

710
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,266
Sure.

711
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:14,233
Oh, uh…

712
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,800
Should I have a look?

713
00:55:18,866 --> 00:55:20,667
- Let's see.
- I'm fine!

714
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:22,567
Let's see your back.

715
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:24,400
What is it?

716
00:55:24,466 --> 00:55:25,867
That's where it hurts the most.

717
00:55:25,933 --> 00:55:28,233
- Really? Then other side.
- There, too.

718
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:42,167
How is it that Yeon-woo and
Song-hwa are together?

719
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:43,934
It's not Yeon-woo,
but Park Young-soo,

720
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,833
and not Song-hwa, but Lee Mi-ra.

721
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,900
They're lovers now,

722
00:55:49,966 --> 00:55:52,166
and it was through Mi-ra
that I met Yeon-woo.

723
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,534
I didn't tell you,

724
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,566
in case
it complicated things for you.

725
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,467
After all, one's someone you hated,

726
00:56:04,533 --> 00:56:06,266
and the other, whom you loved.

727
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,734
She may represent
an old grudge you bear,

728
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,500
but to her,

729
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:24,533
you are just a past encounter
she doesn't even remember.

730
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,766
So just let her pass you by.

731
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,200
Is it… still difficult for you?

732
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,934
The person you held
your deepest affection for and

733
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,233
the person you held your biggest
hatred for are now lovers

734
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:19,434
and your grudge won't be satisfied,

735
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,333
even if you were to kill someone
you were desperate to kill.

736
00:57:24,866 --> 00:57:26,466
Back then…

737
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:30,200
Did you not end up
killing him, in the end?

738
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,633
He died.

739
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:39,200
He died that night.

740
00:58:50,266 --> 00:58:51,833
Sister, you lived.

741
00:58:54,233 --> 00:58:55,633
I survived.

742
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,700
To keep my word to
come and kill you.

743
00:59:02,933 --> 00:59:04,366
Good on you,

744
00:59:05,733 --> 00:59:07,100
Man-wol.

745
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:18,900
(Man-wol)

746
00:59:19,233 --> 00:59:21,433
You've memorized the characters.

747
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:27,133
Did Yeon-woo engrave it for you?

748
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,233
Yeon-woo was always
good with his hands…

749
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:43,666
I guess this blade is also
for him.

750
00:59:47,933 --> 00:59:50,266
And many others, too.

751
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:55,200
You must watch all our revenge,

752
00:59:55,266 --> 00:59:57,800
and die a painful, tragic death.

753
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,666
How about us, then?

754
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:12,133
Because it makes me happy to
see you again.

755
01:00:21,466 --> 01:00:24,300
You greeting me as
my beautiful bride,

756
01:00:26,966 --> 01:00:31,833
and I, caressing you to say
I've missed you…

757
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,133
Shut up.

758
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,333
(Man-wol)

759
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,133
This is…

760
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,166
…the end for us.

761
01:02:27,466 --> 01:02:30,166
I will slay all your people,

762
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:34,333
and burn this castle!

763
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:40,400
That's how the end will be,
for you and I!

764
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,800
You must watch all this,
before you close your eyes!

765
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:52,700
Man-wol…

766
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:57,366
I will fill my heart with you,

767
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:01,833
and watch over you

768
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,333
as a moon that doesn't wane.

769
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:52,400
(Man-wol)

770
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:08,167
After he died that night,

771
01:04:08,233 --> 01:04:10,500
my blood boiled for revenge

772
01:04:10,566 --> 01:04:13,166
and killed many, many people.

773
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,800
And carrying the keepsakes of
my people

774
01:04:16,866 --> 01:04:19,366
in a coffin, instead of
their bodies…

775
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,300
I wandered here and there,
looking for the inn of the moon.

776
01:04:26,633 --> 01:04:30,500
And when I finally arrived there,

777
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:34,600
after countlessly slaying down
those who hunted me down…

778
01:04:35,633 --> 01:04:37,233
The person who greeted me was…

779
01:04:38,233 --> 01:04:40,200
myself, stained with blood.

780
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:55,366
My sin is heavy,
and my grudge is deep.

781
01:04:58,466 --> 01:05:00,400
This is the ugly, bare face of me
that's deep down within me.

782
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:08,666
I…

783
01:05:11,233 --> 01:05:13,533
…have been waiting for him,
for all these years,

784
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,500
so that when he finally does come,

785
01:05:17,566 --> 01:05:20,300
I will drag him down to
those depths with me

786
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:22,233
and perish.

787
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,633
But here I am, instead.

788
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:43,834
I may not be able to
erase your suffering

789
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,100
as if they'd never happened,

790
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,233
but I can pull you out from
your abyss.

791
01:06:57,466 --> 01:07:00,534
Mister, does this bus
go to Myeongdong?

792
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,200
Yes, it does.

793
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:04,700
But are you by yourself?
Where's your mother?

794
01:07:04,766 --> 01:07:06,400
I'm off to meet my Mom.

795
01:07:06,466 --> 01:07:10,134
Mister, do you know
a Hotel Del Luna in Myeongdong?

796
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,333
That's where my mom is right now.

797
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,334
Ms. Choi! Ms. Choi!

798
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,366
Ms. Choi!

799
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,300
Are you leaving us now?

800
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:35,900
How could you, without a word?

801
01:07:35,966 --> 01:07:38,266
We'd known each other
for 200 years!

802
01:07:42,566 --> 01:07:43,600
I'm extremely disappointed.

803
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,500
I'm not going anywhere.

804
01:07:48,566 --> 01:07:51,533
The Grim Reaper had asked me to
clean the car.

805
01:07:54,233 --> 01:07:55,300
Did he now?

806
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,300
But this car is his responsibility,

807
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,934
so why does he always
ask us to, each time?

808
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,866
It's all done.

809
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,067
Then… you're not leaving?

810
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:10,134
I don't know yet whether
it's a boy or a girl.

811
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,500
I'll have to see that, at least.

812
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,034
I ran for nothing,
which is unscholarly.

813
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,233
Mr. Kim.

814
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:23,167
May I have a glass of Tears?
I'd like it strong.

815
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:24,666
Of course. Let's go, then.

816
01:08:26,966 --> 01:08:29,767
- Were you crying?
- No.

817
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:31,834
But those are tears.

818
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,233
- I said, no!
- I don't think so.

819
01:08:35,133 --> 01:08:38,067
Be nice to me while
I'm still here.

820
01:08:38,133 --> 01:08:39,266
I'll be nice to you.

821
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,134
I hid a present for you in here.

822
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,667
So try find it, in one shot!

823
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:48,000
How can I, in one shot?

824
01:08:48,066 --> 01:08:49,434
Then I'll give you a hint.

825
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,866
A hint? Alright.

826
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:56,500
The number of the room is
also the day we first met.

827
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,366
- The day we first met?
- Yeah.

828
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:03,233
How can you remember that?

829
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,400
How can you not remember that?

830
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:10,434
Then you don't remember
the day we first kissed?

831
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,300
Don't say that out so loud!

832
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,834
Who else would hear us,
besides the spirits?

833
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,633
Come on, think!
When did we first meet?

834
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:25,066
Well… It was around when
the flowers started blossoming.

835
01:09:26,133 --> 01:09:27,767
- So June…?
- June?

836
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:30,367
- …no.
- June?

837
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:31,800
May…

838
01:09:31,866 --> 01:09:33,067
May when?

839
01:09:33,133 --> 01:09:35,534
- May…
- May when?

840
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,567
Yes, so May what?

841
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:38,934
It's not May 5th, is it?

842
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,200
May 5th?

843
01:09:40,266 --> 01:09:41,433
Yes, I know it's not May 5th.

844
01:09:44,966 --> 01:09:46,033
Wow.

845
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:53,434
A young child.

846
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,833
It's rare to see a young child
come here alone.

847
01:10:00,233 --> 01:10:02,700
Sweetie, are you here
all by yourself?

848
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:05,334
Yes, I'm here to see my Mom.

849
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,934
I see.

850
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,166
Your Mom came here first,
so you followed after her.

851
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,566
Hold on, you're not…

852
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,766
He's still alive.

853
01:10:30,066 --> 01:10:32,000
You saw this place in your dreams?

854
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:34,466
Mom said she's doing well here
at this hotel.

855
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,633
It's a side-effect of that
dream call service.

856
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,734
A living boy came here,
after seeing his dead mother

857
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,667
in his dreams.

858
01:10:43,733 --> 01:10:46,467
You take him home safely.

859
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:49,034
Then is the child's mother
still at the hotel?

860
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,567
She departed for the underworld
only yesterday.

861
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:54,300
So please console him
and take him with you.

862
01:11:01,733 --> 01:11:02,766
Where did he go?

863
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:11,034
Where did the boy go?

864
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,300
You were watching him.

865
01:11:13,366 --> 01:11:16,200
He said he wanted ice cream,
so I'd gone to get some.

866
01:11:16,266 --> 01:11:17,767
We must find him, quick.

867
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:19,133
Let's split up.

868
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:20,733
Oh, man…

869
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,800
Child!

870
01:11:23,633 --> 01:11:25,133
Where did he go?

871
01:11:25,666 --> 01:11:27,733
Sweetie! Sweetie?

872
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:31,466
Sweetie?

873
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:35,133
Sweetie?

874
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:42,067
Excuse me sir, have you seen
a boy this big?

875
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:43,734
Oh, that boy?

876
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,866
He headed toward the bus stop.

877
01:11:47,766 --> 01:11:48,600
What?

878
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,133
Wait!

879
01:12:30,033 --> 01:12:32,734
(Styx)

880
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,800
(World of Humans/Underworld)

881
01:12:36,766 --> 01:12:39,467
What? A living boy came in here?

882
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:40,467
Yes.

883
01:12:40,533 --> 01:12:42,533
But he disappeared,
so we're looking for him.

884
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:45,466
What's our frontman doing?

885
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:03,666
Was this tunnel always this long?

886
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Am I trapped in here?

887
01:13:39,366 --> 01:13:40,433
We found him!

888
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,433
We found him, we found him!

889
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,167
He was in front of the bus stop.

890
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:47,100
If we had been there any later,
it would've been disastrous.

891
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:50,167
Go call that Hyun-joong punk,

892
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:51,866
and tell Koo Chan-sung to
take him home.

893
01:13:55,466 --> 01:13:57,234
This place isn't a place for you.

894
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,400
That dark tunnel is
a scary place, you know!

895
01:14:00,466 --> 01:14:02,866
But that mister just went in, too.

896
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,667
What? What did you say?

897
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:09,900
Which mister?

898
01:14:09,966 --> 01:14:12,434
A man in a suit just went
in there.

899
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,434
I was watching to see
whether he'd come back out,

900
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,833
but he didn't.

901
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,900
Mr. Koo must've wandered in there.

902
01:14:18,966 --> 01:14:21,366
But if a living man goes in there,
they get lost and never…

903
01:16:11,966 --> 01:16:13,300
Koo Chan-sung.

904
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,400
Koo Chan-sung…

905
01:17:44,533 --> 01:17:45,533
Koo Chan-sung!

906
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,366
I was frightened that
you'll never come back.

907
01:20:12,566 --> 01:20:13,766
You…

908
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:21,433
Who are you?

909
01:21:12,633 --> 01:21:16,366
(Hotel Del Luna)

910
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:20,000
When he came, I wanted to
cast him in the hell called you

911
01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:22,034
and have him perish with you.

912
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,134
But it looks like
that won't be possible now.

913
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,866
Funnily enough,
I've fallen in love again.

914
01:21:30,866 --> 01:21:32,267
Feed on this.

915
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:34,866
Take it, and become an evil spirit.

916
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,600
Just die!

917
01:21:41,366 --> 01:21:43,100
I told you she'll protect me,
didn't I?
