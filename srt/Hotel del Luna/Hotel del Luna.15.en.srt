00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
(Episode 15)

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,280
If I knew President Jang wouldn't come back,

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,520
I should have bid her a proper farewell when she left.

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,840
If she finally departed after satisfying her long grudge??

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,680
Then good for her.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,880
Let's promise each other to say goodbye before we leave.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,560
Don't ever leave without saying so, alright?

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,400
Promise me.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,080
Promise.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,080
Anyway, what is to become of this hotel?

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,320
The Grim Reaper wouldn't give a clear answer as always,

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,160
but it does look like Old Mago is getting ready for a new owner.

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,120
Hope you age by the next full moon.

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,080
Now all it needs is the most important,

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,480
the lunar herb.

22
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,720
Goodness.

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,960
We're out of the lunar herb.

24
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,440
I heard you instructed Old Mago of the apothecary,

25
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,520
to brew new wine to greet the

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,960
new owner of the lunar inn.

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
A wine is aging, which will taste most bitter

28
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,840
on the tongues of those who are full of grudges.

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,680
When Jang Man-wol had a taste,

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,440
she said she'll pull my tongue out.

31
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,240
The one who drinks it will fall under the influence of the moon,

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,160
and escape the cycle of life and death.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,320
All the life left in them will be sucked up by the lunar tree,

34
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,880
which will replace their body,

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,720
and the soul that remains will be bound to the tree.

36
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,480
And so they become the owner of the lunar inn.

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,320
The new wine should be ready by the next full moon,

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,080
but it's missing its key ingredient, the lunar herb.

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,800
I'll have a look.

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,000
Where can I find it?

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,720
It only blooms in the garden of the lunar inn.

42
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,000
There's none here right now, however.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,600
Oh, but was it 200 years ago?

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,080
I saw some bloom in the garden back then.

45
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,160
Then I'll make a trip to the inn, 200 years ago.

46
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,640
No need for you to go.

47
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,120
I'll send someone else there.

48
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,840
You're early to work, once again.

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,800
Just in case she's back.

50
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,120
I have something for you, Mr. Koo.

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,080
I hear this potion will close your all-seeing eye.

52
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,360
President Jang had asked me a favor long ago.

53
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Under your discretion,

54
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,840
if you deem it there is no more need for Koo Chan-sung to be here,

55
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,240
give this potion to him.

56
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,800
But why are you entrusting me with this?

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,840
Just in case.

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,920
Because I trust you the most, Ms. Choi.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,640
Until now, I believed she will surely return.

60
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
But now??

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,800
I believe I should

62
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,760
give this to you, Mr. Koo.

63
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,280
You don't think she will come back, Ms. Choi.

64
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,600
I believe the reason she entrusted this to me,

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
is because she wished for you to live your life in the real world,

66
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,680
and not be tied down to where she no longer is.

67
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Koo Chan-sung.

68
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
Ta-da!

69
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,960
Have a guess about what I'm going to eat.

70
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,600
You don't even have a clue, do you?

71
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Seasoned thistle with rice!

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,640
Look. This is the thistle, and this white stuff is rice.

73
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,920
And this, the seasoning, and this, the spoon!

74
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,400
Okay, Koo?

75
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
Let's go.

76
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,840
Wait, wait. I need my phone, for the photos!

77
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,760
What are you staring at? That look in your eyes??

78
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,760
Oh what?

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,800
You brought along another special service request?

80
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,640
Fine, give it to me. Give it to me.

81
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,000
Bring me all there is.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,480
What else would I do at night, in my bed, huh?

83
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,160
I'll just work and listen in on other spirits' dream calls.

84
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,800
Harvard? What's that?

85
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,240
Do they only teach you how to study?

86
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,560
Ugh, I can't stand the sight of you! Get out!

87
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,520
Koo Chan-sung.

88
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,640
Once you're done working at our hotel,

89
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,000
you'll be a greater person than Hwang Moon-sook.

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,440
You're going to live for very long, and be very rich.

91
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,800
Del Luna guarantees it.

92
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,400
There you go again.

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,680
It's too early to get cocky just yet, you know!

94
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,080
Hey!

95
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,320
Don't give me that look.

96
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,960
Is Ms. Jang Man-wol back?

97
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,160
I need you to do something for me.

98
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,040
What is it?

99
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,680
I need you to go to Manwoldang.

100
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,600
Manwoldang?

101
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,440
Isn't that Del Luna's old name, around the Joseon Dynasty?

102
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,160
That's right, I need you to drop by there for me.

103
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,320
In the garden of Manwoldang,

104
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
you'll find a herb that glows under the moonlight.

105
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
All you need to do is bring that to me.

106
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,520
It's simple, really.

107
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,960
Then why ask me, instead of going there yourself?

108
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,280
I thought you'd like it.

109
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,680
If you go there,

110
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,280
you'll be able to see the old Manwoldang.

111
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,240
Then??will I also be able to see Ms. Jang Man-wol from then?

112
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,280
I guess.

113
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
But if you don't want to, fine.

114
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,640
I'll do it.

115
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,960
I'll go.

116
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,720
Go around the tree,

117
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,600
and you'll see the entrance to Manwoldang.

118
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,160
To return, go the other way.

119
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,080
Oh, but while you're there??

120
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,320
You mustn't eat or drink anything.

121
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,680
Otherwise you'll never be able to come back.

122
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,560
(Manwoldang)

123
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,200
You're the one who reported me, huh?

124
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,280
I only told the truth. What's wrong with that?

125
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,680
Did you have to drag me to the underworld with you, huh?

126
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,520
Yes, that's right! So go on, kill me! Go on!

127
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,080
- Do you want to die? - Yes! So go on and kill me!

128
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,400
It's Ms. Choi.

129
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,880
Don't do this.

130
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,000
Please calm down, and, this way.

131
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Come on.

132
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,840
Well??hmpf!

133
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,960
Excuse me, is that wine also for Madame Jang?

134
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes.

135
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,960
She drinks like a whale, doesn't she?

136
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,120
Mr. Kim.

137
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,000
Who goes there?

138
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,240
How did a living soul enter this place?

139
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,440
Are you here to steal?

140
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,800
Your outfit is, peculiar.

141
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,840
Where did you come from?

142
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,720
Ms. Jang Man-wol??

143
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,640
How do you know my name?

144
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,040
Are you, by any chance??

145
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,880
Oh from Dangyong sent you here, didn't he?

146
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,520
You probably tracked me down with that promissory note I wrote.

147
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,840
Go tell that Oh Choong-hwan loud and clear.

148
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,600
That I'll pay him back, in a month's time.

149
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,760
I came from a much faraway place.

150
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,000
Then you now, won't recognize me.

151
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,640
You have an all-seeing eye.

152
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,560
Who gave you that eye?

153
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,720
Jang Man-wol!

154
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,320
- Damnit. - Here I am, back again.

155
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,000
You're here again.

156
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
- I'm here, yet again! - Madame Jang isn't in right now.

157
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,560
- What is it? - I came by yesterday,

158
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,160
I came by today, and I'm going to come by tomorrow, too!

159
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
That old beggar??

160
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,120
She's still alive and back again.

161
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,760
Jang Man-wol! Here I am, back again!

162
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,600
Isn't that??Old Mago?

163
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,800
You know Old Mago?

164
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,680
Yes.

165
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
I've met about five of them,

166
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,960
but it's my first time seeing that one.

167
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,120
Are you close with Old Mago?

168
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,080
They were all kind to me.

169
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,240
Is that right?

170
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,520
Do you care for a drink?

171
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,840
You must not have been here long.

172
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,720
No, this is only my second year.

173
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,680
This is wine from the mortal world.

174
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,920
It's been a while since we had a living, human guest.

175
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,000
You don't have a living general manager?

176
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,040
General manager?

177
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,440
Oh, you mean the master of the house?

178
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,640
The one we had died recently, so now we don't have one anymore.

179
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,920
Were you perhaps sent by Old Mago to fill the vacancy?

180
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,760
No.

181
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,880
Madame Jang mistook me for Master Oh from Dangyong.

182
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,120
Who is he?

183
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,040
Dangyong is a gambling house, and Oh is a moneylender.

184
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,720
Gambling house??

185
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,240
Ms. Jang Man-wol gambles?

186
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,040
After our long master of the house passed away,

187
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,000
we thought she'd been going out for walks to console herself.

188
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,120
But she'd been in fact, gambling.

189
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,440
Well, what to do??

190
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,120
I'm all in.

191
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,400
If you're chickened out, go die.

192
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,080
- I'm all in, too. - I'll throw in my house!

193
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,480
Alright, let's see them.

194
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,040
Here you go, I'm sure that's enough to call this all mine.

195
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,440
Hold on!

196
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,080
Gosh, I'm sorry, gentleman.

197
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,960
Wow, how much is all this?

198
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,840
At first, she teamed up with a pro-gambler ghost

199
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,160
and racked in some serious cash.

200
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,040
Until she was found out by Old Mago.

201
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,520
Ever since then, the Old Mago that invites poverty

202
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,040
has been coming every day, draining her wealth.

203
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,160
She is gambling with a pro-gambling ghost.

204
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,080
Things are much worse here.

205
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,520
At this rate, we may end up selling the farmland and this building, too!

206
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,760
I really do hope we have a proper master of the house this time.

207
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,400
I'll leave you two to talk.

208
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,840
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

209
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,240
Do you gamble?

210
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,640
I was just having a bit of fun, because I was bored.

211
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,560
A bit of fun?

212
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,320
In my world, you would've been handcuffed and imprisoned!

213
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,280
I was about to stop anyway!

214
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,800
After I recover what I lost, that is.

215
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,320
With that attitude, you'll never quit gambling.

216
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
How am I supposed to greet guests unless I recover my loss?

217
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,600
It shouldn't cost you a cent to receive guests!

218
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,480
Why, you??

219
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,920
There's nothing you don't know, is there?

220
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,760
Alright, I see you have some sort of a connection to Old Magos.

221
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,920
Then go and tell that old beggar that you just saw.

222
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,000
To get out.

223
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,120
You know you can't drive out a God.

224
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,320
Yes, that's right.

225
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,040
Which is why I can't throw out or refuse that old beggar.

226
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,600
She comes every day for a game,

227
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,080
and there's no way I can win??

228
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,520
At this rate, I'll end up on the street myself!

229
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,360
I have successfully convinced a divine spirit to leave before.

230
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,280
Have you?

231
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,360
If I send her out,

232
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,080
promise me you won't ever gamble again.

233
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,040
I won't.

234
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,880
I swear by my hand.

235
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Goodness.

236
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,880
Ugh, this is??terrible stuff.

237
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,440
Did you??

238
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,720
enjoy your meal?

239
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,040
Who are you?

240
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,840
I'm Koo Chan-sung, sent by the eldest Old Mago to

241
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,640
harvest some lunar herbs.

242
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,080
Did my eldest sister send you?

243
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,880
You came from a faraway place, didn't you?

244
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,400
I know you're punishing Ms. Jang Man-wol for her wrongdoing.

245
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,160
But??

246
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,080
Could you stop here?

247
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,560
But I'm planning to make her go completely broke!

248
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,280
Please go easy on her.

249
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,440
I don't want to see her have too much of a hard time.

250
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,760
Why not?

251
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,840
If you don't like that,

252
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,360
how about you play a game with me?

253
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,040
You can choose what game.

254
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,600
Will baduk be alright with you?

255
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,280
Baduk?

256
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,160
Baduk sounds good.

257
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,120
What's happening here?

258
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,320
Is he winning?

259
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,080
They're fifty-fifty. It's a well-matched game.

260
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,040
The young man is faring quite well against the divinity.

261
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,760
He was speaking to me with bravado.

262
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,080
What was it again? Harvard? Have you heard of Harvard?

263
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,840
He said he went there, and that he's smart, if nothing else.

264
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,280
So he wasn't bluffing.

265
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,880
You're damn loud!

266
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,880
Oh, ugh??

267
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,520
I lost!

268
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
Hurry up and leave, then!

269
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,600
And don't ever come back.

270
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,720
- I am leaving. - Hurry up!

271
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,480
Well done, well done!

272
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
(I will not step foot inside ever again)

273
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,640
There. Happy?

274
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,600
Now sign it.

275
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,160
Write your name on it.

276
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,760
So fussy??

277
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,360
I saw in your stable just now that you have way too many horses.

278
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,000
Keep just three and sell off the rest to pay off your debt.

279
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,920
Just three?

280
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,880
You'll probably tell me they're all part of the stable,

281
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,960
but no. Pay off the debt first.

282
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,280
Else I will invite in that old beggar again.

283
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, alright! Alright!

284
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,600
I'll sell them off. Happy?

285
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,080
(Jang Man-wol)

286
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,920
Here, my signature. Done?

287
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,480
If you're bored, don't go to gambling houses

288
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,880
but find a hobby.

289
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,280
Look.

290
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,920
The Joseon peninsula resembles a tiger.

291
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,760
A tiger?

292
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,000
This is Jeonju right here, and it's famous for bibimbap.

293
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
And in winter, go here.

294
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,600
Pohang is famous for its semi-dried herring.

295
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,320
And the cold noodles from Pyongyang, up here??You'll surely love them.

296
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,400
Are you telling me to go on a gourmet tour?

297
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,880
Have you tried all this?

298
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,040
I have, with a certain someone.

299
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,720
Will it be more fun than gambling?

300
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,760
You'll like it.

301
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,280
So much that you'll enjoy it for the next 200 years.

302
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,000
How about you join me?

303
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,000
You??

304
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,000
How about you work here as the master of the house?

305
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,440
Because I quite like you.

306
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,600
Stay here, and be by my side.

307
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,880
Oh, but while you're there??

308
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,440
You mustn't eat or drink anything.

309
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,000
Otherwise you'll never be able to come back.

310
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,880
I guess here, I'll be able to remain by your side

311
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,080
without having to worry about you going anywhere.

312
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,320
Here.

313
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,720
Drink up, Koo Chan-sung.

314
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,920
I must go back.

315
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,360
There is a woman I'm waiting for.

316
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,880
Is she your beloved?

317
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,960
Yes.

318
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,840
She's someone whom I love very much.

319
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,000
Too bad.

320
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,000
I may regret it too, once I go back.

321
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,800
Once you leave,

322
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,440
all of their memories about a time traveler will be erased.

323
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,560
Have you come to spy on me,

324
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,960
in case I don't return?

325
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,320
Whether you choose to return or remain here,

326
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,760
is all up to you.

327
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,960
If you stay here,

328
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,480
you'll be Jang Man-wol's 85th master of the house, I presume.

329
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,400
Whether to return to being the one to see her off,

330
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,440
or to remain here, as a brief passer-by??

331
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,480
It's your decision to make.

332
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,640
Thank you, for bringing it to me.

333
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,560
Now I know why you sent me there.

334
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,000
You made me realize with what heart

335
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,280
I should wait for her.

336
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,800
For now??you can rejoice.

337
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,720
Man-wol's come back.

338
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,280
She must be back!

339
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,360
Sorry I'm late.

340
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,720
It was all so brief over there,

341
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,600
but I took a long time, didn't I?

342
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,040
President Jang!

343
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,880
- President Jang! - President Jang!

344
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,000
President Jang!

345
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,360
President Jang!

346
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
President Jang??

347
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,160
I'm so glad that President Jang is back.

348
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,920
All those rumors about a new owner got me really worried.

349
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,200
It seems President Jang took some time,

350
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,480
seeing someone off at the bridge.

351
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,520
But because she set foot on it,

352
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,080
she's lost much of her memories.

353
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,560
Losing most of the memories about the person she saw off??

354
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,600
Does that mean memories fade in their chronological order?

355
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,000
To think that the memories that have long haunted her

356
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,840
were the first to fade away??

357
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,080
How bitter, but relieving to hear at the same time.

358
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,680
Don't worry.

359
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,160
There isn't one detail I've forgotten about you.

360
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,720
Really?

361
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,760
Then how about a test?

362
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You're so hard to please.

363
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,520
Red car versus me.

364
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,760
You. Happy?

365
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,160
So the most important information is still there.

366
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,880
Do you remember how many cars you have left?

367
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,040
Three??

368
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,200
You didn't sell them off while I was gone, did you?

369
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,680
I didn't sell the cars.

370
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,920
Though I did advise to sell the horses.

371
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,480
Do you remember Master Oh of Dangyong?

372
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,720
How do you know that scoundrel, Oh Choong-hwan?

373
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,120
Even your memory from 200 years ago is safe and sound.

374
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,360
All good, then.

375
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,000
Mr. Kim told you, didn't he?

376
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,480
It's obvious. I bet he had a fine time, backstabbing me.

377
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,040
What else did he say?

378
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,080
Let's have a drink.

379
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,040
I was just feeling really sorry about turning down a woman

380
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,520
who offered me a drink.

381
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,600
A woman? Don't lie to me.

382
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,000
Like you'd have any other woman.

383
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,720
Aw, are you mad because I made you wait?

384
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,080
I do have one. And she's really beautiful.

385
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,640
Koo Chan-sung, don't you underestimate me.

386
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,920
I don't get jealous.

387
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,000
Instead, I kill. So die! Die!

388
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,840
From how you still have your hand, you must've kept your promise.

389
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,400
I went to Manwoldang and met Madame Jang.

390
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,840
- Me? - Old Mago sent me there.

391
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,800
And there, I saved you, who was addicted to gambling

392
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,400
and on the brink of bankruptcy??

393
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,800
I have no memories of that.

394
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,400
She said you won't.

395
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,920
Because I was only dropping by to

396
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,440
harvest some lunar herbs.

397
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,000
Lunar herbs?

398
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,120
Did she say she needs them?

399
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,080
She said she's brewing wine.

400
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
- Do you know about that, too? - Yes.

401
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,600
I had a taste of it, a long long time ago.

402
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,440
That disgusting, terrible wine??

403
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,080
So Old Mago is brewing that wine again, is she?

404
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,880
But Ms. Ji Hyun-mi's brother, Mr. Ji Hyun-joong??

405
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,600
He passed away a long time ago.

406
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,640
Ji Hyun-joong!

407
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,600
Tae-seok.

408
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,960
Hey, give me a ride.

409
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,000
- What about your bike? - I left it at home.

410
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,520
- Get on the back. - Woo-hoo!

411
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,040
- Not! - Hey!

412
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,560
So he's your friend from school?

413
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,000
Then he's not a bad guy who stole your life,

414
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,080
but is looking after your sister in your stead.

415
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,440
I did a little research on Dr. Ji Hyun-joong.

416
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,680
Take a look.

417
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,240
He's done many good things as a doctor,

418
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,720
and he's highly respected, too.

419
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,880
He lived a good life under your name, didn't he?

420
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,640
Yes. He lived life earnestly.

421
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,120
Since Hyun-mi's being taken care of at the hospital he founded,

422
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,960
she should??

423
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
live for another 10 years, won't she?

424
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,040
Hmmm? It's your sister's caregiver.

425
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,320
Huh?

426
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,000
I uh??got her number that day.

427
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,000
Hyun-joong??

428
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,080
Her condition is stable now.

429
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,120
She should manage to pass this one, too.

430
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,720
Thank you, as always.

431
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,600
Then.

432
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Hyun-mi managed to pull through once again.

433
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,840
Yet another disappointment for you, I guess.

434
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Excuse me.

435
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,480
Did you take my photograph?

436
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,280
What photograph?

437
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,680
You talked to me about Ji Hyun-joong last time.

438
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,960
You took that photo of Ji Hyun-joong in it, didn't you?

439
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,840
You have a picture of him?

440
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
So you are his friend.

441
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,760
Since you're his friend,

442
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,040
please make sure Hyun-mi lives a good, long life.

443
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,080
Hyun-joong is always watching you.

444
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,080
He was watching you just now, too.

445
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,120
Um??

446
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,800
Is Ji Hyun-joong still alive?

447
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,680
Don't tell me he's still alive, leaving me to live this life

448
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,640
taking care of Hyun-mi!

449
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,520
Where is Ji Hyun-joong? Where is he?

450
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,080
So you really were a student at a prestigious academy.

451
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,880
I was really popular, too.

452
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,160
Of course. Even our guests have said that

453
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,360
your smile makes their hearts flutter.

454
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,160
I'm sure you were popular.

455
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,840
I too, passed the lower literary examination at a young age,

456
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,560
and was hailed as a child genius.

457
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,840
And whenever I recited poetry,

458
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,680
all the women in town would gather outside the walls to hear me.

459
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,960
I guess they only ever heard your voice,

460
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,120
and never saw your face.

461
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,480
Well, you do have a good voice, Mr. Kim.

462
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,760
Men are all about their voices!

463
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,520
Right, Mr. Koo?

464
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,400
On the other hand, Mr. Koo has more than just a good voice.

465
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,520
The person next to you must be your friend from school.

466
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,760
Yes.

467
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,720
This is the friend that's looking after Hyun-mi right now.

468
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,840
Thanks to him, Hyun-mi was able to pull through once again.

469
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,000
Hyun-joong may not have many days left with us.

470
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,720
So I was thinking,

471
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,920
before his sister arrives and they depart together,

472
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,000
how about we do something for them?

473
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,640
Since Hyun-joong never spent much quality time with his sister,

474
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
how about we open the theme park,

475
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,840
even just briefly?

476
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,080
A theme park?

477
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,320
I wouldn't mind turning my bar into a kids' cafe.

478
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,240
He waited 70 long years for his sister.

479
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,080
He should be allowed some time to catch up with his sister.

480
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,520
Do you really think Hyun-joong was just waiting for his sister?

481
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,400
Do you really think our little Hyun-joong is

482
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,800
so good and pure-hearted, that he waited 70 years,

483
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,760
just for his little sister?

484
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,160
Did you all forget?

485
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,120
That kid arrived here, with a bullet to his chest.

486
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,640
If you don't want to partake in this event for Hyun-joong

487
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,080
and his sister, why couldn't you have kept your mouth shut,

488
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,480
instead of ruining it for everyone?

489
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,480
You know, I??

490
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,400
I once shot someone with this gun.

491
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
I fired this bullet containing deep grudge,

492
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,840
right at her enemy's chest.

493
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,680
So it will torment him for all his life.

494
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,040
So are you saying you'll find who Hyun-joong's shooter is,

495
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,600
and fire that gun at him for him?

496
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,080
Hyun-joong already fired his own bullet of grudge

497
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,520
at his enemy.

498
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,120
What do you suppose this bullet is?

499
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,360
Hyun-mi.

500
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,880
Ji Hyun-joong's sister, Ji Hyun-mi.

501
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,160
He put his sick sister, who's near blind and

502
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,600
mentally unstable, right by his side and tormented him for all his life.

503
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,480
It's true that Hyun-joong waited 70 years here for his sister,

504
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,640
but he also used her to torment his enemy for 70 years.

505
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,800
His enemy, who killed him.

506
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,920
This enemy who killed Hyun-joong??

507
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,000
Is he the friend who's looking after Hyun-mi?

508
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,800
Yu-na.

509
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,880
Hyun-joong.

510
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,120
I brought someone who really wants to see you.

511
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,040
Me?

512
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,520
Ji Hyun-joong.

513
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,720
President Jang.

514
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,280
A man who says he is a friend of Hyun-joong, is here.

515
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,920
Yu-na brought him.

516
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,760
I see he came to beg him to take that bullet out.

517
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,520
Hyun-joong fled, as soon as he saw him.

518
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,200
I guess he doesn't want to see him.

519
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,000
I didn't bring him here for that man's sake.

520
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,960
The only way to give back Hyun-joong his stolen life,

521
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,120
even just a little is??

522
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,120
only possible while he's still alive, so??

523
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,760
So that's why I brought him.

524
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,720
Whatever happens, it's up to Hyun-joong now.

525
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,640
During the evacuation, Hyun-joong lost both his parents

526
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,840
in the bombings and only just managed to save his sister.

527
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,880
Take your time.

528
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,040
Delicious?

529
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,920
Hyun-mi, once we go to our uncle's in Busan,

530
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,400
we'll be able to have a lot of good food,

531
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,080
and get you treated so you're all better.

532
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,280
His sister was hurt badly,

533
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,000
so Hyun-joong chose to take the risky shortcut through

534
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,760
the mountains, instead of joining the other refugees.

535
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,600
Don't move.

536
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,560
Ji Hyun-joong??

537
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,080
Tae-seok??

538
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,920
There he met a runaway soldier,

539
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,480
his friend.

540
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,800
Take your time.

541
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,320
My sister is hurt badly.

542
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,800
Do you know the shortcut?

543
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,400
We're going to my uncle's in Busan.

544
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,680
Come with us, Tae-seok.

545
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,000
Take your uniform off.

546
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,760
Hurry up and take it off!

547
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,320
With this on, I'll be killed regardless of who finds me, so??

548
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,840
So hurry up.

549
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,840
Tae-seok??

550
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,000
Not this.

551
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,840
Hyun-mi's medicine is in here. Without it, Hyun-mi will die.

552
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,560
Put it down before I shoot you. Now!

553
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,360
Hyun-joong!

554
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,920
Hyun-joong!

555
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,000
Hyun-joong!

556
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,880
- Hey, Hyun-joong? Hyun-joong!

557
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,360
I didn't do that on purpose. You know that, right?

558
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,720
Hyun-joong! Hyun-joong!

559
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,040
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

560
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,840
Hyun-joong!

561
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,040
Take my sister??

562
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,520
Hyun-joong!

563
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,440
Take my sister, please!

564
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,040
Hyun-joong!

565
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,440
Hyun-joong!

566
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,040
His friend took Hyun-mi and went to her uncle's place.

567
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,520
And thanks to their aunt who recognized Hyun-mi,

568
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,920
they presumed that the person who'd carried her here

569
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,200
was Hyun-joong himself.

570
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,160
And from then on, his friend lived his life as Ji Hyun-joong.

571
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,920
Ms. Jang Man-wol said Hyun-mi is

572
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,920
the bullet he planted in his enemy's heart.

573
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,800
Hyun-joong always spoke about his sister with a smile on his face.

574
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,120
But I guess he also harbored hatred in his heart,

575
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,040
when he saw his friend taking care of her.

576
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,840
Ji Hyun-joong, why are you crouched down here?

577
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,960
Gosh??

578
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,760
This tree is bare and ugly enough, now that all the leaves and

579
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,720
petals have fallen for good.

580
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,040
And now, with you crouched under it like a puppy in the rain,

581
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,080
I must say what a miserable sight!

582
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,920
I'm a victim.

583
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,560
It was hard enough seeing him do

584
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,360
all the things I've ever wanted to do.

585
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,400
I won't ever forgive him.

586
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,920
How can you forgive a bastard who put a hole in your chest?

587
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,320
Still, go and hear him out.

588
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,360
I'm sure he didn't come here to brag about what a good life

589
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,320
he led after killing you.

590
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,520
He's probably here to offer excuses like how it was hard for him,

591
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,160
and that he had an unhappy life, too.

592
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,680
But you know, it's not so bad listening to all that.

593
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,040
It relieves your anger a bit, too.

594
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,000
Were you like that, too?

595
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yes.

596
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,880
That's how I was able to see him off

597
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,440
when he left for good.

598
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,880
I thought you don't remember the firefly??

599
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,080
Now's not the time to talk about my memories, is it?

600
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,320
If you're going to continue to sulk like this,

601
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,080
I'm going to go over there and turn him away.

602
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,040
Tsk, Yu-na went to all this trouble for nothing.

603
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,360
Of course, this is all just to ease his own guilt.

604
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,840
Still, see him since Yu-na brought him here.

605
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,920
The girl you like is

606
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,560
trying to do all she can, for you.

607
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,760
Perhaps bringing you here

608
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,000
ended up torturing Hyun-joong even more.

609
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,080
Please leave.

610
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,000
Then??

611
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,920
Please pass this onto him, at least.

612
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:46,160
(Ji Hyun-joong)

613
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,360
Hyun-joong really loved school??

614
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,600
Mr. Oh Tae-seok.

615
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,080
Mr. Ji Hyun-joong says he will see you.

616
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,880
He'd like to see you in this room.

617
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,960
Please go in.

618
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,480
You're the same as ever, Hyun-joong.

619
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,240
I've been watching you get old,

620
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,520
Tae-seok.

621
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,120
(Oh Tae-seok)

622
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,880
(Ji Hyun-joong)

623
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,440
You put Hyun-joong in one room with his enemy. Why aren't you worried?

624
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,880
Because Hyun-joong is good at heart,

625
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,680
and he's continued to watch his friend.

626
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,600
I'm sure he let go of much of his grudge,

627
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,040
seeing him take care of Hyun-mi to the very end.

628
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,400
Now that our good Hyun-joong dissipated much of his anger,

629
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,800
it's time for his wicked boss to ask for monetary compensation.

630
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,680
Are you going to extort him?

631
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,960
Hyun-joong's friend isn't just rich.

632
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,640
Before our youngest one leaves us,

633
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,880
we should do something for him, shouldn't we?

634
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,080
I saw that you donated much money under Hyun-joong's name,

635
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,160
and even founded a hospital.

636
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,840
I lived all my life, repenting for my sin.

637
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,720
Since you're already on it, how about you do one more?

638
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,040
Acquire a school, under Hyun-joong's name.

639
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,240
If you can, acquire the very school

640
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,680
Hyun-joong used to attend.

641
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,240
(Dongseon High School)

642
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,400
Please relay on our thanks to Dr. Ji Hyun-joong,

643
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,400
for making such a generous donation to our school.

644
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,000
But will this small ceremony in the middle of the night

645
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,520
really satisfy him?

646
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,920
All Mr. Ji wishes for is an honorary graduation certificate.

647
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,000
Moreover, the middle of the night is more convenient for his guests.

648
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,800
He requested the certificate be made out to Ji Hyun-joong.

649
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,120
He shares the same name as Dr. Ji, doesn't he?

650
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,880
He was a student who loved this school very much.

651
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,080
There he comes.

652
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,240
(Honorary Graduation Ceremony for Mr. Ji Hyun-joong)

653
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,760
They must be his family.

654
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,960
Yes, they're his family.

655
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,960
Is everyone here, then?

656
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,120
Yes.

657
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,400
Many have joined us.

658
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,440
Why did you have to drag everyone here?

659
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,000
As you know, Hyun-joong is pretty popular.

660
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,040
The Grim Reaper lent us his bus, so there is no need to worry.

661
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,480
Your honorary graduation certificate.

662
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,080
Congratulations on your graduation!

663
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,040
Thank you.

664
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,160
Thank you all for coming.

665
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,040
Here's to??

666
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,960
- Hyun-joong! - Hyun-joong!

667
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,480
Thank you.

668
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,520
Congratulations.

669
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,080
Chan-sung,

670
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,720
then is everyone who's sitting over there, spirits?

671
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,840
Yes.

672
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,040
The ones you see have been around here for long,

673
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,400
so they can take on visible forms.

674
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,320
Visible forms??That must require some advanced skills.

675
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,560
It's not just that table that's full, but this one, too.

676
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,080
That table's full, and so is that table, huh?

677
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,560
Sanchez, if this is too much for you you can just step out.

678
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,640
No, it's alright.

679
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,040
When else will I see ghosts having a party to celebrate?

680
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,680
So??that girl who claims she's a relative of Man-wol.

681
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,160
Is she really not human?

682
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,520
There's a bit of a story.

683
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,080
She was a spirit, but ended up taking over someone's body..

684
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,040
That's enough. So we even have possessed people??

685
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,760
I promise to serve you better, and work harder!

686
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,920
Thank you.

687
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,720
- Good luck, Hyun-joong! - Let's go!

688
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,920
Chan-sung, do you like these spirits?

689
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,760
It's our first time gathering for a meal together.

690
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,320
It's always nice having a group dinner with colleagues, isn't it?

691
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,440
Sanchez, don't drink too much.

692
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,480
Because some mischievous spirits??

693
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,560
They like to possess people in their drunken stupor.

694
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,520
Do you mean that?

695
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,680
That spirit at that table over there

696
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,760
seems to be eyeing you, out of interest??

697
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,320
So be careful.

698
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,000
Ghosts too, must like handsome guys like me, huh?

699
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,080
(Dash cam setup)

700
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,160
Oh geez!

701
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,800
Is that a ghost?

702
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,080
I must be seeing ghosts now.

703
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,440
No, the camera got him crystal clear.

704
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,520
That wasn't a ghost.

705
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,440
Gosh, you scared me.

706
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,480
So he's not.

707
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,800
No need to be so scared.

708
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,960
Spirits were once people, too.

709
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,040
It's normal to be frightened. It's you who's become abnormal.

710
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,080
Chan-sung, don't associate yourself too deeply with that side.

711
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,000
I'm worried you'll end up going over to that side completely.

712
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,000
I understand what you're worried about,

713
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,920
but the spirits you saw today are all going to leave.

714
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,800
Even Man-wol?

715
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,120
Yes.

716
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,920
Including Ms. Jang Man-wol.

717
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,320
While you were gone,

718
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,680
I gave Mr. Koo the potion.

719
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,640
He didn't take it.

720
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,480
I see.

721
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:09,000
Mr. Koo must've believed you'll come back for sure.

722
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,840
And you didn't, Ms. Choi?

723
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,480
I thought it was all the better for you, to be liberated.

724
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,520
But??

725
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,040
You came back.

726
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,360
I didn't come back, not like before when I was tied to the lunar tree.

727
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,920
A new owner of this hotel will be arriving soon.

728
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,680
Old Mago is getting ready.

729
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,040
Does Mr. Koo know?

730
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,080
Yes, he knows.

731
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,080
Though neither of us has brought it up.

732
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,520
Mr. Kim, you, Ms. Choi, and Hyun-joong, too??

733
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,600
I want to send you all off well while I'm still here.

734
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,920
But??

735
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,880
I'm not sure if I'll have time now.

736
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,800
President Jang is inside.

737
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,920
Ms. Choi.

738
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,920
That pharmacist from before??

739
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,040
I dropped by to see her on my way here,

740
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,840
and she says she'll be giving birth soon.

741
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,520
If she gives birth to a son who'll continue the family line??

742
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,600
Will you still remain here?

743
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,160
Are you worried that after President Jang leaves

744
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,320
and Del Luna is gone,

745
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,160
I'll be left to wander this world?

746
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,080
You know.

747
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,160
I only just found out.

748
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,000
President Jang is no longer tied to the lunar tree.

749
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,480
She can now depart to the underworld anytime, but??

750
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,400
Now what's tying her down to this place is

751
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,000
you, Mr. Koo.

752
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:18,000
Are you worried I'll be another lunar tree to her?

753
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:24,440
Old Mago once said this to the bride,

754
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,080
who was here for a posthumous wedding.

755
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:33,920
She said it takes greater love to let go, than hold on.

756
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,480
Gosh.

757
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,880
Ugh, so heavy. So heavy!

758
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,280
What is all this?

759
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,240
The things I take out once in a while.

760
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,880
Gosh, it's piled a lot of dust.

761
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,640
This stuff is really strong.

762
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,800
Go open that.

763
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,000
- It's a camera. - Yes.

764
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,840
I used that to take all these photos from here to there.

765
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,800
It's very old.

766
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,160
Did your old general managers use this to take your photographs?

767
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,080
Let's see??

768
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,880
Ah, here.

769
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,560
The bastard who took the one of me at Manwolgwan

770
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,000
blew all my money and did a midnight run.

771
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,040
So I chased after him, only to see that his wife was heavily pregnant.

772
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,040
So I just let him go.

773
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,880
And I'm sure you know Moon-sook from Del Luna??

774
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,080
And much before that, was??

775
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,080
Ah, this one right there.

776
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,520
The general manager then was quite handsome.

777
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,720
They say anyone who's handsome is an oppa, right?

778
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,120
Well, he was more than just that.

779
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,600
I don't believe you.

780
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,600
Mr. Kim already told me,

781
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,880
that out of all the general managers

782
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,720
I'm the most handsome one.

783
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,760
He said you fell for my good looks.

784
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,000
You talk about all sorts of things with Mr. Kim.

785
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,120
Since when did you two get close?

786
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,040
Which is why,

787
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,240
you should've taken those pictures with them.

788
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,960
Then you'll have had evidence to support your claims.

789
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,680
Back then??

790
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,560
I gave no meaning to those who passed me by.

791
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,480
But now,

792
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,560
looking at the pictures with you, like this??

793
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,400
I'm starting to regret not having left any of their traces behind.

794
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,800
Then how about you do so now?

795
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,160
With that camera.

796
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,000
Hyun-joong got his honorary graduation certificate,

797
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,840
but he never took a photo.

798
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,040
Let's call everyone up and take a picture together.

799
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,080
I'll take it for you.

800
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,800
This is my first time taking a photo. Will I show up?

801
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,960
You will.

802
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,720
I once tried with my cellphone.

803
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,440
We all should've put on some more blush.

804
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,080
Everyone's so pale that anyone will be able to tell we're ghosts!

805
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,360
It's alright. What if they do?

806
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,800
Hyun-joong, keep your mouth closed when we take the photo.

807
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,360
And Mr. Kim, don't close your eyes.

808
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,640
Alright.

809
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,600
Here we go.

810
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,920
One, two, three!

811
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,040
Mr. Koo, hurry up and join us.

812
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,720
Join us!

813
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,920
Come stand here, Mr. Koo.

814
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,560
How am I supposed to put that away if you're sitting on it?

815
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,640
Hurry up and move.

816
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,040
Lift me up and carry me.

817
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,320
I said, carry me!

818
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,040
If you won't, I won't move.

819
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,440
Forget it.

820
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,480
You put it away, then.

821
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,960
Off to my room!

822
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,560
Now that we took that photo, let's go for black bean noodles.

823
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,800
Ugh!

824
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,080
You guys took a photo.

825
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,680
Everyone had a lot of fun.

826
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,000
You should've called me, too.

827
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,120
We just thought we should take it together

828
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,320
before President Jang leaves and the hotel disappears.

829
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,080
The hotel will disappear? Why?

830
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,000
Old Mago is building another lunar inn.

831
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,960
Once that happens, President Jang's Del Luna??

832
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,200
will be gone.

833
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,240
Then what about you?

834
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,920
Once the hotel disappears, will you be gone, too?

835
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,960
It's coming along nicely.

836
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,400
I hear Old Mago is brewing new wine for

837
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,640
the next owner.

838
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,000
I'll drink that, and be the owner.

839
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,840
It's Old Mago who decides on that.

840
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,400
Then why not have President Jang have a sip of it again,

841
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,040
and continue to be the owner here?

842
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,080
Do you think she'll do that? When she's finally set her free?

843
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,800
Then when's Old Mago coming?

844
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,000
Or where can I find her?

845
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,280
She's not just someone you can meet just because you wish to.

846
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,160
Then no one here can meet her?

847
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,880
It seems Mr. Koo was given permission to enter her apothecary.

848
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,240
He said he brought the firefly from that place.

849
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,160
(Apothecary - 11-28 Yakjae-golmokgil Gyeongdong Market)

850
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,160
- Cheers! - Cheers!

851
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,800
Sanchez, thank you for everything so far.

852
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,880
Let's have dinner sometime with Chan-sung. It's on me.

853
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,440
Are you moving back with your parents' place?

854
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,560
She's coming to my place.

855
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,120
You guys will be living together, I see!

856
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,800
You're in for a tough road ahead, Young-soo.

857
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,960
While Mi-ra does try to help around the house,

858
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,880
she's totally useless.

859
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,200
I'm already aware of that.

860
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,080
We've already fought so much that

861
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,800
we're now going to test our limit by sticking around 24/7.

862
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,720
Thankfully, I'm tidy.

863
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,320
And if not anything else, Mi-ra's a great cook.

864
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,400
Mi-ra?

865
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,480
Yes.

866
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,520
The kimchi and side dishes she brought me were delicious.

867
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,920
Well, I didn't make all of that??

868
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,960
My parents helped me out a bit.

869
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,080
Oh.

870
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,200
I guess you're not lying. They are from their factory, yes.

871
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,360
Factory?

872
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,880
My parents run a kimchi factory.

873
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,880
It's advertised a lot on homeshopping channels.

874
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,960
You've never heard of Daeho Kimchi?

875
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,040
Daeho Kimchi?

876
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,040
Wow, I only ever ate that brand when I lived by myself.

877
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:51,200
So that's why your side dishes suit my palate perfectly!

878
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,040
No wonder.

879
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,800
So the side dishes that you grew up on were made by my parents!

880
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,080
We really must be destined for each other.

881
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,600
You're right.

882
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,440
But both Chan-sung and I eat that kimchi,

883
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,000
as well as some tens of thousands in this country??

884
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,080
So I really wouldn't call it destiny??

885
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,760
Young-soo said it suits his palate perfectly!

886
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,960
- Right? - Of course.

887
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,200
- How about we do a cheer? - Cheers!

888
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,600
- A love shot? - Love shot!

889
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,840
Hey, we just clicked!

890
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,360
Right, I should be hoping that they get along until she leaves.

891
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,200
What if they have another fight and she doesn't leave, right?

892
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,080
- Good? - Good!

893
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,080
I take it that you're both writers.

894
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,200
This is Yi Tae-baek's favorite wine.

895
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:46,280
On my left is a bestselling author,

896
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,720
who passed away before publishing his newest work.

897
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,880
It's a pity.

898
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,080
I'd done a lot of research, and the story was interesting.

899
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,040
What kind of a novel were you working on?

900
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,520
It's about a scholar from the Joseon Dynasty.

901
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,200
Our bartender here is also a scholar who came first

902
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,120
on the state examination.

903
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,800
Is that right?

904
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,920
May I ask what your name is?

905
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,560
It's not a name that was recorded in history??

906
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,400
The protagonist of my story had also ranked first

907
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,120
on the state examinations.

908
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,240
However, this was later revoked.

909
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,200
Did that really happen?

910
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,560
He'd been the author of some rather obscene books,

911
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,520
so when he was exposed, he was heavily criticized

912
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,000
and had his acceptance revoked.

913
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It was a story about a perverted scholar.

914
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,360
How interesting.

915
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,120
What is the name of this perverted scholar?

916
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,720
He had quite a grand name.

917
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,640
Si-ik, meaning 'The Wings of Our Time.'

918
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,000
His name is Kim Si-ik.

919
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,480
If you have any shame, Kim Si-ik,

920
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,080
don't ever hold your head up high again!

921
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,440
I did complete my work, however,

922
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,120
so it may still be published posthumously.

923
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,000
I really do hope it does.

924
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,600
I hear she brewed wine containing the essence of the moon.

925
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,360
It's back to how it was.

926
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,160
No, it's different from then.

927
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,000
Back then, I'd been fixed in time

928
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,440
but this time, time started flowing again

929
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,120
to sprout leaves and bloom flowers.

930
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:12,160
Are you hoping it may sprout and bloom, once again?

931
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,040
This tree is dead now.

932
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,080
If I were to hope for another period of time like that,

933
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,200
I'd have to cross the Styx.

934
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,200
Yes, you're right.

935
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,160
Yu-na, what is it?

936
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,360
President Jang??

937
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,000
I stole the wine from Old Mago's apothecary.

938
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,200
I heard this wine is for the new owner.

939
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,960
President Jang, please drink this again

940
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,000
and remain at this hotel.

941
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,480
The girl who frequents your hotel has

942
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,120
stolen my lunar wine.

943
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,880
She probably did it out of the fear of losing Hyun-joong,

944
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,600
our frontman.

945
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,720
She didn't want the hotel to disappear.

946
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:44,000
Then she probably took it to Jang Man-wol.

947
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,040
If Man-wol drinks that

948
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,320
and regains the power of the lunar tree??

949
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,400
Hotel Del Luna will go on,

950
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,960
and you two will be able to remain together.

951
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
If Ms. Jang Man-wol makes such a choice??

952
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,440
Will you not stop her?

953
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,440
I thought you wanted to send her off well.

954
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,040
If I won't stop her,

955
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,920
what will you do?

956
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,080
Mr. Koo, Yu-na??

957
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,080
I know. Where is Ms. Jang Man-wol now?

958
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,360
On the night I was first tied to the lunar tree

959
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,280
shined a big full moon, just like now.

960
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,080
And now, the wine I had then has found its way back to me.

961
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,080
Koo Chan-sung.

962
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,600
Should I drink this wine again?

963
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,040
When I went back in time

964
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,120
and met you,

965
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,640
I wanted to take the drink you offered me

966
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,640
and remain by your side.

967
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,960
If I had done that,

968
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,200
I may have been your 85th passerby

969
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,000
and painted a portrait for you.

970
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,080
But as I was hanging the picture we took together,

971
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,200
I told myself I will be your 99th and your final general manager.

972
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:58,440
I won't let you go through another meaningless 100th cycle.

973
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,040
So??

974
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,640
Please don't drink that.

975
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,520
I knew you'd tell me that.

976
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,480
Thanks, Koo Chan-sung.

977
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,920
