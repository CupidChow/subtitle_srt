00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,566
(Episode 7)

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,566
Captain, why are you out here?

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,866
This is the best place to view
the moon, isn't it?

10
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,966
Lady Songhwa is here to see you.

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,067
Sister, why are you leaving
without a word?

12
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,866
Didn’t you sneak into
the castle to see me?

13
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
No.

14
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,834
I'm here to steal.

15
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,567
Thanks to the guard being poor,

16
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,566
I thought this was
a great night to steal.

17
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,266
I thought I'd caught someone
I'd been wanting to see.

18
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,566
But it seems I caught
a thief instead.

19
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,733
So, what did you steal?

20
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,933
This belongs to
a dear sister of mine…

21
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,500
You came to look for me,
because I didn't turn up

22
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:38,933
while you were drinking,
didn't you?

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Forget it.

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,300
It seems like you were chasing
some lady. Go on.

25
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,466
You saw that?

26
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,300
But did that really look like
I was chasing after her?

27
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,467
It was the lady
who was coming onto me.

28
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,134
Good for you.

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,333
A noble lady pours you fine wine.

30
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,800
I prefer this.

31
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,833
This is what's mine.

32
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:12,866
And this…

33
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:14,933
…is confiscated.

34
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,566
It seems like you already stole
what you came to steal,

35
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:22,500
so go back.

36
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,834
We've tightened our guard
due to rebellious forces,

37
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,367
so it's dangerous around here.

38
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:33,366
As for the wine,
I'll pay you back next time.

39
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,866
What if I become
all colorful at this rate?

40
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,100
Koo Chan-sung's going to
get cocky again if he sees this.

41
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:09,866
Oh, he's scaring me?

42
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,034
You like that?

43
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,333
What a killer, right?

44
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
You like that?

45
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,033
Step aside!

46
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,200
Hey, what was that man doing
in the women's bathroom?

47
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,367
I don't know,
he must be a pervert.

48
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,533
Bathroom?

49
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:32,200
Something definitely wasn't right.

50
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:34,700
What could it be?

51
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:49,233
Did something possess this?

52
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:57,833
You're a ghost in the shell
of a human!

53
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Was that your doing also,
just now?

54
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,267
This is your punishment for
disrupting order in the mortal world

55
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,167
when you ought to belong
to the underworld.

56
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,800
Be gone, right now!

57
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,966
It wasn't her doing.

58
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,700
That girl is a spirit that has
been excused by Jang Man-wol.

59
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,000
She's not the evil spirit
who harmed that human.

60
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,734
How did a mere spirit

61
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,067
get hold of another's body?

62
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,467
The owner of the body perished

63
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:58,234
due to
her parents' foolish choice.

64
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,534
So Jang Man-wol allowed her to
inhabit her empty body.

65
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,500
Strictly speaking, she never
harmed any human.

66
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:11,467
Jang Man-wol has been up to
her mysterious ways again.

67
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,866
You, be gone!

68
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,167
A human was just harmed in here
by a spirit.

69
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm also looking for that
evil spirit myself.

70
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:28,334
It harmed a human,
therefore it is an evil spirit.

71
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,567
Extinguish it
as soon as you catch it.

72
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,467
The other Old Mago

73
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:35,366
instructed me to return her to
her original abode.

74
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,434
Del Luna again?

75
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,400
She was a guest there.

76
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,867
Any wandering spirits
ought to be rounded up

77
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:43,700
and dragged to the underworld.

78
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,234
What's this about stopping by
for a rest?

79
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,834
What, is the passage to the
underworld, a highway?

80
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,234
Why the need for a rest stop?

81
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,034
Why did they have to
build such a place and

82
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,134
entrust it to an evil spirit
like Jang Man-wol?

83
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,834
Strictly speaking, she's not
an evil spirit.

84
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,034
And she too, will be departing to
the underworld soon.

85
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,367
I heard the news, yes.

86
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:05,434
So someone has been sent there to

87
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,333
guide Jang Man-wol to
the underworld, has he?

88
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,500
But send Jang Man-wol off to
the underworld that easily?

89
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:20,800
That spirit won't be going to
the underworld so easily,

90
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,633
because the ill-fated encounters
will soon repeat.

91
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,934
She will harm humans again,

92
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,533
and perish as an evil spirit.

93
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,300
It gives me great satisfaction to
hear you’ve had a pleasant stay.

94
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,734
If only you had found your wife,

95
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,934
you two would have
embarked together.

96
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,334
I do hope you two are reunited
in the underworld, at least.

97
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,933
The bus stop is that way.
Let me show you the way.

98
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,133
Isn't that you, honey?

99
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:06,567
Honey!

100
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:08,600
Honey, why are you…

101
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,000
Because I'm dead, that’s why!

102
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:13,100
Do you know how hard I've been
looking for you after I died?

103
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,034
You died as well?

104
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,300
I thought you lived!

105
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,167
So… who's that fellow?

106
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:23,067
Are you cheating on me
as soon as you're dead?

107
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,367
Show some respect!

108
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:27,233
He's three years older than you but
died earlier than you, that's all.

109
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:28,800
Darling.

110
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:32,067
- "Darling?"
- Oh what?

111
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,166
Who the hell are you?

112
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,133
Who the hell are you?

113
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:37,800
Don't touch my darling!

114
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:39,433
He's my first love!

115
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,666
Are you crazy?

116
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
You can't do this in here.

117
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,267
That's right, I am.

118
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,900
So don't touch my darling,
but just go your way!

119
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,166
You're so dead!

120
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,200
You two are already dead!

121
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:51,734
There's no need to kill
each other.

122
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,866
Let go of me,
I'm going to kill them both!

123
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:00,500
Mr. Koo…

124
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:01,700
You're so dead!

125
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,233
- Are you alright?
- Yes, I'm fine.

126
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:05,900
Just let them be.

127
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,567
At our hotel, we cater to
all our customers' needs and wants

128
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,567
whatever they may be.

129
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:28,300
You're already dead,

130
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:31,767
but it's not difficult to
die all over again.

131
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,000
So please do kill each other
until your heart is content.

132
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,066
Alright…

133
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,300
What will be your pick?

134
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,366
Go on.

135
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,334
Here you are, sir.

136
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,567
Stab her and slash at her
all you want.

137
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:46,600
And Madame.

138
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:50,267
You're not going to just take that,
are you? Chop him back!

139
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,800
Here, this way.

140
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:56,034
Alright, we're going to see
some blood and gore,

141
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,166
so step back.

142
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,467
Although you're already dead,

143
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,966
it is still possible to
inflict great pain.

144
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,000
So go on and butcher
all the time you've spent together.

145
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:10,967
Tear them apart,

146
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,534
stomp on them, and destroy them.

147
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,233
Meanwhile, we are here to assist
with you venting your spite.

148
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:19,034
What the hell?

149
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,200
If you see a husband
and wife at war,

150
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:22,434
you should stop them and
tell them to live a happy marriage.

151
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,066
So what the hell is this?

152
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,534
How can you live a happy marriage,

153
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,166
when you're already dead?

154
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:33,634
You won't have another second
at life,

155
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,134
so just focus on venting
your spite.

156
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,834
Whether it's blood or gore,

157
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,067
go on and enjoy yourselves.

158
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,133
Then please excuse me.

159
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,634
Just stop, you two.

160
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,366
Don't fight.

161
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,233
That's enough.

162
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,300
Well done.

163
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,866
That was wise.

164
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:14,267
I thought they were lovebirds.
So what on earth is this?

165
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,000
She said she married
any man out of despair,

166
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:20,667
after her first love,
or her true love died.

167
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,000
A wrongful encounter at
the mouth of the underworld…

168
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:26,300
Last time, it was a debtor
and a debtee and

169
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:27,834
all hell broke loose then, too.

170
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,634
Once you're dead,
there's nowhere to spend your money

171
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,034
so why break out into
a bloody fight over it?

172
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,400
Small or big,
the spite is still there.

173
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:36,600
And fighting it out is
one way to vent it.

174
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:42,367
Here's your shaved ice.

175
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,934
I better go and cater to
the wife's long desire.

176
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,700
She said she wants the
exact shaved ice

177
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,566
she had on her first date
with her first love.

178
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,467
What the hell is this?

179
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:08,000
Soju and grilled seaweed,
which we hear were your favorite.

180
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:11,033
Your wife informed us that
she'd always prepare them for you.

181
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,833
That heartless wench…

182
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:19,700
This may be a shrewd question
in a situation like this,

183
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:23,067
but do you have anyone else
you long kept in your heart?

184
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,334
No.

185
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,034
To me, my wife was my first love.

186
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,133
I want to kill myself
every time I'm reminded!

187
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:36,400
You're already dead, sir.

188
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:41,234
Thank goodness
our guests have calmed down.

189
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,500
He struck you then, didn't he?

190
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:44,934
You really need to watch out for
angry spirits.

191
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,067
It didn't hurt that much.

192
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:49,400
That's not what's important.
He struck you with bad energy!

193
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:50,500
Bad energy?

194
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:52,533
The bateful force of his anger…

195
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:55,366
It struck you right here.

196
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,634
That was close, then.

197
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,733
But it should be alright,
since President Jang was watching.

198
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,866
President Jang Man-wol?

199
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,900
I'm sure she was just there
because it got loud.

200
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:24,100
Normally, she doesn't bat an eye

201
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,634
even if our guests should break out
into a bloody fight.

202
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,234
But just now, she intervened.

203
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,367
I think it's because she didn't
want you getting hurt.

204
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:32,967
Like that's the case.

205
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:37,067
Before that, I'm not
a pushover, you know.

206
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,467
Anyway, since you were
struck by a spirit,

207
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,767
you should sprinkle some salt
on yourself.

208
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,833
This much will do.

209
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,900
She said she'll protect me,

210
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,666
and she's actually keeping
her word.

211
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:57,733
But what does that make me?

212
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,533
It's the sea.

213
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,400
The sea's beautiful.

214
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,633
I'm a bit sad now.

215
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:29,034
Because the sea I'm looking at

216
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,200
now seems more beautiful

217
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:36,866
than the sea
I was staring at before.

218
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,166
No…

219
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,900
Ms. Jang Man-wol.

220
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,600
I came to confirm something.

221
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,834
If you're going to nag,
save it for later.

222
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,066
My manicure's turning out
so well in a long while.

223
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:12,967
If this doesn't turn out well,
you're so dead.

224
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,567
Tsk, tsk…

225
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,666
Don't go around like an idiot,
getting beaten up by spirits.

226
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,634
It's a deep blue, like the sea.

227
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,134
Yes, isn't it pretty?

228
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,500
It is.

229
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:27,833
But in a sad way.

230
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:33,933
Is this the reason…

231
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,834
…why you felt sad,
staring out at the sea?

232
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,967
Because there was no yacht?

233
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:41,534
Oh, it's here!

234
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,400
I thought it'd take longer since
it's all the way from Norway.

235
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:45,667
That was quick.

236
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:46,733
Give it.

237
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,300
Are you going to purchase that?

238
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:52,167
I sold all my cars,
so why can't I have a yacht?

239
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,200
Why buy it, when you have
nowhere else to go with it?

240
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,800
Nowhere else to go with it?
What do you mean?

241
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,500
What's that, uh… That show!

242
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,767
Yes, "City Fishermen."

243
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,167
They seem to go everywhere
on their boats to fish.

244
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:06,034
So don't you worry! I have
plenty of places to go with it.

245
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,300
What about the money?
Do you have the money?

246
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:13,067
Now that's where I have
a slight problem…

247
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,534
So, about that tiger painting.
Will it really not sell?

248
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,500
Then try selling it at
a quarter price.

249
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:19,100
But still, not the yacht!

250
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,267
If you really must go fishing,

251
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,234
I'll take you to a great spot
on Wolmido island.

252
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,467
You can even drive there.

253
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:24,667
But you sold all my cars!

254
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:26,134
You still have two.

255
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,166
What? I thought there were three!

256
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,667
Ah, yes. It's three.
Sorry for the confusion.

257
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,167
Gosh, you scared me.

258
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,500
Thank goodness.

259
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:37,000
Thank goodness, huh?

260
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:38,467
Then let's go for a drive to
Wolmido Island.

261
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:39,700
I'll even look up
some great restaurants.

262
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:41,633
As for this,

263
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,366
I'm cancelling the order.

264
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,866
Gosh, my voice cracked
when I should have yelled.

265
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,833
Wolmido and blue don't
really go together…

266
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,600
Wolmido is all about its
bouncy ride.

267
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,934
I should change to a color that
really jumps out, then.

268
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,466
Wolmido, huh?

269
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,933
(To: Ms. Jang Man-wol, I love you!
From Kim Jun-hyun)

270
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,834
He said to sprinkle salt…

271
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,566
Flavored salt should also do
the job, right?

272
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,166
Chan-sung, what are you doing?

273
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,166
Sanchez!

274
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,200
You didn't leave yet?

275
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,134
I was just about to. What's that?

276
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,967
Uh… salt.

277
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,500
Salt? Why?
Did you run into bad luck?

278
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,167
I heard sprinkling salt will
ward off evil forces.

279
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,034
Evil forces?

280
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,233
By "evil force,"
you don’t mean Mi-ra, do you?

281
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,867
Did Mi-ra steal your card again?

282
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:13,534
Or did she take out
a loan under your name?

283
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,134
That's right, she did all that
to me in the past.

284
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,400
Now it's starting to hurt where
that spirit struck me!

285
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:21,167
I have Himalayan pink salt.
How about that instead?

286
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,934
Why use such fine salt for
such a purpose?

287
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,233
This flavored salt is enough.

288
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,834
Hey, give that to me.
I'll sprinkle it for you.

289
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Sure.

290
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,134
Sanchez, don't you think
you're sprinkling too much?

291
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,666
I'm not some cabbage
being salted for kimchi.

292
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:42,334
It's stuck. It won't come out.

293
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Really?

294
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,500
That's right, is Man-wol going to
buy that yacht?

295
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,600
You're the one who introduced her
to that Norwegian yacht maker?

296
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,834
I uploaded a picture of my yacht
on social media,

297
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,700
and Man-wol asked me where
I got it, so I told her.

298
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:59,300
She was planning to buy
something so expensive?

299
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:02,234
She's the owner of your hotel,
isn't she? I don't see why not.

300
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,534
I was going to introduce to her
to our yacht club, too.

301
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,034
By yacht club, do you mean
one of those elite social clubs?

302
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,434
It'll help
with her hotel business.

303
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,300
By the way,
she's not seeing anyone, is she?

304
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:14,800
Why do you ask?

305
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:16,367
I was thinking of introducing
one of the club members to her.

306
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,534
If it's a yacht club,
go sail yachts.

307
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,934
What's with the matchmaking?

308
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,567
It's through clubs like these that
you meet your business partner

309
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:24,234
and your partner in life.

310
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,534
I mean, I met Veronica there.

311
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,100
What do you think of this guy?

312
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,600
Won't he be a good match for her?

313
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,900
I think he's too skinny.

314
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:34,900
What, him?

315
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:36,900
Ms. Jang Man-wol's type is…

316
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:40,167
Kim Jun-hyun!
Her type is Kim Jun-hyun.

317
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,367
Someone who can shove down
five dumplings at once.

318
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,734
Really? Then…

319
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,400
What about him?
Don't you think he's alright?

320
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,667
I think he's too young.

321
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:51,867
He's over 30!

322
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:55,034
Ms. Jang Man-wol is a lot older
than she appears to be.

323
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,600
Much older than
you can ever imagine!

324
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,834
So nope, he's too young.

325
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,167
Then, who'd be suitable?

326
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:04,334
Sanchez, Ms. Jang Man-wol doesn't
have the money for a yacht.

327
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,434
She can't meet the requisites to
join the club.

328
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,634
So don't just introduce her
to anyone.

329
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,200
Then if not a yacht club,

330
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:13,767
there's always the tennis club
or the golf club…

331
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,166
Sanchez!

332
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:22,534
Since when were you so
into sports?

333
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,166
Aren't you
an all-rounded sportsman?

334
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,966
It's too bad though,
Ms. Jang Man-wol's not into sports.

335
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,800
So Sanchez,
where's that Himalayan pink salt?

336
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:39,100
Go look over there.

337
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,733
So he likes Man-wol.

338
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,366
Jeez, it's everywhere.

339
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,467
Ugh, it's sweet.

340
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,467
Hey, this is sugar.

341
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:52,100
That guy just sprinkled sugar!

342
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,533
We're going to get cockroaches
in here, ugh.

343
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,267
This is your punishment for
disrupting order in the mortal world.

344
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,933
Be gone, right now!

345
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,167
She's really weak now.

346
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm going to take her body.

347
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,466
Hey, hey!

348
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:48,966
Don't!

349
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,533
Don't!

350
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,066
Hey…

351
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,100
Come here!

352
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,067
What's wrong with her?

353
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:08,067
Oh what?

354
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,534
- Has she really lost it?
- I think she's gone mad.

355
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,834
What do we do,
shouldn't we call the teacher?

356
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,500
We should call an ambulance.

357
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:16,267
Call the police.

358
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,300
Shouldn't we tell someone?

359
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:19,934
What if she's really possessed?

360
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,366
- Can you move?
- Oh no…

361
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,266
Don't…

362
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,066
No… no!

363
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:40,300
Yu-na, it's me.

364
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:48,133
You can come out now.

365
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,166
It's okay.

366
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,333
Let's go.

367
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,000
Is there a place where she can
lay down and get some rest?

368
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:31,034
There's the nurse's office
down the corridor.

369
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Thanks.

370
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,766
Looks like something happened.

371
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,267
Was it the fourth Old Mago

372
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,000
who hurt our intern?

373
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:20,634
The fourth one,
in the black dress.

374
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,634
Don't number God.

375
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,634
Though she appears
in different forms,

376
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,167
she does with one intention.

377
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:29,200
She doesn't even appear in
the form humans wish for,

378
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:32,966
so dismissing everything as
"God's will" is a little unfair.

379
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,467
What Old Mago tried to punish is

380
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,800
the evil spirit who was
a guest here.

381
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:40,400
Will she extinguish her
if she finds her?

382
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:43,400
Another face of God instructed me
to bring her back for a good rest.

383
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,734
God's will always has to be
so damn confusing.

384
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,900
Both the benevolence
and the heartlessness

385
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:52,500
are all her.

386
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,400
The first Old Mago who wishes for
me to depart all colorful,

387
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:59,367
and the fourth Old Mago who is
so desperate to extinguish me

388
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:01,234
once I turn into an evil spirit…

389
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,867
Sure, they're all the same God.

390
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:07,167
But… who do you suppose is
more powerful?

391
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:08,800
Number one, or number four?

392
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:10,900
Don't…

393
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:12,833
...number God.

394
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,533
So shrewd.

395
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,233
Though I may not know their
hierarchy, I get their will.

396
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,233
Whatever happens, I won't be here.

397
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,200
What?

398
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,600
This is my will.

399
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:48,334
Yu-na said she felt
an eerie vibe from this phone.

400
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,967
It seems the guest from room 13
harmed humans through

401
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:54,566
a video that was shared
via smartphones.

402
00:27:57,433 --> 00:28:00,600
To confirm that's the case,
we'll need to play this.

403
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,200
But to summon the spirit

404
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:04,834
we need a human as bait.

405
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,467
So who?

406
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:09,400
I'm not quite sure who
to recommend.

407
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,400
Who else is there at our hotel
to be the bait?

408
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:16,200
Go call Koo Chan-sung.

409
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:24,966
I don't want to.

410
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:29,200
From what was said in
this chatroom,

411
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:31,367
this video was clearly
filmed without consent.

412
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:34,867
In such a case, not only filming but
viewing it is a crime.

413
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:36,800
I won't ever
watch something like this.

414
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:50,033
How respectable. And smart.

415
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:54,134
But you need to be brave, too.

416
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
Because we need to
look for a spirit.

417
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:57,834
What, from in here?

418
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,467
It's the guest from room 13.

419
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:03,134
To find her,
you need to play the video.

420
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,467
Then… the reason
she ended up like that.

421
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:07,934
Is it to do with an unpleasant
video like this one?

422
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,100
It could be something
very unpleasant,

423
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,433
or something extremely horrifying.

424
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,166
So, will you?

425
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,133
It's an empty room.

426
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,633
There's no-one there.

427
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,834
Huh? But Yu-na said
when the phone rang,

428
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,267
something wasn't right.

429
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,833
She was definitely here.

430
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,333
Here…?

431
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:12,300
I can still feel her grudge
in this room.

432
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:14,767
This is the room that she created.

433
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:17,667
Then… this isn't a spy cam video?

434
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,000
No.

435
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:23,100
This is a room she built
out of her deep grudge.

436
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:25,867
I'm pretty sure there are
many more like this one.

437
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:27,834
Yu-na said she felt
a chill down her spine

438
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,634
even before the man started
playing the video.

439
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,134
She obviously had set targets and
sent the videos to them.

440
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,133
Then… she must have a next target.

441
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,467
Where do you think she is now?

442
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:41,500
She probably sent this
exact room to her target,

443
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:43,300
and is lying in wait,

444
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:45,066
eager to kill him
should he press play.

445
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,700
Stop looking at your phone
when you're with your daughter.

446
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:03,134
This is for work.

447
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,133
I have some files to
send to my clients.

448
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:51,933
Honey.

449
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:54,633
Honey!

450
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:05,200
Five years have passed
since my sister died,

451
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:08,100
but that video continues
to circulate.

452
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:10,434
I'm sure you know already
if you've done your research

453
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,167
about spy-cam victims.

454
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,133
You can never erase them all.

455
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,200
You're right.

456
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:19,166
Were the offenders
brought to justice?

457
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:21,133
Justice?

458
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:25,300
They only had to pay a small fine,
when Ga-young is dead.

459
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:34,134
Is he one of the offenders?

460
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,200
He was a year above
Ga-young in college.

461
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:39,534
The video was shared among the
male students through a chatroom,

462
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,133
and that's how it was leaked.

463
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:53,334
Those people that she'd greet
in college every day…

464
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,033
They'd play the video and snicker
behind her back.

465
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,633
I'll have to think about this one.

466
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:07,100
Do you remember the students
who shared the videos?

467
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,467
How could I ever forget them?

468
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,500
I remember every one of
their names.

469
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:13,200
If just one had told her about it,

470
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,167
we would've been able to stop
the video from being leaked.

471
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:16,833
And my sister…

472
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,233
She wouldn't have died.

473
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,967
She holed her in up room
like a mad woman,

474
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:28,600
scouring the net in case
another one had been uploaded.

475
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,866
That's how my sister died.
She shriveled up!

476
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:32,300
(Engineering Goddess Will
Take You to Heaven Tonight)

477
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,167
Now that she's left this world…

478
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:50,500
She should be resting
in peace, right?

479
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,766
I very much hope so, too.

480
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:25,567
One of the members
in the chatroom…

481
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:27,666
He took the video and sold it.

482
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:34,900
What's ironic is,

483
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:37,200
that bastard launched
a video streaming company

484
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:39,333
and he's having the best time
out of all of them.

485
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,834
He's sure doing so well,

486
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,400
that I just want to kill him.

487
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:57,634
Don't fume,
it'll only exhaust you.

488
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,533
This is really nice, by the way.
You should try one.

489
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm fine.

490
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,333
It's the last one in the box that
tastes the best, you know.

491
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:11,734
Even that spirit saved the
baddest for the last.

492
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,867
That's why she's sure to
appear in front of him.

493
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:15,934
And before the video is
sent to that man's phone,

494
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,866
we'll get her and
go back to Del Luna.

495
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,267
I don't know. Do you think
she'll follow us that easily,

496
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,800
leaving behind her
most delicious prey?

497
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,334
God sure is unfair,

498
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,100
leaving bastards like that to
live a good life.

499
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,866
That's why I hate her.

500
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,600
Just as I thought.
The last is always the best.

501
00:35:47,366 --> 00:35:51,100
Mr. Koo Chan-sung from
Hotel Del Luna?

502
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:53,366
Del Luna…

503
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,867
It must be a hotel that
opened quite recently.

504
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:59,633
No, it's been around for
quite a long time.

505
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:03,334
Are you interested in
advertising on our website?

506
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,200
No way.

507
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,300
I'm here on behalf of
one of our guests.

508
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,934
She is very keen to…

509
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,767
...meet with you, sir.

510
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:12,966
Me?

511
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Who could she be, and
why does she want to meet me?

512
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:22,367
She holds a deep grudge
against you.

513
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:23,533
Me?

514
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,533
I've never done anyone harm.

515
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,466
What are you doing?

516
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,734
You have a really nice yacht.

517
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,600
I'm thinking of
buying one, just like this.

518
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,066
That is the president of
our hotel.

519
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:48,900
Gosh, you've been to
some nice places.

520
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:51,200
I should've visited them too,
before I died.

521
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,833
Stop it.

522
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:58,334
It's rude to take pictures in

523
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
someone else's private space.

524
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:01,466
Is it?

525
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,366
What are you doing?

526
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:11,900
Your ass is eating your pants.

527
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:13,767
Look…

528
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,834
How much can I expect to make

529
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,834
out of uploading pictures
taken without consent?

530
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,400
10 cents per picture?
Or 20 cents?

531
00:37:22,466 --> 00:37:26,067
I wonder how many
you have to upload,

532
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:29,366
until you can afford a yacht and
luxury trips like that.

533
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:31,734
One million, then?

534
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,934
Are you here to
investigate something?

535
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,400
What, are you journalists?

536
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:37,100
Or the police?

537
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,867
That talk about the hotel…
It's all a sham, isn't it?

538
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:43,100
No wonder.
I thought I'd never heard of it.

539
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,334
To prove that it's not a sham,

540
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,233
I guess we'll have to invite you.

541
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,500
Get out,

542
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:53,033
before I call the guards.

543
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,800
If you ever see our hotel,

544
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,733
please do drop by!

545
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Let's go.

546
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:17,800
"You do your best,

547
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:20,300
and God shall do the rest."

548
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:26,066
You? You believe in
something like that?

549
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:30,833
I lived an honest life,
true to my beliefs.

550
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,334
If this is the life

551
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,100
God granted you for
"doing your best"…

552
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,466
Then God sure is unfair.

553
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:01,933
This is his phone.

554
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:07,034
Good work, Koo Chan-sung.

555
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,600
We better get to the hotel before
the video arrives, right?

556
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:10,966
That means I should hurry.

557
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,633
Our frail Koo Chan-sung has
done his best,

558
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,033
so I wonder what
God will do now for him.

559
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:38,467
It's been a while,
so why isn't it here yet?

560
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,467
Is the battery flat?

561
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:43,167
The Wi-Fi signal's strong here,
too.

562
00:39:43,233 --> 00:39:46,133
The video was definitely
shared via smartphones...

563
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,767
Videos…

564
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:53,000
…aren't only played
on smartphones.

565
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:00,166
Did you check
the security cameras?

566
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,867
I'm positive that it's the guys
who came in earlier today

567
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:05,767
who stole my smartphone!

568
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:06,667
The thing is…

569
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:09,466
Strangely enough, all the footage
during that time were deleted.

570
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:11,766
Do you think that makes sense?

571
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:15,967
How many security cameras
do you think we have here?

572
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:17,734
Look carefully, and find it!

573
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Yes, sir.

574
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,667
It looks like the videos weren't
just sent through smartphones.

575
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:49,200
I better go back.

576
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:51,233
Koo Chan-sung, there's nothing more
for you to do.

577
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:54,933
The rest will be taken care of.

578
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:58,566
Taken care of? By who?

579
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,633
Old Mago will be there.

580
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:07,400
And I'm very curious
in what form she'll appear.

581
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,233
Will it be in her benevolent,
or in her heartless form?

582
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,000
(Jung Eun-seok, CEO)

583
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:35,033
(This is the video
you've been waiting for)

584
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,034
What the…

585
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,033
This isn't our office.

586
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,500
Who the hell is she?

587
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,266
What the…

588
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:21,233
Oh what?

589
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:27,833
Has our system been hacked?

590
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,700
The security's crap, damnit!

591
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:13,100
Look at me.

592
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,366
What the…

593
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,933
I'll show you a killer time.

594
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:33,733
You are an evil spirit
who harmed humans.

595
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,966
Be gone, forever!

596
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,400
Now that she's left this world…

597
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:25,400
She should be resting
in peace, right?

598
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:02,700
Why won't God

599
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:06,300
come to humans
in the form they wish her to?

600
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,500
Let's drink to console
our perished spirit.

601
00:48:17,466 --> 00:48:19,867
Mr. Koo seems very upset.

602
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:22,167
He only burned himself

603
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,766
after getting cocky about
sending off a few guests.

604
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:29,533
Ah, hot!

605
00:48:34,566 --> 00:48:35,700
That was hot.

606
00:48:36,033 --> 00:48:38,167
That's because he's sincere.

607
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:41,467
Koo Chan-sung is a good man.

608
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:43,233
So good that I feel bad for
hating him.

609
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,434
Even if you had been a little early,
it was probably no use.

610
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,700
That's what God decided,
after all.

611
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:10,166
Can that happen to
anyone in this hotel?

612
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:12,766
You mean, perishing?

613
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,233
Yes.

614
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:18,700
Because we're all spirits, too.

615
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:23,734
We ought to depart for
the underworld,

616
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,900
so remaining here
always bears that risk.

617
00:49:27,866 --> 00:49:30,167
It's risky, so…

618
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,300
Why are you still here?

619
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:35,366
Did you die a sad, painful death
like that guest?

620
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,667
Is everyone who's here like that?

621
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:41,900
Including Mr. Kim, and Ms. Choi?

622
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:57,300
At least we don't run out
and cause trouble.

623
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,466
Don't worry.

What is this?

628
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,800
An invitation.

629
00:50:53,966 --> 00:50:55,633
There's someone we were going to
invite, remember?

630
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:58,234
You're going to invite him?

631
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,100
When our guest is no longer
with us?

632
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:03,167
We failed to serve our guest
to our best.

633
00:51:03,233 --> 00:51:07,633
So we ought to do
what she wanted, at least.

00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,700
Make a left turn.

643
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,100
Make a right turn.

644
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,200
Go straight.

645
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,100
Make a left turn.

646
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:17,000
Make a right turn.

647
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:20,233
Make a U-turn!

648
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,000
Go straight.

649
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:33,800
Is this really the right way?

650
00:53:33,866 --> 00:53:36,466
I said, go straight!

651
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Stop!

652
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,433
What the…

653
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:00,800
What is this place?

654
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,500
Hotel Del Luna…?

655
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,333
Did I really come here?

656
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:12,533
(Hotel Del Luna)

657
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,734
Welcome, sir.

658
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,666
You're here under
our invitation, aren't you?

659
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,867
Our president is waiting for you.

660
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:37,933
This way.

661
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,267
Huh?

662
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:51,333
You are…

663
00:54:54,266 --> 00:54:55,267
Welcome.

664
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,734
We have a room ready for you,
Mr. Jung Eun-seok.

665
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,433
Oh, so the hotel actually existed!

666
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,066
So, how did you do it?

667
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:07,133
Did you hack my navigator, too?

668
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,433
You've been invited by
our president, have you not?

669
00:55:17,733 --> 00:55:18,866
Please follow me.

670
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:41,334
This is the room.

671
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,034
The room that our guest,
who we said was looking for you,

672
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,333
had been staying in.

673
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:53,967
You said you never harmed anyone.

674
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:55,700
Or did something suddenly
resurface in your memories?

675
00:55:57,866 --> 00:56:00,533
Let's see why you're
doing this to me, then.

676
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:21,966
This is…

677
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:30,366
Do you remember now?

678
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:34,267
This is my old place.

679
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:37,700
Do you remember what you did
in here, too?

680
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:31,167
How is this room still here?

681
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:33,000
What is this place?

682
00:57:33,066 --> 00:57:34,300
A hotel.

683
00:57:34,366 --> 00:57:37,400
A hotel that lies on the border of
our world and the underworld,

684
00:57:37,466 --> 00:57:39,366
for spirits to drop by.

685
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,634
Don't joke with me.

686
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,700
Like there's anything like that!

687
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,000
Was that a dream?

688
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:16,133
That wasn't a dream.

689
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,600
Who the hell are you?

690
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:23,700
I invited you to my hotel,
remember?

691
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:26,534
That wasn't a dream?

692
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,334
It's not a place you can go to
in your dream.

693
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,700
Only in your death.

694
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:32,633
I… I'm dead?

695
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,600
No, you're not exactly dead.

696
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:38,900
I was curious about something,

697
00:58:38,966 --> 00:58:40,734
so in order to call your soul here

698
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,366
I parked your car at the border of
life and death.

699
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,566
What?

700
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:11,234
What's the rush?

701
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,134
I said I was curious
about something.

702
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,033
What are you so curious about?

703
00:59:16,566 --> 00:59:19,166
Did you finally remember,
after you went into that room?

704
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,034
The guest who went to see you.

705
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:30,133
Do you remember who she is?

706
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:33,800
That woman…

707
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,900
I'll show you a killer time.

708
00:59:42,266 --> 00:59:43,767
Who is she?

709
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,334
You killed her.

710
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,733
- I never killed anyone!
- You did.

711
00:59:48,366 --> 00:59:49,934
You stripped her naked
and threw her on the streets,

712
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,366
until she was ravaged by
people's stares.

713
00:59:53,733 --> 00:59:54,866
You better remember.

714
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,300
I don't know…
I really don't know who she is!

715
01:00:07,366 --> 01:00:09,334
How can you not,
after what you did?

716
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,600
Think harder!

717
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,967
Alright, it was me who did it,

718
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:19,933
but I don't know which one of
those girls!

719
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,767
It was a dream.

720
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:57,933
Yes, a dream.

721
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,933
Jeez, I really thought
I was going to die back there.

722
01:01:08,533 --> 01:01:10,567
He failed to produce
a proper answer,

723
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,100
so why did you send him back?

724
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:17,566
Because that wasn't what
I was curious about.

725
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,466
I did my best to prove that
he's absolutely the worst.

726
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,300
So what will God do now?

727
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,434
Ah, now I remember.

728
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,600
Yoon Ga-young.

729
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,566
That's right.
I heard she committed suicide.

730
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:49,000
Now I remember.

731
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,200
Damnit!

732
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,834
The identity of the victim of
the train accident that

733
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,600
occurred early this morning
on the Gyeongbu line has been

734
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,834
confirmed as Mr. Jung Eun-seok,
President of World Disk.

735
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,267
Mr. Jung had been under
investigation by the police for

736
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:02,667
operating slush funds and
uploading of illegal content.

737
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:05,834
The cause of the accident is
yet unclear.

738
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,134
The police suspect that the
secret organization that he headed,

739
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,767
which was responsible for
uploading illegal contents,

740
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:14,367
may be linked to the case but
no evidence has yet been found.

741
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:17,300
Meanwhile, the dash-cam
from Jung's car…

742
01:03:17,366 --> 01:03:20,733
It seems there is a God after all.

743
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:25,234
Fortunately, there have been
no other serious injuries,

744
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,433
and only a few passengers
who were on board at the time…

745
01:03:27,433 --> 01:03:29,467
(You do your best,)

746
01:03:29,533 --> 01:03:32,000
(and God shall do the rest)

747
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,467
I'm a lot better now.

748
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:40,367
I'm only here because
I didn't want to go to school.

749
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:44,366
Tell your classmates it was a bug
that scared you and go to school.

750
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,767
Hey, if you like school that much

751
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,467
you should just
go to school with me.

752
01:03:49,533 --> 01:03:53,200
You can just show yourself to
other people like last time.

753
01:03:53,266 --> 01:03:55,734
I can't keep it up for long.

754
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,133
Especially during midday.

755
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:00,634
Then how about
you go out with me now?

756
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:01,933
I'll buy you something delicious.

757
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,500
Brother.

758
01:04:06,066 --> 01:04:07,266
Brother?

759
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:10,866
Your brother's right here.

760
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,334
That old man there apparently
founded this hospital.

761
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,900
He knows Yu-na's father,
so I had to say hello to him.

762
01:04:54,466 --> 01:04:56,634
But how funny it is,

763
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,300
his name's the same as yours.

764
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:00,700
Ji Hyun-joong.

765
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,566
Brother…

766
01:05:08,366 --> 01:05:10,600
What is it? Does your legs hurt?

767
01:05:12,866 --> 01:05:15,400
Shall I carry you? Here.

768
01:05:17,433 --> 01:05:18,466
Get on my back.

769
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,634
Hyun-mi, how much do you like me?

770
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,067
This much.

771
01:05:26,133 --> 01:05:28,334
What? Only that much?

772
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,700
This much!

773
01:05:30,366 --> 01:05:33,233
That much? As much as
the gap in your teeth?

774
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:42,966
Ji Hyun-joong.

775
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,166
Ji Hyun-joong!

776
01:05:47,633 --> 01:05:48,500
Huh?

777
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,667
Sorry.

778
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:53,534
I wasn't calling for you, sir.

779
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,233
Sorry.

780
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,367
Ji Hyun…

781
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:00,433
Oh what?

782
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:05,466
Why does he always
disappear without a word?

783
01:06:11,766 --> 01:06:16,367
Hyun-joong's sister is
now pretty old, isn't she?

784
01:06:16,433 --> 01:06:20,100
I heard both her eyesight
and her health is failing.

785
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:23,533
It won't be long until
we bid Hyun-joong farewell, then.

786
01:06:25,433 --> 01:06:26,700
Uh…

787
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,400
Are they all boarding
the bus today?

788
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:39,067
You go ahead first.
I'll board it later.

789
01:06:39,133 --> 01:06:41,900
I'll go on first.
You stay here a little longer.

790
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:45,734
I got to spend all my life
with you, my first love,

791
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,334
so you spend all the time
you wanted

792
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,300
but couldn't,
with your first love.

793
01:06:52,866 --> 01:06:55,233
Thank you. Goodbye.

794
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,333
The bus stop's that way.

795
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,700
You're angry, aren't you?

796
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,500
So is my sister.

797
01:07:30,566 --> 01:07:33,500
Because you dared
put God to the test.

798
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:36,734
I would have welcomed you

799
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,834
if you had come to our guest
in your form right now.

800
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,800
If we come to you
in the forms you want,

801
01:07:41,866 --> 01:07:44,666
you never make the effort,
you see…

802
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:50,800
It seems you're doing well,
however.

803
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:53,300
It looks like flowers
will be blooming soon.

804
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,200
Take good care of her,

805
01:08:01,266 --> 01:08:03,566
so you can send her off well.

806
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,300
Isn't it beautiful?

807
01:08:11,966 --> 01:08:13,666
The sea's beautiful.

808
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:16,433
Right.

809
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:21,633
So beautiful, it's sad.

810
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:25,933
It's beautiful.

811
01:08:27,266 --> 01:08:28,400
So beautiful, it's sad.

812
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:43,134
Jung Eun-seok's slush funds
have been discovered.

813
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,467
They were discovered
in a field of sunflowers

814
01:08:45,533 --> 01:08:47,267
near where he was born.

815
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:49,000
A bundle of 50 dollar notes…

816
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:52,400
You know how he asked us if
we were the police or journalists?

817
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:55,766
That's because he was up to
no good in the first place.

818
01:08:56,433 --> 01:09:00,234
Anyway, the owner of that field
must be an idiot like you.

819
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,167
If he knew 4 million dollars
was buried there,

820
01:09:02,233 --> 01:09:05,234
why report it? He should've
bagged it all for himself!

821
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,700
Tsk, tsk…

822
01:09:08,966 --> 01:09:12,667
So that's why he had a photo of
the sunflowers in his office.

823
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:13,733
What?

824
01:09:14,566 --> 01:09:17,266
Don't you remember?
You took a photo of it.

825
01:09:17,933 --> 01:09:20,700
That's why he was all ticked off
when you took those photos.

826
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:21,766
Photos?

827
01:09:24,633 --> 01:09:25,933
That's enough.

828
01:09:39,366 --> 01:09:40,766
No way…

829
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,934
I had all that money
right in front of me,

830
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,867
but never realized it!

831
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:48,800
I should've asked him about that!

832
01:09:48,866 --> 01:09:51,866
Jeez, that's all mine!

833
01:09:51,866 --> 01:09:54,166
(Police are investigating
its links to Jung's death)

834
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:56,167
My four million dollars!

835
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:58,267
How is that your money?

836
01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:00,266
You have no right to
claim it as your own.

837
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:03,866
My money…

838
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,100
Chan-sung's out on my yacht,

839
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,933
to coax his boss who's mad.

840
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,033
Chan-sung's out on your yacht
with his boss at the hotel?

841
01:10:18,933 --> 01:10:21,067
What, is he brown-nosing?

842
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:23,800
I wouldn't call it that,
but a date instead?

843
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,900
I just blew four million dollars,

844
01:10:32,966 --> 01:10:35,700
so I'm not in the mood to
cruise around someone else's yacht.

845
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:39,100
I've said this again and again,
but how is that your money?

846
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:42,033
You can't claim it as your own,
just because you took one photo!

847
01:10:42,733 --> 01:10:45,367
Enough. You know…

848
01:10:45,433 --> 01:10:47,667
Can't you at least say,

849
01:10:47,733 --> 01:10:49,467
"You must be so upset."

850
01:10:49,533 --> 01:10:53,500
Or, "Then how about
I buy you a yacht for you instead?"

851
01:10:53,566 --> 01:10:55,434
Why do you have to slap me
where it hurts instead?

852
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,966
Then I'll buy you a yacht.

853
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,066
Here. Now that I took a photo,
it's yours, Ms. Jang.

854
01:11:13,533 --> 01:11:16,534
Only a thief covets
what's not theirs.

855
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,834
I was a thief originally.

856
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,367
Didn't you see it, in your dreams?

857
01:11:20,433 --> 01:11:23,267
So all your buddies were bandits?

858
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:26,800
But the man you were marrying seemed
to belong to upper class.

859
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,600
Me? Get married?

860
01:11:34,766 --> 01:11:37,233
I saw you in a red wedding dress.

861
01:11:39,866 --> 01:11:41,034
It was extravagant,

862
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,333
so I assumed you were
marrying a nobility.

863
01:11:45,866 --> 01:11:47,100
That's…

864
01:11:47,866 --> 01:11:49,866
I stole someone else's
wedding gown and wore it.

865
01:12:03,966 --> 01:12:05,233
Koo Chan-sung…

866
01:12:07,566 --> 01:12:09,800
I was a bad person.

867
01:12:09,866 --> 01:12:12,100
I am still,

868
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,266
but I was worse than now.

869
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,367
You have the ability to
look into me,

870
01:12:18,433 --> 01:12:23,533
so you'll slowly find out
how bad I was.

871
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,366
Hey, what's up?

872
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:42,433
Where, did you say?

873
01:13:35,566 --> 01:13:36,800
Chan-sung!

874
01:13:37,533 --> 01:13:38,800
Ah, Mi-ra.

875
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:05,900
(Hotel Del Luna)

876
01:15:06,466 --> 01:15:08,700
Are there any other secrets to this
hotel which I don’t know about?

877
01:15:08,766 --> 01:15:12,634
President Jang Man-wol can
never leave this hotel.

878
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:13,900
Let's share the good stuff.

879
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:17,167
It's better to see it
and enjoy it together.

880
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:18,967
What I have is hell.

881
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:22,334
It's not nice at all,
to view hell together.

882
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,700
Just let her pass you by.

883
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:26,500
How can I just let her pass me by?

884
01:15:26,566 --> 01:15:27,534
Don't.

885
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,134
Run, Koo Chan-sung!

886
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,267
Whether this is your prison
or your fence…

887
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:34,833
I'll be here with you.
