1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:06,144
I was worried because I couldn't reach you.

2
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:10,238
Sorry.

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,209
I wasn't in a good mood

4
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,563
today, so...

5
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:21,838
I missed you.

6
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:42,152
I'll get going.

7
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,161
Now that I got to see you.

8
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:57,148
Do you want to go to a cafe?

9
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,980
I mean, you said you're not in a good mood.

10
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:14,540
Never mind, it would've closed.

11
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,634
Or... Do you want to go for karaoke?

12
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,694
@User Not Found

13
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,436
Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:44,933
You hated singing, right?

15
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:48,190
I'm sorry I didn't think that far.

16
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,424
I don't hate it.

17
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:08,625
I actually... like it.

18
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:12,215
I mean...

19
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:21,016
I liked it.

20
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,411

00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:08,037
I did think about it.

29
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,408
But

30
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,985
as expected, I couldn't do it.

31
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:17,479
I think you'll be good at it, you have a nice voice.

32
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,467
Sing for us.

33
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,865
- Oh!
- Hey, Yi Joon doesn't sing.

34
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:22,542
- Do you think he'll sing?
- Is Shin Yi Joon going to sing?

35
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:26,747
Shin Yi Joon! Shin Yi Joon!

36
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:30,182
I won't. Not in front of others.

37
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,687
Still?

38
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,784
Because of you.

39
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:41,680
Alright, next is Yu Min Jae's...

40
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,324
Yeah, let's listen to Min Jae sing.

41
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,363
Min Jae, what are you going to sing?

42
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:46,631
2 years ago
- Why is it always soccer?
- Basketball!

43
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:48,353
- Why basketball?
- Basketball is really not it.

44
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,392
- All of a sudden?
- This really isn't it.

45
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:51,427
Dude, do it on your own.

46
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:52,443
Do it on your own.

47
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:54,015
- Then, gaming cafe?
- Gaming cafe, gaming cafe, go!

48
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:56,028
Come on, I said let's play soccer What do you mean gaming cafe?

49
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,647
- We don't have enough people for soccer.
- Huh?

50
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:00,643
- Games?
- Gaming cafe.

51
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,286
We should go for games, come on.

52
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:03,944
- Two hours?
- What game should we play?

53
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:04,930
Who is he?

54
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,028
My cousin, Yi Joon.

55
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,799
Yi Joon.

56
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,592
Let's play soccer later.

57
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,985
You can be the striker.

58
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:18,040
And the goalkeeper because you're tall.

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,705
I always thought that you were amazing.

60
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:26,531
You're smart and good at making friends.

61
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,394
Even if you help me like this, it's still difficult for me.

62
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:39,535
And then for the first time

63
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:42,571
I found something that I thought I might be good at.

64
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:45,256
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

65
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:47,355
One, two, three!

66
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,833
Hello! I'm Kim Taehyung.

67
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,640
My height is 172kg.

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,211
- My weight is 52...
- Dude!

69
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,179
Why?

70
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,884
Oh? Oh, right, darn it.

71
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:58,120
- Don't be nervous and—
- I'm so nervous.

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,454
- Mention the name of the agency.
- Oh, right, right.

73
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:02,905
Hello, I'm Kim Taehyung.

74
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:05,125
I am applying for an audition at Why Entertainment.

75
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,635
Hello!

76
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:08,907
I am applying for this...

77
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:10,686
- Why... Enter—
- Oh, what are you doing?

78
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,129
"Hello!" What is this?

79
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,251
Oh, I'm so nervous.

80
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:15,607
When I did it, you said it was nothing.

81
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,214
- Again, again.
- I'll try again.

82
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:18,248
Hello!

83
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:23,044
I'm Shin Yi Joon, applying for this audition at Why Entertainment.

84
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,979
Um, my specialty is singing.

85
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,774
I will begin.

86
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,515
Okay, we're ready.

87
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,548
- We just have to click it!
- Hold on, hold on.

88
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:46,602
Dude, shall we pray?

89
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:49,742
Okay.

90
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,785
I've practically prayed to almost all the gods.

91
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,455
It's forty-four minutes right now, I'll click after one minute.

92
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,024
- Okay?
- Okay.

93
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,218
I'll click it at quarter to! We have a minute left.

94
00:05:58,218 --> 00:05:59,235
Forty seconds.

95
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:01,194
- Dude, what time is it now?
- Forty-five seconds.

96
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,821
Dude!

97
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,937
Argh! Cover it!

98
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:13,231
Dude, promise me.

99
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:15,902
That we will root for each other regardless of the results.

100
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:17,644
- Of course.
- For real?

101
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,558
Root for each other even if just one of us passes!

102
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:21,269
Hold on, alright

103
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:24,233
Oh, that was so tough.

104
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,203
So I wanted to show you.

105
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:27,208
Oh, right.

106
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,234
When will you come home later?

107
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:30,695
Why?

108
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,339
Because your words were most important to me.

109
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,119
Never mind.

110
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,371
Call me later when you come.

111
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,216
I'll get going first.

112
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm so sleepy.

113
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,315
What's with you? This is gross.

114
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:05,413
But I'm hungry.

115
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:06,725
Dude, what should we eat?

116
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:09,494
- Dude, isn't he amazing?
- He's really good.

117
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,056
- Dude, what is it?
- Wow!

118
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,420
Wow, aren't I better?

119
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,885
Why? He's good.

120
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:16,382
Hey, rap for us, rap.

121
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:17,592
- Rap?
- Yeah.

122
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:19,840
Koo koo ka ka.

123
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,887
I'm better, aren't I?

124
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,643
- Dude, you're good.
- Can I brag?

125
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:26,905
Hey!

126
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:29,914
Stop it.

127
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,762
I had nothing to ask you.

128
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,034
What was even worse was that...

129
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,729
in my head, at that moment...

130
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:03,868
- Rap for us, rap.
- Rap?

131
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:04,760
Okay.

132
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,476
Koo koo ka ka.

133
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:07,930
- Yi Joon...
- I'm better, aren't I?

134
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,269
- Dude, you're good.
- Can I brag?

135
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,602
Oh... I'm glad it's not my video.

136
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,856
Have you ever had that thought?

137
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:20,365
You're so afraid and so pathetic

138
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:25,385
that you want to disappear without anyone knowing.

139
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:27,774
I have.

140
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:36,916
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

141
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,906
Maybe that's why...

142
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,667
I can't sing in front of others

143
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:54,574
because I think everyone will laugh at me.

144
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,844
I keep getting reminded

145
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,412
of that moment.

146
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:19,585
It's my first time talking about this

147
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,596
with someone else.

148
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,529
I wanted you to tell me

149
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,695
that I was the only person you shared this with.

150
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,936
I didn't know Shin Hye Joon was available as well.

151
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:46,743
Yeah.

152
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:51,240
Let's all go together next time.

153
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,576
Is that so?

154
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:18,823
I mean, you weren't that interested.

155
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,921
I just happen to ramble on.

156
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,888
My friend said this...

157
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:39,401
Real friends are those who stay by your side

158
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:44,269
when you really want to open up.

159
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,189
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,271
Should I sing something?

161
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:26,655
I'll cheer you up.

162
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,750
♫ Very naturally raise the corners of your lips ♫

163
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,720
♫ even if it's a little too much ♫

164
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,960
♫ Again, like that ♫

165
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,290
♫ As if there is a fixed answer ♫

166
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,560
♫ Everyone try to be alike ♫

Wow, I'm exhausted.

184

Someday...

223
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,658
I wanted to sing this song for you.

224
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:34,873
Should I tell you something about myself, too?

225
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,732
But then, what's your favorite song?

226
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:43,487
- Me?
- Yes.

227
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:45,769
I'm just curious.

228
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:50,161
I wondered what you'd sing.

229
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,332
"Confession"

230
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:02,909
Can you sing that for me later...

231
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,905
Back then,

232
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:10,269
I thought I'd never see you sing.

233
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:12,266
Why?

234
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,882
That's because...

235
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:17,538
If you found out I'm not the Yu Min Jae you thought I was,

236
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:20,231
I thought you'd hate me.

237
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:23,412
I thought you'd hate me.

238
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,028
It's just...

239
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,916
I didn't think we'd get close.

240
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,440
Yu Min Jae.

241
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,619
I like you.

Bonus clip
Are you ready?

244
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,717
Your voice is too small. Are you ready?

245
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:16,952
Cut it out.

246
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:18,123
Dude, you...

247
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:19,797
I know you're going to do it properly when I play the music.

248
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,463
I know you too well, Shin Yi Joon.

249
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:22,578
- I'm going to play it.
- Okay.

250
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:24,401
- You have to do it.
- Okay, okay.
