No, what should I say?

166
00:10:57,477 --> 00:10:59,260
What should I say?

167
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,080
How to not look easy / Makeup

168
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:05,030
Oh! Is she the one you guys talked about...

169
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:08,524
last week.

170
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:11,799
But...

171
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,450
I'm Sin Hye Joon.

172
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,250
I'm Kim Seong Su.

173
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:23,981
I'm scared.

174
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:26,517
How can I talk to them when I can't look them in the eyes?

175
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,571
How...

176
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:33,553
What?

177
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:12,916
Sorry.

178
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm screwed.

179
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,630
♫ No way
I don't want to call you so politely ♫

180
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,900
♫ Just so you can love me like this ♫

181
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,729
