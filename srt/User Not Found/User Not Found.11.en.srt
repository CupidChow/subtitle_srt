You seem to be in a good mood.

It's the same as usual.

4
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:25,709
You're lying to me these days.

5
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:28,515
I'm upset.

6
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:34,670

When you say that...

8
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:42,252
I really hate it.

9
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,150
Really?

10
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:50,251
How upsetting.

11

@User Not Found

12

14
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:13,018
- Yes.
- Tell me.

I'm fine.

16
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:23,109
What's the matter?

17
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:25,062

18
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:26,925
Min Jae.

Do you like Shin Yi Joon?

20
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:33,334
What?

21
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:36,445
No.

22
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:38,135
No.

23
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:40,229

24

I'm sorry.

30
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,883
I was worried

how you might react to this situation, especially because of what I said.

32

what are you going to do?

47
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,958
I'm going to tell him no.

48

I'm going to stay friends with him.

49
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:40,546
Right.

50
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:42,672
And you know too, right?

51
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:46,798
How he asks out all the girls around him.

52
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,259
And you know too, right?

53
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,042
How he asks out all the girls around him.

54
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,445
Yeah.

55
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,878
That's what he does.

56
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,472
He only asked me if I wanted to watch a movie

57
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:10,577
Yeah.

58
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:13,080
What male bestfriend for a person like me?

59
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,848
Male bestfriend?

60
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:23,847
No, I mean...

61
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,640
My younger sister asked me for advice about a boy.

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,734
I was trying to think of an answer.

63
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,887
I didn't know you had a younger sister.

64
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,683
I'm good at giving dating advice.

65
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:33,863
So,

66
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:35,327
tell me.

67
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:37,654
My sister has a really close male friend.

68
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:39,573
A male friend and a

69
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:41,810
female friend who she's really close with.

70
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,327
The boy asked her girl friend out.

71
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,001
But after that

72
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,083
the boy asked my sister to the cinema,

73
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,209
just the two of them.

74
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:56,003
He's trash.

75
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:00,855
Ah, trash.

76
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:04,423
So,

77
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:08,131
should my sister go to the cinema

78
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,353
with that boy?

79
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:12,772
I mean, what was he thinking

80
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:14,378
asking out that girl

81
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:16,826
and then asking my sister to go to the cinema with him?

82
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,047
Do you like him?

83
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:22,540
What?

84
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:24,706
Do you like him?

85
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,361
Shin Yi Joon.

86
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,298
What?

87
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:31,256
No!

88
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:34,260
I know everything even if you don't tell me.

89
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,545
You're so easy to read.

90
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,803
Your "sister" is you,

91
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:43,060
the "male friend" is Shin Yi Joon.

92
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,472
Then, your close female friend

93
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,224
that he asked out must be—

94
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:47,933
Stop!

95
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:51,768
This is messy.

96
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,723
You have to think carefully.

97
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,811
If you're not sure of his feelings,

98
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,272
sometimes it's better to just pretend to be friends.

99
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,187
If you make the wrong choice,

100
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,655
you could lose your friend forever.

101

What do you do with your eyes?

109
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,698
You were the one who hit me. Why do you expect me to apologize?

You haven't bought popcorn and soda, right?

I'll buy those.

Why?

129
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:22,427
Because it's our first time at the cinema together.

That's not what I meant.

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,396
I'm sure Shin Yi Joon wants to watch it with you.

177
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:07,387
My two close friends dating each other would make me happy.

178
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,801
You're a fool. You're such a pushover.

179
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:12,793
What?

180
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:15,183
I'm being the cool and good friend.

181
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:16,709
A true friend.

182
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,978
Am I not?

183
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:18,896
Cool? Cool?

184
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:20,525
What, cool?

185
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,730
Don't lie to yourself.

186
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,280
That's so not cool.

187
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,402
Ah! But, It was the right thing to do.

188
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,567
Hye Joon said so.

189
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,385
Shin Hye Joon?

190
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:42,823
So, you arranged a movie date.

191
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:45,556
for Han Ji Wan and Shin Yi Joon?

192
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:47,068
Yes.

193
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,741
Hey.

194
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:52,200
You are the worst.

195
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,386
You knew everything and used her, didn't you?

196
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:56,056
You're really trash.

197
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:58,135
[Missed call | Yu Min Jae]

198
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:03,356
Caramel popcorn? Or onion flavor?

199
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,724
I'm not having any.

200
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,023
Geez... Don't eat my popcorn later.

201
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,856
Two colas

202
00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:12,522
and one large caramel popcorn, please.

203
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,316
What the hell?

204
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,771
Watching a movie just the two of you?

205
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:24,760
Min Jae.

206
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,940
Are you here to watch a movie with Shin Hye Joon?

207
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:34,243
Why are you doing this?

208
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,175
Shin Hye Joon.

209
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,748
Why did you do that?

210
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,778
We'll take care of the rest.

211
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,671
You can go now.

212
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,881
