[Episode 4]

2
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:07,970
♫ Goodbye, goodbye my princess ♫

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,370
♫ I'll let you go now ♫

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,370
♫ Spread your wings and fly high in the sky ♫

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,500
♫ Goodbye, goodbye my princess ♫

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,560
♫ But remember... ♫

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,565
Are you okay?

8
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:28,540
Are you hurt?

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,339
Answer me, you idiot!

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,167
Senior...

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:51,300
♫ was always me, you only dream ♫

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,820
♫ Why in the dream of yours ♫

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:04,900
♫ You say so easily that there is no place for me ♫

14
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:22,492
Can you walk?

15
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:25,190
But how come you're here?

16
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,058
Where's the task force?

17
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:29,126
They're on the way.

18
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:32,262
I really thought that I was going to die.

19
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:55,406
What is going on?

20
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:04,261
Who the heck are you?!

21
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:38,329
Hold on, my shoes!

22
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:41,665
Wait! Wait! My shoe!

23
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:45,267
What should I do Mom! Oh!

24
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,400
Let's get out of here!

25
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:30,648
Oh, we're safe now.

26
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:33,184
You can put me down now.

27
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:43,747
What's this? Blood? Blood!

28
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:45,296
Oh, Senior!

29
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:47,432
You must have been stabbed! You've been knifed!

30
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:50,716
- What do we do? Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

31
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,237
What should we do? You're bleeding!

32
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:54,105
Oh, hospital, the hospital! Cellphone!

33
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:57,440
- Hurry! Give me your cell phone!
- Stop overreacting.

34
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,370
But you got knifed!

35
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,820
Whose fault is it that I got stabbed?

36
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,920
Do you ever think?

37
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,322
How can you come to the scene of a crime without an investigator?

38
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:14,125
Where do you get that kind of confidence without fear?

39
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:18,696
If I had reported it, would I have been allowed to do it?

40
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:21,399
Why would you do something that wouldn't have been allowed?

41
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,970
What if something had happened to you?

42
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,438
You told me you weren't an idiot and that you would show me what you were capable of!

43
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:28,539
Is this what you were referring to?

44
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:31,209
Do you not think at all?

45
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,711
How could you do this?!

46
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:37,815
I did it so I could live!

47
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:40,952
I have a brain! Of course, I think!

48
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:44,789
Do you think that I learned to gamble and went around pretending to be a gambler because I was bored?

49
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,459
Do you think I wasn't scared coming alone to a place like this?

50
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:52,664
There's a reason I had to do something like this!

51
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:03,074
You too...

52
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:06,820
I wanted to show you as well.

53
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,549
Well, either way, I succeeded.

54
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:16,454
How did you find out about this?

55
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:20,825
Where did you get the information about the illegal gambling house?

56
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:27,165
That is...

57
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,869
But the illegal gambling house information,

58
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,338
you can't say that you got it from me.

59
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:35,540
Do I look stupid?

60
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,677
If it gets known that a prosecutor got assistance from a lawyer of all people,

61
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:42,914
they could suspect me of carrying out a solicited investigation or a contract investigation.

62
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:45,149
So you know everything you need to know!

63
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:50,086
I do know everything I need to know.

64
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:53,424
It's just that my thinking is a bit different from others.

65
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:56,194
I do know everything I need to.

66
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:06,170
That is...

67
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,206
Why aren't you telling me?

68
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:12,243
Let me take this out first.

69
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:14,979
Senior, reach up here.

70
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,382
Why are you asking me to put my hand there?

71
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:21,419
There's a recording tape on my back.

72
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:35,099
You really are an idiot, aren't you?

73
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:41,739
Fine then. I'll take it out myself.

74
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:53,284
You were like that before because you didn't want to lose this?

75
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:56,287
Of course, it's the evidence! The gambling going on inside

76
00:06:56,287 --> 00:07:00,025
and the gangsters who run the gambling house, I've captured them all!

77
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,265
It's broken.

78
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:08,933
Pardon?

79
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:15,373
Huh?!

80
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:31,923
You asked us to dispatch without consulting us on the circumstances. What is the meaning of this?

81
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:34,459
Sir, are you playing a joke?

82
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:37,162
Did they really all escape?

83
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:40,498
We caught two low ranks, but what are we going to do with them?

84
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:42,267
They took all the money with them.

85
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,769
There's no evidence that there was illegal gambling.

86
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,707
Is there not a way to fix the tape?

87
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:51,742
It's mangled. It's not possible.

88
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:55,346
That's not a possibility for me either...

89
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:58,817
I know all those guys' faces, so I can draw their composite sketches.

90
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,985
I know all their names as well! Kkal Ddagoo,

91
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,420
Ma Bongsu, Gom Chi!

92
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,456
Those aren't names. They're nicknames.

93
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:08,640
Then...

94
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,560
I guess my individual investigation has failed...

95
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:18,970
My nails got messed up and broken, too.

96
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,642
I got scraped and hit... I tried really hard.

97
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,750
Let's go!

98
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,248
Why do you keep pushing me?

99
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:33,084
Let me go!

100
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:34,770
Get in!

101
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:37,589
I said let me go!

102
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:52,737
We should go to the hospital.

103
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:55,707
I said I'll take care of it on my own. I'll take you home first.

104
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:59,644
You got stabbed because of me, so how can I go home first?

105
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:01,980
Never mind me. Will you be okay in that condition?

106
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,948
Your parents will be worried.

107
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:09,054
That's why I have to go home in this condition.

108
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:15,060
What will happen to me?

109
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,761
We'll have to see tomorrow.

110
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:21,199
It will be reported back to the office through the police, right?

111
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,535
They won't turn a blind eye.

112
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:28,773
There's no way I could get fired, is there?

113
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:31,743
Normally when someone makes a mistake to this extent, they resign on their own.

114
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:34,846
Are you telling me to resign?

115
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:39,350
Even if it's not to the point of resignation, you should be prepared for a suspension.

116
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,020
Suspension can't happen either!

117
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,956
The preparation and planning were perfect!

118
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:48,093
I learned how to gamble and practiced so much.

119
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:51,000
And I did a site survey multiple times, too!

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,300
Oh, what do I do?

121
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,017
I'm in trouble...

122
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,683
You went out saying you were handling a big case,

123
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:27,783
and you came back after rolling in the fields?

124
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:29,950
What is this?!

125
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,250
Dad, I almost got killed today.

126
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,450
So did you succeed?

127
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,200
I...

128
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:42,450
nearly did, but it went awry.

129
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,010
You didn't die and you're not hurt, right?

130
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,583
Go on up.

131
00:10:56,717 --> 00:10:59,700
Just try to bear with it for a second.

132
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:03,950
Oh my. Really!

133
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:10,250
What is this on your radiant skin?

134
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,650
Mom, my nails.

135
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,350
They broke.

136
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,083
Did you dig a tunnel or something?

137
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,983
I worked this hard.

138
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:29,517
Dad will let me off the hook even if I get fired, right?

139
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:33,083
Before you get married, you can't escape from your father's grasp.

140
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:38,783
You really need to meet a man that doesn't change after marriage.

141
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:42,914
It all depends on the man.

142
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:57,983
So cool...

143
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:00,250
Who?

144
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,150
Things really don't work out for you.

145
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,283
What is this?

146
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:38,483
I was too careless.

147
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,717
I didn't take into account the risks and variables involved.

148
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:48,710
It seems like you and Ma Hyeri weren't meant to be.

149
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:52,717
If she gets suspended for several months, it's all over.

150
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,050
I'm sure I didn't misjudge her.

151
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,383
If only today hadn't gone wrong...

152
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,970
I should have been more careful.

153
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,410
Unanticipated situations that Ma Hyeri might face,

154
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:12,683
I should have considered them.

155
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,580
That kid...

156
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,583
She could have gotten seriously hurt.

157
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:28,983
Mom!

158
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,150
You saw it?

159
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,183
How could Dad do this? Isn't this mine?

160
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:48,150
Even if I bought these with Dad's money, they're still my clothes and shoes!

161
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,683
He said to file a lawsuit.

162
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:51,617
What am I supposed to wear to work?

163
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:55,583
He said you had clothes on last night. That the clothes in there aren't the only clothes.

164
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,217
He's saying not to even dream of using my injuries as an excuse, right?

165
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:01,883
You know he's amazingly good at taking action rather than speaking.

166
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,750
He'll probably open it for you in the evening.

167
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,150
Mom.

168
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,683
Why did you marry a guy like Dad?

169
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,550
But he did tell Chauffeur Lee to drive you to work.

170
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,783
Do you think all that matters is going to the office?!

171
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,283
Hyeri, I'm really sorry for being a mom like this,

172
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:22,983
but my life is in your hands as well.

173
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:25,583
Try to endure it, please?

174
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:31,250
Do you know how many police officers were dispatched just to catch two low-level punks?

175
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,683
You ordered the dispatch because you were fooled by Prosecutor Ma.

176
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:36,617
She didn't fool me on purpose.

177
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:40,583
When I called for dispatch, she had already gathered strong evidence.

178
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,817
Prosecutor Ma was just unlucky.

179
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:46,850
Not reporting the investigation beforehand was a deception in the first place.

180
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,617
I have also investigated without reporting before.

181
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:54,183
But you had your investigator with you!

182
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,983
Hold on, this is strange.

183
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:02,183
You're taking Ma Hyeri's side right now, aren't you?

184
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:08,260
I feel responsible as her mentor prosecutor.

185
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,983
Yoon Sejoon,

186
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:15,183
what is it that you want to say to me?

187
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:19,050
Why are they taking so long? Senior Yoons always short and to the point.

188
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,183
The director is more likely to speak about disciplinary action with Deputy Chief.

189
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:26,350
The director is probably listening to his pleas.

190
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,817
How dare she make such a huge mistake?

191
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:32,650
But a woman carrying out an undercover operation alone...

192
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,583
Maybe Prosecutor Ma had a reason for doing it.

193
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,117
What are you talking about?

194
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:38,350
She thought too highly of herself and refused to give up.

195
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,717
If they take disciplinary action, no one will make a case for her.

196
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,917
But I keep liking Ma Hyeri more and more.

197
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,717
It's refreshing compared to our lives.

198
00:15:56,717 --> 00:15:59,220
Prosecutor Lee, I don't feel that way in the least.

199
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,710
That's not refreshing.

200
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:02,650
She's behaving inappropriately.

201
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,017
Even if she gets fired, wages cut, or suspended,

202
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:08,283
she doesn't give a damn, so she's showing off!

203
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,750
What's refreshing about that?

204
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:41,950
Good morning.

205
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,917
I'm sorry that I'm a little late.

206
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:57,783
It took a while to get here because I was feeling achy everywhere.

207
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,717
I guess your foreign car is feeling under the weather, too, huh?

208
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:05,117
My father took away my car after the underage booking incident.

209
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:09,983
And yesterday I got my clothes and shoes taken away as well.

210
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:11,950
What is she talking about?

211
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:19,250
If you enjoy investigating out in the field, why did you become a prosecutor?

212
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,217
Not at all! I really, really dislike having to get physical to get the job done!

213
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:27,183
I did the individual investigation because I wanted to be a prosecutor. I apologize.

214
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:30,683
You should have at least reported it before you went off!

215
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,083
Without reporting it first and without an investigator, how could you decide on your own

216
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,017
to go to a dangerous place like that by yourself?!

217
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:36,650
And even dragging your senior into it!

218
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,583
About Senior Yoon getting hurt...

219
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,317
he was trying to save me...

220
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:46,517
Senior, what did the hospital say?

221
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,890
Did you get hurt?

222
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,040
Idiot...

223
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:55,283
I just got a little scratch.

224
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,617
That's what I thought!

225
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,050
You were the best of the best prosecutor in the Special Investigations Unit.

226
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:05,283
Pardon? That's not true. He was stabbed...

227
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,150
You got stabbed?!

228
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:10,417
No, it grazed me.

229
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,540
Then, why didn't you say so?!

230
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,350
Did you not tell me because you were worried she would get fired?

231
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,083
Yes, Sir.

232
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:32,183
Get out. Get out, both of you! I don't want to see either of you. Get out!

233
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:42,417
Senior, how's your arm?

234
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:46,417
Stop making a fuss and wait in your office.

235
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,750
Prosecutor Ma!

236
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,850
How did the stakeout in Incheon go?

237
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,517
That Kim Dongseok or whoever, did you catch him?

238
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:08,383
He didn't show up.

239
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:12,650
What a shame when you neglected me to go work on that case.

240
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,183
If you had told me properly,

241
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:16,717
would I have done that?

242
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:19,083
But I did ask you properly to come and help me.

243
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,617
You call that proper? It was practically a coded message!

244
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:25,117
It's a good thing that Prosecutor Yoon went in my place.

245
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:27,850
I heard that you were in danger.

246
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,150
But has Prosecutor Yoon always been so good at fighting?

247
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,217
When he worked in the Special Investigations Unit, he apprehended criminals himself.

248
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:51,550
It seems that she acted on her own initiative to show an effort and made that mistake.

249
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:58,190
Deputy Chief, if she gets suspended now, it will stop her will to live.

250
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:04,763
What am I saying right now?

251
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,790
Please give her one more chance.

252
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:11,103
Really?

253
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:16,260
Either you're lucky or she is. Do well.

254
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,611
That's impressive of Ma Hyeri.

255
00:20:21,508 --> 00:20:27,453
Really, sir? I just need to write an apology?

256
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:31,323
It ended with just the written apology thanks to Prosecutor Yoon's request.

257
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:33,025
Senior Yoon?

258
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:36,462
If you don't do well this time, Prosecutor Yoon will have to take the blame. So, do well.

259
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:38,764
What do you mean "this time"?

260
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:41,530
Prosecutor Yoon is your guarantor.

261
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,730
You know what that is, don't you? If you don't pay your debt, the guarantor has to pay it back instead?

262
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,340
How can a prosecutor do that?

263
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:56,147
A case is not money, so how would Prosecutor Yoon repay if I don't resolve the case?

264
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:59,384
We would transfer him to Dokdo (Island) or somewhere!

265
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,687
A prosecution office is being built in Dokdo?

266
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:07,440
Yeah! Because the Japanese keep insisting it's their land, we're trying to make one!

267
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,295
Do you want to go to Dokdo, too?

268
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,538
Senior.

269
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:23,508
Follow me.

270
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:30,849
Have a seat.

271
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:35,753
Senior, I heard you saved me.

272
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:39,424
I just felt that you deserved another chance.

273
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:46,031
Cases and more cases. I don't know why you are putting everything on the line for a case,

274
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:47,699
but try this one.

275
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,250
Oh... it's a case...

276
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,106
It's a child abuse case.

277
00:21:55,106 --> 00:22:00,246
I don't care about the reason you're doing it but investigate this case properly and carefully.

278
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:04,483
Thank you. I'll make sure to handle this case properly and well.

279
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:06,051
Don't make promises.

280
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:11,423
I'm serious. I'll make sure you don't end up in Dokdo.

281
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:13,192
Dokdo?

282
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:16,028
How's your arm? What did the hospital say?

283
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:17,696
Huh? Let me take a look.

284
00:22:17,696 --> 00:22:19,731
Look at what? I'm fine!

285
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:21,834
But still, show me!

286
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:23,210
Why are you doing?!

287
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,060
Let me see your arm! Roll up your sleeve!

288
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:27,873
Prosecutor Jin!

289
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:34,445
Did you get hurt?

290
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,814
It's nothing.

291
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,617
You came at the right time.

292
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:44,123
Prosecutor Ma, Prosecutor Jin has a lot of experience with child abuse cases,

293
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:46,325
so ask her while working on it.

294
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,090
Oh. Yes.

295
00:22:49,928 --> 00:22:52,297
Prosecutor Ma, a guest arrived for you.

296
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:53,532
A guest?

297
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:57,470
He said you would know if I said it's Lawyer Seo.

298
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:00,939
See you again later then.

299
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,249
Is that why you asked me to drive in the morning? How badly and how did you get injured?

300
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:13,152
I just got some stitches. It's nothing.

301
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:17,289
Because of Prosecutor Ma, you got hurt, stopped the disciplinary action, and even giving her a case...

302
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:19,057
Why are you helping her to this extent?

303
00:23:19,057 --> 00:23:21,093
It's not like that.

304
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:36,542
Why do you look like a delinquent?

305
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:40,946
And were you always this height? You're little!

306
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:44,416
I'm 167 cm tall.

307
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,640
Now that you mention it,

308
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,024
you don't look that great either. Did you get hut? Did you get into a fight?

309
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:54,192
When did you fight?

310
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:58,550
You look a mess, but you seem to be in a good mental state.

311
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,380
You look like you're in a good mood.

312
00:24:00,383 --> 00:24:05,504
I survived. I didn't get the death penalty or imprisonment but just probation.

313
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:08,107
That means just a written apology?

314
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:10,309
I even got a case to work on!

315
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:14,043
- How did that happen?
- Prosecutor Yoon...

316
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:17,249
Can't I tell you tomorrow? I'm really busy right now because of this case.

317
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:20,585
I'm going to be very busy because of a case, too.

318
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,087
The bad you left with me yesterday,

319
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,289
and your other items.

320
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:28,427
My clothes and shoes! Why didn't I think of this?

321
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,495
What's this?

322
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:35,190
Huh? This is...

323
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,304
You were there yesterday?

324
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:39,839
I told you I'd keep an eye on you from afar.

325
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,977
But the location suddenly changed. You knew where it changed to?

326
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:46,779
If I knew that, would I have been a step behind?

327
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,914
If you were there, why didn't you let me know?

328
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:55,387
I got there a step late, and it wasn't a situation I could ever get involved in. You didn't succeed and I get tied to it as a lawyer?

329
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:57,356
It could never happen.

330
00:24:57,356 --> 00:25:02,361
So that's what happened! How did you find this?

331
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:05,640
Probably... by chance?

332
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:10,402
Did you get into a fight while you were there?

333
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,821
I thought you'd need a cell phone.

334
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:39,030
Change the name when you have the time.

335
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:41,900
Wait a sec.

336
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:47,539
Why are you being cheesy?

337
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:49,308
Cheesy?

338
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:54,880
Or are you going to say something cheesy? A love confession in daylight is completely cheesy.

339
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,051
What? Why would I confess to you? Of course not!

340
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:01,220
Then, what confession were you going to make?

341
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,590
It's not a confession.

342
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,060
I just want you to, you know, stop liking me.

343
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,432
Why do I have to stop doing that?

344
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:19,120
I have someone that I like.

345
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:24,610
So, please stop. There's no use anymore.

346
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,246
Who's that person?

347
00:26:27,246 --> 00:26:31,810
You don't need to know that.

348
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,355
Prosecutor Jin, if I tell you it's not the case, then can't you just believe me?

349
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:39,125
I was just worried about you.

350
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:43,740
It was uncomfortable for me to see someone who looked similar to my late wife, so I made her work independently sooner.

351
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,430
Because of that, I feel responsible and feel sorry. That's all.

352
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:54,773
What does it matter if they look alike when their personalities, the way they talk are completely different?

353
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,714
And to be honest, Song Eunji (deceased wife) is much prettier.

354
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,199
I'm telling you this because it's not my style to lead people on while I have someone I like.

355
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:24,560
So, let's stop contacting each other.

356
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,206
I don't think that's possible.

357
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:31,810
Does Prosecutor Yoon also like you?

358
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,579
It's not like you're dating.

359
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:36,615
How did you know?

360
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,150
I told you I'm psychic. You didn't know?

361
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:44,557
But, really, how did you know I like Senior Yoon? I never told anyone!

362
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:49,194
You two didn't even decide to date. Why are you trying to cut me off already like some backward person?

363
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:53,132
We've been tangled up enough in each others' lives. If there's a reason for us to meet, then we can see each other.

364
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:57,002
But still, I'm telling you, it's not right to do that.

365
00:27:57,002 --> 00:27:59,710
Seriously! You didn't even repay me for my legal services.

366
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:04,130
Are you aware of how confidently you are asserting that we should no longer meet?

367
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:07,880
Oh... the police station incident...

368
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,152
You forgot again! Subconsciously, you must have fraudster tendencies.

369
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:15,120
What did you say?

370
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:22,493
I won't ask you to take responsibility for me, so let's just stay the way we've been. Stop being cruel.

371
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,964
Anyway, I warned you.

372
00:28:25,964 --> 00:28:28,734
Don't approach me. If you get hurt, it won't be my responsibility.

373
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:31,970
Oh! I already used it, but...

374
00:28:34,306 --> 00:28:35,990
Ta-da!

375
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,010
What is this?

376
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,145
Get rid of that bruise well.

377
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:47,052
If you need a lawyer, call me.

378
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:54,920
Yoon Sejoon, you're better than me.

379
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,330
♫ So I can stay in your arms, please come to me ♫

380
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,980
♫ Take me, take me, take me to your heart ♫

381
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,242
He's making me feel sorry towards him...

382
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,530
♫ I want to this moment with you is like stopped time ♫

383
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:25,280
♫  Forever with you ♫

384
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,450
♫ Seems too late to enter your heart ♫

385
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:36,302
Senior! Senior! I looked over it, and I have a few—

386
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:38,670
Ask Prosecutor Jin.

387
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,890
♫ I get hooked again and again in your heart ♫

388
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,260
♫ Every day, every day I want to be with you ♫

389
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,290
♫ Should I tell you I like you tonight ♫

390
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,943
The plaintiff is a 7-year-old, and the defendant is a 48-year-old music academy director.

391
00:29:55,943 --> 00:29:58,686
It's attempted rape and assault, but there's no evidence.

392
00:29:58,686 --> 00:30:01,928
The mother only found out that her daughter was abused eight days later.

393
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:05,331
If it's attempted rape, it's hard to find evidence by that time.

394
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:09,914
For children who suffered from abuse, we have to make sure they don't relive the painful memories,

395
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:12,638
so it's best to question the defendant first. Right?

396
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:15,174
You need to get a child counselor.

397
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:17,009
A child counselor?

398
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:20,780
It's the norm to get a child counselor when investigating this type of case.

399
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:26,180
They meet with the child ahead of time to get a sense of their characteristics and to build trust.

400
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:31,650
Hello!

401
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,928
He was well-known,

402
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:39,803
so Jimin's mother took her there for lessons every Wednesday by taking the subway.

403
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:41,730
But that day...

404
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:47,106
Hello, sir, I am Jimin's mother.

405
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,476
I'm so sorry about this.

406
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:51,427
Jimin's mother received a call saying that there was a plumbing problem at her store,

407
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:54,562
so she went back to the store during Jimin's lesson and was late in picking her up.

408
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,415
- Jimin.
- Yes?

409
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:58,217
Your mom is going to be a little late.

410
00:30:58,217 --> 00:30:59,885
Okay.

411
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:03,582
I see you like puzzles.

412
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:09,562
Oh, then does this one go there?

413
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:13,454
Not there. It's here.

414
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,701
Jimin, you're really good!

415
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:19,972
Now you and I,

416
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:22,753
let's do something really fun.

417
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,446
Jimin, it'll be fun!

418
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:30,214
There.

419
00:31:42,562 --> 00:31:44,764
Why is she sleeping out here?

420
00:31:44,764 --> 00:31:49,001
Jimin.

421
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:50,669
Oh, you're here?

422
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:52,938
Oh, I'm so sorry, Director.

423
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:53,940
Not at all.

424
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,742
She plays well by herself.

425
00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:02,915
She was sleeping so well that we took a cab home.

426
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:06,018
I didn't even realize.

427
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:12,058
The following week, she refused to go to her lesson saying that she was sick.

428
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:14,360
I asked her where she was sick.

429
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,829
She said her head hurt.

430
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:20,199
I thought she was telling me the truth, so we didn't go.

431
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:24,069
The next day, when I was washing her,

432
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:28,540
she kept on trying to hold it in, but she soon started to cry.

433
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:35,348
You didn't wash her for a week?

434
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:37,083
That week, especially,

435
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:40,253
Jimin refused to have a bath.

436
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:43,750
But still,

437
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:50,390
do you normally not wash her if she refuses?

438
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:55,568
That's right. When I'm tired from work,

439
00:32:55,568 --> 00:32:58,170
I sometimes didn't wash her.

440
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,173
I see.

441
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:13,753
Look. Right here under Prosecutor-In-Charge, it says Ma Hyeri, doesn't it?

442
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:15,221
It's there!

443
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:18,024
Ma Hyeri!

444
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:19,858
That hurts!

445
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:24,797
So... could you give me the closet key?

446
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:27,700
Do you think you're a prosecutor because you got one case?

447
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,168
If this case goes to prosecution, maybe, you will be a true prosecutor.

448
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:33,573
This case was given to me by my former mentor prosecutor who guaranteed my work,

449
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:36,943
so if it doesn't go to prosecution, he will be sent to a rural region.

450
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:38,811
He'll be demoted!

451
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:40,746
Demoted?

452
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:44,317
Here.

453
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:47,858
What about my car keys?

454
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:53,525
I am delaying the sentence of giving back your cards and car keys until the said case is successfully prosecuted.

455
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:56,929
Oh my! Oh my!

456
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:59,792
How do you know all of those legal terms?

457
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:03,268
Not everybody can be a prosecutor's father.

458
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,312
My babies...

459
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,417
Beauties, have you been well?

460
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:20,419
I missed you!

461
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:24,524
Oh, my pink cutie, it must have been hard on you!

462
00:34:24,524 --> 00:34:27,894
That's right. How can I give you up?

463
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:29,862
How can I live without you all?

464
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:33,900
I must protect you and Senior Yoon, too.

465
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,869
I am willing to be not only a prosecutor but even an ultra prosecutor.

466
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,772
Of course, I will do this!

467
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:53,519
I came because I was called regarding Yoo Jimin's case.

468
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,989
Prosecutor Ma, Kim Minshik's arrived.

469
00:35:00,193 --> 00:35:03,000
I am Kim Minshik.

470
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:06,432
Yes.

471
00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:14,340
I graduated from Ulysees Music Conservatory and was a music professor at North Carolina University.

472
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:20,045
My wife missed Korea so much that I came back for her.

473
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:23,049
I already have all of that information, so just answer the questions, please.

474
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:28,153
Did you ever touch Jimin?

475
00:35:28,153 --> 00:35:32,158
I have patted her on the butt while praising her.

476
00:35:32,158 --> 00:35:34,827
A couple of times.

477
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:37,363
Why did you take her into your office?

478
00:35:37,363 --> 00:35:39,565
The room is soundproof, right?

479
00:35:39,565 --> 00:35:43,403
She was bored while waiting for her mom, so I took her there to play with a puzzle.

480
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:45,938
When a child, who had a lesson at 5:00, came 20 minutes early,

481
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:47,206
why did you tell her to wait?

482
00:35:47,206 --> 00:35:49,175
She came early, so I told her to wait.

483
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:51,411
Did you not do that to ensure that Jimin didn't say anything?

484
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:52,812
To make sure she doesn't tell anyone?

485
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:55,715
Prosecutor, please don't accuse me without any evidence.

486
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:59,118
When Jimin was questioned by the police, she pointed to you.

487
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:01,788
So please let me see her.

488
00:36:01,788 --> 00:36:04,490
I want to see if she'll say the same thing while we're face to face.

489
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,760
Are you saying that a 7-year-old lied about it?

490
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,763
Jimin's mom is a person who needs money.

491
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:15,498
So because she needs money, she told her daughter to lie?

492
00:36:15,498 --> 00:36:17,437
Then, what about me?

493
00:36:17,437 --> 00:36:19,639
I'm a faithful Christian.

494
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:22,742
I even gave Jimin a lesson fee discount of 30%.

495
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:26,077
Pardon? Is that... right?

496
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:29,248
She desperately wanted Jimin to have lessons with me.

497
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:31,584
But the lesson fee was burdensome for her.

498
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:35,821
She said that after the divorce, she takes care of Jimin alone and it's been hard.

499
00:36:38,386 --> 00:36:40,326
I'm...

500
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:43,096
not that kind of person.

501
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:51,871
Oh, Senior! Senior.

502
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:57,764
He said that he never did such a thing.

503
00:36:57,764 --> 00:37:01,013
Rather, he said that he would file a suit against Jimin's mother.

504
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:04,417
You have no choice when the defendant comes on so strong.

505
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:06,202
You have no choice but to get the child's testimony.

506
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:08,287
And make sure you get a child counselor.

507
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:11,909
But this defendant,

508
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:15,971
not only does he not have any prior sexual assault charges, but he also doesn't have any criminal history.

509
00:37:15,971 --> 00:37:19,214
And his wife is pretty.

510
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:20,338
Is that right?

511
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,670
He's a regular church goer and volunteers every week.

512
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,039
What are you trying to say?

513
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:33,269
He doesn't seem like a person that would do that to a young child.

514
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:35,267
That's possible.

515
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:37,522
That's possible, right?

516
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,720
At first, all defendants deny their crimes.

517
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,921
You didn't learn?

518
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:43,990
I did learn.

519
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:48,494
True. A child couldn't lie about something so horrific, right?

520
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:52,331
But the plaintiffs have no evidence supporting the charges.

521
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:54,734
Just because the child said it, doesn't make it the truth,

522
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,069
since her mom is behind her.

523
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:58,705
If her mom instructs her to, she can lie?

524
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:01,007
She could lie.

525
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:03,508
But that might not be the case, either.

526
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:06,045
If you say that, what am I supposed to do?

527
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:08,060
That's your job.

528
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,749
Why are you asking me?

529
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:13,985
You have to find the truth hidden within the case.

530
00:38:13,985 --> 00:38:15,987
Keep digging more and more.

531
00:38:15,987 --> 00:38:20,725
If the mother isn't around, I can easily determine whether the child is lying or not.

532
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:22,828
I'll look forward to it.

533
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,907
Hello.

534
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:36,509
Hi!

535
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:38,983
Hello.

536
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,150
Jimin, my name is Ma Hyeri.

537
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:56,260
Oh, you look exactly like your mom!

538
00:38:57,562 --> 00:39:02,930
Jimin, we're going to play with dolls now. Let's have fun, okay?

539
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,838
Look at this doll.

540
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,441
This male doll is the music director,

541
00:39:09,441 --> 00:39:12,245
and this is you. Okay?

542
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:19,980
On that day, you were with your violin teacher, right?

543
00:39:28,156 --> 00:39:29,995
Listen.

544
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,031
I'll ask you one more time, okay?

545
00:39:32,031 --> 00:39:35,134
This mister doll,

546
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:37,470
what did he do to you?

547
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,922
Where did he touch you?

548
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:03,807
Jimin doesn't seem to want to play with dolls right now.

549
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:07,220
Really? Then, do you want to play with puzzles?

550
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:19,040
Mom, let's go home.

551
00:40:23,527 --> 00:40:28,373
Jimin, a good girl has to answer when an adult asks a question.

552
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:29,907
Why aren't you answering?

553
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:32,007
It's not like you can't speak, Jimin.

554
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:34,607
Then, why don't you speak? Huh?

555
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:38,040
Mom, let's go home.

556
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,807
Okay.

557
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:42,307
Ma'am, I'm sorry,

558
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,840
but can you step outside for a minute?

559
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,773
Prosecutor.

560
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:51,473
Let's go home.

561
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:55,840
Let's go home.

562
00:41:02,973 --> 00:41:05,807
Why is she crying?

563
00:41:16,428 --> 00:41:18,640
Then, goodbye.

564
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,040
What do I do?

565
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,741
Children are very perceptive.

566
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:33,740
- Pardon?
- Pretending to be nice, pretty, friendly,

567
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,407
pretenses, they can tell.

568
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:39,245
What do you mean?

569
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:42,973
You need to understand where the child's coming from first.

570
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,707
I mean...

571
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:54,373
I've never even seen a 7-year-old except for when I was one,

572
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:58,873
so how would I know what a 7-year-old likes and how to deal with one?

573
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:03,240
To be honest, I don't even remember what I liked when I was that age.

574
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,307
Aside from the fact that I liked to eat...

575
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:10,940
I don't remember anything! What more am I supposed to do other than being friendly to her?

576
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:15,207
Chief Cha, by any chance, is there a girl who is

577
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:18,807
not 8 or 6 but exactly 7 years old?

578
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:23,407
Do any of your friends or family have one?

579
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,507
Prosecutor Yoon's daughter is 7 years old.

580
00:42:26,507 --> 00:42:28,407
Who?

581
00:42:29,623 --> 00:42:32,340
What did you just say? Whose daughter?

582
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,707
Prosecutor Yoon Sejoon's daughter.

583
00:42:35,707 --> 00:42:39,007
Prosecutor Yoon is married?!

584
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:41,007
He is.

585
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:44,073
Should I say, he was married?

586
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:45,640
Then...

587
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:48,240
he's divorced?

588
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,540
Well, it's due to bereavement, I believe.

589
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,073
Bereavement...

590
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:58,473
Then, he's a single dad?!

591
00:42:58,473 --> 00:43:01,840
Wait! You didn't know all this time?

592
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,370
Here are some more.

593
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:18,184
- This is it?
- Yes.

594
00:43:18,184 --> 00:43:21,340
Once these are done, there are no arbitration cases left.

595
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:24,407
You only have to write out your decision.

596
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:25,607
You're looking at it again?

597
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:28,873
When you weren't here, due to the lecture you were giving,

598
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:31,642
Prosecutor Ma processed it.

599
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:35,412
Give Miss Lee Bongrae a call immediately requesting her presence here tomorrow.

600
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,340
Okay.

601
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,296
It really doesn't make sense, don't you think?

602
00:43:39,296 --> 00:43:41,025
It's you who doesn't make sense.

603
00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:43,345
How can you not have known he was married?

604
00:43:43,345 --> 00:43:46,062
How could no one tell me?

605
00:43:46,062 --> 00:43:48,107
Who would tell you that without being asked?

606
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:52,458
The person who showed up last should have shown interest and asked.

607
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:57,473
But he never gave off the sense that he was married!

608
00:43:57,473 --> 00:43:59,102
Because he's a single dad.

609
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:01,872
Of course, you couldn't tell.

610
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:05,007
You really have no interest in men.

611
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:06,807
Other people, too...

612
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:10,073
never had any interest in me either.

613
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:13,282
I thought things were going well between you and that lawyer.

614
00:44:13,282 --> 00:44:15,236
When I saw him at the police station,

615
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:19,040
he was a totally tall and handsome hottie.

616
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,244
How old is he?

617
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:23,440
What college did he attend?

618
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,940
Hey, this is pretty!

619
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,573
You still didn't get your credit card back yet.

620
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:32,740
Let's use yours for now.

621
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:40,707
Did Jimin's mom lie?

622
00:44:41,707 --> 00:44:44,107
There's no way.

623
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,990
[Weird Lawyer]

624
00:44:57,046 --> 00:44:58,530
What is it?

625
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,373
I was wondering

626
00:45:00,373 --> 00:45:03,007
if you needed help with a tough case you might be dealing with.

627
00:45:03,007 --> 00:45:05,407
No? Never mind then.

628
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,307
Wait! I do have one.

629
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:11,140
You don't even have evidence.

630
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,807
If you don't get a statement from the child, you can't prosecute.

631
00:45:13,807 --> 00:45:17,103
I know. That's why my head's about to explode.

632
00:45:17,103 --> 00:45:19,440
You better become close with the kid.

633
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,207
There's a difference between acting close and being close.

634
00:45:22,207 --> 00:45:26,163
I don't know how to become close!

635
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:28,431
Why don't you meet with Prosecutor Yoon Sejoon's daughter?

636
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:31,074
Don't you have to make a good impression on her anyway?

637
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:34,570
You knew he was married?

638
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,940
Why didn't you tell me?

639
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,766
I figured you already knew.

640
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:39,107
You didn't?

641
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:41,973

I like you. Can't I?

If it's you.

Are you saying that I can't like you?

809
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:53,867
You can't.

810
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:55,600
Why not?

811
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:59,000
Just do your work properly.

812
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,800
Just because you can breathe a little easier now, you think it's okay to be distracted?

813
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,233
I don't like you. I really don't like you.

814
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:08,767
I despise being liked by someone who causes damage to others.

815
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,600
Hurry up and go.

Dad, what is this?

820
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:43,233
Dad, this is mine. Right?

822
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,100
Don't touch it, it's probably not yours.

Well, I didn't know what Jimin liked, so I bought a variety of things.

You bought all this?

Oh, it's not excessive.

I guess your business is doing pretty well.

841
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:05,093
The monthly lesson fee is quite... expensive.

842
01:00:05,093 --> 01:00:08,960
I earn enough to pay the lesson fee at least.

843
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:16,927
The teacher said that he gave you a 30% discount on the lesson fee.

Why didn't you tell me?

845
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,293
I think you're going to have to take your hands off the Yoo Jimin case.

846

Excuse me?

847

What do you mean?

848
01:00:32,893 --> 01:00:38,027
Jimin's mom requested another prosecutor.

849
01:00:38,027 --> 01:00:40,360
But, why?

850
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,460
She said she doesn't have confidence in you.

851
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,827
Why would she say she doesn't have confidence in me?!

852
01:00:44,827 --> 01:00:47,427
It starts with your outfits,

853
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:52,493
and she must have heard about you being the Booking Procutor. Most of all,

854
01:00:52,493 --> 01:00:56,393
she feels that you are not on Jimin's side, who's the victim.

855
01:00:56,393 --> 01:00:58,660
Chief...

856
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,313
Wait, I'll come with you.

857
01:01:18,827 --> 01:01:20,493
Prosecutor Ma.

Ah, hello!

859
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:27,627
You must still like tomatoes. You're as slim as ever.

860
01:01:27,627 --> 01:01:29,827
But what brings you here?

861
01:01:29,827 --> 01:01:33,960
I came to give you a present to celebrate being cleared of the false charge.

Here you go! Eat a ton of tomatoes!

864

I kept telling you that I didn't do it, that I didn't hit that wench,

865

but you didn't even try to listen to me while shoving tomatoes down your throat!

867
