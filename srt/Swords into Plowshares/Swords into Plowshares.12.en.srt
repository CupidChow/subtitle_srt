You

17
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:50,466
are Zhao Kuangyin?

18
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:51,633
Yes.

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,233
"Zhao the muddlehead" of the Imperial Guard is your father?

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,633
My father serves in the Imperial Guard.

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,533
His given name is Hongyin.

22
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,500
Your mother's surname is Du.

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,000
She is from the Du family, prominent in Dingzhou.

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,833
Her mother was Lady Fan.

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,000
Your eldest brother,

26
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,466
who died young,

27
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:18,300
is called Guangji.

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,366
Yes.

00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:26,500
The letter says that Zhang Yanze, the current Marshal,
a veteran general of many years,

30
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,433
[Guo Wei, Commander of Imperial and Cavalry Infantry]
on the day of the grand court assembly,

31
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,066
[Guo Wei, Commander of Imperial and Cavalry Infantry]
was stabbed and wounded by a youth barely of age.

32
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,833
[Guo Wei, also called Guo the sparrow for his
sparrow-shaped birthmark]Such an absurd story...

33
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,033
[Guo Wei, also called Guo the sparrow for his
sparrow-shaped birthmark]How did they come up with it?

34
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:45,200
The Qian clan of Wuyue has no enmity with Zhang Yanze.

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,433
Why would they wound him in the court hall?

36
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,500
I can't stand you!

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,066
You're sitting in prison, with so many people
sending food here, more cozy than in the office.

38
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:09,366
This place is originally government office,
and it's the Censorate, a top-tier one.

39
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,933
It rectifies court discipline and impeaches all officials.

40
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,960
Just think that one outside the Lijing Gate in King Wu's time,

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,166
how many civil and military officials turn pale mentioning it.

42
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,800
It seems a guest has arrived.

Hongchu.

45
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,466
Since the establishment of the imperial prison,

46
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:58,733
you must have been the most unbridled imperial prisoner.

47
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,500
Then what about you staying for some days and be unbridled too?

48
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,200
No thanks.

49
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,600
Go get a bowl and chopsticks.

50
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,966
My rank is low; I could not attend the court assembly.

51
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,200
I only heard the actual situation from my father.

52
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,800
Zhang's crimes are innumerable.

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,730
Those who wish to kill him are far more than just
Young Master Qian alone.

54
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,366
I suppose,

55
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:35,000
that day in the grand hall, it must have been utter chaos.

56
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,066
He's certainly not the one who wounded Zhang.

57
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:42,233
But that blade was indeed brought into the hall by him.

58
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:46,033
So he takes the blame and this accusation.

59
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,366
That's more like it.

60
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,633
Your father is also from a noble family.

61
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,466
He has been on the battlefield.

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,966
He commands at least several thousand troops.

63
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,733
When spoken of,

64
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,466
he is called a Marshal.

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,533
Yet he let a youngster from the south
draw a blade right in the court.

66
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,966
How absurd.

67
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,466
Is there no true man left in the city?

68
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:29,666
Lord Liu and Marshal in Hedong
lead far more than tens of thousands troops,

69
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:33,966
yet we have not seen them march south to rescue the capital.

70
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:41,933
My father and I, though lacking talent, fought for ten full days
under the military might of the traitor Zhang,

71
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:46,760
to stop the rebel army outside Xuanyang Gate.

72
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:50,166
You burned Zhang Yanze's granaries, right?

73
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:50,766
Right.

74
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,566
Leading that useless Imperial Guard

75
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:21,900
to hold on for ten days against Zhang Yanze
without losing ground,

76
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:35,266
you are indeed better than your useless father
in terms of ability though you are young.

77
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,266
But, boy,

78
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,033
your father is smarter than you.

79
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,500
This time

80
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,466
he bet on the right horse.

81
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:02,066
You can be said to have placed the right bet
for the Qian clan of Wuyue this time.

82
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:09,000
So many people died just for a gamble?

83
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:12,433
The world is like a chess game, like a gamble.

84
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:18,333
Living in such an era, we originally had no other path to take.

85
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:24,266
What does the world affairs have to do with me, a lazy boy,

86
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,933
who usually won't even bother to read documents?

87
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,766
Isn't Wuyue a part of this world?

88
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,466
The King of Wuyue is my elder brother.

89
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,066
Although I hold the title of a commander,

90
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,100
it's merely a formality.

91
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:41,600
I have never been involved in military and state affairs.

92
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:44,600
Who becomes the emperor here in Bianliang City

93
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,733
has nothing to do with a leisurely foreigner like me.

94
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:52,933
You are not willing,

95
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,566
to pledge allegiance to Lord Liu?

96
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,000
Didn't I just say?

97
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:00,566
State affairs are not for me to decide.

98
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:05,233
Even to pledge allegiance, it should be
my sixth and seventh brothers, not me.

99
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:11,366
Mr. Shuiqiu has pledged allegiance on your brother's behalf.

100
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:15,333
Then, Jungui,

101
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:17,660
for what you come to see me?

102
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Wuyue is Wuyue.

103
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,400
You are you.

104
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,233
The Jin emperor has abdicated for over a month,

105
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:38,533
yet Lord Liu has still not dared to proclaim himself emperor.

106
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,900
Do you know why?

107
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,233
Insufficient troops?

108
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,666
Lack of provisions?

109
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,733
The Khitan are too strong?

110
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,833
Whether, it's his business.

111
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:03,066
He doesn't dared to proclaim himself
because he hasn't won people's support.

112
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,066
Then, Jungui, tell me,

113
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,266
how can one win people's support?

114
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,666
Nr. Shuiqiu, on behalf of your brother,

115
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,733
with over a hundred thousand armored soldiers of Wuyue,
pledged allegiance to Lord Liu.

116
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,166
This shows quite the prestige.

117
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:30,266
However, all this cannot compare to one clear word from you.

118
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,933
From me?

119
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,400
Do you still think you are who you were?

120
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:44,133
Could I am no longer myself just after a month in prison?

121
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,966
You injured Zhang Yanze.

122
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,666
So what?

123
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,633
Hongchu,

124
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:55,700
so many people every day bringing you food here.

125
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,100
This is people's support.

126
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,366
Do you know for what Minister Sang
choose to sacrificed in Kaifeng?

127
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,700
For people's support.

128
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:15,733
Minister Sang used his life to let the Khitan ruler know

129
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,966
the will of the people in this land,

130
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:24,833
to let the Khitan troops know, that
the soldiers and people of the Central Plains,

131
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,500
never stand traitors who oppress and betray like Du and Zhang.

132
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,960
Throughout the capital, everyone wishes
they could eat their flesh and peel their skin.

133
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,633
Yet, the only one who truly dared
to draw a blade before the Khitan emperor, was you.

134
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,300
So now,

135
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:45,833
you,

136
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,733
have won people's support.

137
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,533
Having experienced the state's collapse,

138
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,633
Zhao Kuangyin, deeply understood
that figures like Liu Zhiyuan and Guo Wei,

139
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:24,066
these powerful ministers and military governors
had far too many interests to weigh.

140
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:27,033
[Liu Zhiyuan, Hedong Military Governor]
Beyond Hedong, there was Hebei;

141
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:28,666
[Liu Zhiyuan, Hedong Military Governor]
outside the capital,

142
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,733
[Liu Zhiyuan, Hedong Military Governor]
there was the covetous

143
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:32,566
Khitan army.

144
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:35,033
[Shi Hongzhao, Military Commander of Hedong]
After all, Lord Feng had no troops in hand;

145
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:38,733
[Shi Hongzhao, Military Commander of Hedong]
to have achieved this much was already an unexpected delight.

146
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:43,833
You hold the twelve prefectures of Hedong, with an army
of a hundred thousand and plenty provisions,

147
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,633
If we wait until there's a clear outcome
before collecting easy gains,

148
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,500
wouldn't we be laughed at by everyone?

149
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:51,433
Hongzhao,

150
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,930
how's the enemy situation?

151
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,600
I, Yongde, pay respects to Marshal.

152
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:17,800
Marshal,

153
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,333
this is?

154
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,530
[Liu Jiye, Scout Commander of Infantry]
He is Liu Jiye is from the Infantry Command,

155
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,600
[Liu Jiye, Scout Commander of Infantry]
the newly appointed Scout Commander.

156
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,866
He is also my newly adopted

157
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,866
grandson.

158
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He has urgent military intelligence from the north to report.

159
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,830
Open the gate.

160
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,966
Yelü Talie is not in the camp.

161
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,000
Reporting to the Lord, he is not.

162
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,933
How do you know?

163
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,733
I heard it with my own ears.

164
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:54,666
He disguised himself as a Khitan slave and lingered
in the camp at the Hui River for over a month.

165
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,730
You can speak the Khitan language?

166
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,833
Marshal, I hail from the borderlands. I've been
accustomed to their languageS since childhood.

167
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,433
Which languages can you speak?

168
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:10,733
The Qiang language of the Tangut, Khitan language,
Xi language, Black Mountain Zubu language,

169
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:11,900
I each know some.

170
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,333
Serving as a scout in the Infantry Command
is truly a waste of your talent.

171
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,300
He is the eldest son of Yang Hongxin from Linzhou.

172
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,233
Zhe Sanlang from Fuzhou took him as a son-in-law.

173
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,033
He is not an ordinary scout.

174
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,933
Seeing is believing.

175
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:29,833
How do you know the truth just by hearing it?

176
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,433
I saw it with my own eyes,

177
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:32,900
thus I know it is true.

178
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:37,166
How do you know the visitor is an envoy from Shangjing?

179
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,100
[Xiao Siwen, Yelü Deguang's son in law, Khitan general]
The visitor was Xiao Siwen himself.

180
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:43,666
[Xiao Siwen, Yelü Deguang's son in law, Khitan general]
He previously served as an envoy, traveling between Lin and Fu.

181
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,600
I know him.

182
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,566
Reward him with a Deputy Commander.

183
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:53,833
For such a great merit, even a Commander
would be a fitting reward.

184
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,300
Why don't you thank for his grace?

185
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,400
I thank the Lord for grace.

186
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:04,100
Dismissed.

187
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,700
Great King, thus we will make it.

188
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,100
Zhang Yanze is severely wounded and Yelü Talie has departed.

189
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,466
If this is not fortune,

190
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,866
then what is fortune?

191
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:27,433
Xiao Siwen came to the Huishui River in person

192
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,566
to summon Talie away.

193
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:34,133
This means Shangjing has encountered a big event.

194
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
To be able to summon away someone like Talie
with a single document,

195
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,033
only two people can do this in Khitan.

196
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,366
One is currently in the capital, hesitating and wavering.

197
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:47,500
Then,

198
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,000
only one remains:

199
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,200
Empress Dowager, Lady Shulü.

200
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,466
First, send someone to the capital.

201
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:58,600
Yes.

202
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,933
To see who people support?

203
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,600
To submit to,

204
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
the Khitan ruler.

205
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,066
[Kaifeng prefecture, Bianliang City, the Eastern Capital]

206
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:14,000
Empress Dowager recalling official from
Yunzhou to Shangjing

207
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:17,000
is a reminder to Your Majesty.

208
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:18,833
It is time to return north.

209
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:22,733
Affairs here are settled.
Please lead the army back.

210
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:26,633
We should leave someone here in charge.

211
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,300
Your Majesty, if you do not want Du,

212
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,766
then Liu Zhiyuan of Taiyuan is the only other choice.

213
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,166
Please decide quickly, to calm people's doubts.

214
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:40,333
Even if bestowing the silver pillow
, the chosen one must want to sleep on it..

215
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,300
As for Taiyuan, so far not even a single memorial
declaring submission has been delivered.

216
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,733
To hastily proclaim the Liu Clan would make it seem as if
the imperial throne of our dynasty is worthless,

217
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,533
and as if we were begging him to take it.

218
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,733
What about Your Majesty and our dynasty's dignity?

219
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:54,200
You...

220
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,933
Your Majesty.

221
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:06,060
The envoy from Taiyuan, Hedong Deputy Military Governor,
Wang Jun, has entered the capital

222
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,933
by order of the Lord of Beiping, Lord Liu, waiting outside
the Mingde Gate with a memorial declaring submission.

223
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:14,833
Wang Xiufeng is outside the Mingde Gate.

224
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,333
Su Yuanxi and Guo Wei,

225
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:19,966
Did not come in person?

226
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:23,200
The envoy delegation is led by Wang.

227
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:28,300
I didn't see Surveillance Commissioner Su and Marshal Guo.

228
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,000
You may leave.

229
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,900
Yes.

230
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:40,600
Lord,

231
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,733
the Lord of Beiping is...

232
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:43,733
This is false.

233
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:45,166
Pay it no mind.

234
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:49,366
If Lord Liu truly intended to submit,

235
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,566
it should be Commissioner Su, or my father who come.

236
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:55,266
Yet now,

237
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,900
it is Uncle Xiufeng who has come.

238
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:00,300
It is merely a pretense of compliance.

239
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:05,133
If he is unwilling to submit, why make such a grand display
and send an envoy?

240
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,966
To see how people think about?

241
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:14,833
People's support in the capital lie with Lord Feng and Hongchu.

242
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:20,633
Envoy Shuiqiu, Taiyuan envoy has left the palace.

243
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:21,866
With an decree or not?

244
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:26,360
Lord Liu is granted the title of Grand Preceptor and
Prince of Jin to eternally guard Hedong.

245
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:49,433
Your Majesty.

246
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:04,833
Fan Zhi.

247
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,166
Yes.

248
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:12,400
Instruct the Kaifeng Prefecture to set up
two more porridge kitchens in the southern city.

249
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:15,233
Do not use the name of relief aid.

250
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:20,866
The weather is about to turn warm and
ice in the river will soon melt.

251
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,900
Recruit strong and young men and provide relief through work.

252
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:27,866
Yes.

253
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:45,466
My apologize.

254
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:47,000
Lord.

255
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:49,700
Accompany me for a walk.

256
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,866
You can get it there as well.

257
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:56,466
Thanks.

258
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,300
Give me more.

259
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm afraid there are a hundred thousand people.

260
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,000
There are not so many.

261
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:11,066
In the twelve counties of the capital region, only
Chenliu's city walls are still somewhat intact.

262
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:13,833
But no one remains there.

263
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,233
The weather is bitterly cold, the ground frozen.

264
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:22,866
Poor families runing out of food can only leave their homes,

265
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:27,466
heading towards the capital to beg for some food.

266
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:29,466
This

267
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,500
is only just the beginning.

268
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:34,300
Why?

269
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,633
The weather is gradually warming up.

270
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:39,133
In past years at this time,

271
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:43,433
the court would have allocated seed grain
to prepare for spring plowing.

272
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:50,233
This year the stored grain in the
government granaries and seed grain

273
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,633
have all eaten by the soldiers and refugees.

274
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,133
We miss the farming season, and
there will be no hope for a harvest.

275
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:03,033
These common people,

276
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,233
for now,

277
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:10,366
can still come here to beg for some porridge and barely get by.

278
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,600
In another two months, when the granary reserves
are all eaten up,

279
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,500
they will ultimately starve to death.

280
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,466
Lord oversees affairs in this city.

281
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Isn't this within your responsibilities?

282
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:32,366
I am ashamed.

283
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,833
But I cannot make bricks without straw.

284
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:40,300
The reserves of the inner and outer treasuries
are all in your hands, Lord.

285
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,766
What else do you need?

286
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,933
I am

287
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,933
just a muddle-headed old fool.

288
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:49,800
For food, a single bowl is enough.

289
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:52,733
To sleep, a simple bed suffices.

290
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,766
I need nothing else.

291
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:58,666
They need something.

292
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:01,766
They need something.

293
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:03,866
Need what?

294
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,066
A proper court.

295
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,566
One that can purchase grain at fair prices in harvest years,

296
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,966
distribute food and provide relief in famine years.

297
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:20,900
One that allocates seed grain in spring,

298
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:24,100
repairs river infrastructure in summer ,

299
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,966
fills granaries in autumn,

300
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:31,000
and relieves the cold and needy in winter.

301
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:42,833
Today not even a Bodhisattva
can keep these common people alive.

302
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,200
Only you

303
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,133
can keep them alive.

304
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:52,166
Lord, are those your sincere words?

305
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:54,900
Can you?

306
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:02,800
Zhang Li.

307
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:05,633
I am here.

308
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:09,733
Announce to all palace camps and to ministers:

309
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,833
From this day forth, south of the great river,
no one shall plunder the commoners.

310
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:22,566
All military needs must be recorded in writing, compiled
into registers, and submitted to the palace for decision.

311
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,466
I receive the decree.

312
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,200
Lord,

313
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:29,500
is this acceptable?

314
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,930
Rioting troops entered the city,

315
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,166
giving three days' leave.

316
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:41,366
let the strong broke down doors,

317
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,933
plundering coins, silk, and rations,

318
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,433
slaughtering women and children,

319
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:52,533
setting houses ablaze,

320
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:55,033
tearing down courtyard walls to build camps...

321
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,633
Lord,

322
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,433
is this the crime of Zhang Yanze,

323
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:03,766
or of me?

324
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,166
You've using too heavy words.

325
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,266
But

326
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,033
at this moment,

327
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:14,900
with you simply saying "No more plundering, no more killing,"

328
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:17,500
will that suffice?

329
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:24,700
What exactly do you want?

330
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:27,900
Three hundred thousand hu of grain and wheat

331
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:30,300
thirty thousand hu of seed grain,

332
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:32,133
Do you have them?

333
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:33,300
No.

334
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,200
Since you do not, the hundred thousand
soldiers and civilians here and I

335
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,266
cannot let you do something you can't.

336
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:43,333
But

337
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,800
we can settle for the next best thing.

338
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,666
What is it?

339
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,066
Debts must be repaid, lives taken must be atoned for.

340
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,233
Since you have no grain or seed,

341
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:02,966
you may instead offer Zhang Yanze's life in compensation.

342
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,733
Lord Feng, you are threatening His Majesty?

343
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:07,830
Your Majesty,

344
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,666
if you do that, Du Zhongwei may incite unforeseen turmoil.

345
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,100
That's reasonable.

346
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:20,066
Du Zhongwei holds heavy troops.

347
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:23,066
Even Bodhisattva won't defy him, let alone you.

348
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:27,100
Is this your intention,

349
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:32,200
or Liu Zhiyuan of Taiyuan's intention?

350
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:35,166
If you are unwilling to be the ruler,

351
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:40,866
then move back to your Shangjing immediately.

352
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,333
Lord, you have not yet answered.

353
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,600
A person who cares for the world

354
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,066
would not ask such a question.

355
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
If I kill Zhang Yanze,

356
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,566
dare you guarantee that Du Zhongwei will not rebel?

357
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,633
I dare not.

358
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:13,166
But

359
00:25:14,966 --> 00:25:16,233
I dare wager.

360
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,266
Du Zhongwei

361
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,333
is in Yexia.

362
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:24,433
I am in the capital,

363
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:26,133
with no city,

364
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:27,333
no troops.

365
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,633
If Du Zhongwei dares to rebel,

366
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:32,266
you may just take

367
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,366
my life.

368
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,100
Dare you wager?

369
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:46,133
The authorities have investigated the crimes of Zhang Yanze.

370
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:49,000
Zhang is greedy and covetous, plundering people.

371
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,666
He has been ruthlessly killing civilians at will.

372
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:55,166
He allows soldiers' atrocities, people suffering.

373
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:59,066
He embezzles military pay,
leading to the army's morale collapsing.

374
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,433
He seizes farmland and deprived people of their property,

375
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,866
He also sells official positions, corrupting governance.

376
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:08,433
He drives soldiers to rebel, causing disasters.

377
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:12,866
He defies imperial decrees, disobeying the emperor's orders.

378
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:15,533
He frames loyal officials, persecuting the virtuous.

379
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:18,900
He indulges in lechery, corrupting social morals.

380
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,500
He forms cliques, disrupting court order.

381
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:26,433
He robs and kills envoys, provoking neighboring states.

382
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,866
These are twelve major crimes.

383
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:31,200
His crimes is too many to be each listed and recorded.

384
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,233
Even drained the Sea,

385
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:35,400
his evil can't be washed away.

386
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:39,966
to such a great villain, how could I
spare him from the punishments?

387
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:44,300
He shall be immediately caged and sent to the market
to be publicly executed,

388
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:48,566
to serve as a warning, proclaimed to all.

389
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,333
Lord

390
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,366
Zhang Yanze

391
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:58,900
was executed under the clear edict of the Khitan emperor,
publicly executed according to the law.

392
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,466
people of Bianliang City are all witnesses.

393
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:05,166
In the clear annals of history,

394
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:08,366
it will be recorded thus in the future.

395
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,033
What a pity for Qian's Young Master,

396
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,766
so loyal and brave.

397
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,660
In these chaotic times,

398
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,333
human life is cheap.

399
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:21,400
Staying alive,

400
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,260
is more important than anything else.

401
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:27,533
Should we release him?

402
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:29,133
Not yet.

403
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,666
Disrespect in court is not minor offense.

404
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:36,366
Take good care of him.

405
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:39,500
Do not let anyone see him,

406
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,700
and do not let anyone

407
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,166
be reminded of him.

408
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,966
It's roasting so slowly.

409
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,800
What are you thinking about again?

410
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,333
If I survive and return this time,

411
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:30,533
I will go to the island with you and become a live-in son-in-law.

412
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,466
Okay?

413
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:37,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

414
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,966
In this world,

415
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,133
there are too many people who want to shoulder
great responsibilities, but too few with self-awareness.

416
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,200
Otherwise,

417
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:57,733
it wouldn't have been this chaotic.

418
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,900
I won't get involved.

419
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,133
After much thought,

420
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:11,033
this world seems to have no second Arcadia
besides Huanglong Island.

421
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,033
Do you

422
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:31,833
really think so?

423
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,066
What do you think?

424
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:07,433
Lord,

425
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:11,200
Lord,

426
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,966
Wang Jun, the envoy from Taiyuan, requests an audience.

427
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:16,033
He's finally here.

428
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,530
I won't see him.

429
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:19,033
Lord.

430
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:21,133
Fan Zhi,

431
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,500
you go meet him.

432
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:25,900
Wang Jun wants to see you, Lord,

433
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,066
not me.

434
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,933
Everything that can be asked and said,

435
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:35,333
I have discussed with that Guo boy.

436
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,233
Meeting again wih him would just be repeating the same words.

437
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:41,166
Better not to meet.

438
00:30:42,066 --> 00:30:42,966
You go see him.

439
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,800
Tell him:

440
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:50,666
millet and wheat, six million liters each,
and six hundred thousand liters of seed.

441
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:54,233
This is the price I offer.

442
00:30:56,966 --> 00:30:57,966
This world,

443
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,600
at present,

444
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,533
is only worth this much.

445
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:06,933
Lord is a senior minister of three dynasties.

446
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,166
Why be so discourteous?

447
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,366
Xiufeng, be careful with your words.

448
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,633
Lord leads the court.

449
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,733
His thoughts and actions are not for us to comment on.

450
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,933
The humiliation of you and your Lord today,

451
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:25,333
I will

452
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:27,733
surely repay it someday.

453
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:36,100
Lord refuses to see me.

454
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:38,433
Yes.

455
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:41,633
His exact words were:

456
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:44,000
"If he

457
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:46,833
still cherishes his life,

458
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:50,033
he should not go anywhere these days ."

459
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:56,266
Please inform the Lord, Marshal.

460
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,900
Guo Rong has a few heartfelt words for him.

461
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:01,866
This concerns his reputation.

462
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:04,530
I beg him to spare some time for a meeting.

463
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,700
Just give up.

464
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:13,666
Tomorrow, at the grand court assembly in Hall,

465
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:19,166
he will go to the hall and declare submission.

466
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,366
The Great Khitan Emperor decrees:

467
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,666
By the grace of Heaven, I have ascended to throne.

468
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,066
To govern the great realm, it's necessary
to have virtuous ministers to assist.

469
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:39,366
You, Marshal, Director of the Secretariat,

470
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,566
Military Governor of Kuangguo Weisheng Army, Duke of Yan,

471
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,833
having served three dynasties with
splendid knowledge and reputation,

472
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,833
as a crucial minister to the state,

473
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,200
are hereby appointed Grand Tutor, recorded with
a golden register, and granted Prince of Changle.

474
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,433
There's another eight thousand households for you as fief,
twelve hundred to be taxed,

475
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:03,530
You shall serve as Military Commissioner,
overseeing affairs of the Southern Han Office,

476
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,333
commanding the troops of Bianliang.

477
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,000
You shall be granted an ivory tablet and an ox-head token,

478
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:11,933
permitted to ride a horse within the palace and attend court,

479
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:13,966
Approved.

480
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,200
Your subject, Feng Dao, receives the decree.

481
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:31,733
Having obtained the great succession, I would trouble you
as to the matter of the dynastic name.

482
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:36,133
The Yang clan obtained the succession as Duke of Sui,

483
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:38,100
the dynastic name was Sui.

484
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,766
The Li clan obtained the succession as Duke of Tang,

485
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:44,300
thus establishing the Tang of three hundred years.

486
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:48,533
Your Majesty's foundation was obtained
from your father and grandfather.

487
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:52,866
The ancestral temples and shrines,
though not granted by Tang decree,

488
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,566
follow the old system of the Songmo Governorate.

489
00:33:58,233 --> 00:34:01,366
Songmo had its governance in Liao territory.

490
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,633
For Your Majesty to name the state, the name could be Liao.

491
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:41,833
Liao.

492
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,266
Great Liao.

493
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,866
Grand Tutor's proposal fits the traditions.

494
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,566
I concur that the state name shall be Liao.

495
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:56,600
I concur!

496
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,133
Good.

497
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:01,400
Then the state name is settled, Liao.

498
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,600
May our ancestors bless us.

499
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,500
May the Great Liao prosper forever.

500
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,000
Long live Your Majesty.

501
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,366
May the Great Liao prosper forever.

502
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,400
Long live Your Majesty.

503
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:25,733
A senior minister of three dynasties bowed in submission
,even offering a state name.

504
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,400
Truly beyond my words.

505
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,566
I wonders will Lord Feng feel ashamed the day he
meet Minister Sang again in the underworld.

506
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,566
If Minister Sang had not died,

507
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,133
Today, I'm afraid he too would have submitted.

508
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:47,033
The Han culture has been moved to south for seven hundred years.

509
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:50,100
The integrity of the realm is not in the north of the Huai River.

510
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:51,700
Now,

511
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:56,533
The Khitan emperor establishes the Liao and has become
the master of the northern lands.

512
00:35:58,466 --> 00:35:59,566
The only remaining concern,

513
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:05,966
is Liu Zhiyuan in Hedong.

514
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:19,433
Guo Wei.

515
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,800
What do you intend to do?

516
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:23,900
To accomplish great deeds, of course.

517
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,200
Kuangyin.

518
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:27,833
I am here.

519
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,766
Go and take down that banner.

520
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:31,800
Yes.

521
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,233
Guo Wei.

522
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,260
What do you mean?

523
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:56,800
The Khitan came south.

524
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,433
The capital lies in ruins and chaos.

525
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,000
The dynasty's fortune is not long.

526
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,866
The Jin has ended.

527
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,066
The ancestral spirits have no heir.

528
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:05,166
The state faces the danger of collapse.

529
00:37:05,966 --> 00:37:08,166
The people suffer the hardship.

530
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,133
The soldiers and people of Hedong respectfully request you,

531
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,066
for sake of the people,

532
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:20,900
to receive the Mandate, inherit the imperial lineage.

533
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,760
march your banners south and pacify the Central Plains.

534
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:30,666
Wang Jun is back?

535
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:34,733
Guo Wei.

536
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:35,833
What...

537
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:37,100
Guo Wei.

538
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,333
Lord Feng said deliver six million liters
each of grain and wheat,

539
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:47,000
six hundred thousand liters of seed grain, to the capital,

540
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,560
and you can be the emperor.

541
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:58,933
I have received the state's favor for two generations from
the Shi family. I cannot commit such an unrighteous act.

542
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:07,866
Hedong is where the hopes of the people lie.

543
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:11,333
Yet you are bound by sentiments,
unwilling to ascend to the throne.

544
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:14,666
We have received your grace and promotion,

545
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,400
should plead with tears of blood again and again.

546
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:30,966
If you don't ascend, what shall the poeple do?

547
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:34,433
If you don't ascend, what shall the poeple do?

548
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:36,466
What's the point in shouting here?

549
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,166
Break the door.

550
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:43,033
Carry Your Majesty out.

551
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,333
Guo Wei.

552
00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:50,533
What are you doing?

553
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:50,933
Guo Wei.

554
00:38:51,466 --> 00:38:51,900
Guo Wei!

555
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:53,500
Let me go!

556
00:38:53,866 --> 00:38:54,266
Guo Wei!

557
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:55,600
Let me go!

558
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:06,333
Guo Wei!

559
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:10,233
You will trap me in unrighteousness!

560
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:13,133
That's just petty righteousness.

561
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:16,466
The state and the welfare of the people
are the great righteousness.

562
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:20,466
I, Su Yugui, requests you to ascend the imperial throne.

563
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,500
You all will trap me in unrighteousness!

564
00:39:34,566 --> 00:39:37,833
We request you to ascend the imperial throne.

565
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,166
We request you to ascend the imperial throne.

566
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,666
Zhao Kuangyin never could have imagined.

567
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,600
that the founding of a new dynasty

568
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:52,200
could be so hasty and rushed,

569
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:56,100
and that a new emperor ascending the throne

570
00:39:56,733 --> 00:39:58,633
would wear as his first yellow robe

571
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:02,833
a military governor's banner flag.

572
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,600
After Liu Zhiyuan declared himself emperor in Jinyang,

573
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,566
military governors and former Jin generals
rose in response one after another.

574
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,700
The people also rose up in rebellion,

575
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:19,366
killing the Khitan officials.

576
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,900
Wang Qiong, leader of the volunteer army in Chanzhou,
led troops to attack the city.

577
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,533
besieging the Khitan defending general Yelü Langwu.

578
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,000
The volunteer armies in the east broke through
the three prefectures of Song, Bo, and Mi.

579
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:37,500
Hearing the news, Emperor Taizong of Liao,
Yelü Deguang was astonished,

580
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,866
intended to abandon the city and flee north.

581
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,433
This Liu Zhiyuan declaring himself emperor is one thing.

582
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:46,266
But he specifically named the state 'Han'.

583
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,466
What do you think?

584
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:52,100
Is it an unintentional act or a deliberate one?

585
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:57,466
The Former Han, the Later Han, and Third Han
were all the Liu clan's empire.

586
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,233
Liu Zhiyuan bears the surname Liu
and uses "Han" as his reign title,

587
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:04,700
intending to use tradition to legitimize his rule.

588
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,033
Zhang Li,

589
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:11,533
you think I have little knowledge?

590
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,400
The founding emperor, Gaozu of the Former Han
was from Fengyi, Peiguo.

591
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:22,200
The Guangwu Emperor of the Later Han
was from Cai County, Nanyang.

592
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,900
The Zhaolie Emperor of the Late Han
was from Zhuo County, Youzhou.

593
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:29,633
So what is Liu Zhiyuan?

594
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,900
Just a Shatuo barbarian.

595
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:37,666
Even his surname Liu is of dubious origin,

596
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,900
stolen from who knows where.

597
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:43,566
How dare he claim to be a descendant of the Han imperial clan?

598
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:50,866
If we were to test his blood, I suspect even Liu Yuan
the hun would be more legitimate than him.

599
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:51,933
Yes.

600
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:55,000
The rebel usurped the title, like a monkey wearing a crown—

601
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,466
naturally, he has no such scruples.

602
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:01,233
Li Keyong,

603
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:02,933
Li Cunxu,

604
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:05,733
Li Siyuan—the three father, sons—

605
00:42:06,466 --> 00:42:08,466
became emperors as Shatuo people,

606
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:10,100
and that was fine.

607
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,233
Shi Jingtang and his son were also Shatuo people

608
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,433
and held the throne for over a decade.

609
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:18,866
Now,

610
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:23,366
when it comes to us Khitan people becoming the emperor,

611
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,366
it has only been a little over two months,
yet Hedong has rebelled, and Hebei has rebelled too.

612
00:42:29,866 --> 00:42:30,433
Indeed.

613
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,600
We Khitan people

614
00:42:34,366 --> 00:42:35,366
are of Hu descent.

615
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:38,700
But were the Shatuo Zhuye clan

616
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,500
not also of Hu descent?

617
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,800
I simply cannot understand

618
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,833
what constitutes "Hu"

619
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:52,400
and what constitutes "Han",

620
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
in the hearts of those hypocritical southerners.
