[Episode 5]

15
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,533
To Qian Hongzuo, the Kingdom of Wuyue:

16
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,300
Your family has established and govern the state here.

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,466
You have been contributing your strength to the empire.

18
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,600
Thus this decree is issued to manifest exceptional grace.

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
By imperial grace, you are hereby appointed King of Wuyue.

20
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,433
Do strive to live up to the expectations.

21
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:59,466
Let related authority implements this.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,400
Qian Hongzuo, humbly receives the decree with thanks.

23
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:08,100
We humbly receive the decree with thanks.

24
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
Your subject,

25
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:26,633
Shuiqiu Zhaoquan,

26
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,433
respectfully congratulates the Great King.

27
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,666
We congratulate the Great King.

28
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,866
This joy I share with you all.

29
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:41,633
You all may rise.

30
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:54,666
With the coronation ceremony held, we request to
open the treasury, show leniency in punishment,

31
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,633
reward the generals and soilders,
and proclaim a general amnesty.

32
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:02,800
How is the condition of the treasury of the Ministry of Revenue?

33
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,466
In reply to the Great King,

34
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,466
last year, the three rivers flooded.

35
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:11,200
King Wenmu, out of compassion for the people,
exempted the autumn tax for that year.

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,066
The treasuries of various regions
were already stretched thin.

37
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,966
Now the summer flood season is approaching.

38
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,833
All must prepare for potential disasters.

39
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,733
It is not advisable to use them.

40
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:26,233
We can wait until this year's autumn tax is collected
before proceeding with the rewards.

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,100
This year's autumn tax shall be exempted following last year

42
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:32,833
As to the reward for the armies, I...

43
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,866
I pay them myself.

44
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,466
Your benevolence bestows grace upon everyone.

45
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,400
We respectfully obey the instruction.

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,233
So much for today.

47
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:46,566
Lord Shuiqiu, wait a minute.

48
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,433
Others may leave.

49
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,600
We take our leave.

50
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,700
We take our leave.

51
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,400
Rewarding the three armies and exempting taxes
are benevolent policies.

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,833
But regarding the amnesty, especially for the Eldest Prince,

53
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:09,966
he did not even mention it.

54
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:15,566
He did not mention it, so you all did not mention it either,

55
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:19,633
then for what we need ministers in this state?

56
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,300
Academician Yuan,

57
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,133
Academician Yuan.

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,600
Now that Shuiqiu has also returned,
and the Great King has ascended,

59
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,300
all the ministers are satisfied.

60
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:38,366
Do you still remember your words before?

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,166
Five Lords.

62
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,533
Do you intend to save,

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,966
or to kill?

64
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:48,233
What do you mean by that?

65
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,366
When the words are the same,

66
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,233
we'd better have another one to say.

67
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:58,533
Dai Yun

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,300
had no rebellious intent.

69
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,266
He was innocent but executed.

70
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,400
This marks the beginning of discord.

71
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:10,133
The commoner Sun Ben had not been
involved in usurpation, either.

72
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:13,333
Du Zhaoda and hid kind were indeed arrogant and corrupt.

73
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,033
Punishing them according to the law was not harsh.

74
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,833
The Eldest Prince, Hongjun, made few mistakes
in commanding troops and managing affairs .

75
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,933
Yet now

76
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,400
he is unjustly imprisoned.

77
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,033
Ministers are indignant, and people are worried.

78
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,100
Shuiqiu Zhaoquan.

79
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:28,500
It's very bold of you.

80
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,533
My family has been connected to the royal family
for generations and shares the fate of the state.

81
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:37,933
If Wuyue exists,

82
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:38,800
then I exist.

83
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,333
If Wuyue perishes,

84
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,533
then I perish.

85
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:46,033
Thus, I must bare my heart and soul
to speak frankly.

86
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,966
Why didn't say that before dispatching to Bianliang?

87
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:55,000
At that time you were just the Regent of two armies.

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,500
Within the palace,

89
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,800
all affairs, and all decisions made, shall
follow the principle of being expedients.

90
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:03,766
But now

91
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:05,733
the situation is entirely different.

92
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,766
The decree from the capital has arrived.

93
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:11,100
Having received the Emperor's investiture,

94
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:14,400
you are now the rightful ruler of Wuyue.

95
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:19,766
A king governs the entire states and
should employ policies

96
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:25,133
that are not resort to expedient
and compromising schemes.

97
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:28,466
No one has ever

98
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,366
told me that before.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,500
This is the fault of this chancellor.

100
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,033
Please rise.

101
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:04,366
I have succeeded to the two armies for nearly a year now.

102
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,300
When ministers talking about the affairs,

103
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,600
they only say what without explaining why.

104
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,000
Deep in my heart, I know

105
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:20,866
they regard me as a junior
who cannot understand reason behind.

106
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,266
and they can only coax me all day long.

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,966
But the more they do that,

108
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,166
the more anxious and fearful I become.

109
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:38,700
Among my many brothers and the ministers,

110
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,400
I truly do not know

111
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:44,500
who should I trust and rely upon.

112
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,200
Nor has anyone been like you who would risk his life,

113
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,666
to tell me the truth.

114
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:57,766
Shuiqiu Zhaoquan.

115
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,433
Yes.

116
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,333
Will you assist me?

117
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,766
I would not refuse even at the cost of my life.

118
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:22,633
The,

119
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,500
tell me.

120
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,733
Since I have already made so many mistakes,
what should I do

121
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,733
to correct them?

122
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,600
Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.

123
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,266
The past is in the past.

124
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,533
To stabilize the nation now matters.

125
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,266
I beseech you to issue an edict to the court,

126
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:50,966
proclaiming a general amnesty
to show the subject's leniency and fairness.

127
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,166
Release Shen Wenqi from the inner office.

128
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:11,733
Let the Eldest Prince, Hongjun,
to return home to reflect on himself.

129
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,733
So that the imperial clan members will turn back.

130
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,333
Father.

131
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,833
It's so good to see you out.

132
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:30,300
Let's go.

133
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,600
Let's go home.

134
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,566
With the ministers and academicians

135
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,100
stabilizing the court
and governing the populace,

136
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:04,500
the people can be pacified,
and the state can be stabilized.

137
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,100
[Kaifeng Prefecture, the capital]
Your Majesty has newly ascended,

138
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,333
the foundation not yet firm.

139
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:19,566
If we rashly launch a northern expedition and
suffer defeat, the state would be unstable.

140
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,133
I have been waiting for this day for seven years
since the third year of Qingtai.

141
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:25,466
I prepared for seven years.

142
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,200
Minister Sang, what do you still want
to solidify the foundation?

143
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:32,466
I'm afraid the threat is not from outside,

144
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,700
but from within.

145
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:41,233
[Shi Chonggui]
I want the Sixteen Prefectures of Yan-Yun back.

146
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,633
Why do you insist on stopping me?

147
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,966
It is not the right time, not the right situation,

148
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:49,433
and not the right person.

149
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,166
Not the right person.

150
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,766
Minister Sang, you still regards me as a child.

151
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:01,900
I am not that kind of ignorant youngsters raised
by ignorant women's hands like those in of the old Tang.

152
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,866
I have been in the army since I was twelve.

153
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:09,066
I fought on the battlefield, completed missions,
and have never retreated.

154
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,900
Otherwise, how could the late Emperor
pass the crown to me?

155
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:15,466
Your Majesty, a national war is quite a different thing.

156
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:19,300
It does not require mere fervor,
nor individual reckless bravery.

157
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,000
Sang Weihan,

158
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
whose minister are you?

159
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:24,933
I

160
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,566
am the Emperor!

161
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:55,833
If you still don't remove your bride's fan,
I will do it myself.

162
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,066
Alright.

163
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,900
Why are you standing there still?

164
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,033
Come here and help me.

165
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,600
Alright.

166
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:43,066
This crown of yours is indeed quite heavy.

167
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,400
Don't you have anything to say to your humble wife?

168
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm afraid what I have to say
might not be something pleasant.

169
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:56,466
I am listening.

170
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,300
In a few days,

171
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,133
I will set off with the army.

172
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:03,600
I know.

173
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:07,133
My father and elder brother are going.

174
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,133
You're going together?

175
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:10,066
Yes.

176
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,600
W shouldn't speak of such war matters
on the joyful wedding day.

177
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,100
But I'm worried that if I don't tell you today...

178
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:19,900
I understand.

179
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,766
You are telling me the truth.

180
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,233
You are about to reclaim Yan-Yun.

181
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,933
Father is always worried, but elder brother is pleased.

182
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,433
You should be pleased too, right?

183
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,666
The humiliation of losing Yan and Yun
is carved into our bones.

184
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,233
Who would not be filled with indignation?

185
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,566
Do you know what is most crucial in the campaign

186
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:44,800
to reclaim Yan-Yun?

187
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:47,733
Certainly, provisions, supplies, and troops.

188
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:52,633
We must advance from Hedong and Hebei in two routes,

189
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,800
preventing the Khitan armies to support each.

190
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,933
The first crucial matter.

191
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,900
is that you return alive

192
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:05,800
In such an era

193
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:10,166
we women have absolutely no reason
to remain faithful to a dead husband,

194
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:11,400
and observe widowhood.

195
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,233
Therefore,

196
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,233
if you don't wish

197
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,133
that I take my dowry and remarry

198
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,066
shortly after marrying you,

199
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:25,633
you'd better return alive to see me.

200
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,066
This second important matter

201
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:31,133
is what mother said.

202
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,800
What are my mother-in-law's instructions?

203
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:50,900
Mother says since

204
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:54,300
you and your uncle need some days more
to prepare for the journey,

205
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,966
you should using these days ensure the Zhao family has an heir.

206
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:25,033
In the year 942 AD, after Shi Chonggui ascended the throne,

207
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:27,200
he refused to submit to the Khitan,

208
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,800
which triggered three major wars with the Khitan.

209
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,533
In the year 946 AD,

210
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:39,866
during the third war, the Chief Commander Du Zhongwei
colluded with the Khitan

211
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:43,066
and betrayed his side with two hundred thousand troops,

212
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,033
Jin losing its main forces.

213
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,533
Khitan took advantage of the situation to capture Kaifeng,

214
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:54,700
the Later Jin's reign severely threatened.

215
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:10,333
[Western Court, Hangzhou]
Chaos is about to descend.

216
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,866
Southern Tang, Western Shu,
Southern Han, Southern Chu, all these states

217
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:16,733
have sent envoys to the capital to spy abd rally ministers,

218
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:17,966
waiting for events to come.

219
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,633
If the imperial army fails to stop the enemy in Hebei,

220
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,933
and the Northern cavalry captured the river,

221
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:29,333
I'm afraid the disaster of the
Sixteen Kingdoms will fall again.

222
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,833
Shuiqiu Zhaoquan.

223
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:34,333
Yes.

224
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,800
Has any military events happened in the border?

225
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,800
The armies of Southern Tang is as usual.

226
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,500
The armies of Southern Han and Southern Chu
show signs of moving northward.

227
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,800
How is the treasury of the Ministry of Revenue?

228
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,900
Last year to this year are bumper harvest years.

229
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:52,333
The treasury is full.

230
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,533
No need to worry about preparations for military.

231
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,100
Minister Yuan, as winter approaches,

232
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,033
it is time to send envoys to offer
New Year's congratulations to the emperor, right?

233
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:02,933
Exactly.

234
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:11,633
Given the situation,

235
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,733
I shall make another trip to the capital.

236
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:20,500
Then appoint the Vice Director of the State Affairs,
Deputy Military Governor of Hedong,

237
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,200
Commander of Cavalry and Infantry Forces,
Judge of the Chief Commander Office of All Forces,

238
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,200
Shuiqiu Zhaoquan, as the New Year's Greeting Envoy,

239
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:29,933
to the capital.

240
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:31,266
One more thing.

241
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:35,733
Appoint the Acting Minister of Works,
Commander of the Inner Guard Forces,

242
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:38,633
Secretariat Director of the Marshal's Office, Qian Hongchu,

243
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,300
[Qian Hongchu, Commander of the Inner Guards]
as the Deputy Envoy.

244
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,466
Great King,

245
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,066
the situation is dangerous,

246
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:56,233
and the Later Jin court
is likely to be struggling for its life.

247
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,500
The situation is dangerous, and
the court is likely to be struggling.

248
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,166
If it truly collapses like fifty years ago,

249
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,233
I,

250
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,100
must also struggle for my life.

251
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,333
Lord Shuiqiu, heading north at this time,
takes the even greater risk of his life.

252
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,500
Which one of the Qian family of Wuyue, can stand aloof?

253
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:18,866
Hongchu,

254
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:25,566
I'll tell you frankly:

255
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,100
This journey is unpredictable;

256
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,200
you'll risk your life.

257
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,066
You dare to go?

258
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:36,666
Your Majesty,

259
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:39,233
it's such a great calamity,

260
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,533
I am timid, and dares not go.

261
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,633
However,

262
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,566
I have long heard of the capital's prosperity.

263
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,366
It's said that in capital, the food, goods,

264
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,066
are all the epitome of luxury and wealth,

265
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:58,733
far beyond Wuyue,
the remote land's imagination.

266
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:01,000
I have long admired and coveted it.

267
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,666
I'm willing to travel to the capital with Lord Shuiqiu,

268
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:07,000
to satisfy a lifelong desire.

269
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,933
Do you know why I'm sending you there?

270
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,333
Father and son, elder and younger brothers
shall fight together.

271
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:25,900
Those words are what grandfather taught father and uncles

272
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,633
when he was a hostage in central Wu region.

273
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,566
Grandfather had thirty-eight sons in total.

274
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:40,000
When the state faced calamity, the only one
who stepped forward and share his burden

275
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,133
was our father.

276
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:48,166
When grandfather uttered those words back then,

277
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,900
he wasn't meaning to praise father.

278
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,800
He meant to scold others.

279
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,433
Sixth Brother, I never knew this.

280
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,900
How dare I scold my elder brothers?

281
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:04,666
Playing dumb.

282
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,266
I actually understand.

283
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,233
You are the ruler of the state, so obviously you can't go.

284
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,333
Seventh Brother has now joined the Chancellor.

285
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,033
He is now your right-hand man, so he cannot go either.

286
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,166
Then I, Idle folks fishing and playing all day,
am the only one left.

287
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:23,600
Whether I live or I die,

288
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,433
brings little influence to family or country.

289
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Then of course I am the most suitable one.

290
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:35,433
Having been studying for years,
you should have made some progress.

291
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:43,266
If Father back then had not stepped forward
to shoulder the great responsibility,

292
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:48,666
how could Grandfather entrusting
the state to him with relief?

293
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:54,566
Sixth Brother, you must be joking.

294
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,900
On this journey to the capital,

295
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,700
do not act on your own in every matter.

296
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:10,833
Shuiqiu Zhaoquan is an important minister

297
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,333
and a renowned gentleman.

298
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,500
Just follow his arrangements in various affairs.

299
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:17,833
Rest assured.

300
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,133
Though I've been frivolous, I dare not
act recklessly in state affairs.

301
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:23,666
The capital is perilous.

302
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,533
In Hangzhou, you are from the royal family.

303
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:28,733
But in the capital, no one will yield to you.

304
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,200
Always put your life first.

305
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,500
Do not be too willful.

306
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:39,433
Rest assured.

307
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,500
I will

308
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,900
keep your words in mind.

309
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,900
The war situation in the north is unclear.

310
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:00,966
I'm afraid the road after

311
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,700
landing at Deng-Lai will be difficult.

312
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,933
Prince, you may have to endure some hardship.

313
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:09,800
Envoy.

314
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:10,500
Prince.

315
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,133
Seems that something happened.

316
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,200
Look,

317
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,500
the warships of the Huanglong House.

318
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,800
[Sun Taizhen, Lady Yu's daughter]It's my elder brother.

319
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,700
Elder brother!

320
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:43,433
Elder brother!

321
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,066
Third Brother!

322
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:50,033
[Sun Ben, Lady Yu's eldest son]

323
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,133
Although the imperial court has many troops,
the most reliable forces are only two.

324
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,300
One is Liu Zhiyuan's army in Jinyang,

325
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,433
the other is Du Zhongwei's in Yexia.

326
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,466
Du Zhongwei has surrendered.

327
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,333
Liu Zhiyuan alone cannot hold the line.

328
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,866
He can protect himself, but it's hard to advance.

329
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
The situation in the court instead is most troublesome.

330
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,200
The current Emperor is not as good as the late Emperor.

331
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:20,533
Although the late Emperor was mocked as Son Emperor,

332
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,333
he was after all a hero of his time.

333
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:28,800
Commanding troops, handling affairs,
appointing generals and officers...

334
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,900
His prestige in those aspects was immense.

335
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,066
Taizhen, sit down and eat with us.

336
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:36,966
No.

337
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,966
I don't understand a single word of what you are saying.

338
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:42,366
It's boring sitting here.

339
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:45,300
True. Look, you two haven't seen each other for so many years,

340
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,633
but as you meet you talk about boring politics.

341
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,233
Aren't you tired of it?

342
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:54,866
Hongchu is still so playful as before.

343
00:23:57,233 --> 00:24:02,766
Now that you have entered the court, I'm afraid
you can't avoid learning these military and state affairs.

344
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:05,800
My family's ancestral teaching tells me how to face big matters.

345
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:09,100
However formidable the Khitan cavalry is,

346
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,600
they can't ride directly here across the Yangtze River, right?

347
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:17,133
However chaotic the Central Plains are in,

348
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,700
having thirty regimes and eighty emperors
replacing the former ones,

349
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,500
they have nothing to do with our Wuyue, right?

350
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,366
You have been in the peaceful Wuyue for too long,

351
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,933
not konwing how danger it can be when the empire collapse.

352
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
In the capital, whoever the emperor is,

353
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:35,900
we all equally submit, present memorials,
and offer tribute.

354
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:39,400
What does the collapse of the empire have to do with us?

355
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,433
Third Brother, try this.

356
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,366
Hongchu is after all too young.

357
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:56,366
He has some small clever ideas, but
he lacks worldly experience and insight.

358
00:24:58,233 --> 00:24:59,466
Why Hongzuo sends him?

359
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,300
He should send Hongzong instead.

360
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,400
No one can stay childish forever.

361
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:08,600
One must learn what he should learn,

362
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,800
and must bear what

363
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
he must bear.

364
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:15,533
In this world,

365
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:18,533
there is no real Elysium

366
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:34,333
Look.

367
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:43,666
[Ye County, Laizhou Prefecture]

368
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,200
Something's unsual.

369
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,300
What's unusal?

370
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:58,433
The northern army is moving south, and the battlefield
should be southwest of Ye.

371
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
Even the cavalry detours,

372
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:04,100
they should pass through
Yanzhou and Jizhou to the west.

373
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,500
There's no reason to detour hundreds of miles
to the East Sea coast as a preliminary move.

374
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,000
You means this place is not the front line of the battle?

375
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:15,366
If the Khitan cavalry really had such magical power,

376
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:20,833
why would they bypass the capital and
instead take a long detour here,

377
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,666
to burn Laizhou to ashes?

378
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,400
Because

379
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,600
it wasn't them who burned it.

380
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:30,166
Go.

381
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,066
Riding a horse requires your legs' strength
to grip the horse's belly.

382
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:57,300
Holding onto the saddle rings is useless.

383
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,133
Shut up.

384
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:01,966
You'd better not ride yourself and get on my horse.

385
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,200
I'll take you with me.

386
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,966
I said shut up.

387
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:11,800
Are you hurt?

388
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,333
You see,

389
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,266
It's not a big deal falling down.

390
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:20,766
It's fine.

391
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,800
Get on my horse, I'll take you with me.

392
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:25,966
No.

393
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,000
Don't be stubborn.

394
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,800
Get on my horse, I'll take you.

395
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:36,266
I can make it myself.

396
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,233
You can?

397
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,666
There's a long way ahead.

398
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:42,566
Let's go.

399
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,833
I'll take you.

400
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:54,000
You see?

401
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,700
you can't control a horse with your hands.

402
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,766
You have to use your feet.

403
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,633
Horses are smart.

404
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,266
With just a light touch, it knows what to do.

405
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,466
What you need to do is to
sit steadily on the horse's back.

406
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,833
Try it.

407
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,600
Clamp your legs tight.

408
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,566
Tight already?

409
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:11,100
How is it?

410
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:11,800
Steady now?

411
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:28,833
These

412
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,733
are all human bones.

413
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,300
What is that person doing?

414
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:50,766
He is too hungry.

415
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,366
Prince，

416
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:22,366
you'd better have some.

417
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,700
Winter approaching,

418
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,666
the further we go, the colder it gets.

419
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:30,033
Your body can't make it without something warm in your belly.

420
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,200
Have some more.

421
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,733
After this trip, I'll never use bones to make soup again.

422
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,733
Those bones lying along the road...

423
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:53,900
The local officials, do not care at all?

424
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:56,966
Here is the Pinglu Army's place.

425
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,000
Since Huang Chao's rebellion,
it's been sixty or seventy years, right?

426
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,230
Because of Wars,

427
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:04,066
and disease,

428
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:07,600
people here dying all around every year.

429
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:12,366
The post stations in the Central Plains
have long been abandoned.

430
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:15,300
This place doesn't belong to a prefecure.

431
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:17,533
Who would care them?

432
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:29,133
The bones you saw were cleared
to the roadside so that they won't

433
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:31,600
block the road and hinder troop movements.

434
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,233
So many corpses can cause a great epidemic.

435
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,066
These people from the north
really lack awareness.

436
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Of course, they have been accustomed to it.

437
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,566
Disease is indeed terrifying.

438
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:53,566
But compared to dying in wars,
or being captured and stewed to make soup,

439
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:56,566
dying from illness already means good fortune.

440
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:58,033
Prince,

441
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:00,830
you sure you don't want some?

442
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:20,030
May be intruders.

443
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,566
Stay alert.

444
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:46,000
Go.

445
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,300
Envoy, Prince, everything alright here?

446
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,430
What happened?

447
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:25,300
Reporting to Envoy and Prince,
some men in official army uniforms came.

448
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,500
They seemed to be chasing someone who is fleeing.

449
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:30,866
Seeing the firelight here, they barged in.

450
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:32,466
Anyone injured?

451
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:35,966
Luckily we have a big number
of soldiers well prepared.

452
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,266
No one died, and twelve were wounded,

453
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,633
four seriously,

454
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,433
What about those men?

455
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:44,633
They had horses and we couldn't capture them all.
Eleven escaped.

456
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:45,900
Anyone alive?

457
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,366
Two injured, their horses' legs were cut.

458
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,230
They suicided finding impossible to fleet.

459
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:57,100
Of the three fleeing faster, two died.
The other one was hit by three arrows,

460
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:59,833
slashed once on the back, but he's alive.

461
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:02,430
Should we save his life?

462
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,400
Hedong Army.

463
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,966
Where are their bodies?

464
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:39,066
In the woods.

465
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,066
Take us there.

466
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:40,930
This way.

467
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:59,500
They are wearing standard military uniforms.

468
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:03,633
Clearly, they are not from Khitan.

469
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:04,766
Envoy,

470
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:07,966
I found this from an officer's body.

471
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,560
Commander of the imperial guards of Weibo?

472
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,166
Clerk of Cavalry and Infantry...

473
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,900
This is something used in Hedong Jinyang Army,

474
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,600
having been used since Li Keyong occupied Taiyuan.

475
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,400
They are actually the Shatuo people's personal guards.

476
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:36,533
This Clerk position,

477
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,200
I don't know what it is for.

478
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,533
Pack up luggages and set off now.

479
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,933
We cannot stay here for long.

480
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:47,100
What about that one?

481
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,766
He was too severely hurt to move.

482
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:51,100
Once he catches a cold, he will die at once.

483
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:54,033
The conflicts between the northern governors

484
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,766
are not something we remote Wuyue can interfere with.

485
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,933
This is nothing

486
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,266
we can handle.

487
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,833
So we just leave him here?

488
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,400
Can't we carry him on a horse?

489
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,033
Prince, we have only a few horses.

490
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,330
To carry four injured people,
four commanders will have to march on foot.

491
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,366
Those are our own commanders.

492
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,266
We don't know who he is.

493
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:23,500
To have a commander to give a horse to him,
our men might have some complaints.

494
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,666
Who asked for your horses?

495
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:26,766
Bring my horse.

496
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:28,266
Use my horse to carry him.

497
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:30,566
I will march on foot.

498
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:31,700
Enough.

499
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:34,530
Let's move out since luggages are packed.

500
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,766
Prince,

501
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,500
just use my horse.

502
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:58,900
We haven't seen many living people since we disembarked.

503
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,666
What about the last time you came?

504
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,800
Three years ago, this place was desolate indeed,

505
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:08,400
but around the city, there were residents.

506
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,100
Prince, Commander.

507
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:33,666
His fever has gone and he
should be in safe condition now.

508
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,000
When will he wake up?

509
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:37,600
I don't know.

510
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:42,800
When we reach the capital,
find him a better physician to treat him.

511
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:43,933
Understood.

512
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,400
Just keep lying there, you.

513
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,700
Watch over him.

514
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,100
Yang Guangyi, Attendant of the Imperial Guard,
pays respects to the Ambassador.

515
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,566
Why is it you who came?

516
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,266
Please rise.

517
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,900
No need for formalities, Attendant.

518
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,700
[Yang Guangyi, Attendant of Imperial Guard]

519
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,766
We are here to welcome you and escort you into the capital
by the order of the Minister.

520
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:29,400
What is the current situation in the capital?

521
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,266
Not good

522
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:35,100
The troops from Yexia have occupied Fengqiu,
vanguard reaching Chenqiao Post.

523
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:41,033
In the east, outside Dongming Town, Zhaopi and Tongwaxiang
strongholds are being attacked by scouts.

524
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,700
Who is the commander leading them?

525
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,866
It is Zhang Yanze, the Marshal of the Zhangguo Army.

526
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,166
His tactics have always been known for being ferocious.

527
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,300
Pressing Fengqiu in the north and Dongming in the east,

528
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,966
They must be flanking maneuver
Ato cut off the southern route to the capital.

529
00:37:57,433 --> 00:38:00,030
How many troops are in Dongming?
Who's defending there?

530
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,400
Although Dongming has two strongholds,
there aren't many troops stationed there.

531
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,133
If a battle breaks out it, would be over in a day.

532
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:12,900
Once Dongming falls, Chenliu will certainly be the next.

533
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,333
I passed by Chenliu this morning.
The magistrate of Chenliu has fled and the city is in chaos.

534
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,733
We didn't enter the city. We came around it.

535
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,466
Who is in charge of the capital's defense?

536
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,460
It's a hard topic. The Marshals and the generals
have been evading responsibility for over a month.

537
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,300
The ministers also have no clear plan.

538
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,266
What about Lord Feng?

539
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:37,833
He returned to the capital more than ten days ago.

540
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:41,966
Marshals have been lining up, offering gold and paintings
to see him, but none met him.

541
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,433
He merely attends court, handing all military affairs
to the Bureau of Military Affairs without even asking.

542
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,200
And the Emperor?

543
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:52,500
In reply to your noble question, my status is low.

544
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,733
Palace affairs are beyond my knowledge.

545
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:57,933
I heard that a few days ago,
several eunuchs stole some gold and items

546
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,533
trying to flee from the city.

547
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,600
Lord Feng issued a strict order to behead them.

548
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:08,600
We must seize the chance to get through
now that Chenliu has not yet been sealed off.

549
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,366
The era of complete chaos is coming.

550
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:17,766
In the dust and dirt of battlefield,

551
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:23,600
nobody will know what kinds of beasts are hiding.

552
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:27,333
When in Wuyue, I always thought Sixth Brother was heartless.

553
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:31,933
But experiencing so much on the journey,
I understand his difficulties.

554
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:36,333
He is far better than this new Emperors in the Central Plains.

555
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:57,633
What's wrong?

556
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,166
Not feeling well？

557
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:02,733
Nonsense!

558
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,833
Then what is it?

559
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,960
You must have meals even you're not feeling well, don't you?

560
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,730
I specially got you some vegetable soup.

561
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,200
I just feel that

562
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:26,800
things are not quite as I imagined.

563
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,930
Indeed, they are not quite the same.

564
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:35,500
Tell me,

565
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:38,866
why wouldn't Wuyue be like this?

566
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:42,833
Probably because

567
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,266
the people are different.

568
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:47,166
Everyone has a head on their shoulders.

569
00:40:47,366 --> 00:40:48,366
What is different?

570
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:51,533
Wuyue has no military unrest,

571
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:52,700
and it's not this cold.

572
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:57,133
Actually, Wuyue is not entirely peaceful either.

573
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:02,100
Uncle Dai, so loyal and upright, yet
was unjustly convicted and lost his life.

574
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,633
And my elder brother.

575
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:07,600
If Mother had not cut off the Qiantang River,
perhaps he would have been...

576
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,733
Ministers each have their own wish.

577
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:14,100
Within the imperial clan, family affairs can be troublesome.

578
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:20,033
But these have nothing to do with the common people.

579
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:25,200
Farmers in the fields and
fishermen on the water are unaffected.

580
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:27,966
Every day,

581
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:32,266
related officials will care for the hydraulic engineering.

582
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,366
There are no refugees or disorderly soldiers,

583
00:41:36,366 --> 00:41:39,300
nor many white bones by the road.

584
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:44,100
What you speak of are all extremely ordinary things.

585
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:48,466
Yet here they cannot be seen.

586
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:50,866
You are right.

587
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,833
They are extremely ordinary.

588
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:57,133
Yet in the Central Plains, they are all absent.

589
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,500
Yang Guangyi.
