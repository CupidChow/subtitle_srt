Come on! Come!

16
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,733
Let go!

17

You!

19
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:50,600
Away from me!

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,633
Away!

21
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,766
Lady of Chu is deeply righteous.

22
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,600
Rewarding the army with her own body,

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,100
she can be called a model in the capital.

24
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,433
Now, within Kaifeng Prefecture,

25
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:45,666
there are more than one hundred
female relatives in Marquis of Betrayal's family.

26
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,100
Today is the first day.

27
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:50,366
So we need only one Lady of Chu.

28
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:52,366
Tomorrow,

29
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,433
we will have Lady of Ning,

30
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,500
Lady of Zhao.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,300
For each day His Majesty cannot enter the city,

32
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,633
there,

33
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,900
will be several more people.

34
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:16,000
So you are to beg me to go out of the city,

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
to let the Khitan Emperor come into the city?

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:19,900
Yes.

37
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,666
I believe

38
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,033
that no matter what great plans Lord and Minister Sang have,

39
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:29,166
they should not be at the cost
of the lives and honor of innocent women.

40
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:30,866
Minister, it's rude of you.

41
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:36,100
The tragedy of Lady of Chu was entirely brought about
by the tyranny and perversity of Zhang the traitor.

42
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,530
What does it have to do with Lord and Minister Sang?

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,433
If, I did not kill one, but he died because of me.

44
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,560
If so, Academician Fan,

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:43,933
am I,

46
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,266
innocent?

47
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,533
Utterly absurd!

48
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,500
Fanzhi.

49
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:52,566
Minister Qian.

50
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,366
Do you know what plan

51
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,900
Sang Guoqiao and I have?

52
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,266
I can have somewhat surmised.

53
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,666
Since you have,

54
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,133
why do you still persuade me to give up?

55
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:11,066
I'm trying to persuade you to give up.

56
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:15,800
I wish to beg you, Lord, to save the lives
of all the innocent women in this city.

57
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:18,333
The great plan has nothing to do with them.

58
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,460
They should not be used as bargaining chips.

59
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,566
Sang Guoqiao

60
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,700
has already staked his own life on this plan.

61
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,666
The life of the Lady of Chu is a life.

62
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,666
Is Sang's life

63
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,200
not a life?

64
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:41,733
Minister Sang is a minister of the state,
having received his salaries for many years.

65
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,533
He can stake his own life as a bargaining chip,

66
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,266
but he should not involve the innocent.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,066
In this world,

68
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,400
are there truly innocent people?

69
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:53,266
Yes.

71
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,566
What about you?

72
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,633
This old man is asking:

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,533
you,

74
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,533
are you innocent?

75
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,466
I,

76
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:10,000
am not.

77
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:17,966

78
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,166
I'm here

79
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:23,300
Go to their camp in Red Ridge,

80
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,600
and deliver a message to Yelü Deguang.

81
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:28,200
Tell him

82
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:31,600
I will wait for him

83
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,600
at Mingde Gate.

Mingde Gate?

86
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,733
Your Majesty, the Mingde Gate is
the main gate of the Daming Palace.

87
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:47,900
It shall be closed except on the first
and fifteenth days of the lunar month.

88
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,700
Lord Feng

89
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,933
intends to submit?

90
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,266
I dare not presume to guess what Lord Feng thinks.

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,900
I am merely delivering a message as ordered.

92
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:03,700
Zhang Yanze did a good job this time.

93
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,630
What are you thinking about?

94
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:14,800
I'm thinking about what Minister Sang said.

95
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:20,260
The Khitan are to enter the city. Are you going to welcome them?

96
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:20,966
Of course I am.

97
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,600
I am a prince of Wuyue,

98
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,500
enjoying fine clothes and food and
offerings from the people since childhood.

99
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:31,000
I am not an innocent person

100
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,100
How could I not go?

101
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,933
The Emperor has arrived at Mingde Gate.

102
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,033
Why don't you officials bow?

103
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,066
Silence!

104
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,333
Lord Feng,

105
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,066
you are the prime minister of Jin.

106
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,000
Yet you failed not only to correct the ruler's behavior,

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,233
but to bring peace to the common people,

108
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,300
causing the nation to collapse
and the sovereign to be humiliated.

109
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,966
Lord Feng,

110
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,533
don't you feel ashamed?

111
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,066
That makes sense.

112
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,700
I should indeed feel ashamed.

113
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,000
Lord Feng,

114
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,630
why are you not wearing court attire?

115
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,733
Jin has perished.

116
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:43,366
The sovereign is no longer sovereign,
and the minister is no longer minister.

117
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,533
At this moment,

118
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,233
there is only the commoner Feng Dao.

119
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,033
I feel the pain just looking at
the attire of the fallen kingdom,

120
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,966
let alone wearing it.

121
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,466
Lord Feng, since you do not
acknowledge yourself as a minister,

122
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:00,966
why have you come to court again?

123
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,700
I am an old man with no city and no troops;

124
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,066
how dare I not come?

125
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,366
Lord Feng,

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,100
what kind of old man are you?

127
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,500
A foolish and stubborn old man,

128
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,633
with no talents or virtue.

129
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,633
Lord Feng, that day in the palace at Shangjing,

130
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,466
I once said:

131
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:30,066
when we meet again,

132
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,133
it may not be you coming to see me.

133
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:33,900
Now,

134
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:35,933
we meet here in Bianliang.

135
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,966
You have aged considerably.

136
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:43,200
Your Majesty, however, remains as radiant as youth times.

137
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,300
That day, I could not keep you,

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,366
so I chased after you here.

139
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,366
Lord Feng,

140
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,400
will you leave again today?

141
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,066
This place is my hometown;

142
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,366
there is nowhere else to go.

143
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,000
Lord Feng, you seem to harbor resentment in your heart.

144
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:05,533
I dare not.

145
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,700
Your Majesty, Chongyuan Hall has been prepared.

146
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,500
Please hold a formal assembly with all officials present.

147
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:40,930
Eldest Young Master,

148
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,760
so everything's over?

149
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,333
Not yet!

150
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,366
All officials, kowtow.

151
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:15,600
Lord Feng.

152
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,500
The rituals between ruler and subject matter.

153
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,930
Your Majesty.

154
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:26,100
Should I kneel?

155
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,500
In the court of Tang,

156
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:29,933
Lord,

157
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,000
were the rules be like this?

158
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,033
The rites and order have collapsed.

159
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:36,933
Lord.

160
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,533
When you kneeled to the Li family, the Shi family...

161
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:40,766
Could it be that

162
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,333
they ask you to kneel themselves, Lord?

163
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,166
I served three emperors, of two dynasties,

164
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,766
and has always been exempt from kneeling.

165
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,166
Even so,

166
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,266
Lord,

167
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,966
could you spare me more respect?

168
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,333
A person from a fallen state,

169
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,733
with the everything gone,

170
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,700
have no repect remains to share.

171
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,200
Lord should not kneel!

172
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,300
Bold!

173
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:16,766
[Yelü Ruan, Prince of Yongkang]
Who are you?

174
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:18,900
[Yelü Ruan, Prince of Yongkang]
How dare you disrupt the court assembly?

175
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,866
I'm Acting Minister of Works, Commander of the Zhendong and Zhenhai Armies,

176
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:26,866
Secretariat Director of the Grand Marshal of All Circuits,

177
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:27,533
Qian Hongchu.

178
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:29,933
I'm bold enough to ask,

179
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,000
under the boundless heavens, on this vast land,

180
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,666
what makes you, the ruler of all people?

181
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:38,800
So you are that Qian Hongchu from Wuyue?

182
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,433
On my journey from Wuyue to the capital, I see everywhere,

183
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:43,966
the cities in ruins,

184
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,333
and people suffering.

185
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,500
After entering the capital I see something even worse:

186
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,000
Zhang Yanze, the former Military Governor
of Zhangyi, allowed his troops to plunder.

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,700
From ministers and nobles

188
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,233
to commoners, all suffered from his dees.

189
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,800
In the Kaifeng government office, he humiliated
the former ruler and brutally killed the State Lady.

190
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,766
His beastly actions are condemned by everyone.

191
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:10,733
Ye the Great Khan is pleased to have such a treacherous subject.

192
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,800
Is this what a sage ruler does?

193
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,700
You brat from Wuyue,

194
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,766
how defiant you are!

195
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
How dare you speak nonsense in the court hall,

196
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,466
defying the sage ruler,

197
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,033
and undermining royal laws?

198
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,333
I have not yet permitted you to speak!

199
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,466
Qian Hongchu,

200
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,300
are you truly not afraid of death?

201
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:50,266
Or, do you thing,

202
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,800
that this Wuyue Kingdom, being far sway

203
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,900
can thus be exempt from my military might?

204
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,133
We Qian clan of Wuyue

205
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,066
serves the Emperor above,

206
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:09,500
and the soldiers and civilians below.

207
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:15,066
I dare not to stand in the same court hall with someone
who oppresses the people and the former emperor.

208
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,233
Khan's military might is formidable.

209
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,300
It can conquer cities and crush armies.

210
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:24,500
But it shows no benevolence, and can't show its
mercy to win the people's support.

211
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:29,233
I, Qian Hongchu, unworthy descendant
of late King Wusu of Wuyue,

212
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,300
would rather die and see my kingdom perish
than serve an unrighteous Emperor.

213
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,966
What a brat you are!

214
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:36,833
How dare you speak nonsense here!

215
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,166
I'll tear your mouth apart!

216
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:38,666
My lord,

217
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:41,300
he's just a child talking recklessly.

218
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,566
Unforgivable!

219
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,366
How dare you trivial Wuyue be so defiant!

220
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:46,233
Just scold him.

221
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:48,066
Just scold him and that will be enough.

222
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:53,000
You esteemed one don't need to get angry over a child.

223
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,600
Lord!

224
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:58,200
Protect His Majesty!

225
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,666
I do wonder what

226
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,966
you taste like.

227
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,900
Don't hurt him!

228
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,066
He is justc a child!

229
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,066
Step aside!

230
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,033
Don't hurt him!

231
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,000
Marshal, calm!

232
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,466
Do not bother with a southern child.

233
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:57,633
Are you all rebelling?

234
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,466
Right and wrong certainly exist.

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,033
The annals of history above,

236
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,566
the land and people below.

237
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,633
the right and worng,

238
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,733
is everlasting.

239
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,033
Is Marshal Zhang alright?

240
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:02,966
He is not badly hurted,

241
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,900
but disgraced indeed.

242
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,900
Good.

243
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,533
Your Majesty

244
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:13,133
We await your decision.

245
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,566
Academician, regarding what happened today,

246
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:28,533
we beseech you and the Lord

247
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,000
to mediate and resolve it.

248
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,400
On the day of the grand assembly, trying to kill a military
governor in the presence of the Emperor and the ministers...

249
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,066
The audacity of our Yong Minister is truly astonishing.

250
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,266
I'm afraid even a deity came,

251
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,600
he would not be safe.

252
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,166
Academician!

253
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:55,000
His actions today

254
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:59,133
were to rid the officials and people of anevil person.

255
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:02,866
The court has shown us, Wuyue,
the grace of leniency under suzerainty.

256
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:06,300
Thus, he felt the duty to draw his blade for the court's sake.

257
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,733
Henceforth, no matter who
becomes the ruler of the Central Plains,

258
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,400
you all, will still be ministers of the Central Plains.

259
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,066
But now,

260
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,400
if you all stand by watching, would this not disappoint
all loyal and righteous men in the land?

261
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,733
Lord Shuiqiu, please calm down.

262
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:34,400
Don't say that.

263
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,100
We can't say that.

264
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,133
Taizhen.

265
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,033
It's cold outside.

266
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,560
Be careful not to catch a chill.

267
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,400
Go back inside and rest.

268
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,366
Elder Brother,

269
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:05,566
didn't you say the grand court assembly was just a formality?

270
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,533
Now it's past noon,

271
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,000
why hasn't they returned yet?

272
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:13,600
General Liu,

273
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,366
is there any news from the palace?

274
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:24,733
Ever since the Khitan Emperor entered the city,
his personal guards have taken over the city defense and street.

275
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,800
Our people cannot get out.

276
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,266
There is still no news.

277
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:00,866
In the palace,

278
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,633
something must have happened.

279
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:08,466
Even for the New Year's Day grand assembly with
the banquet, it should have ended by this time.

280
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:11,833
Gguangyi,

281
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,730
[He Zhen]have some hot porridge.

282
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,166
Thank you, sister.

283
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,200
Lord,

284
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,066
today...

285
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,233
You are not to submit, right?

286
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:38,700
Your Majesty.

287
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,066
Are you in a hurry?

288
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:48,200
How dare I?

289
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,333
I was merely in a hurry for that ten days

290
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:53,866
and that cost Sang Guoqiao's life.

291
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:55,566
It seems as if

292
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,900
I had been eager to kill him.

293
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:01,266
Sang Guoqiao was killed by Zhang Yanze.

294
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,100
It has nothing to do with Your Majesty.

295
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,600
If you, Lord, and Guoqiao

296
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,233
felt unsatisfied with Du Zhongwei,

297
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,533
you could have spoken directly to me.

298
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,166
Why do you make it like this?

299
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,900
The hundred thousand soldiers and civilians here

300
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,433
say that for ten days.

301
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,333
Your Majesty...

302
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,500
Did you hear them?

303
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,133
So that's how it is.

304
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:28,833
I...

305
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,533
had not intended to kill Guoqiao.

306
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,100
And you had not intend to kill the Lady of Chu.

307
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,833
I understand.

308
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,766
Now Zhang Yanze is severely wounded,

309
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:48,800
There need to be someone in charge
of the troops within the city.

310
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,933
What's your recommendation, Lord?

311
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:54,066
Your Majesty commands a million warriors.

312
00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:56,933
You surely do not lack commanders.

313
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,933
Ruan,

314
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:00,633
your opinion?

315
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,800
Since Your Majesty is consulting Lord Feng,

316
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,433
Lord can be appointed Grand Tutor to temporarily oversee
all military affairs inside and outside the Eastern Capital.

317
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:10,900
[Yelü Wuzhi, Grand Commisioner of Clan Justice]
I think what the Prince

318
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,366
[Yelü Wuzhi, Grand Commisioner of Clan Justice]
just said makes sense.

319
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:13,766
Lord,

320
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,400
your opinion?

321
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:23,633
I hide my hands in robes in the morning and in
three quilts at night, not to be exposed in the cold air.

322
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,933
When winter passes ice dissolves themselves,
and grass grows itself.

323
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:34,160
Things go like that, so, forgive my offense.

324
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:36,866
I, this old man,

325
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,700
dare not accept

326
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:40,733
the position of Grand Tutor.

327
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:41,266
Lord Feng!

328
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,700
Let him finish speaking.

329
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,833
If Your Majesty

330
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,333
grants  me one request,

331
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,600
I might try with an effort to manage

332
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:55,433
the military affairs inside and outside the Eastern Capital.

333
00:22:57,866 --> 00:22:59,266
Lord, speak freely.

334
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,700
Acting Minister of Works Qian Hongchu

335
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:10,133
misbehaved in court, profaning the rites of court.

336
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:15,600
He should be stripped of his titles and emoluments,
and put into the southern prison.

337
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,366
Let the authorities related
thoroughly deliberate his crimes.

338
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,300
His Majesty has issued an edict:

339
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:43,700
I decide to appoint you to handlt the court affairs.

340
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,333
The regional affairs shall still be handled by the law.

341
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:51,033
Grand Tutor Feng Dao, whose virtue
has known in two dynasties and reputation is widespread,

342
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,400
can make thoughtful plans and measured arrangements,

343
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,866
Hereby granted authority over
military affairs within and outside.

344
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:58,600
All other duties remain as before.

345
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,400
Approved.

346
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:02,233
Lord.

347
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:07,166
Give it to me.

348
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:18,133
You ministers:

349
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:20,500
Merit must be rewarded,

350
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:21,966
and crime must be punished.

351
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,233
Acting Minister of Works,

352
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,733
Commander of Zhenhai and Zhendong
Armies' Military Governor's Office,

353
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,333
Secretariat Director of the Grand Marshal's Office, Qian Hongchu,

354
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:34,233
holding a weighty position in a foreing state,

355
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:36,933
misbehaved in court, profaning the rites of court.

356
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:40,733
He lacks the integrity of loyalty,
and is guilty of transgression.

357
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:44,766
According to the compiled references,
he should have been executed by law.

358
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:48,433
Yet, to show special leniency, we impose a light punishment.

359
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:51,466
All his official titles and ranks shall be stripped,

360
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,300
his duties and assignments revoked.

361
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:57,166
Put him into the Censorate prison to wait
for deliberation of his crimes.

362
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:57,966
Approved.

363
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,633
Your Majesty posses unparalleled skill
and insight in deciding state strategy.

364
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,933
We will follow your orders.

365
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,466
We will follow your orders.

366
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,900
Time todecode.

367
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,800
State affairs cannot be delayed.

368
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
What state affairs?

369
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,233
Before today,

370
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,266
Taiyuan or Yexia,

371
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:37,666
you had to choose one.

372
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:39,200
Once today passed,

373
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:40,633
there is no choice left.

374
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:44,300
Ninth Son,

375
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,766
has already chosen.

376
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,766
Envoy, Third Young Master,

377
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,600
Young Master Guo arrived.

378
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,866
Guo Rong, pays respects to Envoy.

379
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,466
No need for formalities.

380
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:08,333
I invited Young Master here today
to discuss importance affairs.

381
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,800
Importance affairs?

382
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:20,733
The King of Wuyue, Military Governor
of Zhendong and Zhenhai Armies,

383
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,666
Grand Marshal of All Circuits, Lord Qian,

384
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,433
sends his regards to the Military Governor of Hedong,

385
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,066
Commander of the Northern Campaign, Lord of Beiping, Lord Liu.

386
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,533
He urges Lord Liu, for the legitimate succession
of the Central Plains and the people,

387
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,166
to ascend the throne,

388
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,466
to pacify the people.

389
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:50,033
Shi Shouxin, Wang Zhengzhong,
take over the defense of the Left First Ward.

390
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:50,700
Yes. Yes.

391
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:54,100
Li Jixun, Liu Qingyi,
take over the defense of the Right First Ward.

392
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:55,466
Yes. Yes.

393
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,500
Yang Guangyi, Liu Shouzhong,
Take over the defense of the left two wings.

394
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:01,000
Yes.

395
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,433
All troops from Yexia within the jurisdiction
are to be reorganized and reassigned.

396
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:08,400
Those who violate military law will be executed immediately.

397
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:09,966
Yes.

398
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:22,966
Father

399
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,700
Marshal Yao only has two commands under him.

400
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,166
I'm afraid...

401
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
You need not worry about him.

402
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:29,566
Kuangyin,

403
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,566
you go on my behalf to Jiebei Alley.

404
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:34,566
This is important,

405
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,566
concerning the life of our entire clan.

406
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:41,466
We must not be the slightest bit careless.

407
00:27:41,466 --> 00:27:41,900
Yes.

408
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:51,133
Lord,

409
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:55,000
Zhao Kuangyin, Commander of the Imperial Guard
18th Command, requests an audience.

410
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,666
Invite him in.

411
00:27:55,866 --> 00:27:56,233
Yes

412
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:09,933
Kuangyin.

413
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,800
Rest assured, Envoy.

414
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,366
My father sent me here to report on his behalf,
that Lord Feng has already issued the order:

415
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:29,200
The prefectural office and the prison
are both in Minister Xue's charge.

416
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:33,000
He, from Bianliang city, has a conscience.

417
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
As for Hongchu, a true man, a true hero,

418
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,866
Minister Xue will not allow
the slightest humiliation or grievance any longer.

419
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:40,560
Thank you very much.

420
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:05,833
Stick it on.

421
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:15,933
Well I must

422
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,033
thank everyone for this.

423
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:20,466
When did I have

424
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:21,533
this long beard,

425
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:23,266
and such broad shoulders?

426
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,033
Might I trouble you to hurry on this journey
and return to Jinyang.

427
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,133
Give it to me.

428
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:35,600
The petition urging ascension to the throne.

429
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,400
What?

430
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,000
Young Master.

431
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,733
Now that burned it,

432
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:06,400
how will you return to Jinyang to present the petition?

433
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,600
I have already memorized it.

434
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,000
The ministers urging ascension.

435
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,666
Marshal Zhao is listed first among the military officers.

436
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:14,533
I am the witness.

437
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,600
Very well.

438
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,966
Then please

439
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,400
set off quickly.

440
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:20,766
However,

441
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,700
now is not yet the time to return to Jinyang.

442
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:30,100
Young Master, state affaris are paramount.
Please return to Jinyang immediately.

443
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,266
The situation in the capital is already like this.

444
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,733
You, Young Master, is promising.

445
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:37,000
The place for you to make great achievements
should be the north.

446
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,866
Young Master,

447
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:39,800
consider it carefully.

448
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,400
When Hongchu was standing against the treacherous villain
with drawn blades in the hall that day,

449
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,900
did he ever think of the word "achievements"?

450
00:30:58,433 --> 00:30:59,766
Kuangyin, please arrange for me

451
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,100
to meet Lord Feng.

452
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,333
This place originally was the main hall of our Censorate,
where the senior officials usually conduct trials.

453
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,300
The cells in the Censorate are all damp, cold, and dark.

454
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,166
The young masters from Kaifeng City are in a haste,

455
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,800
so we have had no time to build new cells.

456
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:28,200
The sunniest room in the courtyard

457
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:29,666
is this chamber.

458
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:32,533
So we moved you here to rest.

459
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:41,533
Thank you.

460
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:52,833
Hongchu.

461
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:00,033
Hongchu.

462
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:03,033
Hongchu.

463
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,166
They really let you in.

464
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,000
Don't cry.

465
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,033
Don't cry.

466
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm perfectly fine, aren't I?

467
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:07,900
Go.

468
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,600
Guo Rong pays respects to the Lord.

469
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:22,466
Sit.

470
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:24,333
I dare not.

471
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:28,300
You came here,

472
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:29,766
for what?

473
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:34,333
Lord,

474
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,000
I have three matters.

475
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:37,866
The first,

476
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,800
concerns the Qian's Ninth Young Master.

477
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,200
Minister Qian is a man of sincere character.

478
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,733
Unaware of the court's treachery,
and the wickedness in human hearts,

479
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,933
He boldly drew his blade in the great hall,
risking his own interest and safety.

480
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,633
Lord, you have great virtue.

481
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:58,066
If you can save his life, you will
fulfill for me the bond between us.

482
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,566
On behalf of the gentlemen of Jinyang, I'm thankful, Lord.

483
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,633
This matter is not for you to offer thanks,

484
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:10,366
neither for those from Jinyang.

485
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,933
The second matter？

486
00:34:16,366 --> 00:34:17,166
The second matter.

487
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:20,400
I beg you, Lord, to hold the Khitan ruler for some time.

488
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,266
You are asking me

489
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,000
to submit to the Khitan Emperor?

490
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,960
Only you can accomplish this, Lord.

491
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:34,866
I beg you to endure humiliation for the plan,
for the sake of the world

492
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:37,300
On behalf of everyone in the world, I'm thankful, Lord.

493
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:41,366
What is the third matter?

494
00:34:43,366 --> 00:34:45,700
Prevent Du Zhongwei from coming here.

495
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,300
Right?

496
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:48,300
Exactly.

497
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,966
For the sake of the Central Plains, for the sake of
the common people, I beg you, Lord, to handle this.

498
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:56,200
The Lord of Beiping,

499
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:58,266
and Lord of Taiyuan, Liu Zhiyuan...

500
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:02,100
Is he willing to take on the responsibility for this realm?

501
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,833
Lord Liu's always thinks ahead and plans thorouly.

502
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:08,100
I dare not  make inferences.

503
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:09,333
What about you?

504
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:12,733
At this very moment,

505
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,233
right here within this city,

506
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,600
are you willing to take on

507
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,100
the responsibility for this realm?

508
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:25,800
To save the Qian's Ninth Young Master,

509
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,766
hold the Khitan Emperor,

510
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:31,233
and prevent Du Zhongwei from reaching the city,

511
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:34,233
I only need to do one thing, that is

512
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,766
to capture you, this spy from Jinyang,

513
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:38,500
tie you up with a rope,

514
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,366
send you into the Daning Palace,

515
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:43,533
and present you to the Khitan Emperor as a pledge of loyalty

516
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:49,833
For the people all over the world,

517
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:51,333
are you,

518
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:54,666
willing to die?

519
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,700
If my life can be of help to your plan,

520
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:05,533
you may take it as you wish.

521
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:13,900
You may go.

522
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:16,900
Does this mean you agreed?

523
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:18,900
Yes

524
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
But not for you.

525
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,566
Nor for Liu Zhiyuan.

526
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,900
I am doing this for Sang Guoqiao,

527
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,100
and for Qian's Ninth Young Master.

528
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:32,400
I,

529
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,233
bow in gratitude to you.

530
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:44,933
Now that you have met Lord Feng,

531
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:46,900
what are you going to do next?

532
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:51,066
It's time to leave the city and head north, right?

533
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,900
Kuangyin.

534
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:56,633
There's still one thing.

535
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,533
What is it?

536
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,500
Can you make a trip to Jinyang for me?

537
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:03,933
He refuses to leave the capital?

538
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:10,800
He says that Lord Feng is taking great risks
and Qian's Ninth Young Master is still in prison.

539
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:16,400
If he left the capital and fled at this time,
he would be ashamed to enter the Xuanyang Gate again.

540
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,500
Father.

541
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,700
Should I go?

542
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:27,133
Do you want to?

543
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,933
Have you considered,

544
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:38,066
if both Lord Feng and Guo Rong fail,

545
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:41,400
and Du Zhongwei takes the capital one step earlier,

546
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,566
what should you do then?

547
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,600
Father, you will still be in the capital.

548
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,400
You will surely teach me how to protect myself.

549
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,966
If you pledge allegiance to Lord Liu,

550
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:10,866
and I submit to Du Zhongwei,

551
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:13,266
what will you do then?

552
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:17,833
Kuangyin.

553
00:38:19,566 --> 00:38:20,600
Remember,

554
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:24,833
in times of chaos

555
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,000
there are no fathers and sons.

556
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,000
If one day

557
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,100
you and I face each other as foes on the battlefield,

558
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,466
you must not show any mercy.

559
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,733
You left and returned.

560
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,100
Why?

561
00:38:57,266 --> 00:38:58,566
I came to bid farewell to you.

562
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:01,500
Taiyuan is in the northern region.

563
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,166
The wind is strong, and it's colder than the capital.

564
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,966
Take more clothes with you.

565
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,800
Anything else?

566
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,500
During the ten days fighting outside the city,

567
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,333
one thousand three hundred and thirty-six
have earned merit of killing enemies.

568
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,500
Among them, three hundred and twelve
should be granted official status.

569
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,633
Thirty-six should be promoted to junior attendants.

570
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,533
Additionally, Li Jixun, Shi Shouxin, and
Yang Guangyi, three generals,

571
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:42,466
have merits, and should be promoted.

572
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:48,033
Li should be promoted to
Deputy Commissioner of the Ceremonial Office.

573
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:51,800
Shi should be promoted to
Deputy Commissioner of the Eastern Dyeing Office.

574
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,500
Yang should be promoted to
Deputy Commissioner of the Supply Treasury.

575
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,300
Five hundred and seventy-eight are wounded and disabled.

576
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,933
According to regulations, each
should be rewarded with five taels of silver,

577
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:09,533
five bolts of silk, ten strings of cash,
one hundred catties of grain, and two sets of winter clothes.

578
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,433
Eight hundred and eighty-six died in battle for the country.

579
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:17,900
Their families should be visited and generously compensated.

580
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,900
The roster has already been compiled.

581
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,800
Here is the roster.

582
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,233
Rise.

583
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:26,066
Thank you, Lord.

584
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:31,300
One hundred men form a company.

585
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,200
Five companies form a command.

586
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,200
Five commands,

587
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:38,066
form a division.

588
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,300
In this battle, you commanded nearly tem commands,

589
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:43,600
which is twodivisions.

590
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,766
Kuangyin.

591
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:47,833
do you know

592
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,200
what should a general be like?

593
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,466
To be brave in battle, strategic in employing troops,

594
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:58,266
impartial in enforcing discipline,
and good at caring for the soldiers.

595
00:40:58,266 --> 00:40:59,400
But in the army,

596
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:02,700
every bowl of  rice, every piece of clothes

597
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:04,366
where do they come from?

598
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,033
From the taxes and levies of the court.

599
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,766
They are split into Summer and Autumn Taxes.

600
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:14,166
For Summer Tax,

601
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,900
there should be six sheng of grain
for each mu of upper-grade fields,

602
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:20,433
and four sheng for each mu of lower-grade fields.

603
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:21,933
For Autumn Tax

604
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,130
there should be five sheng of grain
for each mu of upper-grade fields,

605
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,433
and three sheng for each mu of lower-grade fields.

606
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:33,033
Local governments also have their own rules. There are also
taxes for houses, commision charge, and so on.

607
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,433
All in all,

608
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:37,600
there will be no less than ten categories.

609
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:40,700
Every brick and tile

610
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,066
in the capital,

611
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,433
is the people's hard-earned wealth.

612
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,600
The world has been in turmoil for a hundred years.

613
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
In the palace,

614
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:58,700
there are unworthy emperors like the Shi family.

615
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,100
In the army,

616
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,366
there are also marshals like Zhang Yanze

617
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,733
who devour the people.

618
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:07,500
You are right.

619
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:10,233
Being a general

620
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:16,566
requires courage and wisdom, requires fair and impartial
judgments, and requires skills in comforting soldiers.

621
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,766
You must also understand

622
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:22,600
the hardship of the common people,

623
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,100
their sufferings,

624
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:28,400
and the hardship of surviving the chaos.

625
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,233
One day,

626
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,533
you will also become a marshal.

627
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:40,666
If the Emperor fail to do what a ruler should do,

628
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,966
and all the ministers fail to do what subjects should do

629
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:48,300
I hope you can insist to do

630
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:51,800
what a general should do.

631
