[Episode 8]

15
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,033
What's wrong?

16
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,730
Ambushed on the road?

17
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,833
Less than twenty miles away from the
enemy's vanguard are Weibo scouts.

18
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,933
Moreover, long-range ones.

19
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:08,166
Scouts from Weibo. If I had really encountered
that distant reconnaissance cavalry,

20
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,160
I would really not have returned.

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,466
Is the enemy still able to move effectively?

22
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:20,300
The horses are all laden with gold, jewelry,
household belongings and silk.

23
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:27,466
These scoundrels have actually traveled
a road of luxury from Yexia to the capital.

24
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:28,766
Mind your words.

25
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,960
I am now the commander of this army.

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,066
Yes.

27
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:44,066
The enemy is advancing along the Bian River like a flood.

28
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:47,333
Light cavalry scouts are on the east guarding the flanks.

29
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,433
Infantry is on the west in four columns,

30
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,200
but there are eight great banners
[great banners represent the highest general]

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,666
and two black banners with eagle feathers.
[great banners represent the highest general]

32
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,133
Black banners with eagle feathers.
[Black banners with eagle feathers represent Khitan elite army]

33
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,030
That is a banner system only used by

34
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,433
Khitan nobles of the Ordo and above.
[Ordo, a position managing clan affairs]

35
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,133
Anything else?

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,333
Between the great banner columns,
there are many labors.

37
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:07,666
Unable to advance fully, I don't know the exact number.

38
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,530
I estimate that there should be over ten thousand people.

39
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:21,200
Gathering private wealth and coercing civilians,

40
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,700
they can only cover three to five miles per hour at most.

41
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,133
It seems they won't arrive at noon.

42
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,733
Probably we'll wait until sunset.

43
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Go and get something to eat.

44
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,400
Yes.

45
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:33,200
Let's go.

46
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,633
Go.

47
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:34,000
Go.

48
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:35,066
Tired?

49
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,500
They will arrive at sunset.

50
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,700
Didn't you say noon?

51
00:03:56,133 --> 00:04:01,000
The Military Governor of Hedong's Deputy Residence Envoy's son
serves in Young Master Zhao's cavalry.

52
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:02,966
He sent back that message.

53
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,800
They are Young Master Zhao's words.

54
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:08,866
Fan Zhi.

55
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,166
Lord.

56
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,800
Is that the Lady of Chu?

57
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:16,833
[Lady Ding, Lady of Chu State]
It is.

58
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,033
[Lady Ding, Lady of Chu State]
The Empress Dowager is devoted to Buddhism,

59
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,733
[Lady Ding, Lady of Chu State]
unwilling to attend to affairs.

60
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,333
The Empress must stay by His Majesty's side
and can't leave him.

61
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,333
Most of the women in the palace are timid and weak.

62
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,233
Thanks to the Lady of Chu stepping forward...

63
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:30,766
Otherwise,

64
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:34,533
with so many refugees' families
crowded within the imperial city,

65
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,066
it would be hard to avoid trouble.

66
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:40,866
Whether Zhang Yanze comes or not,

67
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,900
we need to stick to the plan.

68
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,600
Let's go back.

69
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:46,866
Yes.

70
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,366
The Nanqing River to the north
can force the enemy into a do-or-die position.

71
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,833
They are trapped between the Nanqing River and the moat.

72
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,700
Even with thousands of troops, it would be difficult to deploy.

73
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,633
If the enemy attacks from the east,

74
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,466
the only path they can take is
the one at the foot of the mountain Yi.

75
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,200
That road is only two hundred paces wide.

76
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,500
The terrain is narrow, easy to defend, hard to attack.

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,633
If they ascend the mountain and occupy the high position,

78
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:23,566
then they will also be obstructed by Nanqing River,

79
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,133
still unable to deploy their forces.

80
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:31,666
It's clearly that the position your son has chosen for
the camps is extremely well selected.

81
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,500
Young Master Zhao

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,433
deployed archers from several commands
all within the auxiliary city.

83
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,600
Even if a large force attack, it might not necessarily succeed.

84
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,666
He merely fancies himself clever.

85
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,300
Your praise is truly too high.

86
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,966
Marshal, you are too modest.

87
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,233
Your son, though young,

88
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:56,233
already possesses the virtue of a great general.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,966
They will each use up a quiver of thirty-six wolf-fang arrows.

90
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:09,100
There are one hundred men, which means
three thousand six hundred arrows, safety ensured.

91
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,966
Don't deceive me.

92
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,133
How could there possibly be a hundred men?

93
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,500
Not so many, but there are certainly eighty.

94
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,830
Skilled archers are hard to find.

95
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,033
In each command, there are all elites and close guards.

96
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:25,100
Who dares to pocket soldiers' pay in such a place?

97
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,600
That would risk his own life.

98
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,566
Where did these crossbows come from?

99
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:39,466
Before this expedition, the Marshal specifically
requested them from the imperial armory.

100
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:43,566
After discarding the damp
and useless ones, sixty-six remain.

101
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:44,500
That's good.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,930
Take this.

103
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,500
If you feel understaffed, I'll assign two more squads to you.

104
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:53,933
No need.

105
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,900
Really?

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,700
Although drawing the string is less exhausting,

107
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,233
when battle start, exhaustion can be inevitable.

108
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:07,333
It can be crucial fro them to taking turns
and rest at critical moments.

109
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,960
[Li Jixun, Commander of Imperial Guards]
Makes sense. Do as what you said.

111
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,100

Sir!

116
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,333
Calm down.

117
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,066
Say it clearly.

118
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:27,666
Sir,

119
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,030
the enemy troops are coming from the east.

120
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,333
Order the entire army

121
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,833
to encamp ten li from the city.

122
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:54,866
Scouts, advance two hundred paces
to shelter the left flank of the main force.

123
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:57,833
Tell everyone to be careful.

124
00:08:58,533 --> 00:08:59,600
In the city...

125
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,966
must be something strange.

126
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:03,333
Understood.

127
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,266
It's true that Zhang Yanze has a bad temper.

128
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:24,000
But when it comes to military talent, few can match him
among the all the generals in the world.

129
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,133
Expecting him to be careless and underestimate the enemy,
suffering a minor setback, is probably unrealistic.

130
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:39,700
Although the enemy troops are weary from their long journey
with an arrogant attitude, they are still impregnable.

131
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,500
Zhang Yanze has long been in charge of military affairs.

132
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,000
Both the late Emperor and the current one
have had enough of him,

133
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:50,300
yet they never stripped him of his military authority.

134
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,330
There is indeed some reason for that.

135
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,000
There will be no battle today.

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,533
Tell everyone to be cautious.

137
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:58,000
Understood.

138
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,933
Zhang didn't attack the city.

139
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,866
He has long been in charge of military affairs.

140
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:05,766
He is not in a haste for this moment.

141
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,700
How's the condition inside?

142
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,666
Everything including provisions,
funds, and civilian labor have all been properly arranged.

143
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,566
From tonight, the capital will reinstate the night curfew.

144
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:22,333
It's just one day.
This is quite an achievement.

145
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,400
What about the conscripts?

146
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Reporting to the Lord, those who entered the city yesterday

147
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,833
have been registered into over seven thousand households,
forming seventy units.

148
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,533
Well enough.

149
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,333
Any unusual movements with those from
the military commands and other states?

150
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,766
The attendants from various sides
have been incorporated into the guard.

151
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,633
As for the guest residences,

The Rites of Zhou states:

155
00:10:57,433 --> 00:11:00,900
Diplomatic relations consist of
envoys' visits and formal exchanges.

156
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:03,466
Now,

157
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,900
the Emperor has abandoned the state,

158
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,866
the Khitan army is pressing upon the capital region,

159
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:11,800
officials have fled,

160
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,466
and people are uneasy.

161
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:17,400
Regime change can be just around the corner.

162
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:18,900
[Xu Xuan, Secretariat Officer of Southern Tang]
Lord Feng,

163
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,666
[Xu Xuan, Secretariat Officer of Southern Tang]
a senior minister entrusted with the late emperor's will,

164
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,366
failed not only to serve the sovereign and secure the state,

165
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:29,800
but also to govern the armies and pacify the people.

166
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:33,700
Instead he to force the abandonment
of state rituals and detain envoys,

167
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,533
ordering the gentlemen of other states as if herding slaves.

168
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,166
Mr. Sang, are your coming here

169
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,533
as a envoy' visit, or for formal exchanges?

170
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,966
Xu Dingchen,

171
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:52,466
do you still only have these nonsense?

172
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:58,166
It is Jin who faces collapse and disorder,

173
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,266
not our Great Tang.

174
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:06,366
Then what if Du Zhongwei surrenders,
giving the prefectures of Hebei to Khitan?

175
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,000
If the late emperor could give away
land of the empire,so can Lord Du.

176
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,400
Du Zhongwei may sell Hebei to Khitan.

177
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,833
But it's not likely he dare to give away Henan.

178
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,633
I, Sang, dare.

179
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:34,666
It was actually me who sold
the Sixteen Prefectures of Yan and Yun to Khitan.

180
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:38,200
When it comes to doing business with Khitan,

181
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,700
Du Zhongwei

182
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:42,000
probably cannot surpass me.

183
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,833
Eternal history above,

184
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,500
if you really dare,

185
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,000
you, Sang Weihan,

186
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,866
will be the biggest sinner on this land of China!

187
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,700
I already am.

188
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:01,566
Selling a few more prefectures merely means I still am.

189
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,600
If by doing so,

190
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,666
I can make your Great Tang face the Khitan on your north border,

191
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:12,666
and show the counties of Huainan
what it is like to be treated like fodder,

192
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,000
like leftover dishes,

193
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,666
like a small food stall,

194
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,866
and have the sovereign and ministers
in Jiangning City living in uneasiness,

195
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:26,166
then it is good enough for me.

196
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,000
Sang Guoqiao,

197
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:32,066
what on earth do you want?

198
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:33,766
Lord Feng says that,

199
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,266
our Great Jin is hopeless.

200
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:38,900
We can surrender to Khitan,

201
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:40,900
but cannot surrender to Yexia,

202
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,933
let along Zhang Yanze.

203
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,133
That is your affair!

204
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,433
Also your affair.

205
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,433
Guoqiao

206
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,800
You've done a hard job.

207
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,100
In governing the state, I'm not as good as you are.

208
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:09,233
When it comes to betraying the country,
you are not as good as I am.

209
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,333
Xu Xuan has agreed?

210
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,266
Before the Khitan Emperor arrives in the capital,

211
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,433
Southern Tang will not connect with
Du Zhongwei or Zhang Yanze.

212
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:26,300
If those two send messengers or spies,

213
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,066
Xu Xuan will decline on behalf of the Southern Tang.

214
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,760
As for the Southern Tang guards
incorporated into the Imperial Guard,

215
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,100
he has dispatched Li Yuanqing, Officer of the Northerna
Department of Privy Council, to train and discipline them.

216
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,300
They won't cause trouble before the city falls.

217
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,333
Before the turmoil in the capital ends,

218
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,666
Southern Tang will not take the opportunity to attack Wuyue.

219
00:14:55,633 --> 00:15:00,133
This humble official, Shuiqiu, thank you
on behalf of the King of Wuyue.

220
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,000
Minister Sang,

221
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,630
forgive my offensive question.

222
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:23,200
If Southern Tang refuses to comply
and insists on collude with Zhang,

223
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:23,866
will you,

224
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,000
really sell Henan and Hebei?

225
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,033
Minister.

226
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,500
This is not something we vassal officials should ask.

227
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,100
Lord Shuiqiu,

228
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,266
I want to know the answer.

229
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:41,766
Young Master Qian,

230
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,566
in your opinion,

231
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:45,433
should I sell them,

232
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:47,633
or not?

233
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:49,300
I don't know.

234
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,866
Since childhood, I have been educated
and reading sages' articles.

235
00:15:57,066 --> 00:16:00,533
I read that, Confucius wrote his book, and the rebels fear.

236
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:05,233
But whatever, betraying the country
and surrendering territory is always wrong,

237
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:05,733
isn't it?

238
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,366
Since you can tell right from wrong,

239
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,000
then,

240
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,933
why did you ask that question?

241
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,900
If I were in Hangzhou,

242
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,600
it would certainly be wrong beyond dispute.

243
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:18,500
However,

244
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,600
on this journey to the Central Plains,

245
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:24,233
I am becoming more and more confused.

246
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,133
What I originally thought was right, or wrong,

247
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,400
seems to be both right and wrong.

248
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,266
And today,

249
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,433
after hearing your words and deeds,

250
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:38,233
I thought about the words "right and wrong".

251
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,300
It suddenly seems that discussing
right and wrong at this moment

252
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,733
is like asking those starving in lack of grain
why don't say eat meat.

253
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,730
It's the most absurd thing in the world.

254
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,333
Why do you think that?

255
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:54,500
I don’t know either.

256
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,800
I just felt suddenly so confused, and I asked.

257
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,500
Please forgive me.

258
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,066
So good to be young.

259
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,900
What did you say?

260
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,066
Nothing.

261
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,466
I have lived a few more years, so I slightly
have more experience and insight, Young Master Qian.

262
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,433
Are you willing to trust my words?

263
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,433
Awaiting your wise words.

264
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,560
Right and wrong do exist.

265
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:27,600
They must exist.

266
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,466
With the annals of history above,

267
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,366
with the land and people below,

268
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:34,400
they have always been hard to handle.

269
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,366
But, because of no matter who or what reason,

270
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:43,366
betraying the country, and handing over
our soldiers, civilians, and land to Khitan,

271
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,366
causing our land to be someone else's territory,
and our people to be inferior to another authority,

272
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,100
are,

273
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:57,100
my eternal crime,

274
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,500
and the empire's eternal shame.

275
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,133
So if oneday,

276
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:08,300
someone tells you, Young Master,

277
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,733
that the late Emperor was forced by circumstances,
or that I, Sang, had no choice,

278
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:16,233
please do not hesitate and immediately kill that villain,

279
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,600
to rid the world,

280
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
of a wicked one.

281
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,600
What are you thinking about again now?

282
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,400
Don't you think

283
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:19,966
that we were just a joke when in Wuyue?

284
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:24,433
What nonsense are you talking about again?

285
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,333
I truly feel that I,

286
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,600
am a joke.

287
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,900
After my father passed away,

288
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,433
Sixth Brother took control of the two armies,

289
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:38,933
killed Marshal Dai, and imprisoned
Third Brother and Eldest Brother.

290
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:40,866
I believed Sixth Brother was wrong.

291
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,466
So I went to argue with him.

292
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:44,400
I wanted to save Third Brother.

293
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,933
Mr. Shen gave me the inspiration.

294
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:48,433
That's why I sent you the letter.

295
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:53,800
Then your mother led a team, blocked the Qiantang River,

296
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,830
and rescued Third Brother.

297
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,966
At that time, in my heart,

298
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,300
I was extremely proud.

299
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,766
I was proud that Sixth Brother didn't know that
all those things were plotted by me.

300
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:13,733
It was I, his good-for-nothing brother, who idles away
in fish markets all day, who pulled it off single-handedly.

301
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,800
You truly saved my elder brother's life.

302
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,933
It was merely one life, of also my elder brother's.

303
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:23,100
That clerk surnamed Guo,

304
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,900
killed a man in front of so many people.

305
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:33,166
I know he did it to uphold the law and maintain order,

306
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,233
so that more people would follow the rules,

307
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:39,566
and so that more people would survive.

308
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,933
But I just can't understand.

309
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,366
The lives of these many people matter,

310
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,433
so the life of that one person

311
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
doesn't matter?

312
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,433
If...

313
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,966
If we can return to Hangzhou alive,

314
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:06,366
will you marry me?

315
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:15,966
My mother said, if you dare to
have some affairs with me but not marry me,

316
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,600
she will block the Qiantang River again as your reckoning.

317
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,660
Why are you suddenly thinking about that?

318
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:31,366
I was just thinking,

319
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,300
if this city falls tomorrow,

320
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,966
we might both die here.

321
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,466
If we are to die here, of course I have to think about

322
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,033
where shall I be buried, and
whether to be buried together with you.

323
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,266
If I am to be buried with you,

324
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:55,633
what's my identity?

325
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,000
Look at the people in this city.

326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,530
Every day, so many people struggle to live.

327
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:12,833
The people around us are so busy
as if their feet were not on the ground,

328
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,066
and as if they did't need to eat or sleep.

329
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:16,766
But you,

330
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,400
you spend all day like a fool.

331
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,860
You'd better think carefully whether you are really
going to marry me rather than dwell on these things.

332
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:28,966
At least I'll know,

333
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,766
whether I shall be buried besides you when I die.

334
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:34,300
At least,

335
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:36,800
that's something you can do for me right now.

336
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,233
So you mean,

337
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,466
everyone else is doing their jobs,

338
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:50,766
while only I am worrying for nothing.

339
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,366
You are not to blame.

340
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:06,700
After all,

341
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,033
you were born as a noble prince living in luxury.

342
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,566
On the sea,

343
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,260
hundreds of fishing boats and vessels capsize every year.

344
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,500
How many people end up in bellies of fish?

345
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,066
How many people can never
see their wives and children again?

346
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:25,800
You know?

347
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,700
When a person dies in the sea,

348
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,633
their body won't sink.

349
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,766
It becomes swollen, bloated by the seawater, turns pale,

350
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,300
and then,

351
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:42,500
floats on the surface,

352
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:46,200
devoured by big and small fish.

353
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,266
It will never, never

354
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:51,433
rest in the earth.

355
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,100
This capital city right now

356
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:58,533
is like that great ship.

357
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:00,766
The people on this ship...

358
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:04,000
Some are tying the mooring ropes.

359
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,666
Some are repairing the ship.

360
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,266
Some are mending the sails and nets.

361
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,566
Some are rowing the oars.

362
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:13,366
And you,

363
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,333
a scion of a noble family who has never seen storms,

364
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,533
even unable to carry something heavy on your shoulders,

365
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:21,600
what can you possibly do?

366
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,300
Only today do I realize,

367
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,733
how utterly useless I am.

368
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:45,900
Actually, in this world,

369
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:48,866
there are not many heroes who can save the world.

370
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:49,600
Most are

371
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,233
useless people like you and me.

372
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,100
Actually, it isn't so bad being a useless person.

373
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,633
At least,

374
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,530
there's no need worrying too much every day.

375
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:06,000
As for those national strategies, matters of right and wrong,
rituals, and the welfare of the people,

376
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:09,366
let those with capability think over and handle them.

377
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:14,966
What we need to take care of are the people around
and the matters in our hands.

378
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:17,700
Then, our lives worth living.

379
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
Send another fifty men.

380
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:46,800
Transfer them over there tonight to guard that pass.

381
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:47,666
Yes

382
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:48,433
Yes.

383
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,660
What are you doing here?

384
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:13,133
Reporting to the Commander,
Qian Hongchu, awaits your orders.

385
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,900
You think this is a game?

386
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,466
This is war. People can die.

387
00:26:17,466 --> 00:26:19,266
Yes, I know

388
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:23,166
Go away.

389
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:23,930
Third Brother.

390
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,100
Third Brother!

391
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,730
Third Prince.

392
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:28,333
Ninth Prince,

393
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,700
When the bandits attack the city later,
it will be dangerous.

394
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,833
Arrows have no eyes.

395
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:35,460
No one will be able to look after you.

396
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,166
Reporting to Lord,

397
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:38,866
I know.

398
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,600
You know, yet you insist, right?

399
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,166
The bandits have surrounded the city
and disaster is imminent.

400
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:48,800
A mere Minister of Works from Wuyue,
is worthless within the capital.

401
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:49,733
I can do nothing.

402
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:57,300
So, I, Junior Officer of the Third Unit
of the Wuyue Royal Guard, Qian Hongchu,

403
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,700
awaits you two's military orders.

404
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,760
Can you even draw a bow?

405
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:19,900
Enough.

406
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Your humble subordinate can hold a shield.

407
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:05,266
Young Master,

408
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,933
Scouts report: Zhang has left camp.

409
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:12,800
There's five thousand cavalry, ten thousand infantry,
in six column, and one thousand Khitan troops.

410
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:24,366
Pass my order:

411
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:28,366
All commanders, guard the city walls.

412
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:32,100
Anyone who leaves camp without orders
will be executed immediately,

413
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,900
Anyone who disrupt morale will be execute immediately.

414
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,533
Yes.

415
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,900
Beat the drums.

416
00:28:51,366 --> 00:28:53,800
First cavalry battalion, sweep Xuanyang Gate.

417
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,833
Second battalion, sweep Yingchu Gate.

418
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,900
Archers, volley at a hundred paces.

419
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,733
Yes.

420
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:02,066
Tell everyone to be careful.

421
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:04,333
Do not approach Yingchu Gate.

422
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:05,800
Within a hundred paces,

423
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,033
be careful not to be hurt by those boys.

424
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,600
Pass the shields.

425
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,933
Pass the shields.

426
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:37,900
Which lap is this?

427
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,900
The fourth.

428
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,400
One lap is three hundred to five hundred meters.
So three laps are two to three li.

429
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,333
The horses are strong in the morning.
Running ten or so li isn't a big deal.

430
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:51,600
Then you hold on for ten laps.
Tell all commanders, serve the meal half an hour early.

431
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:51,933
Yes.

432
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:19,700
Pass the shields.

433
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:21,133
Pass the shields.

434
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,066
Drag him down.

435
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:43,200
Eleven dead,

436
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:44,866
fifty-six wounded.

437
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:46,900
Two cavalry commands have all had lunch.

438
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:56,666
Tenth lap.

439
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:15,933
Sound the gongs.

440
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:17,766
Call the cavalry back.

441
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:43,860
Withdraw the shields.

442
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,933
Take a gamble?

443
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:08,600
Take a gamble.

444
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,133
All troops, listen!

445
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,266
What are you shouting about?

446
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:14,566
What?

447
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,900
didn't you say "take a gamble"?

448
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,900
I bet a gold knife with you.

449
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,600
This is Marshal Zhang's trap for us.

450
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,866
This defending general has some insight.

451
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:41,866
This time, Marshal Zhang

452
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:45,466
was like dressing up for a blind man.

453
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:48,200
The southern commanders are strict in discipline.

454
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:49,600
The battle,

455
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:51,033
won't be on today.

456
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,333
Infantry retreat first.

457
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:05,100
Cavalry the last.

458
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,733
Withdraw!

459
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,833
Have meal!

460
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:28,966
Marshal,

461
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:33,666
Your son's strategy truly shows the talent of a great general.

462
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,066
His future achievements must be promising.

463
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,766
Wasn't he just huddling from start to finish?

464
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:43,933
We did the same thing on the city walls.

465
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,566
The Minister of Works is right.

466
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:50,666
My humble son does not deserve such high praise.

467
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,730
Eating a cake still can't silence you?

468
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,866
Lord Shuiqiu.

469
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,333
Thank you.

470
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,830
Give me another one.

471
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:18,433
If I hadn't blocked with my shield in time,

472
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,530
he would have been hit by another arrow.

473
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:31,900
Why do you do this?

474
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:38,466
Why?

475
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:40,700
The person is already dead.

476
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,930
What use is there in bowing to him?

477
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,200
Because he should not have died.

478
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:57,666
This world

479
00:36:58,733 --> 00:36:59,933
should not be like this either.

480
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,033
One day you will understand,

481
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:09,866
that in this world you have no choice but to do many things,

482
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:13,300
but that does not mean they are right.

483
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,500
The world is like this.

484
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:18,100
Perhaps there is no other way,

485
00:37:19,266 --> 00:37:21,900
perhaps one is forced by circumstances,

486
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,966
perhaps everyone

487
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,733
has their own reasons.

488
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,466
But there must be right and wrong.

489
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:35,066
No matter what others say

490
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:36,800
or how they think,

491
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,800
one must know in their own heart,

492
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:44,633
that this is wrong.

493
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,500
The world's "wrongs" are also wrongs.

494
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,266
One cannot, because the world is wrong,

495
00:37:58,266 --> 00:38:02,133
then simply conform it and
take those wrongs as something right.

496
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,033
Who's there!

497
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,533
Attack!

498
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,766
Attack!

499
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:39,766
What's wrong?

500
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,566
Someone's sneaking in.

501
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:42,300
Sneak in?

502
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,733
Take this.

503
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,066
Follow me.

504
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,333
Team Bing,

505
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,533
follow me,

506
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,366
throw enemies down!

507
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,866
They must have come around from the west.

508
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:14,630
Otherwise, even if they were on foot,
we should have heard them.

509
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,666
When marching at night, one can't ride horses.

510
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,633
But they must have brought horses.

511
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:22,600
Otherwise, they can't escape if they fail.

512
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:28,333
So they probably led the horses here,

513
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:33,466
and left the horses by the western section
of the moat, with someone guarding them.

514
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:35,600
Then they crossed the frozen river on foot,

515
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:40,730
and climbed the city wall with things
like hooks or sickles attached to ropes.

516
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:44,733
OK.

517
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:49,300
I'll take a cavalry command out,
make a detour from the west and come back,

518
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:50,900
and kill all their horses.

519
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,633
Marshal Zhang has been in army for so many years.

520
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:57,800
Do you think he would just sit idly in his camp,

521
00:39:58,466 --> 00:40:00,933
waiting for you to kill his horses first and then his men?

522
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:02,966
Come here.

523
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:08,366
Believe it or not, as soon as your cavalry rides out,

524
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:10,930
and once they're a mile from the camp,

525
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,466
a thousand cavalrymen will suddenly
appear from the wilderness,

526
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,533
and swallow you,

527
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,933
without spitting out a single bone?

528
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:22,800
Such a large city...

529
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:27,666
Even he manages to send a hundred or so men up
in the night, what's the meaning of that?

530
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:28,400
Furthermore,

531
00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:33,466
deploying an army of over ten thousand men
with barely any torches lit...

532
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:38,000
How can the troops from Ye see in the dark
without falling into chaos?

533
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:47,266
I think Marshal Zhang's arrangement this time
is not to sneak into the city.

534
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:49,900
It's to pry our city gate open.

535
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,200
Right now, we are a thorn in Marshal Zhang's side.

536
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:56,366
If he doesn't pull us out,

537
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:59,966
he can't attack the city without interruptions.

538
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:02,000
Isn't it just a common stockade?

539
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:06,700
Is it worth so much Marshal's energy?

540
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,633
To lure the defending general out of that stockade,

541
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:14,566
you not only dispatched five thousand cavalry
to set an ambush in the south,

542
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,733
but also placed your personal guards
on the city walls as bait.

543
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:23,100
The stakes are indeed high.

544
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,733
However,

545
00:41:25,466 --> 00:41:28,933
the defending general in that stockade is really a turtle,

546
00:41:29,366 --> 00:41:31,500
not even willing to stick his head out.

547
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:38,000
When did such a figure emerge within the capital?

548
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:17,366
Go.

549
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:38,433
If you were Marshal Zhang,

550
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,566
and you set up camp by the Naning River,

551
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,966
where would you place the provisions and supplies?

552
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,633
Of course, the further back, the better.

553
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:52,933
The further back, the safer.

554
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,133
How far back can it be?

555
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,300
♫ Across tens of thousands of miles
strech towering mountains. ♫

556
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,766
