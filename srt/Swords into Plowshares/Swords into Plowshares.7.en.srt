Scouts from Weibo have already arrived the Bian River.

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,333
A strong army pressing upon the city,
the refugees outside are all rushing into the city.

20
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,630
The gatekeeper of Xuanyang Gate has submitted a report,
requesting to close the gates.

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,966
Tens of thousands of commoners are crying for food.

22
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,930
Are you going to shut them outside,
leaving them to be slaughtered by the enemy troops?

23
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,233
This is war.

24
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,533
Military affairs are life-and-death matters to the state.

25
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:58,800
How can we afford such misplaced mercy?

26
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,766
Go to Xuanyang Gate on my behalf and see,

27
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,200
Having long fed on the people's toil, we...

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,500
if this gate,

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,933
should be closed or not.

30
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,700
The city can hold on...

31
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:10,433
Yes.

32
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,500
and the people should not be abandoned.

33
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:16,700
Having received the grace for generations,
we should defend it with life.

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,400
It's getting dark.

35
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:35,766
If we don't close the gates, more people outside
will find it hopeful and gather.

36
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:40,100
If we don't close them now, after two hours,
I'm afraid we would not be able to close it.

37
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,366
You, take out your blade and that can mean closing.
You dare?

38
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:50,600
The most urgent matter now is that if that many refugees suddenly flood in,

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,166
the Kaifeng Prefecture must take action to arrange for them.

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,166

is there anyone still handling affairs?

However, yesterday, the Secretariat issued an order,

45
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,433
[Lü Yin, Judicial Clerk of Kaifeng Prefecture]
appointing you as Judicial Officer of Kaifeng Prefecture.

46
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,800
Now the city is in chaos.

47
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:44,700
Everyone in the office have all fled home
as early as they could.

48
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:51,533
At this time, someone who come here
dressed in official robes must surely be you, Sir.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,466
What is your name and your position?

50
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,366
Your humble official is Lü Yin, from Anci, Youzhou.

51
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:01,633
I currently serve as Judicial Clerk to review
and organize evidence and arguments.

52
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,333
Are there any others on duty in this Prefecture, ?

53
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,933
In reply to Lord Xue,

54
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:13,433
with the chaos and disaster approaching,

55
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:15,000
no one could ensure his own safety.

56
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,333
Who would not be afraid?

57
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,900
Who would not cherish his own life?

58
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,900
Who does not have their family, have elders and children?

59
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,666
So that means there are none,

60
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:28,200
except you.

61
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,066
Mr. Lü, do you have a courtesy name?

62
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,400
Thank you for your inquiry, Lord. My courtesy name is Yuqing.

63
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,000
Yuqing.

64
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,266
The word means abundant blessings.

65
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:45,833
Saying goes that a family always doing good deeds
will get abundant blessings. A good name.

66
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,800
It's a pity you are in such an era.

67
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:51,133
Yuqing.

68
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:56,766
From now on, you will temporarily act as
the Administrative Officer of Kaifeng Prefecture.

69
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:59,233
I'm too young and inexperienced.

70
00:05:59,233 --> 00:05:59,733
I'm afraid...

71
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:05,133
An official is to perform duties.
One who does not is not an official.

72
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,366
In the current Kaifeng Prefecture,

73
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,533
your seniority is the highest below me.

74
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,233
Yes.

75
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,200
Your humble official thanks you.

76
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,933
Eldest Young Master, there are too many people.
We can't keep like this.

77
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:29,100
Once war starts, where else can they go
besides the capital?

78
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,300
They are from the capital region.

79
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Now, the capital,

80
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:34,766
is their home.

81
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,366
But the battle is coming.

82
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,566
Who knows if anyone among them
is a spy of the Yexia army and the Khitans?

83
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:43,800
There must be quite a few.

84
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:47,266
It's not Marshal Zhang's first day being a general.

85
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,433
If that's the case, then hurry up...

86
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:50,766
Then what?

87
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,566
Is the world being in such chaos

88
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:54,466
their fault?

89
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,066
It's better to think about what we can do
instead of hesitating here.

90
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,766
We must do somethign.

91
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,830
Resettling refugees, or resisting the troops, whatever we can.

92
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,600
The imperial guards have been fed for many years
on the taxes and grain of the capital region's people.

93
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,100
We must do something

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
to live with our conscience.

95
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,166
Young Master,

96
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,733
that's easy to say.

97
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,166
Now, even the Emperor and the ministers have no way out.

98
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:25,833
What can we illiterate soldiers possibly do?

99
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,600
Enough.

100
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,666
Don't argue with him.

101
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,300
Tell everyone, ready to go.

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,066
Where to?

103
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:37,766
Set up camp

104
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,866
to defend the outer city.

105
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:41,966
Eldest Young Master...

106
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:45,430
To defend the city, we must first set a camp.
This is common sense.

107
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:54,466
We have no reinforcement outside,
and only a few thousand troops inside.

108
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:59,300
Marshal Zhang has at least twenty thousand troops,
and we're badly outnumbered.

109
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,900
When the main army besiege the city,

110
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:08,133
even if all of us are stationed on this wall over ten miles long,

111
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:09,960
I'm afraid we still won't hold.

112
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,233
The Yexia troops have plenty cavalry,

113
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:19,760
and the Khitans are a people skilled in riding and archery.

114
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,566
I guess they don't even need a direct attack.

115
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:28,233
Just ride around the city walls for a few laps,
and they could exhaust us.

116
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:29,660
Young Master,

117
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,500
I understand your point.

118
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,233
But we only have one

119
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,066
But we only have one command.
[A command usually has a hundred to three thousands soldiers]

120
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:38,566
At most,
[A command usually has a hundred to three thousands soldiers]

121
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,733
there's barely over two hundred.

122
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,400
If the entire Yexia army arrives,
we wouldn't hold on for even half an hour.

123
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,800
how can we possibly camp under the city walls?

124
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:49,066
Losing is a matter of ability.

125
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,733
But not daring to fight is a matter of our spirit.

126
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,533
Young Master,

127
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,966
the ministers haven't decided whether to fight or surrender.

128
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,966
We don't need to be in such a haste.

129
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,530
Young Master,

130
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,533
I'm impressed by what you've just said.

131
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,666
I will go to the Secretariat
to request Lord Feng's written order.

132
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,966
Speed is crucial in warfare and we can't wait for that.

133
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:34,930
Pass my order:

134
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,760
All troops, ready to go!

135
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:37,866
Yes, sir!

136
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,166
Lord,

137
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,800
My son is rash and reckless,

138
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,433
acting on his own.

139
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:15,633
It's my fault failing to discipline him strictly enough.

140
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,933
Please punish me, Lord.

141
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,900
Lord,

142
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:23,100
We are outnumbered.

143
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:27,033
If we don't camp outside the city
to form a pincer attack with the city,

144
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:30,033
then defending the capital is pointless.

145
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,600
Rise.

146
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,533
Thank you, Lord.

147
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:41,800
The key to defending a city,

148
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,900
regarding within, is sufficient food supplies;

149
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:48,266
regarding outside, is reinforcement.

150
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:52,866
Now in capital, where can we find sufficient food supplies?

151
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,033
And the reinforcement?

152
00:10:55,633 --> 00:11:00,000
Among the nobles, generals, and ministers,
who doesn't have a few hundred dans of grain?

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,866
Take soldiers to their house one by one.

154
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:06,000
We can get
over a hundred thousand dans of provision.

155
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Now in the city, there are about
seventeen to eighteen thousand households.

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,160
Estimating at ten jin for each household's daily grain
consumption, the total is no more than two thousand dan.

157
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,933
Economize and it should be enough to last for two months.

158
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,500
What about two months later?

159
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:23,866
Would Lord Liu of Taiyuan lead
his troops southward day and night,

160
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,166
to rescue our capital of the seige within two months ?

161
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:29,366
No need.

162
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,066
We don't need two months.

163
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,333
Not even one month.

164
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,600
For ten days,

165
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:38,066
can we hold on?

166
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,133
Tell me the truth.

167
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:44,500
The capital's troops, including the Imperial Guard

168
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,400
and the Kuan Yi Guards,
[Kuan Yi Guards are high-ranking guards in casual wear.]

169
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,066
is no more than six thousand.
[Kuan Yi Guards are high-ranking guards in casual wear.]

170
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:51,866
But I'm afraid less than half of them
can fight on the battlefield.

171
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,333
Exactly.

172
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,333
They can still be barely useful if stationed on the wall.

173
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:03,366
But if they fight in the battlefield outside,
in the blink of an eye, they will scatter.

174
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,166
if stationed on the city walls,

175
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:07,866
they are usable?

176
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:09,833
Yes they are.

177
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,700
Jungui.

178
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,833
In your opinion,

179
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:21,066
how many troops are needed
to defend the city for ten days?

180
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:24,766
That depends on how many troops Marshal Zhang has,

181
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,800
and on how many palace-tent troops the Khitan have sent.

182
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:32,166
The most important, how much provisions they have.

183
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:36,960
How many people they can find outside the city,

184
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:40,260
decides how much provisions they will have.

185
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
This is the official document
from the Imperial Street Office.

186
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,766
The Imperial Guard killed twenty-six soldiers
to suppress the unrest the day before yesterday.

187
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:55,900
They all belonged to the Fengguo Army.

188
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,700
The highest rank was a minor official.

189
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,660
We need to find the bereaved families
and offer burial fees.

190
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,100
How's the treasury's condition?

191
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,333
The lock was smashed.

192
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,466
I checked and found not a single coin
or a single bolt of silk left.

193
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,666
Let along the rice for official salary.

194
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,100
It's a time when,

195
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,100
everyone is turmoiled.

196
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,466
At this moment,

197
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,133
nobody will still care about the laws and regulations.

198
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,500
The laws and regulations
become meaningless.

199
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,433
Having no provisions and salaries,
no one is willing to do their jobs.

200
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:32,566
In such a condition,

201
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,166
we can really do nothing.

202
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,633
Even if the sky falls,

203
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,933
the job must still be done.

204
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,866
Your orders, Lord?

205
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:47,800
The first thing to do,

206
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:49,366
is to borrow money.

207
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:55,900
Quick!

208
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:56,700
Hurry up!

209
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:29,630
Young Master,

210
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,633
With only two hundred soldiers here,

211
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:37,460
I'm afraid when Marshal Zhang's troops arrive tomorrow noon,
we won't even hold on for half an hour

212
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,360
Will there be reinforcements?

213
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,800
Tell everyone to cheer up.

214
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,500
Everyone in the world is watching us.

215
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,400
Right now,

216
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,800
we are the thorn in Marshal Zhang's side.

217
00:14:56,766 --> 00:15:01,166
We must show him
the courage and spirit of us Imperial Guards.

218
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,200
Set up camp outside the city, close to the walls.

219
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,600
Yes

220
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,033
Not a big troop.

221
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,733
Seems less than a thousand solders.

222
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,600
Who is their commander?

223
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,400
There are scouts cavalry about
two or three hundred paces outside walls.

224
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,660
We did not dare to approach.

225
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:26,800
It's a surprise that in this city

226
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,630
there's still someone daring lead troops to resist.

227
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,266
Wasn't it said that the fatuous emperor tried
to burn himself a few days ago?

228
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,366
I heard Lord Feng has returned to the court.

229
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:39,400
Not sure if it's true.

230
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:41,900
It's best that he has returned to the capital.

231
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,333
So that we could also save some effort.

232
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,066
With him in charge,

233
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:55,666
things in the capital shall be settled by decrees.

234
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Lord.

235
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,366
The Northern army,

236
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,466
has arrived at Yedu.

237
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:08,200
Our Marshal, following the sovereign's command,
leads troops southwards to your capital

238
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,733
to denounce your ruler and his subjects.

239
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:13,400
It's time for change.

240
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:14,900
Lord,

241
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:16,833
as the Prime Minister,

242
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,666
you must understand the situation.

243
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:23,966
The fatuous Shi Chonggui should
renounce his imperial title and await punishment.

244
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:27,200
[Zhang Yanze's lobbyist]
the Marshal's army should be welcomed to enter the city,

245
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,900
to pacify the common people.

246
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,566
Bring it here.

247
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,600
Bring it.

248
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:36,900
Bring what?

249
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,700
The official decree.

250
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,930
The imperial edict.

251
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,833
Do you have that?

252
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,266
Although I do not possess one,

253
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:46,600
every word of mine is the absolute truth, Lord.

254
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,766
Since you do not have one, get out.

255
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:51,633
Send him to the Kaifeng Prefecture, to be charged with fraud.

256
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:53,633
Yes.

257
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:54,666
Guards,

258
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,966
take him out.

259
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,366
Lord,

260
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,500
Lord, please reconsider! Lord!

261
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,833
Lord!

262
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,200
Fan Zhi.

263
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:07,900
I'm here.

264
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,666
Draft a order.

265
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,500
Summon all officials of the third rank and above
in the capital and foreign envoys.

266
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:18,633
Two hours from now, we will have a meeting
at the Jianxian Jiangwu Hall.

267
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:19,366
Understood.

268
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,000
Khitan is a big state with over a million armored troops .

269
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:27,466
Lord Du's forces in Yexia also
have two hundred thousand fierce warriors.

270
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:32,300
Capturing the capital is as easy as turning over one's hand.

271
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:37,260
Envoy, the Minister of Works, you have come
by the orders of the King of Wuyue.

272
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,700
Presumably, you have your own plans for the situation.

273
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:42,333
Now that the empire is about to collapse,

274
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,200
the Shi's fortune of over a decade is coming to its end.

275
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,766
[Zhang Yanze's lobbyist]
You gentlemen from Wuyue

276
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:47,900
[Zhang Yanze's lobbyist]
must know the trend.

277
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:52,966
Marshal Zhang now commands an army of
a hundred thousand, sieging the capital.

278
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,233
When the city falls,

279
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,266
I'm afraid no one will be safe.

280
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:04,033
Sir, are you come here to persuade Wuyue
to abandon the court and serve the Khitan?

281
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:08,633
The Khitan sovereign is a supreme sage.

282
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,833
Do you think he is to be seen at will?

283
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:16,100
Without a recommendation from
a high-ranking minister, I'm afraid you

284
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,366
can't even approach his camp.

285
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:25,560
Envoy, someone from Kaifeng Prefecture has arrived.

286
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,766
Wuyue has always served the court
respectfully with plenty tribute.

287
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:36,833
The silver, silk, pearls, and jade you've brought in this journey

288
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,433
must be considerable.

289
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Though the state is now in chaos, and the situation is urgent,

290
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,400
I'm afraid it will be difficult for you gentlemen
to make the haste decide to sever someone else.

291
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:51,700
Lord Du of Yexia does not seem
to have a temperament of emperor.

292
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,233
The Khitan ruler dominates the north is powerful,

293
00:18:56,133 --> 00:19:00,033
but whether he can enter and
rule the Central Plains is questionable.

294
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:05,566
Marshal Zhang is no more than a muddle-headed, greedy,
and despicable mediocrity, not worthy of discussion.

295
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:09,766
The tribute you have brought may not find
a recipient for the time being.

296
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,666
Then,

297
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,100
why not contribute some of them
to the common people of the capital?

298
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,300
Since we can't find a ruler of the Central Plains now,

299
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,433
serving the people of it is also the right thing to do.

300
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,566
Who are you scoundrel?
How dare you be so disrespectful!

301
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,900
Please don't be angry, sir.

302
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,033
Don't be angry.

303
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:33,866
Neither Lord Du nor the Khitan ruler
is worthy of our allegiance.

304
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,800
Then, in your view,
who is the best ruler now?

305
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,500
Sir, what do you mean by that?

306
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:42,900
The current Emperor is seated within the Zide Hall.

307
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:46,400
There has been no decree of abdication.

308
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,566
How could there be another best ruler?

309
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,700
How much do you want?

310
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,233
Depends entirely on your will.

311
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:59,566
One hundred thousand people of the capital need food.

312
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,866
For the wealthy, a million would not be too much.

313
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,166
For the poor, even a tiny contribution would not be too little.

314
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,433
In that case,

315
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,566
help me with one thing,

316
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:14,500
and I will lend one hundred thousand units
of silver-silk to Kaifeng Prefecture.

317
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:19,100
However, a written agreement must be signed
regarding offsetting tribute.

318
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,300
What's your opinion?

319
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,800
Can you make the decision?

320
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,866
I am the Judicial Officer of Kaifeng Prefecture.

321
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:30,700
How could I not be able to decide such small things?

322
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,600
You are truly generous.

323
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,000
Yet Marshal Zhang's sincere words are neglected.

324
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,033
You would rather throw one hundred thousand units
of silver-silk away than use it to reward the troops.

325
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,900
What I have just asked you to help me with is,

326
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:50,200
to take this thief who stole my teacup to the prefecture,
and punish him according to the law.

327
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,233
Slander! Who's steeling your teacup?

328
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:53,266
Caught red-handed!

329
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,300
Then please order your men to tie this person.

330
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,233
I will drag him back.

331
00:20:59,066 --> 00:20:59,600
Guards!

332
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:13,766
Did I lend them too much?

333
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,800
It's done, so what's the point
in talking about "too much"?

334
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:19,166
So I shouldn't have lent?

335
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:21,533
What do you mean by "should"?

336
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:29,566
I don't know if he is a swindler.
He might be making empty promises.

337
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:34,366
We will deliver the silk directly to Kaifeng Prefecture.

338
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:36,100
Let him take that prisoner.

339
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,433
How could this be a scam?

340
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:41,300
But I still feel this matter is somewhat absurd.

341
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:44,466
You were quite decisive when lending just now,.

342
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:46,530
You indeed have done something absurd.

343
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:52,800
But since it's already done, it's even more absurd
to start wavering now.

344
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:56,366
I just find his words extremely reasonable.

345
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,433
Regardless of whether Sixth Brother and Wuyue
will continue to serve the current court,

346
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:06,566
within the capital, there are hundreds of thousands of
innocent people suffering.

347
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,760
As long as we can do something,
we shouldn't just stand by watching.

348
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,066
Those abandoned by the Emperor

349
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,930
must be taken over by whoever.

350
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,100
Envoy, Minister,

351
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,266
The Secretariat has sent a message saying Lord Feng

352
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:36,933
has summoned officials of the third rank and above, as well as
foreign envoys, to meet at the Jianxian Hall in an hour.

353
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:37,466
Lord,

354
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,666
the Emperor has abandoned the world.

355
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:44,600
Lord Du is welcoming the Khitan army southwards,
just like the late Emperor did.

356
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:46,833
They cannot be stopped.

357
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,900
Young Minister Feng,

358
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,266
What do you mean by ”just like the late Emperor did“?

359
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,700
The late Emperor abandoned You and Ji Region.

360
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,900
Then Du is to abandon what, the Two River Regions?

361
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,600
Inner Academician, why pretend to be so ignorant?

362
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,433
Khitan has already reached Yexia,
taking over the Hebei Region.

363
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:09,233
How can you still say 'abandoning'?

364
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,100
Yexia has fallen,

365
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
but Jinyang has not.

366
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,000
Lord Du has surrendered,

367
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:17,200
but Lord Liu will absolutely not.

368
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:22,300
Hedong's million soldiers and civilians
swear to fight to the death.

369
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,033
Sounds really noble.

370
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,833
Hebei has been occupied for months.

371
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:31,766
Holding his troops in Jinyang, Hedong, why haven't his armies
marched out to resist the enemy?

372
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:33,033
And who are you anyway?

373
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:34,333
Your position?

374
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,966
Are you qualified for interrupting us
discussing military affairs?

375
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:53,100
I'm Guo Rong, Clerk of the Hedong Cavalry and Infantry.

376
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:02,200
On behalf of Lord Liu, I present our case
to you esteemed gentlemen.

377
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,866
Du Zhongwei has betrayed.

378
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:06,600
Zhang Yanze runs rampant.

379
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,833
The Khitan are advancing.

380
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:11,930
Yet you, in power, are not
caring for people and resisting the enemy.

381
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,133
Instead you are thinking of
bowing and kneeling to the traitor.

382
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,300
How ridiculous!

383
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,100
So that's how it is.

384
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,733
Even Liu Zhiyuan is wavering.

385
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:27,266
I wonder when Lord Liu will
lead his troops here for political affairs.

386
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,433
So you mean,

387
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,533
Lord Liu should do as what Lord Du did.

388
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:34,866
He should abandon the residents,

389
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,533
surrender the land to the Khitan,

390
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,666
and lead troops to the capital to initiate a reform?

391
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,100
Hebei is the frontline.

392
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:47,700
Is Hedong not also the front line?

393
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:48,933
Hedong

394
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,700
cannot be abandoned.

395
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,966
It is the court's

396
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:55,933
last hope.

397
00:24:56,966 --> 00:25:00,000
I summoned you here not originally to discuss this.

398
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,933
Zhang Yanze's troops

399
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,233
are right at our doorstep.

400
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,066
Whoever,

401
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:08,733
of you,

402
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,766
wishes to surrender,

403
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:14,466
may go out of the city to surrender shortly after.

404
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:17,800
Right now, there is an urgent matter

405
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:20,800
that must be entrusted to you.

406
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:27,033
Lord, what urgent matter are you referring to?

407
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:28,433
Grain.

408
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,033
Troops.

409
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:34,660
The Three Departments charge provisions
and West Court charges troops.

410
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,466
What can we do about them?

411
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:38,900
The emperor lost all troops in war, and now,

412
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:41,666
he asked us for troops and provisions.

413
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,300
That's it.

414
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,666
Jungui.

415
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:48,566
Lord,

416
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:55,333
according to regulations, Ministers and above
each has fifty guards.

417
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:57,666
Chief Ministers have one hundred.

418
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:04,366
Military governors, their armies and bureau each has their own
guards and officers with varying quotas.

419
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:07,866
Put all these people into the army,
we'll have five thousand soldiers.

420
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:15,866
As for provisions, the high officials and ministers each
holds at least sixty shi of grain in their private granaries.

421
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:17,566
At most five hundred shi.

422
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:24,566
Put all into the provisions, it could at least supply
the capital's soldiers and civilians for over two months.

423
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:25,966
It's not peacetime.

424
00:26:25,966 --> 00:26:27,466
No one has a easy life.

425
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:29,366
Are you forcing us to donate them?

426
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:34,100
Gentlemen, in this national crisis,

427
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:38,633
it's high time we keep our loyalty and integrity.

428
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:08,233
Are we really going to take action?

429
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:08,900
Otherwise?

430
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,000
In the hall,

431
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,800
they are either high-rank officials or nobles.

432
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,633
In peacetime, we can offended none.

433
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,800
But they are merely fifty to seventy jin of flesh
stripped of their bones.

434
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,033
Not enough for a single meal of the rebels
if thrown into the camp outside the city.

435
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:46,100
Mr. Sang.

436
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,466
I don't have soldiers.

437
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:54,566
The guards have also been withdrawn since I was dismissed,
only some servants remaining.

438
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:59,466
I have three hundred and eighty dan of stored grain
and twelve thousand strings of coins and silk.

439
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:01,700
I will give them all to you, Lord.

440
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:06,766
Lord Feng.

441
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,930
Esteemed envoys.

442
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,000
Though our two states have been enemies,

443
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,766
I will have to ask for your help
at this critical moment of survival.

444
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:26,600
The Imperial Guards will requisition the five hundred soldiers
of entire Southern Tang envoy delegation.

445
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:27,966
Lord Feng.

446
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,000
Lord Feng.

447
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,200
The Wuyue envoy delegation has two commands,
plus one naval battalion from Huanglong Island.

448
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,133
There are over six hundred and twelve soldiers in total.

449
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,500
They will help you in the war, Lord,

450
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:50,600
to defend the capital.

451
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:57,200
We came from afar originally to pay tribute,
so we do not have much provisions.

452
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,900
That two hundred thousand bolts of silk
originally to congratulate the court for the New Year

453
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,000
will be be donated to you to supply the army tomorrow, Lord.

454
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,966
Esteemed envoy.

455
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:10,433
You are thoughtful.

456
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,500
But still I need to request you one thing, Lord.

457
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:19,333
Just say it.

458
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,566
Wuyue soldiers are vassals of the imperial court.

459
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:29,133
It is our duty to fight bravely to the death
on the front lines to defend the capital.

460
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:31,533
But if the court,

461
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,033
treats us as outsiders and
scatters them into different units,

462
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,800
causing them to die in vain,

463
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,233
then I,

464
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,233
Will not comply.

465
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:47,200
Wuyue troops can only be used to defend the city.

466
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,333
They can't fight outside the city.

467
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:55,500
Agreed.

468
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,000
The Wuyue army shall be commanded by me in person.

469
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:02,333
All generals shall be appointed by me
and the Minister of Works,

470
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:07,300
and other soldiers shall not receive orders or
be considered as disobey orders on the battlefield.

471
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:08,533
Agreed.

472
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:09,966
Anything else?

473
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,100
Nothing else.

474
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,166
We will respectfully obey your command.

475
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:15,466
Lord.

476
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,033
Thus, we Tang...

477
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,266
You are different.

478
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:23,500
From this moment onward, all members
of the Southern Tang envoy delegation,

479
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,233
from you, Xu Dingchen, downwards, must all obey orders.

480
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:30,766
Those who disobey will be executed.

481
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:41,000
[Beiguo, Bianliang.]

482
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:45,500
There will be at least two more hours
before so many people all enter the city.

483
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,266
The total number must be around twenty thousand.

484
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,766
Thirty-three thousand and eight hundred.

485
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,100
You've been counting?

486
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,433
Up until you spoke just now,

487
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:58,433
nearly thirty-three thousand eight hundred have entered.

488
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:03,266
I didn't count in the several thousand who entered earlier,
and those outside who haven't entered yet.

489
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:06,533
I reckon the total number must be around fifty thousand.

490
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,330
Fifty thousand people?

491
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:14,300
How can the city provide enough space
for extra fifty thousand people?

492
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:16,466
Indeed.

493
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:19,166
Ziping.

494
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,133
Yes.

495
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:23,300
How is Kaifeng Prefecture?

496
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,566
We borrowed a sum from the Wuyue envoy delegation.

497
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:31,466
Ninth and eighth-rank clerks, city patrols,
and attendants are on duty.

498
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,430
We recruited about a hundred people,
barely enough for affairs.

499
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:37,733
Zhao Hongyin.

500
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,566
I'm here.

501
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
How is the city defense?

502
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:44,066
Reporting to the Lord,

503
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:47,866
I have strictly ordered soldiers
to inspect the city defenses,

504
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:50,133
and repair the damages immediately.

505
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,566
Detailed assignments have been deployed.

506
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:57,133
Let Zhao Hongyin take command of the capital's defense.

507
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:01,133
All troops within the city are to follow his orders.

508
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:02,433
Yes.

509
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,066
Yao Yuanfu.

510
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:07,366
Here.

511
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:13,400
The total number of guards, troops, and retainers
assembled from various prefectures and military districts

512
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,133
are about four to five thousand.

513
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:20,133
You are to take charge of reorganizing and
integrating them all excluding the Wuyue troops.

514
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:26,566
Weed out the old and weak, and select three thousand
young and strong men to serve as the city's reserve forces.

515
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:28,566
Understood.

516
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,000
Within the capital city,

517
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,666
military supplies and provisions,
medical care for the wounded,

518
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:43,200
trading, and stable housing,
all fall under the jurisdiction of Kaifeng Prefecture.

519
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,866
From this moment,

520
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,600
Sang Guoqiao is reinstated as the Prefect of Kaifeng,

521
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,100
and Ziping shall serve as his deputy.

522
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,333
I entrust the order of the capital to you two.

523
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,666
Reporting,

524
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,966
since noon yesterday,

525
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:07,233
forty thousand refugees
have entered the city from Xuanyang Gate.

526
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,866
We don't know how many will come later.

527
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:15,533
Setting aside the matter of their food,
where to settle them is a major issue.

528
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:20,200
Currently, Maqian Street and the surrounding streets
are completely blocked.

529
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,900
The available places in the capital city is not likely
to hold even one-tenth of them.

530
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,333
Lord Xue,

531
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,266
among these refugees, how many
are the old, the weak, women, and children?

532
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:33,066
How many are healthy male adult?

533
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,160
the latter takes slightly more than forty percent.

534
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,000
Lord,

535
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:44,233
we can gather and organize these healthy male refugees.

536
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,500
They are not fit for front lines,

537
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,633
However, they can be used as labors to
build walls, transport supplies and cook meals.

538
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,666
I will entrusted this to you.

539
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:03,500
As long as the refugees can be pacified and prevented
from causing trouble. Their life are entirely at your disposal.

540
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:05,733
Understood.

541
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:07,733
One more thing,

542
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,333
I humbly request a contingent of soldiers.

543
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,400
I don't need many, just enough to maintain order.

544
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,200
The troops of Wuyue will not be on the city walls for now.

545
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,066
You can use them.

546
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:23,400
Thank you, Lord.

547
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:33,733
So the healthy male settled,
how about the elderly, children, and women?

548
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:35,966
Ask him.

549
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,633
Lord Xue, rest assured.

550
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:43,366
Within the capital, there must be places for them.

551
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:50,100
If we cannot give them homes, how
can we give them sense of secure?

552
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,600
Gentlemen,

553
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Zhang Yanze is about to attack the city.

554
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,900
Prepare for battle.

555
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,866
Let us leave

556
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:06,733
this empire

557
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,333
with a final shred of dignity.

558
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:13,100
Understood.

559
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,266
Come here, all of you!

560
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:17,166
All come here!

561
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,066
All of you!

562
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,633
Listen.

563
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,966
I am the Judge of Kaifeng Prefecture,
a subordinate of Lord Xue.

564
00:35:26,966 --> 00:35:28,266
Anyone who is tired,

565
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:28,800
hungry,

566
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,300
want a place to rest,

567
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:32,766
have a hot meal,

568
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,033
or some hot soup,

569
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,566
follow me.

570
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:37,766
Assemble at the Mingde Gate.

571
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,533
Do not trample or injure anyone.

572
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:44,966
Qian's Young.

573
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:45,466
Here.

574
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:46,733
After me, with a troop.

575
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:47,200
Yes.

576
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:52,800
You, take the left team and
follow the Minister of Works.

577
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,633
You must ensure his safety.

578
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:55,900
Left team, turn around!

579
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:59,266
Those wanting food and soup, follow me!

580
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,333
Get up, get up!

581
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:01,500
Yang Guangyi,

582
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:02,866
Liu Qingyi,

583
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,266
Liu Tingrang,

584
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:05,566
Liu Shouzhong,

585
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,766
Wang Zhengzhong,

586
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,133
Wang Shenqi,

587
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:09,366
Li Jixun,

588
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,800
Han Chongyun.

589
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,700
You eight generals, listen!

590
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,733
Yes!

591
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,733
You eight generals with eight commanders.

592
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,933
Each reinforce with one additional squad
and depart the city immediately.

593
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:24,266
Join forces with the Eldest Young Master.

594
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:28,100
All of your actions shall follow his command.

595
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,833
Order received!

596
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,900
The Emperor has issued a decree.

597
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,500
You all, are good families from the capital region,

598
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,133
forced to abandon your homes and seek refuge
due to the calamity of war.

599
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,566
Now that you are here,
you are the capital residents.

600
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:46,066
You must obey its laws.

601
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,600
Now, in this great crisis, I, your emperor, and you,

602
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:54,666
shall share both sweetness and bitterness
to go over hardship together.

603
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:55,566
My dwellings

604
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:58,066
are your dwellings.

605
00:36:58,833 --> 00:36:59,866
My food

606
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:02,133
is your food.

607
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:04,166
My enemies

608
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:06,433
are also your enemies.

609
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,000
Now, healthy male shall be selected
for service at the front.

610
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,100
The elderly, weak, women, and children
may reside within the Imperial City,

611
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,200
so that you need not worry about hunger,

612
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,566
nor suffer from cold.

613
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,300
This is my thoughtful intention.

614
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,900
You all

615
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,533
shall understand it.

616
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
You all understand?

617
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:41,566
Listen.

618
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:43,666
From this moment onward,

619
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:48,600
women, the elderly, and children
may all take residence in the Imperial City.

620
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:55,266
Meals, and lodging will all be arranged
by specially appointed officials.

621
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,933
Men taller than four chi, with hair and beard not yet white,

622
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,400
may not reside in the Imperial City.

623
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,533
They must obey the orders of
the Kaifeng Prefecture attendants,

624
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:11,400
be registered and conscripted
to aid in defending the capital.

625
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,566
Think carefully.

626
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:20,033
Since you have entered the capital,
the safety of the capital is your safety.

627
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,600
If the capital survives,

628
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,466
you survive.

629
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,433
If the capital falls,

630
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:27,500
you too shall perish.

631
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:29,566
The Emperor says,

632
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:35,133
"I shall provide for your parents, wives, and children."

633
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,366
Line up! Line up!

634
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:46,933
I want more.

635
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:47,833
Line up, you all!

636
00:38:50,766 --> 00:38:51,466
Let me first!

637
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,000
No scramble!

638
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:21,933
Listen to orders!

639
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:23,366
Follow the rules!

640
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:26,333
As long as the work is done,
everyone will have porridge.

641
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:31,300
Those who disobey orders and
break the rules shall be like him.

642
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,900
He was just starving and wanted some hot porridge.

643
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,400
Which royal law did he break?

644
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:44,300
Minister, what brings you here?

645
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:45,500
I am asking you.

646
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,066
He was hungry,

647
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:48,233
and wanted a mean.

648
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,566
Which royal law did he break?

649
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,166
Then, Minister, pick up your sword

650
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:10,933
and avenge him.

651
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:16,766
Yes?

652
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:19,733
You don't dare?

653
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:32,666
What are you looking at?

654
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,700
Go back lining up and add more firewood.

655
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,133
Battle approaching,

656
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:48,530
matters are piling up.

657
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:52,333
You don't have to help,
but please don't cause me trouble.

658
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,133
Minister,

659
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:58,133
take your royal law.

660
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:17,466
These on the table were originally just rough paper
for children to practice calligraphy.

661
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:19,300
But now,

662
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:24,566
They bear the seals of the Minister and I.

663
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:30,500
That represents One hundred qing of paddy fields
at the foot of Phoenix Mountain in Hangzhou.

664
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:33,600
The Minister and I

665
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,900
Issue this reward on behalf of the King.

666
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,333
All you soldiers,

667
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:43,800
and those behind me from Huanglong Island,

668
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,666
Listen.

669
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,900
for each arrow hits you, you are granted one mu of land.

670
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,766
For each sword wound on you, you are granted two.

671
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:01,966
For each spear wound on you, you are granted three.

672
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,966
For severe injuries leading to disability,
you are granted five.

673
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:09,300
For those who fall in battle,

674
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,333
their families will receive ten,

675
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,500
which will be a permanent possition,

676
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
tax exempted.

677
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:19,500
So much for pleasant words.

678
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:22,830
What follows are the unpleasant ones.

679
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,533
You are all seasoned military men.

680
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:29,866
So you understand the army's rules.

681
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:32,966
But I still need to reiterate them.

682
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:34,066
Those who dare to

683
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:39,166
miss opportunities in battle, disobey orders,

684
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,966
speak recklessly, retreat without authorization, or desert

685
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:48,200
will be executed immediately.

686
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,330
Their relatives in the country:

687
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:56,066
men will become government slaves, women, public courtesans,

688
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:59,630
not pardoned for three generations.
