Soldiers,

52
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,200
have some wine.

53
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:44,566
It will warm yourselves and boost your courage.

00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:11,900
Yes please.

Reporting to Father Marshal, I have led the
eighteen commands out from behind the camp eastward,

57

circled around Yishan Mountain, marched
along the Nanqing River, turned westward,

58
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,000
and burned down the Zhang's southern camp where he stored grain.

You scoundrel!

64
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:27,666
Foolish boy, the essence of
military strategy lies first in prudence.

65
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:29,500
Yet you,

66
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:33,800
are always taking reckless gambles with lives.

67
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,066
It would be one thing if you got trapped,

68
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,400
but it cost cavalry forces and will thus damage defense plan.

69
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,466
What do you think you are doing?

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,833

00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,866

drink your wine with nothing in return.

106
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,166
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

107
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,466
It suddenly occurred to me that today,

108
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,800
is the eve of the Little New Year.

109
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:48,766
Ten years ago on Little New Year's Eve,
my father king asked me about my life's ambition.

110
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,200
I was so mischievous back then.

111
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,866
In front of all my elder brothers, I said that I want to go to sea.

112
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:59,400
I want to see what the Kun and Peng
in fairy tales really look like.

113
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,300
All fathers are the same.

114
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,533
Happy as they are deep inside,

115
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,533
their words sounds as if to kill you.

116
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,766
On Little New Year's Eve when I was ten,

117
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:18,366
my father asked me,
"what do you want to do when you grow up?"

118
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:18,966
I said,

119
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:26,600
"My ambition is to face the enemy and smash them,
making marvelous military achievements. "

120
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,100
That very night, I got a beating.

121
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:35,833
And you?

122
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,600
What's your ambition?

123
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,366
Come on, we are asking you.

124
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:45,600
I have none.

125
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:47,733
How boring.

126
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,900
If I'd known you were so bashful,
I wouldn't have saved you that day.

127
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,633
Born in such a world, It seems that, whatever ambition,

128
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,100
is not correct.

129
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,300
I remember last year's Little New Year's Eve,

130
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,333
I happened to be in Jinyang.

131
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,333
At that time, my father was in low spirits.

132
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:18,833
My siblings were all too young, so I go to my father
on behalf of them. I asked my father,

133
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,500
"It's the convention to ask about
next year's goal on New Year's Eve.

134
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,033
Father have always been frugal,
and quite prestigious in the army,

135
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:32,500
yet you have never been appointed as a military governor.

136
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,266
Is there regret in your heart, father?"

137
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,600
What did Marshal Guo say?

138
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,600
He said,

139
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,800
"High titles and generous salaries are not worth discussing.

140
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,133
If I could just

141
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,733
drink a cup of warm wine in a peaceful year in my life,

142
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,800
then I would feel fulfilled."

143
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,066
How beautiful.

144
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,800
Even the most glorious prosperous age,

145
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,466
will eventually see its sunset.

146
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:58,200
Even the most unbearable chaotic era

147
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:01,766
will eventually usher in a sunrise.

148
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,633
Hold on, hold on. Just one moment more.

149
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:55,966
OK it's done.

150
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,733
It's the tenth day.

151
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,333
I'm afraid, no one in the city,

152
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:34,533
will survive this winter.

153
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:40,700
The bitterly cold weather and the frozen ground
do make defending difficult,

154
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,766
but it will be even harder for the bandits attacking the city.

155
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,600
That's not exactly the condition.

156
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,433
City walls can be relied upon,

157
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,433
but people cannot.

158
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,733
In the first few days,

159
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,933
people are in high tension with a surge of righteousness and
passion, as well as promises of high titles and good salaries.

160
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:04,966
But now,

161
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,366
ten days have passed.

162
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,433
It's human nature to be afraid
of hardship and change their minds.

163
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,833
Moreover the cold weather ins unbearable.

164
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,566
Besides, the enemy is not just a single army.

165
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,566
Du Zhongwei have another fifty thousand troops in Yexia,

166
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,333
not to mention the Khitan behind him.

167
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:30,600
Instead on the imperial court's side,

168
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,800
they claim to be the legitimate regime with an emperor,

169
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,566
who exists as if he didn't.

170
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,566
In the court,

171
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,766
there's only Lord Feng, one old man left,

172
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:49,066
struggling to keep things in order.

173
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,300
Outside the capital,

174
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,600
who else still cares about this court?

175
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:56,633
Who still cares,

176
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,700
about those hundreds of thousands of common people?

177
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,700
There's neither troops outside as reinforcement,

178
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,100
nor virtuous men inside to protect this city.

179
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:11,800
It's hopeless.

180
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,566
Having defended for ten days,

181
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:44,900
I wonder if the ministers

182
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,566
have come up with any plans.

183
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,466
Peace negotiations is not acceptable.

184
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,500
We must hold firm.

185
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,900
We will definitely defend the city
to the death, right? We must!

186
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:03,700
Seeking peace is...

187
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:05,600
Lord,

188
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,433
that...

189
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:10,300
We will defend!

190
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:11,800
Lord.

191
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:15,833
Lord.

192
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:18,900
Here.

193
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,100
Absurd!

194
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:22,733
You petraitors!

195
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:23,566
Nonsense!

196
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,633
Fan Zhi.

197
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:01,266
Lord.

198
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,333
Open the Qianyuan Hall.

199
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:11,700
Court is in session.

200
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
It seems the battle

201
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,233
won't be on today.

202
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,866
Let's return and report to Lord Feng.

203
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
What did you say?

204
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:25,900
Muster the troops.

205
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,166
Withdraw to the city.

206
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:30,633
Withdraw?

207
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,500
What about the city?

208
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,600
Are we not defending it?

209
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,133
The order Lord issued that day

210
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:40,966
was to defend the city for ten days.

211
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,400
Now the ten days has passed.

212
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,100
Jungui.

213
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,700
Are you joking?

214
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:55,966
Kuangyin.

215
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,333
Let's withdraw.

216
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,566
Tale our soldiers back into the city.

217
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:08,766
before Zhang Yanze's army is mobilized.

218
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,900
Having fought for over ten days,

219
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:22,800
those who died, those who live, are all our heroes.

220
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,033
Now,

221
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,600
what you can do have all been done.

222
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,400
The remaining ones

223
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
should not die in vain.

224
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:48,766
Die in vain?

225
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,800
On the day we start defending,

226
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:56,166
Father Marshal gave me eighteen commands,

227
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,266
fully staffed ones,

228
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:03,900
with two thousand, two hundred and twenty-one men.

229
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,700
Now,

230
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,633
now only over eight hundred remain.

231
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,100
And now you tell me

232
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,766
they should not die in vain?

233
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:22,100
You, you, Jungui,

234
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,666
you, are truly shameless.

235
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:27,866
There will be no reinforcements.

236
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:32,833
I know.

237
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:35,733
Things won't change,

238
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,433
even if we keep defending.

239
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:44,700
I know.

240
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:47,433
Without Father Marshal's command,

241
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:49,100
here,

242
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,200
shall be our graveyard.

243
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,800
Marshal's order, the entire army, withdraw into the city!

244
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,566
Marshal's order, the entire army, withdraw into the city!

245
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:01,166
Marshal's order, the entire army, withdraw into the city!

246
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,766
Marshal's order, the entire army, withdraw into the city!

247
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:05,766
Young Master.

248
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,533
So we are returning like this?

249
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:08,166
So shameful.

250
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:09,600
We can no longer hold on.

251
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:12,300
Withdraw? It would have been better
if I hadn't sent here.

252
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,933
Enough.

253
00:22:55,766 --> 00:23:01,033
Whereas, in January, the tenth year
of the Khitan Huitong period,

254
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:04,233
the Great Khitan Emperor decrees:

255
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:08,100
Khitan Emperor has been supporting
emperors and kings in south and north,

256
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,900
to govern their domains, and issue orders.

257
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:14,533
You, the Shi clan, were originally the Marquis of Jin,

258
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:18,200
with less than one-tenth fields, and less a brigade of soldiers,

259
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,166
as if trapped in a vase struggling.

260
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
You presumptuously claimed the imperial authority.

261
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,000
You are unable in managing court discipline and political
affairs, causing turmoil and wars throughout the land.

262
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,866
People are starved to death everywhere,
which is shocking and grievous.

263
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:38,066
Filled with pity and unease for
the suffering of the common people,

264
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,666
I wishing to relieve the dire straits,

265
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:45,600
People to our south are suffering from hunger and cold,
so I raised an army to console them,

266
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,466
and I went to Ye and Bian in person,

267
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,966
hoping to restore the order and
save these people from sufferings.

268
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,733
Now, you young ruler, is absurd and fatuous.

269
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,600
You arbitrarily ascend to the throne and neglect
laws and rituals, plunging the people into misery.

270
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:09,933
You have now lost the right
to abdicate and move out of the palace yourself.

271
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:14,133
You are demoted to Marquis of Betrayal,
to await the judgment of your crimes.

272
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:20,300
Censor-in-Chief, Yelü Xieli is to be appointed
Commissioner of Han Affairs in the Eastern Capital.

273
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,433
Military Governor of Zhangyi, and
the Right Martial Guard General, Zhang Yanze,

274
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:28,666
will act as the provisional governor of the Eastern Capital,

275
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,933
All military and state affairs shall be entrusted to him.

276
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:37,800
The officials and soldiers of Bianzhou, must
obey their commands and strictly follow their orders.

277
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:44,200
Should there be anyone who commit crimes or defy their
superiors, I would applying all punishments to him.

278
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,200
So be it.

279
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,566
Listen to the orders and do not disappoint me.

280
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:17,500
So everything's over?

281
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,366
This is already the best outcome.

282
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:23,600
I don't understand!

283
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,700
There's no reinforcements.

284
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,233
The capital,

285
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:30,900
is doomed to fall.

286
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:35,866
If that's the case, what
was the point defending for ten days？

287
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:37,300
For the sake of dignity.

288
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,366
So many people died,

289
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:44,033
just for that so-called dignity?

290
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:45,766
Was it worth it?

291
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:51,933
Lord Du surrendering to the enemy,
and Zhang attacking the capital,

292
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:55,100
all for nothing more than placing a bet
that when Khitan Emperor,

293
00:25:55,333 --> 00:26:00,633
they might seize the throne, and rule the world,
just as the late Emperor did.

294
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:02,966
As the late Emperor?

295
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:05,100
To be another son emperor?

296
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:08,733
If the Khitan Emperor is willing to acknowledge a son,

297
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,333
Lord Du and Zhang Yanze would
scramble to acknowledge this father.

298
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:14,700
They are traitors!

299
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:16,800
Never to be reconciled with!

300
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:20,600
What corrupted hearts,
devoid of loyalty and righteousness.

301
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:30,433
In the face of victory or defeat, most people in this world
would abandon righteousness for victory.

302
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:35,066
People, state, loyalty, integrity, righteousness—

303
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,066
aren't those the most priceless things?

304
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,266
In this world,

305
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:42,066
there certainly exist truly priceless things.

306
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:43,700
However,

307
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
in the court of the imperial palace,

308
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,600
everything inevitably has a price.

309
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,866
Things that cannot be valued by price

310
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
simply do not appear here.

311
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:57,500
In the court, if you do not calculate values,

312
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,833
you will not be entitled to stand here.

313
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,600
Lord, Minister,

314
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,833
are you here to see, who in the world today

315
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:12,000
is still willing to bet on a court that is doomed?

316
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:15,633
Khitan is powerful, the central empire is declining.

317
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,966
In the eyes of most people,
the outcome is already clear.

318
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,800
If your esteemed brother were to choose,
would he bet on the court or on the Khitan?

319
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,566
Yet Lord Shuiqiu and I, Sang,

320
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:41,266
can only bet on the court.

321
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:54,166
This ten-day battle is meant to tell the world

322
00:27:55,033 --> 00:28:00,466
that even in this time when loyalty is wavering,
there still exist someone who bet on the court.

323
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:31,500
By the orders of Lord and Father Marshal, I,
led troops to garrison the city,

324
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:32,966
for a total of ten days.

325
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,500
Six hundred seventy-one men died in battle,
seven hundred thirty-two wounded.

326
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,000
Now, by the orders, I return to the city

327
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,300
to report to Lord and Father Marshal.

328
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:54,866
What should to be done,

329
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,933
and what could be done,

330
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
has all been done.

331
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,266
Go to my residence

332
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,000
to take your family home.

333
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,633
Thank you, Lord.

334
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:20,100
This humble general, Palace Attendant,
Commander of the Eighteenth Command of the Imperial Guard,

335
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:25,466
Secretariat and Chancellery, Palace Guard Attendant,
Arms-Bearing Officer, Zhao Kuangyin,

336
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,533
humbly requests Lord, for the morale of the troops,

337
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:33,000
to show compassion and award those who died,
were wounded, and meritorious in battle,.

338
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:38,466
You little fool!

339
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:42,300
The palace is this not a place for your nonsense!

340
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,066
Lord,

341
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,766
forgive my son's offense.

342
00:29:59,066 --> 00:29:59,600
Bring it.

343
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,600
Bring what?

344
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:07,633
The roster of those who died and were meritorious.

345
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:12,333
It has not yet been completed?

346
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:15,066
It's OK.

347
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,500
I will wait.

348
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:26,833
The soldiers who died and were wounded
need to be compensated.

349
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,366
The meritorious ones need to be rewarded.

350
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,933
Even if everything had really collapsed,

351
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,300
these are things that must be done.

352
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,133
Kuangyin.

353
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:14,933
Take a few attendants to the Lord's residence now,

354
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,966
to bring your mother, and your
younger brother, back home.

355
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:42,066
It was my oversight that caused you
to fall into the hands of the enemies and disturbed.

356
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:43,266
It's my fault.

357
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,200
In His Majesty's edict,

358
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,733
there is one more matter that we two shall handle.

359
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:48,733
Indeed.

360
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:52,033
We must move the deposed emperor to another palace.

361
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:53,900
But as far as I know,

362
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:58,133
there is no second palace for residence in this city,.

363
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:03,100
It doesn't matter. We can move him
to the main hall of the Kaifeng Prefecture.

364
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:04,900
I will handle this matter.

365
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:11,166
These impoverished in the capital,
knowing full well they themselves cannot partake,

366
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:13,400
won't let others partake either.

367
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,400
They have ruined the ambition of Lord Du and me.

368
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,533
I wonder what benefit they would possibly get.

369
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,900
Central Army Commander!

370
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:24,866
Yes.

371
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:29,766
Post notices with the spy Guo Rong's portrait
and search the entire city for him.

372
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:31,533
Understood.

373
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:52,966
Greetings, Sir.

374
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,433
Lü Yin, your surbodinate, greets you.

375
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:01,800
Your subordinate pays respects to you.

376
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,366
What brings you here, Minister?

377
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:08,166
What?

378
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,666
Am I not supposed to come?

379
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:12,966
I would not mean that.

380
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:14,633
Juzheng.

381
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:21,400
You were the sixth in the imperial examination
of the second year of Qingtai.

382
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,166
Is that so?

383
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:25,100
Yes.

384
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:31,866
A jinshi on the same list, with ten years of hard study
and twelve years of officialdom,

385
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,966
is no more than a judge in the capital.

386
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:39,566
Nothing shows better the hardships of troubled times.

387
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,333
Have you known about the edict from the Khitan emperor?

388
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,466
The Academy Institute sent a copy.

389
00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:53,466
I'm organizing household registers and land records,

390
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,400
and tidying seals and documents,

391
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,733
waiting for that Marshal Zhang to handover those to him.

392
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,500
Good.

393
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:04,633
Since you know,

394
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,166
listen carefully.

395
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,566
Awaiting your order.

396
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,200
From this day forward,

397
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,966
you are no longer the Judge of Kaifeng Prefecture.

398
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,333
From you downwards,

399
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:27,066
all adjutants, runners, and clerks
are dismissed together.

400
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:32,133
Considering that you've done your duties
over the past ten days, this prefecture will show mercy/

401
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,766
Since there is still some public funds,

402
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,566
each person may get an extra three months' salary.

403
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:40,766
Collect it,

404
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:43,733
and then disperse.

405
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,266
Although I'm an assistant official, by regulation,
my position is a court-appointed one.

406
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:55,633
As Military Commissioner, you still can't appoint
or dismiss capital officials bypassing Lord Feng.

407
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:58,166
Forgive me, I dare not obey this order.

408
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:02,833
I dare not obey this order.

409
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:12,733
Juzheng, you are still young.
You still have family. So leave here.

410
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:22,566
Sir, I, Xue, though lacking in talent,
also know a great calamity is imminent.

411
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:27,366
Yet I dare not shirk my duty to reserve my own life.

412
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:36,766
You've decided?

413
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:41,966
At most, I will lose my life.

414
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,100
It is not your turn to lose it.

415
00:36:57,866 --> 00:36:58,700
I, Sang,

416
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,333
am the Prefect of Kaifeng of the Great Jin Dynasty.

417
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:41,900
I wondered who it is so bold.

418
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,733
So it turns out to be you, Minister Sang.

419
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,000
You arrived so late.

420
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,866
How rude are you to Minister Sang!

421
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:11,966
With the decree of the Khitan Emperor, I'm here
to take over the Kaifeng Prefecture office.

422
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:14,266
Minister Sang,

423
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:17,233
you have always been sensible;

424
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,900
You will not obstruct, will you?

425
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,166
I, the Prefect of Kaifeng, am still here.

426
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,700
You cannot take over.

427
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,300
What did you say?

428
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:36,200
You refuse to obey the decree?

429
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,633
You filthy, worthless scoundrel!

430
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,033
Clearly, your death is imminent, yet
you still think you've seized an opportunity?

431
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:55,500
One truly can’t explain ice to a mayfly.

432
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,266
Sang Weihan,

433
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,466
you really don't know how to preserve some dignity.

434
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:12,400
I, Sang, bear eternal shame of selling
the Sixteen Prefectures of Yan and Yun.

435
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:17,900
You and Du Zhongwei sold over thirty prefectures
of Hebei and the capital.

436
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,666
Do you have any dignity left to give me?

437
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:25,233
Where are the official seals?

438
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,400
Smashed.

439
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,066
And the registers and legal documents?

440
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:32,100
Burned.

441
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:39,200
Have you gone mad, or are you suffering from
a phlegm disorder that has clouded your mind?

442
00:39:39,866 --> 00:39:43,300
All your plots are in the light,

443
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,666
and all your schemes will come to nothing.

444
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:50,766
My lifework has ended.

445
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,600
If costing my life could ruin you and Du Zhongwei's conspiracy,

446
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:57,100
then it will be worthwile.

447
00:39:57,733 --> 00:40:01,166
What you are going to do, the late Emperor succeeded in it.

448
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,700
But Du Zhongwei is not to succeed,

449
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:07,066
and you are even less likely to.

450
00:40:08,566 --> 00:40:09,433
Because,

451
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,333
you are a fool.

452
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:23,533
Good.

453
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:30,633
Sang Weihan, as the chancellor of the Later Jin dynasty,

454
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:33,770
is described in the Old History of the Five Dynasties as follows:

455
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:39,230
His ambition to assist and harmonize, and merit in establishing
the state can indeed be called a pillar of the state.

456
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,366
The New History of the Five Dynasties says:

457
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,066
It's Sang's merit to end Later Tang and prosper Later Jin.

458
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:46,800
His talents in politics and making strategy

459
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,333
have also received recognition and praise.

460
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,066
However,

461
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:57,866
as one of those directly responsible for
losing the Sixteen Prefectures of Yan and Yun,

462
00:41:57,866 --> 00:42:03,266
he has consequently received harsh criticism and
condemnation from later Confucian scholars.

463
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:09,600
The 17th century scholar Wang Fuzhi
explicitly criticized Sang Weihan

464
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,566
in his Discourses on Reading the Zizhi Tongjian, saying:

465
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:16,600
He left great calamity to the world, the influence of which on later generations

466
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,100
makes him a criminal of tens of thousands of years.

467
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:29,900
Central Army Commander!

468
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:31,866
Yes.

469
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:34,300
Announce to the entire army:

470
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:36,966
Grant three days of leave.

471
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:41,400
Conduct a city-wide search.

472
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:47,333
The advanced troops shall
conduct the search on the first day.

473
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,700
Others get the second and third days.

474
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,233
Let them notice the time.

475
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,766
Return to your units at the hour of Xu the day after tomorrow.

476
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,733
