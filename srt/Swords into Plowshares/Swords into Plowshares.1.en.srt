00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,921
[Episode 1]

2
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,233
In the year 907 AD,

3
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:41,800
Zhu Wen, military governor of Xuanwu,
overthrew Tang and established Later Liang.

4
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,766
Thus, the Great Tang Dynasty,

5
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:48,933
which had ruled China
for 289 years, officially fell.

6
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:54,500
China entered the bloody and chaotic
Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period,

7
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,100
a time of immense suffering for the people.

8
00:01:57,766 --> 00:02:00,433
In the year 923 AD,

9
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,289
Li Cun Xu, the military governor of Hedong,

10
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,000
conquered Later Liang
and established Later Tang.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,900
Just thirteen years later,

12
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,586
a new military governor
of Hedong, Shi Jing Tang,

13
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:13,086
borrowed troops from the Khitan
to conquer Later Tang

14
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:16,166
at the cost of ceding
the Sixteen Prefectures of Yan and Yun,

15
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,200
and establish Later Jin.

16
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,191
To secure Khitan support,
Shi Jing Tang did not hesitate

17
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:25,926
to acknowledge Yelv De Guang,
the Khitan ruler ten years his junior

18
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:27,933
as his godfather.
[Shi Jing Tang, Emperor of Later Jin]

19
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,466
He later became the infamous "Son Emperor".

20
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,600
Years of continuous war left fields deserted.
[Zhangyi Right Camp]

21
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,766
- Move it!
- Social order was destroyed.

22
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,633
During the Tianfu Period,
a drought hit Guanzhong Region.

23
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,600
People died of hunger everywhere.

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,800
Tax collectors' horses
trampled through villages.

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,900
As the poem of Wei Zhuang goes,

26
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,000
Outside the gate of armies corpses lay heaped.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,466
Of millions of households not one remained.

28
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:06,166
By order of Marshal Zhang Yan Ze,
Military Governor of Zhangyi, it is decreed:

29
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:11,800
Households near Anding County must each
contribute one dan of military supplies.

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,866
If grain is insufficient, flesh will suffice.

31
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,766
No! No!

32
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,433
No!

33
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,466
Marshal!

34
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:31,200
In Prefectures of Jing and Yuan,
there are 38,000 households.

35
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,433
Heaven cherishes all life.

36
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:37,600
If an army feeds on the people,
then it is no better than a beast.

37
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,066
Useless wretch!

38
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,366
[Zhang Yan Ze]
[Military Commissioner of the Zhangyi Army]

39
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:48,200
How did I raise a coward like you?

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,033
[Zhang Huai Su, Zhang Yan Ze's adoptive son]

41
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:52,166
Will you kill him?

42
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,633
If you don't kill him,

43
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,266
I'll kill you and use you as army rations!

44
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:05,466
A son's life is given by his father.

45
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:08,233
Kill me if you wish to, Father!

46
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:13,133
I only beg that you spare
these innocent commoners.

47
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,066
My dear eldest son.

48
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:19,933
Since you cannot bear them
eating others' flesh,

49
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:25,000
then cut your own flesh to feed them.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,333
Buddha, my son is compassionate,

51
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:32,966
wishing to emulate you in cutting
his own flesh to feed his comrades.

52
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,066
Good.

53
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:41,266
- Zhang Shi!
- I'm here.

54
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,666
Cook him.

55
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,633
Marshal!
[Zhang Shi, Military Governor of Zhangyi Army]

56
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,400
Marshal, please calm down!

57
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,600
The eldest young master is filial and pure.

58
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,333
Marshal, please show mercy!

59
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,266
I have more than just this one son.

60
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,833
In the Jingyuan Army,

61
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:03,133
tens of thousands of men are all like my flesh.

62
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,000
But...

63
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:13,166
If someone wishes to starve my flesh,

64
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:18,216
I will grind his bones
and make rations of them.

65
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:23,030
[Ten days later]

66
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,404
[The Garrison Mill]

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,233
[Zhao Kuang Yin]
[Courtesy name Yuan Lang, Zhao Hong Yin's son]

68
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:00,466
[Zhao Hong Yin]
[Deputy Inspector, Imperial Guard Headquarters]

69
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:03,833
[Jingzhou, station of the Zhangyi Army]

70
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,600
Bring out the the Emperor's command insignia.

71
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,966
The army only obeys the Marshal's orders.

72
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:27,633
We don't need any other orders.

73
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,633
Now that the Marshal is not in camp,

74
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,966
even if the heavens themselves came,

75
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,933
they can only wait here.

76
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:37,266
I kindly request you to make a report.

77
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:40,400
Deputy Capital Guard Commander
of the Imperial Guard, Zhao Hong Yin,

78
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,635
holds the insignia here

79
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:47,066
to summon the Secretariat Director
of the Zhangyi Army, Zhang Shi,

80
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,063
to the palace for interrogation.

81
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:53,533
The Emperor's decree must be treated seriously!

82
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:54,733
The Emperor?

83
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,700
He said "the Emperor".

84
00:06:58,533 --> 00:06:59,540
Do you know him?

85
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,166
No.

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,633
Father, stalling isn't a solution.

87
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,800
Let me try to give him
a few horseshoe-shaped gold ingots.

88
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:19,566
Kuang Yin, this is the gate
of a military headquarters.

89
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:21,400
We must not act rashly.

90
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,533
Understood.

91
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,040
Sirs.

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,066
Excuse me.

93
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm puzzled about a matter
and would like to seek your advice.

94
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,000
I've heard that to face the insignia
is to face the Emperor.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,733
Facing the Emperor's insignia,

96
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,500
the entire army bows its head,
and generals kneel in respect.

97
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,800
Why have the rules changed here?

98
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,366
You're just a kid.

99
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,633
Absolutely ignorant of what's proper!

100
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:59,266
The Emperor is established
by the Marshals and Lords,

101
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:04,900
and the Marshals and Lords are supported
and elevated by us fighting men.

102
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,066
That is to say,

103
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:13,766
we grunts are the benefactors
of the Lords and Marshals,

104
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:16,633
and thus the benefactors of the Emperor.

105
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,700
Right, everyone?

106
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,366
Yes, yes, yes!

107
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:25,833
The Emperor bestows the insignia
upon the Marshals and Lords in gratitude.

108
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:31,633
It's certainly not meant for you to flaunt
and tyrannize with in the military camps.

109
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,200
Nobody move!

110
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,600
Listen to him.

111
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,233
Don't move recklessly.

112
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,733
I have little strength,
and my hand is unsteady.

113
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,266
I hope not to take this sir's life.

114
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:52,162
Request the Secretariat Director
of the Zhangyi Army,

115
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:53,800
Military Governor Zhang Shi, to step forward.

116
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,133
The Emperor has questions.

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,633
You don't know your place.

118
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,700
Good-for-nothing wretch.

119
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,633
You are Zhang Shi?

120
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,300
Your secret memorial
has been received by the court.

121
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,633
Father!

122
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:57,800
Father!

123
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,233
Pursuers!

124
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:02,000
Judging by the horse beats, at least a squad.

125
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,700
Take him. Get moving!

126
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,600
Spread out!

127
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,666
Listen up, all of you!

128
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,566
Aim for the horses, not the men!

129
00:10:58,566 --> 00:10:59,900
Understood.

130
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,415
I am the Deputy Capital Guard Commander

131
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:32,666
of the Imperial Guard Infantry
and Cavalry, Zhao Hong Yin.

132
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,233
Returning here to report.

133
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,166
Open the gates!

134
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,686
[Kaifeng Prefecture, the capital prefecture]

135
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:54,733
At this time, Zhao Kuang Yin
had not yet even obtained

136
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:58,033
an official position
of the third-class in the army.

137
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:03,233
As a scion of a military family whose ambition
was to become a military governor,

138
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:06,533
Zhao Kuang Yin simply could not
comprehend that in this world

139
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,800
there could exist a military governor
like Zhang Yan Ze,

140
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
who was utterly devoid of conscience.

141
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:17,166
He did not understand how such a cruel beast

142
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,666
could have become a military governor
holding power of life and death over a region.

143
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,433
He understood even less
what the sovereign and his ministers

144
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:31,400
in the great hall could possibly be discussing
faced with such a merciless beast.

145
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,066
The eldest young master
was slit across the throat by the Marshal.

146
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:41,266
He was then cooked in public.

147
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,133
[Shi Jing Tang]

148
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,726
Sending people to the mill,

149
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:45,033
to ground flesh into dust

150
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:49,536
was what Huang Chao would do,
not my military governor.

151
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,633
A high-ranking minister is involved.

152
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,883
I believe this matter
[Shi Chong Gui, Prince of Qi]

153
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:57,933
should be thoroughly investigated.

154
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:00,942
This man framed my military governor,

155
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:03,433
and sowed discord between
a ruler and his minister.

156
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,250
Cage him and send him to Jingzhou.

157
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,833
Let Zhang Yan Ze decide how to deal with him.

158
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,733
Your Majesty!

159
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,966
Every word I have spoken is true.

160
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,433
I beg Your Majesty to discern the truth.

161
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,500
I beg Your Majesty to discern the truth.

162
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,800
Your Majesty!

163
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,966
I beg Your Majesty to discern the truth!

164
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:25,500
Your Majesty!

165
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,433
Zhao Hong Yin.

166
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,733
I'm here.

167
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,933
What a good job you've done.

168
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,333
My life is forfeit.

169
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,533
I deserve death!

170
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,514
[Feng Dao, Courtesy name Ke Dao]
[Director of the Secretariat]

171
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,833
You are an old-timer,
present since the first year of Tongguang.

172
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,989
You are demoted to Commander.

173
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:56,533
You are to remain
in the Imperial Guard Command.

174
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

175
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,833
I don't understand.

176
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,233
Where is the justice?

177
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,200
Where is the law?

178
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,266
All because he's a military governor?

179
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:13,166
It's because he holds over ten thousand troops.

180
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,800
That is the justice.

181
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,866
That is the law.

182
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:22,169
A soldier becoming a Marshal
who can even devour his own son.

183
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,206
He's worse than a beast.

184
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:25,166
- Kuang Yin.
- Am I not right?

185
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:30,266
I have found you a wife,
the third daughter in your Uncle He's family.

186
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:33,566
Let's settle the marriage early.

187
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:42,166
I've always upheld integrity and righteousness.

188
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,666
The Khitan saved me out of righteousness,

189
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:50,566
so I should repay them with honesty
and by keeping my promises.

190
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:53,033
Now, An Chong Rong is going to
attack the Khitan.

191
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,533
That'll put me in an unfavorable position.

192
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,200
This battle must be fought.

193
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,233
Logistics precede the army.

194
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,133
Within Military Governor
Du Chong Wei's jurisdiction,

195
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,133
a million hu of grain was collected,
but only three hundred thousand was reported.

196
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,266
The rest filled his own pockets.

197
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,900
The tribute from the Kingdom of Wuyue

198
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,233
is already on its way.

199
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,800
Yes.

200
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,100
I still have Wuyue.

201
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,666
The Kingdom of Wuyue faces the sea to the east,

202
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,266
and borders Min to the south.

203
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:29,700
The rest of its territory is surrounded
by its powerful neighbor, Southern Tang.

204
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:36,900
Wuyue submits and pays tribute to
the Central Plains dynasties for protection.

205
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,666
The Central Plains dynasties have continuously
[The Western Court, Hangzhou]

206
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,533
bestowed favor upon the Qian kings of Wuyue,

207
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:47,400
intending to leave hidden landmines
in the rear of Southern Tang.

208
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,033
Under this delicate balance,

209
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,000
Wuyue has long been free from war.

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,933
Commerce flourishes,
and the people live and work in peace.

211
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,133
It can be called a land of happiness.
[Armors and Arms Ready for Battle]

212
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,633
Last year in Jianzhou,

213
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:02,766
our army ran out of provisions,
thus suffering defeat.

214
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:04,300
Tens of thousands of our comrades died there.

With just one word from that Son Emperor,
[Zhou Ping, Infantry Officer]

218
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:14,666
the Great King sent all provisions
to the Central Plains.

219
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,733
Why is it so difficult for us
to receive our rewards?

220
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:19,600
How is that right?

221
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,633
Having lived in peace for too long,
you've grown fussy.

222
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,833
How dare you discuss
the Great King's commands here?

of the Inner Cavalry and Infantry Guards]

who dares to neglect them?

228
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:43,600
It is only to seek rewards for the comrades
who risked life and limbs last year

229
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,366
that we hope to make it clear
to the Eldest Prince.

230

Old Lord, as a veteran commander of the army,

231
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,833
you definitely understand
the intricacies within.

232
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,800
Enlisted in the army
in the second year of Tianfu,

233
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
you must be at least 65 now.

234
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,266
Old Lord, this humble general was born in July.

235
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:04,133
I have turned 66.

236
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,933
Back then, the rebellion of Xu Zai Si

237
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,433
caused the Late King great distress.

238
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,966
It was the current King
who shared his father's burden,

239
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:20,133
becoming a live-in son-in-law
of the Tian family in Xuanzhou,

240
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,366
thus settling the aftermath.

241
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:28,766
I remember at that time,
everyone feared the difficulty of the matter.

242
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:30,400
Everyone was unwilling to follow.

243
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,633
When the Great King went to Xuanzhou,

244
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,166
he only took you, his sole long-time attendant.

245
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:43,133
The past is gone.

246
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,466
Thinking of it makes one sigh.

247
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:51,133
It is the duty of us ministers
to share the King's burdens.

248
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:53,400
You are loyal,

249
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,666
so surely you would not
cause your lord trouble.

250
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,233
Strip Zhou Ping of his armor,

251
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,100
drag him out, and behead him.

252
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,466

- Eldest Prince!
- Lord!

257
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:21,000
These soldiers in the army fear authority
but do not cherish virtue.

258

Having lived in peace for too long,

259
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:25,366
they inevitably become lazy and negligent.

Lord, but...

261
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,100
Since you've been granted military authority,

262
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,433
you should not belittle yourself.

When Zhou Ping followed me
to the Tian family then,

268
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,166
I promised him one thing.

00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:21,733
I will accept punishment
and disposal from you.

353
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,166
The King's orders are absolute.

354
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,200
If we delay and ruin an important matter,

355
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
I will set up a big pot
before all the commanders and soldiers,

356
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,466
and stew you.

357
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:31,066
Orders received.

358
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,166
You bunch of fools.

359
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,200
Still lazing around?

360
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,933
Hurry up and move the things out!

361
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,233
Quick!

362
00:23:56,673 --> 00:23:57,939
Quick!

363
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:05,833
Everything has been prepared.

364
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,800
I dare not delay official business.

365
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,200
Commander He.

366
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,433
I did not supervise
the selection in the storeroom.

367
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:15,366
The receipt will be
given to you at a later date.

368
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,566
I understand. Official matters take priority.

369
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:20,300
Please do not trouble yourself
with the receipt.

370
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,466
In three days, I will come
to your residence to collect it in person.

371
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:33,833
Are there issues with these silks and fabrics?
[Qian Hong Chu, Qian Yuan Guan's ninth son]

372
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,733
The silks and brocades used
when rewarding soldiers

373
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,566
have always been black or gray.

374
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:42,400
Even if the color is one grade higher,
it is at most blue.

375
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,933
Scarlet, green, and indigo blue
are reserved for officers.

376
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,933
Commoners using them is an overstep.

377
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:48,966
Indeed.

378
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,566
Fifth rank officers and above wear scarlet.

379
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:51,933
Sixth and seventh ranks wear green.

380
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,933
Eighth and ninth ranks wear indigo.

381
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,733
First, rewards have always
been of solid colors.

382
00:24:57,733 --> 00:24:59,766
This time, they are of mixed colors.

383
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,600
This is very unusual.

384
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,900
Second, I held the King's order.

385
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,400
Yet he dared to defy it,
refusing to comply until Lord Hu arrived.

386
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,566
His audacity is astonishing.

387
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:15,400
Third, when issuing rewards,

388
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,966
officials from each department
enter the warehouse to select,

389
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:20,966
then wrap, box, and transport them back.

390
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:23,133
But he did not let me enter the warehouse.

391
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,900
He directly packed them and sent them out,

392
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,933
using hundreds of wooden boxes,

393
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:32,933
all of which must written off on the ledger.

394
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:36,733
Is he going to pay the cost
of these boxes by himself?

395
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:39,233
Fourth, when issuing rewards,

396
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:42,000
a receipt is signed immediately
upon disbursement.

397
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,566
Yet, he didn't even ask for proof on the spot,

398
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:47,466
merely saying he would
come to collect it later.

399
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:49,766
Although this is convenient,

400
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:51,666
it doesn't accord to regulations.

401
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,233
Then it is clear.

402
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:56,366
There's a thief within.

403
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:58,566
What on earth is going on?

404
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,966
I truly was blinded by greed.

405
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:04,466
[Dai Yun, Commander of
the Inner Cavalry and Infantry Guards]

406
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:09,600
Such nonsense meant to fool outsiders
might work on Shen Wen Qi,

407
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,800
but that's it.

408
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,166
To brush off me...

409
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:18,233
You are pushing your luck!

410
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:21,366
The inner guard armies have always
been under your command, Marshal.

411
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:23,200
Now, out of nowhere...

412
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,333
a Commander-in-Chief
of the Imperial Cavalry and Infantry,

413
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:29,800
comes asking to open
the inner treasury without informing you.

414
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,000
I panicked and committed this foolish act

415
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,033
for fear of violating
your military rules and regulations.

416
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:38,800
You are not foolish in the slightest.

417
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,500
You are too clever by half.

418
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:46,033
Having only commanded the First Capital
of the Personal Guard for about two years,

419
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:52,733
you acquired two three-courtyard estates
by West Lake and took nine concubines.

420
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:55,833
Do you think I'm blind?

421
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:59,366
I dare not deceive you, Marshal.

422
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:03,133
Since I became a commander,
I have received many gifts.

423
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:04,633
Still, I have two principles.

424
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,400
I dare not neglect my duties.

425
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,000
The army's provisions and pay,
I dare not embezzle.

426
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,626
If I have violated these two principles,

427
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:15,433
I am willing to be pierced
by ten thousand arrows.

428
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:21,400
These matters are not
for your glib tongue to decide.

429
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,533
Send inner treasury's financial records
for the past two years to my residence.

430
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:28,533
As to whether you are guilty,

431
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:33,133
we must first verify everything clearly
to ensure justice is served.

432
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,166
I humbly obey
the Old Marshal's esteemed command.

433
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:47,500
Deceiving everyone and engaging in theft.

434
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,933
He Cheng Xun is merely a commander,

435
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:53,433
yet he openly steals and sells
the royal family's private property.

436
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:55,900
His audacity is truly immense.

437
00:27:56,933 --> 00:28:01,033
The inner treasury holds countless coins,
silks, and other treasures.

438
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,966
These are all items
rarely seen by ordinary people.

439
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:05,466
Once they enter the market,

440
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:08,800
the local officials of two Courts,
and the various prefectures and counties,

441
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,966
could not possibly remain unaware.

442
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:16,466
How did he do it with no one noticing?

443
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:18,766
Eldest brother, Lord Yu Ru.

444
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:20,933
Have you ever seen boxes like this?

445
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,833
What's wrong with these boxes?

446
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,000
The government uses large boxes for storing
and transporting silk and cloth, right?

447
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,666
The Eastern Court treasury
only uses large three-feet square boxes.

448
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,666
We have indeed never seen such a small box

449
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,166
that is three feet long and one foot wide.

450
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,533
That's right.

451
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:46,400
Instead, I often see such small boxes.

452
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:52,333
In the Western Court city,
the 18 shops with the "Shanyue House" signboard

453
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:57,066
all use this kind of small boxes
to sell their cloth and silk.

454
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:03,433
Hong Chu, this is no small matter.

455
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,766
Don't get involved.

456
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:07,566
Be content with your fishing business.

457
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:09,233
I understand.

458
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:22,866
Distinguished guest, where do you come from?

459
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,533
Our master has been waiting
in the Listening Rain Pavilion for you.

460
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,866
This way, please.

461
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:47,956
[Li Yuan Qing, Courtesy name Yun Qing]
[Grand Master of Qinhuai House]

462
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,966
Yun Qing, I haven't seen you in a long time.

463
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:07,166
Cheng, kindly take a seat.

464
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,466
After you.

465
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:10,100
What dishes are there today?

466
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,633
Report them now.

467
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:16,666
Master, that young fisherman's boy
who tried in the kitchen once has been invited.

468
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,833
It took me quite some effort.

469
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,766
Regarding knife skills for preparing raw fish,

470
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:25,933
even the veteran chefs have less than
a thousandth of this lad's skills.

471
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:27,966
With Master Li's visit,

472
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:30,766
it's perfect to have him serve properly.

473
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:31,766
Matters of food and drink

474
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:33,933
are not of great concern to Yun Qing and me.

475
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:36,900
What's important is that
the person must be reliable.

476
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,033
Please rest assured.

477
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:40,966
That young boy always
hangs around the fish market docks.

478
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,733
Many old fishermen know him.

479
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,633
He's a local with a clear background.

480
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,033
Enough.

481
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,400
You may go.

482
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,600
Cheng, the Crown Prince has passed away.

483
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,200
Now, the Great King's health is not well.

484
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,300
Within the palace walls, which prince
do you think will ascend to the throne?

485
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
Among the Princes,

486
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,366
the Eldest Prince has the highest reputation.

487
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,166
The Third Prince holds
the strongest military power.

488
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,766
However, both of them are adopted sons.

489
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:16,833
The Eldest Prince is son
of King Qian's elder brother's.

490
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,333
He is Lord Five's eldest son.

491
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:20,866
The Third Prince's original surname is Sun.

492
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,433
They are both false sons,
not to be taken seriously.

493
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:31,033
Some say, Zhou Ping led the disturbance,

494
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:34,800
backed by Dai Yun.

495
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,866
What is your view of this matter?

496
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,666
If Marshal Dai truly backed him,
Zhou Ping wouldn't have died.

497
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:51,175
[Qian Hong You, childhood name A'Zuo]
[Commander of the Inner Guards Archer Units]

498
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,233
Dai Yun is my uncle by marriage.

499
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:59,000
I hold military power in the west.

500
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,966
Dai commands the guards within the court.

501
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:04,493
Even without the baseless rumors,
for overall stability,

502
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:07,700
I implore you to relieve me
of my military command.

503
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:14,433
The stability of Wuyue

504
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,500
relies on you all to uphold.

505
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,666
I will spare no effort,
even at the cost of my life.

506
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,566
So, you mean...

507
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:30,933
Among the King's biological sons,
there's someone promising?

508
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,633
The Sixth Prince can be described...

509
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,566
as mature and capable in statecraft.

510
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,700
Your Majesty, the Sixth Prince has arrived.

511
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:51,200
Let him in.

512
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,333
Yes.

513
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,366
Acting Grand Commandant,

514
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:02,100
Deputy Military Governor
of Zhenhai and Zhendong,

515
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,400
Assistant to the Chancellor's Office,
your subject, Hong Zuo,

516
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,193
pays homage to Your Majesty.

517
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,266
You're always like this.

518
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,766
Don't you find it a mouthful?

519
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:18,566
Even I am tired of your verbosity.

520
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:20,400
You are just a youth.

521
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,933
Why do you pretend to be mature and steady?

522
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:24,200
What's the matter?

523
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:28,666
Do you need me to grant you
an honor of pretentious maturity?

524
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,533
I apologize.

525
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:34,866
Hong Chu is not much younger than you.

526
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,366
Look at the two of you.

527
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:39,166
One retains childishness,

528
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,233
while the other is pompous.

529
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,333
He's not in the Chancellor's mansion.

530
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,600
If one enters it,

531
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,733
will they cease to be my son?

532
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,633
Propriety cannot be neglected.

533
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:01,433
I just want you to call me "Father".

534
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,633
Is it really that difficult?

535
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:05,466
At home, we're father and son.

536
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:06,933
When discussing affairs...

537
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,533
we are ruler and subject.

538
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:14,466
This Sixth Prince is actually
a remarkable person.

539
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:18,333
With such a mature and statecraft-minded
prince in the inner court,

540
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:22,933
how dare you, this granary rat,
so recklessly tamper with dealings?

541
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,766
When a family's estate grows,

542
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:27,533
and a state has been established for long,

543
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:31,100
it is inevitable that
some foxes and rats will emerge.

544
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,200
I am merely a middleman.

545
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,900
Those who truly rely on
these businesses to suck blood

546
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,100
and amass wealth are none other
than these scions of nobles and generals.

547
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,866
Master, the first course is here.

548
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,300
Does it have a name?

549
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,000
This wine pot is made of the finest porcelain.

550
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,833
The wine is a new brew
from our winery, named "Moonlit Night".

551
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,900
The fish is shaped into twenty-four arches,

552
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,166
thus named "Moonlit Night
of Twenty-Four Bridges".

553
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,466
A fine name.

554
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:12,933
Yun Qing, have some.

555
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:14,400
Same to you.

556
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:24,000
Tender, fresh, and smooth,
melting in the mouth.

557
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,400
Indeed, quite something.

558
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Your reward.

559
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,466
Quick, express your gratitude.

560
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:45,433
I humbly thank you.

561
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:47,566
Enough. You may leave.

562
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,300
Steward Hou, wait a moment.

563
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,700
What is this person's name?

564
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,133
The fishermen at the fish market
call him Nine Jin,

565
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:06,233
because they once saw him dive into the water

566
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,933
and catch a nine-jin fish barehanded.

567
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:10,760
As to his surname, that is unknown.

568
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,873
Upon seeing the gold,

569
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:15,366
he was neither dazed nor overjoyed,
but instead startled.

570
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:19,033
It seems gold is not new to him.

571
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:22,633
Whenever kneeling or standing,
his acts are perfectly measured.

572
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:25,766
This is the upbringing of a child
from a prominent family.

573
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,466
His manners are flawless
down to the last detail.

574
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:29,800
That man's boot soles have no mud,
[Xue Wen, Qian Hong Chu's close attendant]

575
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,166
but they exude a salty, fishy smell.

576
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:34,600
He probably came by ship.

577
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,400
The sea waves are turbulent,
so it must have been perilous.

578
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,566
Thus, the ship wouldn't be small.

579
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:44,133
This lad is actually a informant?

580
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,600
I will go capture him for interrogation.

581
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,800
It's too late.

582
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Don't be so alarmed.

583
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,766
Too many people in the Western Court
are keeping an eye on us.

584
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,700
We can't possibly capture everyone.

585
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:56,933
However, young as this man is,

586
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:58,700
he really has remarkable culinary skills.

587
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,566
He's probably from a prominent family.

588
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,733
Go to the Maritime Trade Office
to check the ships

589
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:05,333
with three hundred liao or more
entering port today.

590
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,566
Entry time should be between Mao and Si.

591
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:08,766
It should be easy to identify.

592
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:15,926
[The East Sea]

593
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,633
Don't bother hiding.

594
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,233
It's stuffy inside.

595
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:04,666
Come out.

596
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:36,900
I'm hungry. Is there any food?

597
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,066
You, watch your step!

598
00:39:01,066 --> 00:39:02,200
Watch your step!

599
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,933
You two, lift gently!

600
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:04,933
Slow down!

601
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:06,166
Come.

602
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:09,166
Everyone, be careful!

603
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,933
Be so careless again,
and you can jump in to be fish fodder!

604
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,466
All of you, hurry up and pack it!

605
00:39:13,466 --> 00:39:14,466
Quick!

606
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:16,033
Pack it all up!

607
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:17,233
Quick!

608
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:18,933
Carry it away!

609
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,000
I must have lost my manners.

610
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I am truly very hungry.

611
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:40,166
I appreciate your generosity and kindness.

612
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:43,500
How are you related to the Yu family's
eldest daughter from Huanglong Island?

613
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,166
I... do not know who this Eldest Lady Yu is.

614
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:50,233
But I have indeed heard of
the Huanglong pirates on the East Sea,

615
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:52,133
whose name strike fear.

616
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:57,566
So, you mean, you infiltrated Shanyue House

617
00:39:57,566 --> 00:39:59,466
not for business.

618
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:05,000
That depends on what business
you are doing with Shanyue House.

619
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,000
Everyone, slow down!

620
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,200
All of you, be careful!

621
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,333
Intruders!

622
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,066
There's trouble.

623
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:58,000
Huanglong House intruders.

624
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,733
Great Master, just leave for your affairs.

625
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:05,966
I've received a meal's grace
and dare not leave without permission.

626
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,733
If you still don't trust me,

627
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,300
you can send one or two
trusted aides to guard here.

628
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,333
Serve this young master well.

629
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,066
Do not slight him.

630
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,566
- Slow down!
- Hurry up!

631
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:47,833
Stop!

632
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,566
Let me go!

633
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:27,966
Let me go, gentlemen!

634
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:28,966
Let me go!

635
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:31,333
- Let me out!
- Behave!

636
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,000
Madam, I suppose there must be
some misunderstandings between us.

637
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,600
You'd better be quiet.

638
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,733
Otherwise, I'll cut out your tongue
and feed it to the dogs.
