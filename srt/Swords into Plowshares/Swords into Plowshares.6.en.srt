Could you please inform Lord Feng

I already said Lord will not see anyone.

20

74
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:14,300
Let's take a detour.

Hurry!

76
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:41,533
Hurry!

77

87
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:55,566
But...

88
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,733
A fire this big in the palace can be seen dozens of miles away.

89
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:02,066
I'm afraid the outer city is in complete chaos.

90
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,366
Take your four squads to the streets.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,333
If you see anyone killing or looting,
execute him on the spot.

92

One more,

94
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:13,400
Then here?

I'll be here.

Yes, sir.

99

100
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,100
Here!

101
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:29,233
Ask them, who has seen the Emperor?

102
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:30,266
Yes!

103
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,033
Hurry!

104
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,766
Let me go!

105
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,533
Mother!

106
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:54,666
Mother!

107
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,133
Disarm and don't move!

108
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:11,300
Nobody move!

109
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,433
Don't move!

Nobody move!

111
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,100

117
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,633
Go on.

118
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,730
Have you seen the Emperor?

119
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,530
We can't find His Majesty anywhere.

120
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,166

00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:23,200
Your Majesty!

125
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,566
Your Majesty, where are you?

126
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
Go! Everyone, search!

127
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,133
Hurry!

128
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,833
Your Majesty is found!

129
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,033
Your Majesty! Your Majesty is found!

130
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,733
Quick!

131
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:36,566
Your Majesty is found!

132
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,700
Torches!

133
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,730
Your Majesty!

134
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Your subject, Commander of the Imperial Guard Cavalry
and Infantry, Zhao Hongyin, has come to rescue Your Majesty!

135
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:52,566
Your Majesty.

136
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:58,900
You mean,

137
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,700
this fire was set by the Emperor himself?

138
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:06,266
The Deputy Commissioner of the
Palace Domestic Service, Jiang Ping, said that.

139
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:11,300
His Majesty let the eunuchs to bring
twelve barrels of fierce fire oil into the hall.

140
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,760
After it was all splashed about,

141
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,133
it was His Majesty

142
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,300
who lit the fire in person.

143
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,500
That's insane! How could Jiang Ping dare to obey such an edict?

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,833
Jiang Ping said

145
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:28,900
His Majesty

146
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,966
kneeled and begged him,

147
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,533
saying he wanted to die with dignity.

148
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:44,100
Jiang Ping is an old servant who attended the late Emperor.

149
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,633
In a moment of weakness,

150
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,100
he thus acted foolishly.

151
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:55,766
If the Emperor wishes to abandon the world,
we subjects must spare no effort to persuade him not.

152
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:58,966
A moment of weakness? What a petty eunuch.

153
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,033
Then, in the end,

154
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,000
who saved the Emperor?

155
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:04,833
He himself got scared

156
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,566
and do not wan to die.

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,800
Lord, please discern.

158
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:14,800
The one who served the ruler was your eldest son's.

159
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:19,566
So what about letting him come to my place?

160
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:21,266
What?

161
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,066
Not willing, huh?

162
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:25,000
I accept the order.

163
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:28,700
On behalf of my son,

164
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:32,600
I thank the Lord for your grace.

165
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,800
All vehicles park on the left.
Pedestrians keep to the right.

166
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Everyone, go home.

167
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:39,833
Yes.

168
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,200
How imposing!

169
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,233
You're finally back. Hurry up and help.

170
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,500
Everyone,

171
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,000
good job.

172
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,800
Surround the carriage.

173
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,830
I am Zhao Kuangyin, Commander of the Eighteenth Unit
of the Imperial Guard Cavalry and Infantry.

174
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,730
Sir, please step out of the carriage.

175
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:23,966
Yang Guangyi sent you here?

176
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,300
Yang Guangyi is my sworn brother.

177
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
Zhao Hongyin is your father?

178
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:33,166
You know my father?

179
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,733
I want to meet him.

180
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:37,633
He is currently in the palace.

181
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,866
Then I will go there.

182
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,166
It is heavily guarded.

183
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:45,033
Although my father is a commander of the Imperial Guard,
he cannot break the rules.

184
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:47,733
Now it have already become such a mess.

185
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,660
Stop talking about rules.

186
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:53,666
You're injured.

187
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,066
Alright,

188
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll take there.

189
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:20,933
Greetings, esteemed guests.
This is your humble official Zhan Nan,

190
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,433
People in the city are panicked these days.

191
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,600
Rumors say Zhang Yanze's troops are coming along the Bian River.

192
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,533
There are troops in the city,

193
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,833
but there's no leader.

194
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:37,133
[Zhan Nan, Clerk of Guest in Honglu Temple]
Don't know if we will have a protector, or a disaster.

195
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:41,633
Even the cleaners have all disappeared
one by one over past few days.

196
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:45,700
Noble guests, please arrange for everything yourselves.

197
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,600
As for the daily supply of food,
the temple would arrange for all provisions.

198
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,400
The senior officials are not here now.

199
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,433
Tomorrow I will go to the temple and break the storeroom door

200
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:00,533
to see if there are any funds left.

201
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,066
But now the city is in chaos,

202
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm afraid even with money, we can't buy anything.

203
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:06,933
Wait.

204
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:10,033
Just now you said "break the storeroom"?

205
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,300
Yes.

206
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,933
The key to the storeroom is with the temple assistant.

207
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:16,533
He escaped seven days ago.

208
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,200
We can only break it open for now.

209
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,300
Moreover, even we break it, there might be nothing.

210
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,666
We have money.

211
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,000
Mr. Zhan, could you do the purchase for us?

212
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:31,166
Young master, the problem is that
the markets in the city have all closed.

213
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,366
To buy a little,

214
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:36,233
we can go door to door and buy some at high prices.

215
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,933
But the food and supplies for
several hundred people are not easy to manage.

216
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,066
Lord Shuiqiu, don't look at me.

217
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:50,400
I am just a military officer, and I've never been a quartermaster.

218
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:51,900
This kind of work...

219
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,333
Please report that,

220
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,966
I wish to meet Lord Feng.

221
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,633
The Khitan ruler has already arrived at Yexia.

222
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,333
Minister Sang come specially to discuss a plan with Lord Feng.

223
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,133
Such a major matter is not yet discussed,

224
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,633
yet the Emperor himself set a great fire in the palace.

225
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,960
The situation is critical.

226
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,400
Lord Feng, you must make the decision ahead.

227
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,700
What plan?

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,866
Decide what?

229
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,433
His Majesty is unreliable.

230
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:32,766
Everyone relies on you, Lord Feng.

231
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,900
The one who wants to be Emperor is Du Zhongwei.

232
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,833
If you want a plan or a decision... Go to ask him.

233
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,700
This Du surrendered to the enemy
on the battlefield, causing Hebei to fall,

234
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,066
and the situation to collapse.

235
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:50,100
How can such a man be a ruler?

236
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,400
Then, who do you intend to make the ruler?

237
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,266
Tell me.

238
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,133
Lord. The Emperor wishes to abandon the empire.

239
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,333
This is not your fault, Lord.

240
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:10,300
Now it is the time to
rectify the chaos and restore the order.

241
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,133
Mr. Sang,

242
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,500
you may leave.

243
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:19,700
Lord.

244
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:22,166
Otherwise I'm going to scold out loud.

245
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,200
The one who destroyed the Later Jin

246
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
is you, Lord.

247
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:49,830
Minister Sang.

248
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:57,800
Kuangyin,

249
00:16:59,133 --> 00:16:59,866
you two,

250
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,100
wait here,

251
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:02,966
do not wander around.

252
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:03,300
Yes.

253
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:15,600
Lord Feng.

254
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,500
Zhao Hongyin has arrived.

255
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,100
This humble general Zhao Hongyin, greets the Lord.

256
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,300
How is His Majesty?

257
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,600
He has been settled in Zide Hall,

258
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,200
given some medicinal soup,

259
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,930
and has already fallen asleep.

260
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,933
Keep a close watch on him.

261
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:32,900
Understood.

262
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,833
Anything else?

263
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:43,500
[Clerk of the Hedong Cavalry and Infantry]

264
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:53,433
Where is the person?

265
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,100
Waiting outside the province.

266
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,100
Bring him in.

267
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:08,760
What did the Lord say?

268
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,666
You, take him inside.

269
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:12,966
Me?

270
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:13,566
Yes.

271
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:17,930
You are appointed the Armed Commander
of Secretariat Director Guard.

272
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,700
The official order has been issued.

273
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,333
From today, report here daily for duty.

274
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:23,666
Come here.

275
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,333
Report to the Lord, I encountered
this person last night while patrolling.

276
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:39,660
He claimed...

277
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,200
Kuangyin.

278
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:43,000
I am here.

279
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:49,266
Your father has he given you
the Secretariat's official order?

280
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:53,100
Thank you for your promotion, Lord.

281
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:02,100
I am Guo Rong, Clerk of the Cavalry and Infantry

282
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,833
Hedong Military Governor's Office.

283
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,500
[Guo Rong, also named Chai Rong, Clerk of the
Cavalry and Infantry]I pay my respects to the Lord.

284
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,100
[Guo Wei]
You are Guo Wei's son.

285
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:09,533
Yes.

286
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,366
When did you arrive?

287
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:15,400
I arrived last night along with the Wuyue envoy delegation.

288
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,533
The Wuyue envoy?

289
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,766
Marshal Zhang's occupied Huazhou,
pressing troops towards Chenqiao.

290
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,166
I had to to take a detour.

291
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,500
But on the way, I was ambushed by the troops from Yexia.

292
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:31,533
I encountered them by chance in Shangqiu.
They saved me, allowing me to arrive safely in the capital.

293
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,366
Do they know your identity?

294
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:36,733
No.

295
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,400
I know what's important.

296
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,966
I pretended to sleep and did not speak with anyone.

297
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:49,700
Your father himself had little education,
but he's quite good in raising his son.

298
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,566
I dare not accept such high praise from you, Lord.

299
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:59,666
You have endured hardships along the way,
risking your life to enter the capital.

300
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,166
What is your purpose?

301
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,433
It is truly my fault.

302
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:08,766
My subordinates were negligent.
They didn't even know when that person got away.

303
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,233
I beg you to forgiveme.

304
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,633
You two adult, unable to keep watching over
a patient who had been unconscious for days?

305
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Your excuse is...

306
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,133
What?

307
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:27,766
He is gone, and we must have an explanation.

308
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:29,433
That's enough.

309
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:42,500
Please don't worry.

310
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,933
This matter is not the fault of you
and your subordinates.

311
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,230
The Emperor is incompetent.

312
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,433
Hebei has fallen,

313
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,800
the world is in chaos,

314
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,066
and order has collapsed.

315
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:55,600
He even burned the palace,
bringing constant disturb to the capital.

316
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Nobles and commoners are all worried.

317
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:01,300
Lord, for thirty years, you have
borne the expectations of the world.

318
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,166
In times of crisis, it's the state's fortune
to have you back to the court.

319
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,030
You are entrusted by the late emperor on his deathbed.
In this critical moment,

320
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,700
we wish you to shoulder the heavy responsibility,
just like the Legendary Chancellor Kongming,

321
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,533
like Yi Yin and Huo Guang, and exercise your authority.

322
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,860
Please support the Seventh Prince
Shi Chonggui, to ascend to the throne,

323
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,900
to restore the legitimate succession.

324
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,966
Please kill the evil and bring the order
back to the empire and the court.

325
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:33,033
If you presides over state affairs in the capital,

326
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:38,033
the soldiers and civilians of Taiyuan, with Lord Liu,
are all willing to follow you,

327
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:39,900
and ready to serve at your command.

328
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,960
Who taught you those words?

329
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,066
[Liu Zhiyuan]
By Lord of Taiyuan?

330
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:56,566
Or by your father?

331
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,033
Who?

332
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,900
I entered the palace last night and
happened to encounter the fire and chaos.

333
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,200
This is merely my superficial opinion.

334
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,733
Young man, it's so bold of you!

335
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:16,100
Lord,

336
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,333
the state is declining.

337
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,133
I dares not but speak frankly as my advise.

338
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:22,466
Fortunately,

339
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,066
those words are your own insight.

340
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:30,800
If they had come

341
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:33,500
from Lord of Taiyuan,

342
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:38,700
now your head would already be on the ground.

343
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:41,766
Young man,

344
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:44,400
you are too naive.

345
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:51,800
Liu Zhiyuan rose from the bottom,
and long experienced in the ranks of soldiers.

346
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,366
What has he not seen?

347
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:54,800
What has he not experienced?

348
00:22:57,566 --> 00:22:59,200
If he wanted to be the bottom-fisher,

349
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:03,266
he would not be as blunt and unsightly as you.

350
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:06,766
To be honest,

351
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,266
Lord Liu and my father ordered me to ask you, Lord,

352
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:11,400
for a truthful answer.

353
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,000
Is the Emperor,

354
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:15,266
still reliable?

355
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:17,200
Can the capital,

356
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,833
still be defended?

357
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:21,933
He's not.

358
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:23,600
It can't be.

359
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:30,000
Lord Liu asks, in such situation,

360
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,100
where are we going?

361
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,366
Have you thought of it, Lord?

362
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,033
He was originally the one most capable of waiting.

363
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,933
He has waited for his whole life.

364
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,930
Is waiting a little longer now

365
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:48,300
a big deal for him?

366
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,966
Move aside.

367
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:16,900
You're in my way.

368
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,200
You ignored me earlier.

369
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:20,633
Still angry now?

370
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:21,966
You are a Prince,

371
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,600
I am a maid serving you.

372
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:25,600
How dare I be angry with you?

373
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,000
Then my maid is truly different.

374
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,966
Even her temper is unmatched in the southeast,
overpowering Mount Wu.

375
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't be angry.

376
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:43,200
It's my fault.

377
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:44,900
I apologize to you.

378
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,166
If you are tired of me,
you might as well tell me at once.

379
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:57,566
When we return, I will go back to the island
with my elder brother to stay with my mother.

380
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:00,966
At least I won't have to spend all day
reading other people's expressions.

381
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:01,533
Alright.

382
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:05,066
When we return, I will go to the island with you.

383
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:08,966
We'll fish for a lifetime,
becoming carefree island masters,

384
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,733
and never bother with Wuyue or Bianliang anymore,

385
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:15,166
nor see those troublesome two-legged livestock again.

386
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,833
That's my family's island.

387
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,633
Why will you be an island master?

388
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:20,900
Then...

389
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:22,500
You... you'll be the master.

390
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,833
OK, OK, let's stop here.

391
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:36,633
It was my fault not letting you speak today.

392
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:38,666
Forgot it, OK?

393
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Am I not right?

394
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,833
They lost a person.

395
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:46,633
Why can't I ask?

396
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:47,966
Why can't I say something?

397
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:50,166
Is it reasonable?

398
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,500
This person

399
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,933
left on his own.

400
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,366
So there's no need to ask.

401
00:25:58,733 --> 00:25:59,466
What do you mean?

402
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:04,566
This person's identity is very strange.

403
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:10,633
Yang Guangyi and his men had already noticed him
when they were in Chenliu.

404
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:15,433
Lord Shuiqiu and Third Brother both knew that.

405
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:19,033
But neither of them pointed it out.

406
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,866
It's bizarre.

407
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:25,700
Strange.

408
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,833
Less words, and you'll
be less involved.

409
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,600
So in the end,

410
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,300
no one pointed it out.

411
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,900
All of you

412
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,533
know everything clearly.

413
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,466
Only I am confused,

414
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,833
worrying in vain.

415
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:55,900
That Guo

416
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,000
is merely a young man speaking nonsense.

417
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,833
Minister Sang,

418
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:02,433
however, is serious.

419
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,900
This old man would rather all the court officials and nobles

420
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,966
were like this nonsense-speaking young man.

421
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:18,166
This is the trend of the world,
beyond our ability,

422
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:22,133
Even the Emperor himself is
about to abandon this empire.

423
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:25,133
Lord, why do you torment yourself?

424
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:29,133
Do you also think I am doing this for His Majesty?

425
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:30,466
Isn't that so?

426
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,966
When everyone was singing and urging him to ascend,

427
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:38,266
Lord, you held the little Prince, storming out of the palace.

428
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,333
Now, everyone says

429
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:41,966
he should be deposed,

430
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,200
yet only you, Lord,

431
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:46,600
are still trying to support him.

432
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,566
I didn't think that far.

433
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,100
I just feel it's unfair.

434
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:57,666
Unfair.

435
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,866
When the current Emperor has strong power,

436
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:05,366
everyone see him as the greatest emperor.

437
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:07,400
Now,

438
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,733
he is betrayed and isolated,

439
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,066
and you all try to

440
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:14,300
blame everything on him.

441
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,200
On him alone.

442
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,233
So that you

443
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,866
these loyal ministers and good generals

444
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:24,900
can have a new master,

445
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,233
and feel at ease,

446
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:30,066
to enjoy glory and wealth again.

447
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:32,033
Now,

448
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,233
disaster approaching,

449
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:39,766
each of you again speaks of the court and the state all day,

450
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:45,600
as if you would like to immediately tie him up

451
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:48,133
and offer him as a pledge to the Khitan ruler.

452
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,033
People must have self-awareness.

453
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,033
I know I cannot bear this world,

454
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,433
and I know who can.

455
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:04,400
But he may not be willing to bear it at this time.

456
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,233
The bell rang all night because of fire,

457
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,333
and again all this morning.

458
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:16,966
It's really a bit annoying.

459
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:18,630
Time for meal.

460
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:23,433
Quick, bring out my court rope.

461
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,466
Court rope?

462
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,233
I'll go myself.

463
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:29,960
What about your meal?

464
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:04,433
Gentlemen.

465
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:10,700
here's the Emperor's

466
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,066
Abdication Edict.

467
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:32,166
I,

468
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,466
received the grace of the late Emperor,

469
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,300
and ascended to the throne.

470
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,466
I have been diligent every day.

471
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:44,600
However,

472
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:48,500
I do not have enough wisdom and virtue

473
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,866
to take this state from my ancestors.

474
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,200
Now,

475
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:55,466
due to my incompetence,

476
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,433
royal brothers harm each other,

477
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,833
feudal lords rise to rebel,
and the clan faces crisis of perish.

478
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,600
Observing the condition of the empire,

479
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,300
I sea disasters and difficulties.

480
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,766
The empire is facing its collapse.

481
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,100
Abdication has happened in history, not in this family only.

482
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:17,200
Heaven has its way and
the authority shall change accordingly.

483
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:21,500
Heaven shall lead the empire to the competent one.

484
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:26,633
Ignorant as I am, I know the fate is changing.
So I shall yield my position to the right one,

485
00:31:34,366 --> 00:31:41,266
following the precedents of Tang, Yu, Song, and Qi,
to maintain this empire and the royal family,

486
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,666
by the instructions of the heaven.

487
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:47,466
Thus, the empire shall return to peace,
and continue to be blessed,

488
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:52,333
so that the great achievements
of the two emperors won't be destroyed.

489
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,366
I inform this to all ministers,

490
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
hoping you to understand my thoughts.

491
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:05,266
December the 17th, the third year of Kaiyun.

492
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:18,733
"To the right one."

493
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:23,900
Who is the right one?

494
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,666
Throughout history, in abdications
there must be a worthy successor.

495
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:31,600
How can there be such a vague single word 'right'?

496
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
What kind of abdication is this?

497
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,233
Minister Sang?

498
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,400
His Majesty cannot say it explicitly.

499
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,433
He is to let the ministers to decide.

500
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:44,500
Preposterous!

501
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,933
Abdication, is it an external or internal one?

502
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,100
It must be made clear.

503
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,466
How can there be an abdication
where the new monarch is decided by the ministers?

504
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:54,000
Indeed.

505
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Is it Lord Du?

506
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,700
Or the Seventh Prince?

507
00:32:58,533 --> 00:32:59,733
It should be made clear.

508
00:32:59,966 --> 00:33:00,766
Indeed.

509
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:02,166
Absurd!

510
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:06,633
How can you

511
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:08,200
act like this?

512
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,466
Hongchu.

513
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:10,960
Mind your words.

514
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,633
Lord Shuiqiu,

515
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:19,033
for forty years, have we Wuyue
been serving such a group of ministers?

516
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,000
I do not know which minister you are...

517
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:30,533
Judging by your position in the court,
you are probably a minister.

518
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:32,433
However,

519
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:34,266
I still must ask.

520
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,800
Are you truly the minister of the Emperor?

521
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:41,800
You,

522
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,300
you,

523
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,100
and you!

524
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,166
Are you truly the subjects of the Great Jin's Emperor?

525
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,200
You just stand here discussing to whom
the Emperor's throne should be abdicated?

526
00:33:58,866 --> 00:33:59,733
The Emperor,

527
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:01,600
is about to abdicate!

528
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:05,166
What you should ask, and care about,

529
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:08,800
is why the Emperor is abandoning his empire, isn't it?

530
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,433
This young lord of Wuyue,

531
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:19,000
we have encountered a great upheaval
and the situation is perilous.

532
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,766
The Emperor voluntarily abdicated.

533
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:22,433
It was truly a necessity.

534
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,033
In the court, there were no sycophantic or rebellious ones.

535
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,166
Yet chaos is approaching.

536
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,266
His Majesty's abdication was also out of
the care for the common people and the world.

537
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:38,066
What about us?

538
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,333
The Emperor abdicates, the authority changes,

539
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,433
yet not a single one in the court offered remonstrance,

540
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,560
not a single one showed any reluctance.

541
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,733
Even Jie and Zhou had ministers on their side.

542
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:59,966
Yet within this Chongyuan Hall, there are only Yi Ya and Cheng Ji,
who care nothing about the Emperor.

543
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,466
What are we supposed to do?

544
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,960
What are we, states who received
the golden edicts of the Emperor,

545
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,730
who faithfully served the legitimate dynasty
of the Central Plains, supposed to do?

546
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,966
Southern Tang and Western Shu
have their own imperial lines.

547
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:20,933
But Southern Chu, Southern Han,
and the soldiers and civilians of us Wuyue,

548
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:22,800
Where are we going?

549
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:26,800
My late Father King left this instruction:

550
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,733
"Faithfully serve the great state of the Central Plains."

551
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,966
Serve the great state.

552
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,033
The great state!

553
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,100
This...

554
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,900
is your "great"?

555
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:43,666
A "great" without sovereign or father,

556
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:45,900
without loyalty,

557
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,500
without righteousness!

558
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,066
Confucius wrote the his great book
and the rebels are afraid.

559
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Among all the rebels in this hall,

560
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,400
who dares to step forward

561
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,266
and claim the word "great"?

562
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,700
I will knock on the palace gate.

563
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,733
I will...

564
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,900
go in person

565
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,100
to ask the Emperor.

566
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,633
Hongchu.

567
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,566
I am the Inspectorate Minister of Works of Jin.

568
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:35,960
I wish to see the sovereign.

569
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:38,966
Lord Shuiqiu, you will stop me?

570
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:07,900
Ninth Prince.

571
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:11,666
Ninth Prince.

572
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,130
Ninth Prince.

573
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:17,900
Do not stop me.

574
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,200
You...

575
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:22,800
You are...

576
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,733
Thank you, Ninth Prince, for saving my life.

577
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:32,300
I will go with you.

578
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:36,400
Today, I have caused trouble again.

579
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,200
What calamity could be greater
than the capital burning?

580
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:44,966
Lord Feng has ordered us to escort you to see the Emperor,

581
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,800
so that no one's like a headless fly,

582
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,330
charging around recklessly.

583
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,133
I also wonder

584
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:53,533
how this perfectly fine capital

585
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:55,900
has fallen into such a condition.

586
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,630
We pay our respects to Your Majesty.

587
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:30,933
You...

588
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:39,533
All of you...

589
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:53,433
Propriety,

590
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,066
order,

591
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:56,500
moral tradition...

592
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,333
You,

593
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:07,100
are all here to play games with me?

594
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:13,366
We, your subjects, simply wish to ask Your Majesty,

595
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,366
why you would abandon yourself,

596
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,133
and cast aside the empire's officials and people?

597
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,633
Young man,

598
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:25,466
do you think this empire

599
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:28,733
is still the same empire from decades ago?

600
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:33,233
That empire perished long ago!

601
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,966
I will tell you what the Emperor is!

602
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:41,866
The Emperor,

603
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,166
is he who has the strongest military power!

604
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:52,800
Whoever holds the sword can become the Emperor!

605
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:57,266
Whoever wears the armor can become the Emperor!

606
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,900
You wear armor,

607
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,366
and you too can become the Emperor!

608
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,133
Take it.

609
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:42,966
Take it.

610
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,733
Yes.

611
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:56,866
You wear the armor,

612
00:40:58,766 --> 00:40:59,966
you carry the sword,

613
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:02,333
you are the Emperor.

614
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,400
The Emperor is above,

615
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,300
accept this humble man's bow.

616
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,000
This is the empire now.

617
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:21,166
Rise.

618
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,700
This is the way of the world today.

619
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,866
Where is there any right or wrong left?

620
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:30,566
No one needs them.

621
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:38,833
If you are soft-hearted,

622
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,166
you deserve to die.

623
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:50,966
Do you understand?

624
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:22,233
His Majesty has lost his mind.

625
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,400
But we still must not lose it.

626
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:32,200
Now, let us pay our last respects to His Majesty.
