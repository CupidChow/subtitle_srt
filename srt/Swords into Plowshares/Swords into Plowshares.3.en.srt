[Episode 3]

00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:38,000
[Yan Tong]

16
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:06,960
Your old servant, following
the final instructions of the late King,

17
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:14,233
requests that Sixth Prince assume
the position of Regent of the Two Armies.

18
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,530
Sixth Prince, pray restrain your grief.

19
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,833
The late King entrusted you with
the twelve prefectures of Wuyue,

20
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:29,366
its sixty-seven counties,
and its million soldiers and civilians.

21
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,600
At this moment,

22
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:37,100
you must not indulge in
childish sentimentality.

23
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:03,866
I'm so young that
my talent and knowledge are too shallow.

24
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:06,132
I'll need your help

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,300
in various affairs, Lord.

26
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,732
The late king, by his final instruction,
entrusted me with his dying charge.

27
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:20,766
How dare I not devote my very life and soul
to repay the late king?

28
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:21,833
Prince.

29
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:23,933
Huang Wei.

30
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,800
Here.

31
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,666
Help Sixth Prince move
to the side hall to rest for now.

32
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,433
Yes.

33
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,166
Hongzong.

34
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,100
You may come with me.

35
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,900
The distinction between ruler and subject
has been settled.

36
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,800
The Seventh Prince
should not accompany you now.

37
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,700
There should be dozen bolts
of raw hemp in the Laundry Court.

38
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,433
Fetch them quickly.

39
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:19,733
Yes.

40
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,100
Lord Huang is waiting.

41
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,433
Be slow and you'll be whipped.

42
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,933
Yes. Yes.

43
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:24,200
Quick! Hurry up!

44
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,300
The King has passed away.

45
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,133
So it seems

46
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,933
we have luckily escaped this calamity.

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,066
It's not that simple.

48
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,966
Now our lives

49
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,700
depend entirely on Commander He.

50
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,600
It was my negligence.

51
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,533
I had almost forgotten him.

52
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,033
I don't know when the assassin entered.

53
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,832
I will take punishment.

54
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,100
Go.

55
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,333
Yes.

56
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,000
Father,

57
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,566
it couldn't have been
an assassin from outside.

58
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,532
The murderer must be among these people.

59
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,800
Dai Yun has commanded the Inner Guard
for many years.

60
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:18,532
Placing a few men
in the First Personal Guard Regiment

61
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,433
would be as easy as turning over his hand.

62
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,200
But it couldn't be him either.

63
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,900
He has been tied up and cannot move freely.

64
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,266
Secondly, he has no reason
to kill Yan Tong.

65
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,799
To kill a witness in the Yaotai Courtyard,

66
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,966
no one would have the audacity.

67
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,900
Unless with the orders
of someone with immense power.

68
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,833
Dai Yun...

69
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,033
Father,

70
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,500
dawn is approaching.

71
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:00,300
Soon,

72
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,633
the Ministers and Marshals will all arrive.

73
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,133
We will have to open the gate.

74
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,360
Within the palace walls,

75
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,700
are there any reliable troops we can use?

76
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,400
The squad leaders and above
in the First Personal Guard Regiment

77
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:18,099
were all selected by the King...
no, by the late king himself.

78
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,833
And even they have been infiltrated.

79
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,233
Where can we find trustworthy troops?

80
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,200
Bring him into the hall.

81
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,066
Yes.

82
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,500
Marshal, What is your intention

83
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:10,924
deploying armored troops
at the palace gate?

84
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,033
Dismount.

85
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:49,633
Lower the keys.

86
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,300
Open the gates.

87
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,333
By the command of the King,

88
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,033
execute the rebel,

89
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:31,400
Dai Yun.

90
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:38,500
Backward!

91
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:39,332
Backward!

92
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:26,900
Vermin!

93
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,600
By the instructions of the late king,

94
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,866
Acting Grand Marshal, Right Guard General,

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,100
Commander of the Inner Cavalry
and Infantry Guards, Dai Yun,

96
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,800
colluded with the imperial clan,
usurped military authority,

97
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:50,133
plundered the inner treasury,
burned the palace and harmed the sovereign.

98
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,233
Dai also plotted to establish an heir,

99
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,632
deploying the personal guard's
troops and armor

100
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,176
to seize the palace

101
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
and support the Marquis of Xi'an,
Qian Hongyou

102
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:01,376
to usurp the throne,

103
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,833
Guilty of treason, Dai shall be
subjected to

104
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:05,842
public execution, three clans exterminated.

105
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,033
By the decree of the King of Wuyue,
Grand Marshal of All Forces,

106
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:13,066
August the 24th, the sixth year of Tianfu.

107
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,600
The maritime ventures are truly remarkable.

108
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,560
Dominating the commerce
in the Western Court,

109
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,309
Shanyue dare not boast of wealth
compared with your family.

110
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:25,100
You still owe me
Two hundred and fifty catties of pure gold,

111
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,600
equivalent to
forty thousand strings of coins

112
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:27,624
and eighty thousand bolts of silk.

113
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
When will you repay?

114
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,533
My family is poor.

115
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,165
When issuing rewards
to the labors on the river,

116
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,509
we offer mere ten thousand bolts
of silk, of mixed colors.

117
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,800
In Quzhou, the Western Court,

118
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,599
my daily expenses are fixed.

119
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,733
I don't need such extravagance.

120
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,533
Who said it's all for you?

121
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,333
Raising a son

122
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,033
is like throwing away a stone.

123
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,199
Earn your own bread
and other expenses yourself

124
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:54,376
through your own hands.

125
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,966
Instead, your Aunt Jinding
has a large family.

126
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,866
As a junior, would that be proper for you
to return to the island

127
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,476
without bringing something
back to help out?

128
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,333
You're right, mother.

129
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,500
I will convey your utmost sincerity
on your behalf

130
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,466
to Marshal Dai and Aunt Jinding,

131
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,333
And send daily greetings on your behalf,
so that

132
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:18,157
others will not think that
we don't know what's proper.

133
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,066
I inherit the great legacy of my ancestors,

134
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:27,165
toiling for the state,
diligent and cautious,

135
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,509
and striving for perfect governance.

136
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,600
However, the two luminaries
adorning the sky

137
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:35,009
cannot escape the cycle
of waxing and waning.

138
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,400
The four seasons of the year

139
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:39,609
cannot surpass the period
of succession and replacement.

140
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,965
The pivot of power cannot remain vacant,

141
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,933
and public affairs require an authority.

142
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:46,833
Righteousness shall be upheld.

143
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,599
There shall be reverence and harmony.

144
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,433
Diligence and tolerance shall be kept.

145
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:52,600
The strange and evil shall be rejected.

146
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:55,100
Benevolent men shall be appointed.

147
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:59,300
Grand Tutor, Deputy Military Governor
of the Two Armies, Qian Hongzuo

148
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:02,366
is intelligent, wise, brave, and resolute,
with reverence and benevolence.

149
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,466
Therefore, Hongzuo shall receive the seal
to act as Regent of the Two Armies.

150
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,680
We humbly beseech
Your Majesty's consideration.

151
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,120
[Qian Hongjun]
We humbly beseech Your Majesty's consideration,

152
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,166
to grant the ceremonial banners
according to the imperial rites,

153
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,199
and to govern the commoners, soldiers,
and people of Southeast well

154
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,266
so as to bring order to this land.

155
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,200
Be diligent and reverent.

156
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:22,900
Let the authorities implement this.

157
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,199
Wuyue cannot be
without a ruler for a single day.

158
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,700
Your subject, following the late king's
final instructions,

159
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,066
requests the Grand Tutor
to act as Regent of the Two Armies,

160
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:42,366
to manage the affairs
of the Grand Marshal's Office

161
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,089
and oversee all internal and external
military affairs.

162
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,933
Hongzuo's virtue is too shallow

163
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:53,065
to bear the responsibility
of the army and state.

164
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,199
Prince, your words are mistaken.

165
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:02,966
The late king

166
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:08,866
entrusted the two armies of the southeast
and the twelve prefectures to you.

167
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,933
You are the descendant of the late king.

168
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,233
At this critical moment
for the family and state,

169
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:17,866
how can you belittle yourself,

170
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:22,500
disobeying the late king's final command
and disappointing soldiers and people?

171
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,400
I've received great kindness
from two generations of late kings.

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,133
At this time of undecided state affairs,

173
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:37,366
how can I be ungrateful and unjust,
seeking only to protect myself?

174
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,766
Lords, ministers, where is your loyalty?

175
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,000
Your subject,
Deputy Commander of the Inner Army,

176
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:45,724
Qian Hongzong,

177
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,699
requests the Grand Tutor

178
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:48,776
to follow the late king's
final instructions

179
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,866
to act as Regent of the Two Armies,

180
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:53,433
to manage the affairs
of the Grand Marshal's Office

181
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:56,057
and oversee all military affairs.

182
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:59,366
Your subject, Pacification Commissioner
of the Western Court,

183
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,699
Acting Commander of Internal and
External Cavalry and Infantry,

184
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,876
Qian Hongjun,

185
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,133
requests the Grand Tutor to follow
the late king's final instructions

186
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,960
to act as Regent of the Two Armies,

187
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,600
to manage the affairs
of the Grand Marshal's Office

188
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:11,876
and oversee all military affairs.

189
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,433
We, your subjects, request the Grand Tutor

190
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:16,676
to follow the late king's
final instructions

191
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,733
to act as Regent of the Two Armies,

192
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,599
to manage the affairs
of the Grand Marshal's Office

193
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,124
and oversee all military affairs.

194
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,300
You were not summoned
to attend the ceremony

195
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:35,824
for the new ruler to ascend the throne?

196
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,165
I only knew Commander He before
for unparalleled martial arts.

197
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:54,000
I never expected you to scrub the floor
cleaner than most too.

198
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,966
All birds captured,
the good bow is stored away.

199
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:02,600
You exaggerate.

200
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:04,700
I am merely...

201
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:13,766
I am merely a soldier
as small as a mustard-seed.

202
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:19,165
Better to say,
"When hares die out, the hound is cooked."

203
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:21,333
Then let me ask you:

204
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:25,866
Was he...

205
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,466
a cunning hare?

206
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,333
I served him
as a personal guard for three years.

207
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:57,700
During the Dongzhou battle,
we boarded the enemy ship to fight.

208
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,366
Fire arrows set the sails ablaze,

209
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:03,833
and the mast crashed down.

210
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,233
If he had not

211
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:09,032
kicking me into the water,

212
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,032
on my grave there would be

213
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,500
a tree as thick as a bowl by now.

214
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,032
You regret it?

215
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,200
If I hadn't kill him,

216
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,533
I myself would be condemned

217
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,333
to the most severe penalty.

218
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,466
But I have went all out
to kill him, and then?

219
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:39,733
To the nobles,

220
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:41,300
ministers,

221
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,933
and royal family,

222
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:44,833
I...

223
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,933
I am merely a treacherous servant
who betrayed his master.

224
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,899
Right now,

225
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,966
allowing me to scrub the floor here

226
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:05,800
is already an immense grace.

227
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,800
How dare I even think of good jobs like

228
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,424
guarding the main hall
during court assemblies?

229
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:16,600
Do you know

230
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,866
why he died?

231
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:27,366
Come closer.

232
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,966
Because he underestimated you,

233
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,433
a soldier as small as a mustard-seed.

234
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:47,366
These nobles and marshals
in the Kingdom of Wuyue

235
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,109
have been in peace for too long.

236
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:53,466
They have probably long forgotten
what kind of world we are living in now.

237
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,733
They still think
they have everything under control,

238
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,733
without knowing that
for the past few decades,

239
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:07,265
the affairs of the world
have never truly been in their hands.

240
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:11,966
The Emperor in Chang'an,

241
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,300
needs the Yabing of Weibo.

242
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,300
Without his personal guard Yabing,

243
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:21,100
an empty Emperor will only
starve to skin and bones.

244
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:26,433
not even able to have a sip of honeyed wine
to drink when on his deathbed.

245
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,433
How pitiful.

246
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:37,966
Acting Grand Marshal, Right Guard General,

247
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:41,466
Commander of the Inner Guard Armies,
Dai Yun,

248
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,530
secretly colluded with the imperial clan,
plundered the inner treasury,

249
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:48,166
burned the palace,
and harmed the sovereign.

250
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,400
He deployed the personal guard's
troops and armor

251
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:52,708
to seize the palace

252
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,000
and support the Marquis of Xi'an,
Qian Hongyou

253
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:56,242
to usurp the throne.

254
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:59,000
Guilty of treason, Dai shall be
subjected to public execution,

255
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,076
three clans exterminated.

256
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,800
The Marquis of Xi'an, Qian Hongyou, harbors

257
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:06,909
treacherous intentions
and ambitions beyond his place,

258
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,466
and colluded with the inner army.

259
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:12,333
He shall immediately surrender
his military authority and official seals,

260
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:16,033
be dismissed from the post
of Prefect of Quzhou,

261
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,376
title of Marquis of Xi'an
and its associated emoluments revoked.

262
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,700
He is to be imprisoned.

263
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:23,200
This is proclaimed to the empire,
so that all may know.

264
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,533
Seize them!

265
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,560
Wait a moment.

266
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:30,233
Ninth Prince.

267
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:31,866
What are you doing?

268
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,866
Eldest Brother.

269
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,500
You claim this
is Father King's final instruction.

270
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,300
Do you have evidence?

271
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,033
The instruction bears the late king's seal.

272
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:45,433
Ninth Prince.

273
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,265
What more evidence do you need?

274
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:51,000
Then why are there no signatures or

275
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:53,176
endorsements from
the chancellors and senior advisors?

276
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,700
Moreover, Father's instructions have always

277
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:57,142
been handwritten by Academician Yuan.

278
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:59,433
Why is this one not in Yuan's handwriting?

279
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,700
Ninth Prince, do not be reckless.

280
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,100
This is a matter of state.

281
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,966
A young man like you don't understand.

282
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,300
Brother, you are mistaken.

283
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,033
You hold a yellow silk scroll,
speaking with imperial authority,

284
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,266
intending to strip the Marquis of Xi'an
of his military command,

285
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,176
position, noble title,
and even to imprison him.

286
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,830
On this instruction, there is
neither the handwriting

287
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,754
of the academician nor the signatures

288
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,000
of the chancellors and senior advisors.

289
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,265
How do we know it was not you these people
who murdered the late king,

290
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,733
forge an edict to seize the army
and harm my third brother?

291
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:29,466
You!

292
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,166
No need to argue with him.

293
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,433
Just take him away.

294
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:36,433
This man is the Master of
the Shanyue House, a Southern Tang spy.

295
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,800
Why is he here?

296
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,166
Is the instruction you proclaim
truly Father King's will,

297
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:44,233
or the will of an enemy spy?

298
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:56,300
Defying the king's command
is an unpardonable crime.

299
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,633
Seize them all.

300
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,533
Go!

301
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:03,533
Take the Ninth Prince and Qian Hongyou
into custody.

302
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,400
Nobody move!

303
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:05,733
Everyone don't move!

304
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,632
I am the ninth son of the King of Wuyue,

305
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,500
Marshal of All Armies Under Heaven,

306
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,233
a direct descendant of the Qian clan,

307
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,466
Right Commander
of the Inner Army's General Staff.

308
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,065
Ninth Prince.

309
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,166
If anyone take another step forward,

310
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,000
I will end my own life right here.

311
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:21,566
Those who plotted against my life
are Du Zhaoda

312
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,866
and Cheng Zhaoyue.

313
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,400
You are all accomplices.

314
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:28,466
This grave crime,
shall have your three clans exterminated.

315
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:38,400
The Ninth Prince refused to obey the order,
drawing his blade in defiance.

316
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,933
So you just came back like this?

317
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:45,100
The Ninth Prince is a close relative
of the royal clan.

318
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,300
I dared not act arbitrarily.

319
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:57,233
Academician Yuan,
how should I deal with this do you think?

320
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:10,333
Both the Third Prince and the Ninth Prince
are royal family members.

321
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:13,200
This is a family matter for you,

322
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:15,924
and we outside ministers
should not discuss this.

323
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,933
Lord Hu,

324
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,033
as the late king's regent,

325
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,800
do you have any advice for me?

326
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,466
Last night,
the Lichun Courtyard caught fire,

327
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,500
the late king passed away,
and a sudden rebellion erupted.

328
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,500
Friend and foe were indistinguishable.

329
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,100
This old man had no choice but to execute Dai Yun.

330
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:42,400
In extraordinary times, actions are taken out of necessity,

331
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,100
and I cannot follow the laws of peaceful times.

332
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,133
I beg your understanding.

333
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:57,832
Is Lord Hu suggesting that
I set the Third and Ninth Prince free?

334
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:03,266
You should know the difference between
the Third Prince and the Ninth Prince.

335
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:08,533
The Third Prince has long been in the camps,
with the soldiers respecting him.

336
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:12,800
Moreover, with Dai Yun already dead,
enmity has been established.

337
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:15,233
There is no turning back.

338
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:21,033
If handled improperly,

339
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,833
I'm afraid the state may face a internal threat.

340
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,300
As a ruler,

341
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:32,066
one cannot let personal feelings effect state affairs.

342
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:40,765
The decision must be decisive and resolute;

343
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,332
one must absolutely not show womanly compassion.

344
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,100
Let the Eldest Prince

345
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:50,860
interrogate the Third Prince.

346
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:18,400
Third Prince.

347
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:21,132
Father King...

348
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:34,233
Hongchu was extremely tired

349
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,766
and fell asleep.

350
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:39,133
He will be fine.

351
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:41,199
That's good.

352
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,500
Do not disturb him.

353
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:49,533
So, where are we going?

354
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,233
The Censorate,

355
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,666
or the Ministry of Justice?

356
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:55,866
The Inner Surveillance Office.

357
00:25:57,733 --> 00:26:01,332
Well enough. At least not I'm not asked to commit suicide right now.

358
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:02,533
Third Prince, I...

359
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,280
Do I need to be tied up?

360
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,633
If you are willing to obey, of course not.

361
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:11,065
Let's go.

362
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:46,433
Seventh Brother.

363
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:36,533
Have you figured out why you were wrong?

364
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,832
Now that Sixth Brother is the King,
there's no more brotherhood.

365
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:44,733
Anyone who still utters the word 'brother' at this time

366
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,800
is committing a grave sin and
deserves to be cut into a thousand pieces.

367
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,233
Where were you

368
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:53,300
last night?

369
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,933
Sixth Brother became the King today.

370
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,833
Last night, he was not yet the King.

371
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,800
What happened last night should have been asked by Father.

372
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
He asked.

373
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:06,800
He asked,

374
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:09,466
"Where is Hongzong?"

375
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:13,066
I replied, "Waiting outside the hall for orders.

376
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,800
"Not announced, he dared not come in."

377
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:16,866
He then asked,

378
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:19,933
"What about Hongchu?"

379
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:22,466
I replied,

380
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:25,266
"He might be asleep.

381
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:27,733
Should I summon him?"

382
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:31,333
Father King said,

383
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,133
"Children need their sleep.

384
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,133
Hongchu has always been playful.

385
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,000
He might have been tired out
playing during the day.

386
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,533
Let him sleep."

387
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,033
Why did you lie to him?

388
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,433
I clearly wasn't there.

389
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:54,930
You should ask yourself.

390
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,166
Yesterday,

391
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:57,866
when he passed away,

392
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,833
he was still thinking of his sons.

393
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,433
At that time, did you, as a son,

394
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,866
remember old father suffering long-term illness?

395
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:25,933
Father.

396
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,733
Father.

397
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,733
This place,

398
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:44,600
after all, is for guilty members of the royal family.

399
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:48,800
Compared to the Ministry of Justice, it's much better.

400
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,200
Is Hongchu alright?

401
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:57,500
He was punished by kneeling in the Fengxian Hall for half a day.

402
00:29:58,733 --> 00:29:59,666
That's all.

403
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,733
It's fine.

404
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:02,866
It's fine.

405
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,233
Do you want me to help you

406
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:07,033
to do something?

407
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,033
Can you?

408
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:18,933
Eldest Brother, even you
are not going save Third Brother?

409
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:22,033
Hongchu,

410
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,466
your literary talents are not outstanding,

411
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:29,765
but when it comes to mathematics,
even skilled old accountants have to admit defeat.

412
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,333
You can calculate such big numbers,

413
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,333
yet why are you so confused about the life and social affairs here?

414
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:42,200
When can you grow up a bit more?

415
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,933
I truly don't understand these affairs.

416
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,833
I only know he is innocent.

417
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:49,133
Sixth Brother know that clearly,

418
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,466
but he insists on killing Third Brother.

419
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:56,033
You know even more clearly, but you arrested Third Brother
to show your contribution to Sixth Brother.

420
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,833
All the ministers at court,

421
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,533
knows that Third Brother is actually innocent.

422
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:03,265
It's only because Sixth Brother

423
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:06,233
scruples his military power that he arrested Third Brother.

424
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:09,800
Yet no one dares to utter a word to save Third Brother's life.

425
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:13,800
If that's called life and social affairs, and growing-up,

426
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,400
I would rather never grow up, and never
understand so-called life and social affairs.

427
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:22,233
Hongchu,

428
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:27,533
Eldest Prince is not unwilling to save
the Marquis of Xi'an, but unable to.

429
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:33,433
As you yourself said,

430
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:37,300
the Marquis of Xi'an's crime lies not in what he did,

431
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:41,800
but in the military power he holds
over the Archery and Cavalry Units.

432
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,566
If that is a crime, then among the Qian clan's descendants,
the one with the greatest crime

433
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,300
is not the Marquis of Xi'an.

434
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,866
Eldest Prince himself bears the responsibility
of Commander of the Inner Army.

435
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,966
His crime can be greater than that of the Marquis of Xi'an.

436
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,233
Think about it.

437
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:10,399
It's impossible to save the Third Prince in Hangzhou.

438
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
You mean...

439
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,166
I didn't say anything.

440
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,533
This mission is critical and cannot afford any mistakes.

441
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:53,265
Prince, rest assured. I have served you for many years
and understand the importance.

442
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,166
Visiting the capital firstly is to present the memorial of mourning,

443
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,866
secondly to investigate mass condition,

444
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:07,466
and thirdly, to pay respects to the important ministers.

445
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,500
Especially Lord Feng.

446
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:13,066
You must meet him in person and
convey my regards on my behalf.

447
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,166
I humbly obey your command.

448
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:20,300
Since Lord Shuiqiu is the envoy, according to convention,

449
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,200
he should be appointed as Judge of the Grand Marshal's Office.

450
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:25,566
You are right.

451
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,333
It should be.

452
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,233
I

453
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,566
thank you respectfully.

454
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:51,633
Things got a bit hard.

455
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,832
If Qian Yuanguan were still alive, sending a letter over,

456
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,433
considering Elder Sister,

457
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,900
the authority of Wuyue wouldn't make things
difficult for their Third Prince.

458
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:05,900
All of you, listen carefully.

459
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,033
Tomorrow,

460
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:09,966
I will enter the Qiantang estuary

461
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,766
to ask the Qian family of Wuyue to give my son back.

462
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,133
The ships you brought this time,

463
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:19,132
whether they are fu ships, guang ships, or sha ships,

464
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,700
I will use them all.

465
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,866
I need not only the ships,

466
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,766
but also the men you brought with.

467
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,766
They can show off our strength.

468
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,799
Pass my order:

469
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:34,100
Anyone who enters Qiantang with me this time
will be exempt from all flag fees next year.

470
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:37,833
Those visiting here for the first time
will each receive a Single Dragon Flag.

471
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:41,266
Those who have had Single Dragon Flags
will all be promoted with Double Dragon Flags.

472
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,466
In that case I'm afraid there will be over a hundred ships.

473
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,333
There can't be too many ships.

474
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:53,299
If the bad boy of the old bastard dares to harm my son,

475
00:34:54,233 --> 00:35:00,233
I will cut off the Qiantang River and split this
unreasonable Wuyue Kindom into two halves.

476
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:33,200
Gentlemen

477
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,266
Who can tell me

478
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:39,266
what exactly is going on?

479
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,630
Reporting to the Regent

480
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:50,233
Lady Yu of Huanglong Island Was the widow of
the late Marshal's Mansion Protocol Officer Lord Sun Tingfu.

481
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:56,400
Although for decades she occupies the islands and does not
submit to royal authority, she has no act of transgression.

482
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,966
Rashly leading her fleet to invade the Western Court,

483
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:04,232
I'm afraid she comes for the matter of
Dai Yun the Marquis of Xi'an.

484
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,166
Du Zhaoda.

485
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:11,166
I'm here.

486
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:13,833
You go on my behalf to ask Lady Yu,

487
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:17,433
what is her intention rashly mobilizing troops.

488
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,800
Such sea bandits have long refused to submit to royal authority.

489
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:22,165
No good asking.

490
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,000
Then you mean,

491
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,600
armed conflict is inevitable?

492
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,066
Exactly.

493
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:46,633
Then you, board the ship now
and arrange a battle with Lady Yu.

494
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:48,400
I

495
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:49,500
I, I

496
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:50,100
Go

497
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:51,133
I

498
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,333
I, I

499
00:36:53,233 --> 00:36:53,700
I

500
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:54,500
Regent,

501
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:56,533
please spare him a little.

502
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,765
Even Young Du is incompetent,

503
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:03,633
please at least preserve a little dignity for Old Lord Du.

504
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,533
Gentlemen, you receive the ranks and salaries of Wuyue.

505
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:23,933
Now that the state faces calamity,
who can go on my behalf to ask Lady Yu her intentions?

506
00:37:35,866 --> 00:37:38,566
I am willing to accept the command to board on your behalf,

507
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,100
to meet Lady Yu face to face.

508
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:42,766
What

509
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,033
is your name?

510
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:47,900
Reporting to the Regent, I am Cheng Zhaoyue,
an executive of the Shanyue House.

511
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,233
Graced by the late king, I was granted the honorary title of Chengfeng Lang.

512
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:03,233
From now on, you are no longer
the eighth-rank Chengfeng Lang.

513
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:06,266
You are the Inner Surveillance Commissioner of the Inner Army.

514
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,933
Change into purple robes with a golden fish pouch.

515
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:12,300
Go on my behalf to ask Lady Yu what exactly she intends to do.

516
00:38:13,566 --> 00:38:14,765
Thank you for your trust.

517
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:19,433
I will spare no effort to overcome all difficulties
and fulfill my mission without disgracing it.

518
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:22,700
Lord Du.

519
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:24,266
I'm here.

520
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:26,366
I need to borrow your clothes.

521
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,933
Cheng Zhaoyue pays respect to Lady Yu.

522
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,233
Great Executive.

523
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,666
The Shanyue House is renowned throughout Wuyue.

524
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,299
Wenxiu and Master Cheng have long admired each other.

525
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,566
But I did not know when you also became
the Inner Surveillance Commissioner

526
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,333
in the service of the King of Wuyue.

527
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:12,265
This humble Cheng has been the Inner Surveillance
Commissioner for less than a quarter of an hour.

528
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:15,000
I got it.

529
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:20,732
So among the nobles, as well as civil and military
officials of Wuyue, one one has courage.

530
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:24,700
I couldn't agree more, Great Executive.

531
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:28,733
What plans does the new ruler have?

532
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,766
Master Cheng, please speak plainly.

533
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:34,633
That also depends on

534
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,566
what plans Lady Yu and the Great Executive have.

535
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:44,433
Qian's ninth son owes the Huanglong House
two hundred and fifty catties of pure gold.

536
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:47,366
I'm afraid the esteemed ruler is too miserly to pay it.

537
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:48,866
Therefore,

538
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:51,600
We have come in person to collect it.

539
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:53,933
Well...

540
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:56,500
How did this come about?

541
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,600
This transaction does have a witness.

542
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,399
Master Li of the Qinhuai House is the witness.

543
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:07,165
This Master Li,

544
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:09,933
Master Cheng, I bet you know him.

545
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:16,133
Only two hundred and fifty catties of gold?

546
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:19,633
No need for the King's approval, I can make the promise with you.

547
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:21,100
Anything else?

548
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:23,400
Give back my son,

549
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:24,633
and

550
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:31,066
corpses and coffins of Dai's family members.

551
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,200
Then I will withdraw,

552
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:34,166
and from now on

553
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:40,000
the Qian stays on land, while the Sun on the sea,
with no further connection.

554
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:41,933
I understand.

555
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,700
I shall take my leave now.

556
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,033
There is one hour and a half until noon.

557
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:48,766
Tell Qian Hongzuo,

558
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:52,433
if I don't see my son before noon,

559
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,466
my first step is to capture his Qiantang Naval Camp.

560
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:05,866
Regent

561
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,000
I believe in state affairs,

562
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,233
one should not act like a merchant

563
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,100
Sixth Brother, there are at least a hundred or so ships and vessels on the river.

564
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:24,833
Two hundred and fifty catties of pure gold is not unacceptable.

565
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,000
If we don't give it to her, Lady Yu probably won't withdraw her troops.

566
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:34,600
I request the Regent to issue an edict strip Qian Hongyou of his titles and stipends for treason,

567
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:38,100
deprive him of the royal name and demote him to a commoner.

568
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,933
Hongyou's original name is Sun Chengzuo,

569
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:42,133
violating Regent's name taboo.

570
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:49,700
His fault lies in overstepping, so his name shall be changed
into Sun Ben to highlight his transgression.

571
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:55,300
The Regent can dispatch Sun Ben to board the ship
and denounce them with righteousness.

572
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:59,066
They will surely be utterly ashamed and retreat.

573
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,666
What do you think, Eldest Brother?

574
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:06,300
Academician Yuan's proposal is prudent and statesmanlike.

575
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,700
I second his proposal.

576
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,133
We shall proceed as he suggested.
