1
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,971
[Episode 2]

2
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,650
What a quick ship!
[Qian Hong Chu]

3
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,033
It's a swift coastal skiff.

4
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:31,400
At this distance,
they can use arrows and crossbows

5
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,866
to nail us to death one by one on this ship.

6
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:40,100
Which Master of Qinhuai House is present?

7
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,633
Please come aboard for a talk.

8
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,333
This is Black Cloud Longsword.
[Yu Wen Xiu]

9
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,468
The sword is his life.
[Great Executive of Huanglong House]

10
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:16,300
It must never be held in another's hand.

11
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,933
Let him hold it.

12
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:29,666
Li Yuan Qing of Qinhuai House
pays respects to the Great Executive.

13
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,100
So, it is Grand Master Li in person.

14
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,033
Please forgive my discourtesy.

15
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,522
My visit is indeed presumptuous.

16
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,466
You are not to blame.

17
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:47,533
A state has its laws,
and a family has its rules.

18
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,300
Though the sea is shrouded in storms,

19
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,633
it is not a place beyond the law.

20
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,700
I have roamed the world,

21
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,355
without receiving a single coin
from the Kingdom of Wuyue,

22
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,266
or a single grain from the King.

23
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:01,933
As to the laws of Wuyue,

24
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:05,100
what have they to do with Qinhuai House?

25
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,233
Though Huanglong House may be insignificant,

26
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:10,166
we still have eight warships,
sixteen swift skiffs,

27
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,533
and countless cargo vessels,

28
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:15,400
traveling to and from Goryeo, Japan,
the Ryukyu Islands, and Srivijaya.

29
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,100
On the East Sea,

30
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,133
we are the law.

31
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
You may take the ships,

32
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,000
but not the men and cargo.

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,213
- Guards!
- 500 catties of pure gold.

34
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:31,833
I'll buy these men and cargo.

35
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,033
800.

36
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,466
600.

37
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,900
750.

38
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,500
The world has been fragmented
and in chaos for at least five decades.

39
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,833
No one has had an easy life.

40
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,133
650 catties.

41
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,500
Indeed.

42
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,366
We're all making a living in troubled times.

43
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:49,033
Every household has its own difficulties.

44
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,700
700 catties.

45
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,166
If even a tiny fraction is missing,

46
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,633
you may return and prepare for battle.

47
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:59,033
700 catties it shall be.

48
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,933
As for that lad outside,
give him to me as a bonus.

49
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,233
1,000 catties.

50
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,300
I'll buy the men and cargo.

51
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,866
750 catties for the men and cargo.

52
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,800
250, for myself.

53
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,133
I am the young master of Shanyue House.

54
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,900
These Southern Tang bandits captured me
and demanded the cargo as ransom.

55
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,195
Great Executive, just detain
the men, the ship, and the cargo.

56
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:26,700
Then send me along to Hangzhou.

57
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,900
You'll get a thousand catties of pure gold,
not a single speck will be missing.

58
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,000
Great Executive, this kid is talking nonsense.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,666
Don't be deceived by him.

60
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,933
Sailing on the sea, honesty comes first.

61
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,466
700 catties of pure gold. It's settled.

62
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,600
Great Executive, you're truly
a gentleman with virtue.

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,733
You have my admiration.

64
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:52,633
The boy outside, 250 catties.

65
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,366
Do you want to buy him?

66
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,246
I'll raise you!

67
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:57,333
300 catties.

68
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,166
I'll buy myself.

69
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,000
It's 300 now.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,833
Do you want to bid on?

71
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,133
What is your connection with Cheng Zhao Yue?

72
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:18,166
Cheng Zhao Yue has two daughters.

73
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,700
One is 16, and the other is 12.

74
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,333
He does have a son,

75
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,400
still in swaddling clothes.

76
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,215
Who exactly are you?

77
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:31,733
Why do you claim to be
the young master of Shanyue?

78
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,333
I...

79
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,446
Uncle is asking the questions.

80
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:37,633
You'd better tell the truth.

81
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:40,733
If you tell one lie,
I'll cut off one of your ears.

82
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,366
If you tell two lies, I'll cut off both.

83
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,500
If you tell three lies,

84
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,933
your nose will be gone.

85
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,433
I'm cold.

86
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,233
That's the truth.

87
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:54,900
But my head is hot.

88
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,200
[Huanglong Island, The East Sea]

89
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,933
Armor.

90
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,333
Mountain-patterned armor,
black-hammer armor, both available.

91
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,266
I even saw a set of Mingguang armor.

92
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:22,382
Li Yuan Qing...
[Eldest Lady Yu, Grand Master, Huanglong House]

93
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:25,066
He was a Southern Tang spy leader,

94
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:27,100
and commander of the Black Cloud Troops.

95
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,700
Why would he go through such trouble
to travel far across the waves

96
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,450
to come to Wuyue to buy armor?

97
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,600
Southern Tang's troops aren't so poor
as to be in such a state.

98
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,166
He must be selling armor on behalf of others.

99
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,166
Qinhuai House doesn't need to buy armor.

100
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,362
He bought all the people.

101
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:47,633
He's trying to keep you from
finding out the supplier's identity.

102
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,366
Maybe we can ask that kid when he wakes up.

103
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:52,866
This kid resembles someone.

104
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,133
250, you're awake.

105
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:19,900
Drink this.

106
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,333
What time is it?

107
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,866
Where I am?
[Sun Tai Zhen, childhood name Zhen Niang]

108
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:26,400
You had a fever all night.
[Lady Yu's daughter]

109
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,553
You've sweat a lot.

110
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:29,086
It stinks in here.

111
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:31,493
This bed is probably ruined.

112
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,080
Uncle prescribed the medicine for you.

113
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,733
Take it and you'll feel better.

114
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:53,293
Have this. It's sweet.

115
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,720
You must be hungry.

116
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,753
Your food is outside.

117
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:01,166
I'll go get it.

118
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:19,866
Lord Shui Qiu.

119
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:23,133
Lord Shui Qiu.
[Shui Qiu Zhao Quan, Commander of Liaoqian]

120
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,966
I'm Xue Wen.

121
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you sure?

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,733
Was it truly a swift coastal skiff?

123
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:34,466
Absolutely. A swift skiff.

124
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,866
The Mingzhou Navy?

125
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,166
No.

126
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,600
The Mingzhou Navy wouldn't
appear there at that hour.

127
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,300
Then who could it be?

128
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:46,540
Huanglong Island.
[Qian Hong You]

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,689
As brothers, the Sixth Prince
is so proper and sensible,

130
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:56,266
and the Seventh is so alert and reasonable.

131
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:01,200
Yet, the Ninth Prince never
puts anyone's mind at ease.

132
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,700
Talking about this now is useless.

133
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,100
It seems this time,

134
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,133
you and I will have to leave for this affair.

135
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:13,466
Do you know the identity of Li Yuan Qing?

136
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:15,600
The great proprietor of Qinhuai House
in Southern Tang.

137
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,366
How do you know?

138
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,100
I overheard your conversation on the ship.

139
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,866
Why were you on Qinhuai House's ship?

140
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:26,233
Can I... refuse to answer this question?

141
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:27,500
Then answer this one.

142
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,593
Do you know who the cargo vessel
that night belonged to?

143
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,600
Shanyue House.

144
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,613
How do you know?

145
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:37,666
Can you tell me?

146
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,033
Yes. I guessed.

147
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,900
You fool.

148
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,266
Then make a guess.

149
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:53,233
What kind of goods
were they trading that night?

150
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,033
Well...

151
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,600
I really have no clue.

152
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,766
I will tell you then.

153
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:01,400
They were trading armor.

154
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,666
What was exposed is no ordinary item.

155
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,866
You...

156
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,366
It was armor.

157
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:14,066
An official family hides one set,
and they'll face a grave crime of treason.

158
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:18,433
If the theft and sale of armor is exposed,
it warrants death by a thousand cuts.

159
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:22,166
All men in the family will be killed,
and women will become public courtesans.

160
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,666
So, you mean...

161
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,133
the old master's investigating this?
[Du Zhao Da]

162
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:30,466
It might not be that soon.

163
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,400
We just have to act swiftly.

164
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,060
There'll still be time to remedy matters.

165
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,040
Marshal.

166
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,200
[Dai Yun]

167
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,266
Anything different about the rewards
issued from the treasury this time?

168
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,433
No, nothing.

169
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:03,733
They seem more fitting than before.

170
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:06,066
More fitting than before?

171
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,500
What do you mean?

172
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,266
The rewards issued from the treasury
were often either black or gray.

173
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,500
But this time, it's bright red.

174
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,233
The color is so vibrant and beautiful.

175
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:22,000
Take it home, and mothers and wives
can make clothes from it.

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,100
Wearing such robes makes one very dignified.

177
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,833
Were all of them red?

178
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,900
We in the Central Guard
all received bright red.

179
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,500
I heard that some other units got green,

180
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,233
some blue, and also black and gray.

181
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:40,766
So, it seems they are all mixed colors.

182
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,266
Thank you for the report.

183
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,733
You may leave.

184
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,666
I'll take my leave.

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,800
That scoundrel He Cheng Xun!

186
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:01,433
He sure thinks himself bold.

187
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:15,800
[Yan Tong, Commander of the Second Unit
of the Imperial Household Guards]

188
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,066
Yan the Third, you mad?

189
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,666
How dare you storm the treasury!

190
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,433
Do you have a death wish?

191
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,300
Listen up, all of you!

192
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,766
In this courtyard,

193
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,133
it is Commander He and the First Unit
who are in charge.

194
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:36,089
Our only task is to lock up all the
account rooms and warehouses.

195
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,700
Then we'll withdraw outside the courtyard.

196
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,500
We only need to guard the perimeter,

197
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,233
allowing no one in, and no one out.

198
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:46,766
Before noon tomorrow,

199
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:52,366
if a single mouse runs out,
or an ant crawls in,

200
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,466
it will be our fault.

201
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,933
- Yes, sir.
- Yan Tong!

202
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:59,366
I will report this sealing
of the treasury immediately!

203
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,833
There's no need for that.

204
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:08,413
Old Marshal.

205
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:12,202
Tomorrow morning, I have arranged with
the Prefect of the Eastern Court

206
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:13,980
to thoroughly search the treasury.

207
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,333
All of the the accounts,
receipts, and inventory,

208
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,600
shall be sealed from this moment on.

209
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:24,666
After tomorrow's search, inspection, and audit,

210
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,033
I will report to the Great King in person.

211
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,233
Then, whoever deserves death
will lose his head.

212
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,400
Proceed.

213
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,985
[Accounts]

214
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,700
This old bastard acted too suddenly,

215
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,133
leaving no room for maneuver.

216
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:05,494
Everything else's not an issue.

217
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:07,100
But the armor hasn't been replenished yet.

218
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,266
There's no way to balance the accounts
if the checks go on tomorrow.

219
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:14,533
This old executioner
is trying to put me to death.

220
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:20,533
What if we break open the account room locks
and balance the accounts?

221
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:26,100
What a brilliant plan.

222
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,133
How did you come up with it?

223
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,333
Newly made accounts can be detected,

224
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,100
and on top of that,
if you break the locks open,

225
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,033
aren't you just declaring yourself guilty?

226
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,533
There's no way to hide.

227
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,902
With all rooms locked,

228
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:48,700
I can neither do the accounts,
nor replenish the armor.

229
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,933
Do we just sit here and wait for punishment?

230
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:54,233
I have a plan.

231
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:59,666
I just don't know
if you are brave enough for it.

232
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:05,666
A knife is at our throat.
What else is there to fear?

233
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,533
Come closer.

234
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,200
250.

235
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,553
I raised the price.

236
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:32,080
300.

237
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,100
I don't care.

238
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,653
You're 250.

239
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:37,333
What do you want?

240
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,166
My mother and uncle
wants to invite you to the front hall.

241
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:45,433
Didn't we meet during the day?

242
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,066
They've asked, and I've answered.

243
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,433
What else is there?

244
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,500
This is something different.

245
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,200
How is it different?

246
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,033
My elder brother has returned.

247
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,633
He wants to see you.

248
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,200
Your... elder brother?

249
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,733
Lord Shui Qiu.

250
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:21,779
Third Brother.

251
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:30,166
Can Hong You bring Hong Chu back?

252
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,900
He certainly can.

253
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,700
Rest assured.

254
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:44,113
[Lady Wu, Qian Hong Chu's mother]

255
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:49,300
Will Lady Yu take her anger out on Hong Chu?

256
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,066
Just relax. She's not that kind of person.

257
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,666
Let's rest early.

258
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,266
I'm afraid my health
won't allow me to stay up late.

259
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:02,900
Great King!

260
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,266
Great King, an emergency!

261
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:08,300
Great King!

262
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,633
What happened?

263
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,733
Great King!

264
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,833
Open the door!

265
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,200
What's wrong?

266
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,100
Lichun Courtyard! The inner treasury!

267
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,401
Lichun Courtyard is on fire!
[Huang Wei, Deputy Director of the Eight Halls]

268
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,033
Quick!

269
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,466
This rascal doesn't ever speak the truth.

270
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,766
He truly has his father's blood.

271
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,180
Madam, that comment is not very fair.

272
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,969
I didn't know that the famous
Lady Master of Huanglong House

273
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:54,233
is my third brother's birth mother.

274
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,733
The Great Executive also never told me
that you knew my father.

275
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:02,300
Seeing the Great Executive
seizing the ship and killing the boatmen,

276
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,900
my heart almost jumped out of my chest.

277
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,220
I truly dared not act without caution.

278
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,633
Your caution is not wrong.

279
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:14,120
Had I known earlier where you were from,

280
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,233
I might have thrown you into the sea.

281
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:20,186
I wouldn't have kept you here
for you to run your mouth.

282
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:22,573
- Mother.
- Enough.

283
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:26,033
I won't ramble on with you youngsters.

284
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,466
I am tired and need to rest.

285
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:33,213
Let's leave matters to be discussed tomorrow.

286
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,133
We bid thee farewell.

287
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,426
All right.

288
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:42,353
You brothers can talk.

289
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:44,080
I am also tired.

290
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,633
Zhen Niang, A'You. Accompany me back to rest.

291
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,366
Yes, Uncle.

292
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:54,559
We bid thee farewell.

293
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,100
Third Brother.

294
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,300
I'll deal with you later.

295
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,786
Who is on duty today?

296
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:40,386
Who is it?

297
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:43,380
Great King, today is an even-numbered day.

298
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,366
It should be Lord Hu's turn
to be on duty in the inner guard.

299
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,113
Where is He Cheng Xun?

300
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:56,643
Tell that scoundrel to get out here now!

301
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:59,353
[Hu Jing, Secretary, Ministry of Works]

302
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:01,183
I...

303
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,013
I...

304
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:08,033
I pay my respects.

305
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,000
Yan Tong?

306
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,133
Why is it you?

307
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:13,740
My Lord, I was at the side wing
fighting the fire.

308
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,580
A few spots still need to be extinguished.

309
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,080
I mean, why are you here?

310
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,566
Where is He Cheng Xun?

311
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:23,533
Lord, this fire broke out suddenly.

312
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:28,080
I have been fighting the fire,
and I have not seen Commander He.

313
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,713
Seize him.

314
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:31,200
Lord...

315
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,993
Spare my life!

316
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:34,153
I've been wronged!

317
00:21:34,153 --> 00:21:38,466
I followed Marshal Dai's military order
to seal off Lichun Courtyard.

318
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:42,333
Otherwise, even with the greatest courage,
I would not dare to act on my own.

319
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,666
I've been wronged! Lord, I've been wronged!

320
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,900
Your Majesty, shall we summon a palanquin?

321
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,033
Lord.

322
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,986
Great King, I'm here.

323
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:28,533
A fire broke out in the palace.

324
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:32,500
Losing few side courtyards
is not of great importance.

325
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,833
Notify everyone inside and outside
not to act rashly.

326
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,366
Anyone who spreads rumors shall be...

327
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,546
beheaded.

328
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:45,133
Understood.

329
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,200
Great King!

330
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,000
Great King!

331
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,020
What's the situation?

332
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,444
The palace is not yet under martial law.

333
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,040
It is the perfect time to escape.

334
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,133
Delay another half an hour
and it will be too late.

335
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:30,973
So, there's no better time to leave than now?

336
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:34,033
Commander He, did you see something?

337
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:38,346
Lord Hu just passed by
carrying the King on his back.

338
00:23:38,346 --> 00:23:40,073
Yan Tong was apprehended, mouth gagged.

339
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:41,840
Presumably, he hasn't been interrogated yet.

340
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,273
If he doesn't ask now, he will soon.

341
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:46,000
Let's go quickly.

342
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,920
Carrying on the back?

343
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,780
Exactly.

344
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,433
I'm afraid he's not well.

345
00:23:54,833 --> 00:24:00,266
If he's really unwell,
then that would be great for us.

346
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,040
What on earth is happening?

347
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,066
Great King!

348
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,866
What's the matter with him?

349
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:13,000
Quick, quick!

350
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,372
Madam.

351
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,080
Madam, please forgive my impropriety.

352
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,700
Please move to the side hall to rest.

353
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:28,660
Madam, please don't worry.

354
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,293
Tomorrow...

355
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:35,133
I will certainly shoulder
the responsibility for this.

356
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,133
Find a reliable person.

357
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:53,120
Summon two palace physicians
to Yaotai Courtyard.

358
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,466
Yes.

359
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,820
Be extremely cautious.

360
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,346
Be careful.

361
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,293
Do not leak any information.

362
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:01,633
Understood.

363
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:06,866
Hu Jin Si has always been astute and decisive.

364
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,446
It's impossible to deceive him.

365
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:15,413
If that's the case, let's disperse
from the palace before anything happens.

366
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,466
Return and wait for your death.

367
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,353
Sir, how confident are you with your plan?

368
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,453
If the King's health problem is not serious,

369
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,966
there's only a 20-percent chance of success.

370
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:31,713
If he falls ill and never recovers...

371
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,366
Then what?

372
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:43,666
There is still an 80-percent chance.

373
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,066
Be honest.

374
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,953
Reporting to the Supervisor,

375
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,473
the King's pulse is extremely faint.

376
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,513
It feels rootless.

377
00:25:58,513 --> 00:25:59,980
Speak plainly.

378
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,100
Yes.

379
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,766
This "cauldron-boiling" sign is the first
of the seven fatal pulses in medicine.

380
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:07,953
The King...

381
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:09,900
I'm afraid...

382
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,586
The cause of illness?

383
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:18,233
Since the Filial and Devoted Crown Prince
passed away last year,

384
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,706
grief has been in the King's heart,
damaging his lung meridian.

385
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:24,040
In winter, he caught a cold,
which lingered for nearly a hundred days.

386
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,853
His health was already crumbling.

387
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:27,853
The deep-seated illness entered his organs.

388
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:32,000
He was suddenly startled,
and it all erupted at once tonight.

389
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:39,333
Is there any way to save him?

390
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,033
- We are incompetent.
- We are incompetent.

391
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:48,746
Listen, all of you!

392
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,000
The King is critically ill.

393
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,060
There is suspicion and fear.

394
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,080
The situation is dire.

395
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,000
I need you to make the Great King
wake up by whatever means.

396
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,266
Reporting to the Supervisor,

397
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:09,346
if we use gold needles on the Baihui,
Sishencong, and Shenting points,

398
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:11,973
we might make the King wake up briefly.

399
00:27:11,973 --> 00:27:15,500
However, this method stimulates vitality
and accelerates the meridians.

400
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,980
It's easy to get a breath of life,
but it will be extremely difficult to sustain.

401
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,686
I understand. Use the needles.

402
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:24,500
The needles...

403
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,746
I will take responsibility.

404
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,280
You will not be held accountable.
Use the needles.

405
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,833
Yes.

406
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,193
Great King.

407
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:01,666
What time is it now?

408
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:04,100
Just past the sixth mark of the Zi hour.

409
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,733
I...

410
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:10,600
How much time do I have left?

411
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:19,733
Let me prostrate myself and beg Your Majesty
to settle important matters.

412
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:29,073
Lord, stay.

413
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:35,533
Everyone else, leave.

414
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,666
Commander of the Capital Archery
and Cavalry Army,

415
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,966
Marquis of Xi'an, Qian Hong You,
is talented in both civil and military matters.

416
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,563
His knowledge spans heaven and earth.

417
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:08,866
At the risk of my unworthy life,
I beg a withdrawal of this order.

418
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,258
What?

419
00:29:13,258 --> 00:29:14,858
The Third Prince...

420
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:20,900
He does not meet your approval?

421
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,566
Since ancient times,
when a ruler has true sons at his knee,

422
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:28,566
there has never been a reason
to appoint an adopted son.

423
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:33,166
Although the Third Prince is your adopted son,

424
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:37,233
he is also the son of
the Marshal's Mansion's Sun Ting Fu.

425
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:42,900
If the twelve prefectures of Wuyue,
with its million soldiers and civilians,

426
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:48,100
are entrusted to an adopted son,

427
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,833
how can this not raise doubts
at home and beyond?

428
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:54,666
How can it ensure peace
within the court and among the people?

429
00:29:54,666 --> 00:30:00,233
Emperor Ming Zong was not
the biological son of Emperor Tai Zu.

430
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:06,266
Therefore, after Ming Zong's death,
Shi Jing Tang usurped his family's empire.

431
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:13,466
Since the Emperor can be an adopted son,

432
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:16,300
then a good son-in-law can also be one.

433
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,633
My King.

434
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:29,766
The Central Plains
have been in chaos for decades.

435
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,666
Fathers and sons suspect each other.

436
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,100
Sovereign and ministers are in disarray.

437
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,666
Heaven and earth are overturned.

438
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:39,233
Some things must be done
as there's no other choice.

439
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,033
That's why...

440
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
they let mistakes ride.

441
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:54,433
As for Wuyue...

442
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,700
We have not reached such a state.

443
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,966
I agree with you on this.

444
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,800
Now...

445
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,300
Summon Hong Zuo to the palace.

446
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:25,866
The Great King summons the Sixth Prince.

447
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,566
Old Lord, what does this mean?
[Qian Hong Zong, Deputy Commander]

448
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:40,300
The Great King's command
is only to summon the Sixth Prince.

449
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,366
He did not summon the Seventh Prince.

450
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,666
Please wait outside the hall.

451
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,566
Father!

452
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:56,400
Father!

453
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,600
Father!

454
00:31:58,533 --> 00:31:59,966
Father!

455
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,700
Father!

456
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:09,960
My dear, foolish child.

457
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:16,333
You finally gave up that etiquette
between ruler and subject with me.

458
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,000
Everyone will eventually die.

459
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:29,333
There's no need to cry.

460
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,766
In the fourth mouth on last year...

461
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,033
when Fifth Son passed away,

462
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:44,022
I had you enter the Chancellor's mansion

463
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:46,400
to participate in
and decide on government affairs.

464
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,033
You are someone who remains calm
in the face of major events.

465
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:53,066
It's just a pity that

466
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,700
there's not enough time for you.

467
00:32:57,766 --> 00:33:03,033
I had originally intended to
support you for another year or two.

468
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:10,100
Father, please don't say that.

469
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,833
Please!

470
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,433
Take care of your health.

471
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,433
The state, the family,

472
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,969
the officials, nobles, and relatives,

473
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:20,900
the soldiers and civilians
in 12 prefectures and 67 counties,

474
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,700
they can do without me.

475
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:25,400
But they cannot do without you.

476
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:28,733
Father!

477
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:30,000
Father!

478
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,820
[Liu Yan Chen, Commander of the Third Unit
of the Imperial Household Guards]

479
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,433
Liu Yan Chen, I never knew that
you are a man of courage and strategy.

480
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,266
By the King's command,

481
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:42,533
I shall lead the inner palace troops.

482
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:46,366
Yet, you blocked me outside the palace walls.

483
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:51,966
Do you know that I can enforce
military law and execute you?

484
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:55,233
Marshal, I dare not offend a superior.

485
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,400
Yet, this is my duty.

486
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,566
Once the gates are locked,

487
00:33:57,566 --> 00:34:00,433
I dare not open them
without the King's command.

488
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:02,566
The palace is ablaze with fire.

489
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:06,833
If the King faces any danger,
can you bear the consequences?

490
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,566
Open the gates!

491
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:11,700
Let me enter to pay homage to the King.

492
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,033
If you are to kill me,
I am willing to accept the punishment.

493
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:18,166
But I cannot open the gates without an edict.

494
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,333
You!

495
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,733
Dai Yun is still outside the palace gates.

496
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,533
Yes.

497
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,533
Commander of the Third Unit
of the Imperial Household Guards, Liu Yan Chen,

498
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,533
did not open the gates.

499
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:38,000
Instead, he used a rope
to lower himself from the palace wall

500
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,900
and is dealing with the Marshal face-to-face.

501
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,900
This Liu Yan Chen is promising.

502
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,800
Promote him to Deputy Capital Guard Commander.

503
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,166
Yes.

504
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,433
This is He Cheng Xun
of the First Personal Guard Unit.

505
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:01,600
I have something urgent to report.

506
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:08,700
Your position at court is respectable,

507
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,033
but your military experience is insufficient.

508
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:15,966
When I ascended the throne,

509
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:19,966
I first grasped military power,

510
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:24,000
then the empire.

511
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,433
Marshal Dai...

512
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:30,433
He is a commander of the inner army
with great prestige and authority.

513
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:32,600
I cannot but obey him,

514
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,433
and watch his show of force.

515
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:37,633
Yet, unexpectedly, less than an hour
after I handed over the defense,

516
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:39,766
a great fire broke out.

517
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:43,033
I am responsible for the inner treasury,
and I deserve punishment.

518
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:44,833
I was scared out of my wits,

519
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,400
not knowing to whom I could state my grievance.

520
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,566
Thus, I've ventured to report this case to you.

521
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,366
I deserve punishment.

522
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:57,000
He Cheng Xun.

523
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,633
Yes.

524
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:04,233
You are truly audacious
to accuse a senior state official.

525
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:05,700
Do you know the consequences?

526
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,733
Every word I have said is true.

527
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,833
If there is a single lie,
I would forfeit my life.

528
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,333
Seize him.

529
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,166
Father.

530
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,633
Marshal Dai's actions tonight
were indeed improper.

531
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,733
Foolish child.

532
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:37,700
Remember this.

533
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,000
After you succeed the throne,

534
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,800
Hong Jun and Hong You

535
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,233
must not continue to command troops.

536
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,733
Otherwise...

537
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:57,300
you'll find peace hard to grasp.

538
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,433
Father, since none of
the senior ministers can be trusted,

539
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,566
what should I do?

540
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:08,166
The previous king's final instruction.

541
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:12,766
Serve the great Central Plains state well.

542
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:14,833
Serve the great Central Plains state well.

543
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,633
Serve the gentry and people
of the southeast well.

544
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:21,200
Serve the gentry and people
of the southeast well.

545
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,933
Serve the generals
and officers in the army well.

546
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,766
Serve the generals
and officers in the army well.

547
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:29,633
If you can win over the military commanders,

548
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,166
you can naturally bestow favors.

549
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,833
Bestow favors.

550
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,966
If you cannot,

551
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,966
handle it decisively and courageously.

552
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:47,033
Never show womanly compassion.

553
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:58,166
I understand.

554
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,700
I will remember this well.

555
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:31,933
Father.

556
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,333
The Third Prince's archers
are temporarily not a concern.

557
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:41,466
The key is Dai Yun.

558
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:44,433
He is the Commander of the Sixth Unit
of the Imperial Guards,

559
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:48,333
a legitimate military commander
in charge of troops.

560
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,400
Before dawn,

561
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,100
I can still use the pretext
of rotating palace guard duty

562
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,033
to keep him outside the palace gates.

563
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:01,466
Once dawn breaks,

564
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:06,633
if he forces his way in,
things will become difficult to manage.

565
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,033
He won't, will he?

566
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:14,033
The succession of the throne

567
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:17,633
is a matter of utmost importance.

568
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:20,166
Who would dare be careless?

569
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:23,600
In just a blink,

570
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,100
perhaps...

571
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:28,933
an old hen might turn into a duck.

572
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:33,066
Over the past hundred years,

573
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,933
there has never been a lack of
treacherous ministers and rebels.

574
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,933
Old Lord.

575
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:51,033
The King summons you.

576
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:19,066
Lord.

577
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:23,233
Draft a final memorial.

578
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:27,700
Report to the Emperor in Bianliang.

579
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:32,933
Request that Qian Hong Zuo,

580
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:36,933
Deputy Military Governor of
the Zhenhai and Zhendong armies

581
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,633
with the honorary title of Grand Tutor,

582
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:45,433
be appointed as Chief Minister

583
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:48,600
and King of Wuyue.

584
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,000
I shall obey the command.

585
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:54,533
After my death,

586
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:56,933
expel the Third Prince.

587
00:40:57,966 --> 00:41:01,933
Strip him of his title
and remove his military authority.

588
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:04,800
Strip him of the royal surname.

589
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,633
Restore his original surname.

590
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:10,766
Sun Cheng You.

591
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:13,166
I shall obey the command.

592
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:18,400
Do not harm his life.

593
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,733
Yes.

594
00:41:20,766 --> 00:41:22,433
Hong Zuo.

595
00:41:26,366 --> 00:41:27,900
Your son is here.

596
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:30,600
Hong Chu...

597
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:34,333
He is born irrepressible.

598
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:37,566
Do not restrain him too much.

599
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:40,433
Commanding armies,

600
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,566
governing prefectures.

601
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,800
Neither of these are his passions.

602
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,733
There are dangers and evils of human hearts...

603
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:56,633
You, as his elder brother,

604
00:41:57,333 --> 00:42:00,600
must protect him well.

605
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:02,733
Yes.

606
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,600
Hong Zuo.

607
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:13,700
The southeast, Wuyue,

608
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,533
is entrusted to you.

609
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,866
My King!
