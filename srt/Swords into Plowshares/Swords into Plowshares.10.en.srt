[Episode 10]

15
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,733
Central Army Commander!

16
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:41,700
Yes.

17
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,566
Announce to the entire army:

18
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,133
Grant three days of leave.

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,133
Conduct a city-wide search.

20
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:56,933
Lord.

21
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:59,566
That is Yanglou Street.

22
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:03,300
It has begun.

23
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,733
then go back.

24
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,533
Protect your entire family, young and old.

25
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,166
The Zhao residence.

26
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:10,900
Go, go.

27
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:34,566
Release.

28
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Eladest Young Master.

29
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:27,266
Drag them all into the pit in the behind.

30
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:30,266
Then fetch some water to wash the blood off the ground.

31
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:31,433
Are thy buried?

32
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,366
Don't hurry.

33
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,033
This is only the first wave.

34
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,666
The night is still long.

35
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:40,933
Move!

36
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,100
Turn.

37
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,300
Black Cloud Long Sword Unit.

38
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:06,233
Go.

39
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:11,733
Envoy.

40
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,366
We are willing to be the first wave.

41
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,966
But do tell those on the wall not to injure us by mistake..

42
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:22,033
The bandits without organizational discipline are merely a motley crew.

43
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,133
It's impossible for them to break in,
but we must be alert that they might set a fire.

44
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,166
So this is so-called transaction?

45
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:35,966
This is the trend.

46
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,800
Whether it's Lord Feng

47
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,733
or Lord Liu,

48
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,533
none can go against the trend.

49
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,700
Minister Sang

50
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,166
explained so much to me,

51
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,600
but I still don't quite understand.

52
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,033
Actually, what Mr. Sang, Mr. Feng, and others did
over these days, are meant to tell the Khitan Emperor

53
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,866
that anyone in the Central Plains can be the emperor,

54
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,300
except Du Zhongwei and Zhang Yanze.

55
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,166
Because the central land

56
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,566
would not have another "son emperor".

57
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,333
Envoy, they've arrived.

58
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:12,733
Good.

59
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,700
Beat the drums.

60
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,200
Yes.

61
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,666
Welcome the great banner.

62
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,233
The great banner!

63
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,266
It's the great banner!

64
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:47,933
It's even taller than our Marshal's banner.

65
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,800
There's ambush on the wall.

66
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,600
All archers.

67
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,133
At least thirty or more.

68
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,466
And we're just letting such a huge fortune go?

69
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:57,866
Everyone!

70
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,100
Charge!

71
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:05,500
Calm down!

72
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,766
No matter what great fortune,
it only counts when you can grasp it.

73
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,233
In such a vast capital city, there ais
more than this one places to find wealth.

74
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:13,966
Exactly.

75
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,166
If we lose our lives here, wouldn't that be a senseless death?

76
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,100
Retreat!

77
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:21,466
Backwards!

78
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:23,100
Retreat! Retreat! Retreat!

79
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:12,800
Lord Feng,

80
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,933
what do you meaning?

81
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:23,666
This gate

82
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,300
is called Mingde, which means virtue..

83
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,933
Those without virtue

84
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,666
may not enter this gate.

85
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,733
I am acting under the decree of the Khitan Emperor

86
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,366
to request the Marquis of Betrayal

87
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,833
to move to another palace.

88
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:42,966
Lord,

89
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
do you intend to obstruct?

90
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,166
According to the regulations,

91
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,200
this gate is only opened on New Year's Day.

92
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,600
On all other days,

93
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,633
only the imperial carriage may enter.

94
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,266
There are still three days before the New Year.

95
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,700
Do you truly intend to enter?

96
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:22,033
Even if this gate is closed, the relocation
of the palace is inevitable.

97
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:26,366
Lord, please don't defy
the imperial decree and bring yourself a disaster.

98
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,500
The golden-flowered silver pillow is a sacred royal object
only possessed by close royal relatives.

99
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,633
How did you obtain it?

100
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,000
Several years ago,

101
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:53,966
on my way for a mission to Shangjing,
a friend gifted it to me.

102
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,830
It was bestowed by His Majesty.

103
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,600
Dismount from your horses at once!

104
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:21,433
With so many soldiers following,

105
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:28,300
where do you intend to move our Emperor to?

106
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,366
THE EMPEROR,

107
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:36,866
is to invite your Marquis of Betrayal to temporarily
reside in the Kaifeng Prefectural Office,

108
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,500
awaiting His Majesty's arrival.

109
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:44,500
I should not say these words,

110
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,833
but,

111
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,766
I am old, confused, and garrulous.

112
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:53,966
I cannot help but

113
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,300
offer you a few words of advice.

114
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:04,300
On the day that Emperor arrives in the capital,

115
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,100
this old emperor must make amends before his carriage.

116
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,733
A dead man

117
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,533
cannot make amends.

118
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,670
Your Majesty, please change your attire.

119
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:50,100
A marquis holds the junior third rank.

120
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,766
It's an overstep to wear that
vermilion gauze robe and that Tongtian crown.

121
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,200
Your Majesty, forgive me.

122
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,533
We truly could not find third-rank attire
that fits you in the palace.

123
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,733
Do not call me Your Majesty again.

124
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:06,966
Your Majesty

125
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:08,900
will always be Your Majesty.

126
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:15,233
I used to think that, the story of the Handan traveler
who dreamed of a glorious life, wakening up finding it a dream,

127
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,233
was merely a fictional story.

128
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,766
Only today do I understand its meaning.

129
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,233
Well.

130
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:34,466
I shall wear these clothes.

131
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,066
My glorious dream,

132
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:41,966
has ended.

133
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,533
From this day forth,

134
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:52,966
there is no Jin.

135
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:04,700
The entire families of Military Commissioner Sang,
and Commissioner Meng of the Xuanhui Bureau, perished.

136
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,766
Gao Xun, the Gate Officer's uncle and younger brother,
died in the military disaster last night,

137
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,933
bodies lying on the street.

138
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:23,433
The senior monk Shixing of Xiangguo Temple
was also killed by the rebel army.

139
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Not a single one among
over a thousand monks and refugees in the temple survived.

140
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:37,200
During that ten defending days,
the total number of soldiers and civilians

141
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,366
who perished due to the war
was only about three thousand.

142
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:49,733
Yet in just one night last night, those who died in this
military disaster reached as many as eighteen thousand.

143
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:55,400
And the number only conclude those whose bodies were found.

144
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,700
We haven't even count in those,

145
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,133
whose bodies are not found.

146
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,630
You were born in the second year of Guanghua, right?

147
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,400
Yes.

148
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:11,066
I was born in June, the second year of Guanghua.

149
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:15,033
Do you still remember what this world,

150
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:18,966
was like before?

151
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,700
Feng is swaggering on account of his age.

152
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,870
Are we just going to let him have his way?

153
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,466
This man have always been good at playing a fool.

154
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:13,830
Having served so many emperors, he thinks of himself
as a senior statesman over three generations,

155
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,300
and that no one can touch him.

156
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,133
One could say he is courting death.

157
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,566
This man had some friendship with His Majesty.

158
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,933
Only His Majesty can decide how to deal with him.

159
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,130
They've all gone there.

160
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:37,766
Lord.

161
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,933
All the civil and military officials have gone there.

162
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:44,100
What about the envoys?

163
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:46,000
They have gone as well.

164
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:50,966
But that young man from Wuyue did not go.

165
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,200
That Qian family's Ninth boy?

166
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,000
Has he gone mad?

167
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,570
If one were truly mad, he would not act like this.

168
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:12,500
What does Shi family's empire have to do
with his Qian family?

169
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,833
Even the people of capital are not worrying,

170
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,400
so why is a prince of the Wuyue Kingdom being so painful?

171
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,366
Won't it cause any more trouble if he doesn't go there today?

172
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,900
I hope it won't

173
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:09,066
We respectfully welcome Your Majesty.

174
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:12,800
I, your guilty grandson, respectfully welcome Your Majesty.

175
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,566
Long live Your Majesty.

176
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,033
I, this guilty woman Li, respectfully welcome Your Majesty.
Long live Your Majesty.

177
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:28,266
We respectfully welcome Your Majesty,
the Great Khitan Emperor.

178
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:30,533
Long live Your Majesty.

179
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:33,933
Where is the Lord?

180
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,930
Reporting to Your Majesty, all officials
of the sixth rank and above within the capital,

181
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,100
are here to respectfully welcome Your Majesty.

182
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,833
[Yelü Deguang, Khitan Emperor]I did not ask who came.

183
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,300
[Yelü Deguang, Khitan Emperor]I asked who did not come.

184
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:50,133
Feng Dao, the Marshal, the Secretariat Director
and Duke of Yan did not.

185
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:54,466
Qian Hongchu, the Acting Minister of Works,
the Commander of the Inner Army of Wuyue,

186
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:58,566
the Cavalry Commander and the Secretariat Director of the Grand Marshal's Office,

187
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,566
claimed illness and did not come.

188
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,566
I know Lord Feng.

189
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,566
But I have not heard of this Qian Hongchu.

190
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,733
Wuyue is a remote and insignificant state,
not worth caring about to you.

191
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,466
How old is this person?

192
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:19,030
[Zhang Li, Imperial Secretary of the Hanlin Academy]
I've heard that when Qian Yuanguan named his sons,

193
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,000
[Zhang Li, Imperial Secretary of the Hanlin Academy]
the latter character shows birth order.

194
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
[Zhang Li, Imperial Secretary of the Hanlin Academy]
"Hongchu" means he's quite young.

195
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,100
Shi Chonggui,

196
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,233
do you know your crime?

197
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,733
I'm fatuous, actions absurd. My crime is unforgivable.

198
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:41,033
I submit to your judgment.

199
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,233
This sheep seems too small to be used
as the rewards for the army, isn't it?

200
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,400
He came with armor striped, holding a sheep as sacrifice,
a jade in his mouth and a coffin in a cart.

201
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
is an ancient ritual from Confucius' time.

202
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:59,600
For a ruler, it is too humiliating to be advocated
according to the sages' articles.

203
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Southerners are cold-sensitive.

204
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,530
This robe will shield you from the wind.

205
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,200
I am unfilial.

206
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:22,200
Having offended Your Majesty, yet I receive such
gracious reward with previous crimes remain unjudged.

207
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,633
I'm overwhelmed with shame.

208
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:25,800
I am deeply moved.

209
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,166
Since I have enfeoffed you as the Marquis of Betrayal,

210
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,933
it means I have pardoned your crimes.

211
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,833
After all, your father acknowledge me as his godfather.

212
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,730
So you are my grandson, and even you are short of virtue,

213
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,430
I, as the grandfather, should still show benevolence.

214
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,133
Why put on such a pitiful show?

215
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,866
Do you think that I am

216
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:50,366
a harsh and suspicious ruler?

217
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,033
How dare I?

218
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:55,400
I kowtows in gratitude for your grace.

219
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,466
The imperial carriage is prepared in the barbican.

220
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:05,333
We welcome you to enter the city on your sacred chariot
and ascend to the throne in the Daning Palace.

221
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,033
Zhang Li.

222
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,930
I found that in the northeast, about ten li
from the city, there is a river encircling a hill.

223
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:17,800
I wonder what place that is.

224
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:22,400
Reporting to Your Majesty, the river is called Qu River
and the hill is called Red Ridge.

225
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:24,700
Where is Ruan?

226
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:25,633
I'm here

227
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:29,800
Tell all the tribes, the imperial household
and the personal guards

228
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
that Lord Feng is a sage of great virtue.

229
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:37,433
He may be worried that we are rough men from
the grasslands who will disturb his venerable tranquility.

230
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:39,800
Since it is so,

231
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:42,833
pass my command:

232
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,500
No one is to enter the city.

233
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,433
Tonight, we camp at Red Ridge.

234
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:48,400
Yes.

235
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,400
Today's event concerns diplomatic relations.

236
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,866
Ninth Prince, you should not have been so willful.

237
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:07,766
After the war dust rose at Xiaoguan Pass, the river region fell,
and even the spring felt foreign.

238
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:13,733
Han people there all speak the nomad language,
and turn towards to curse their compatriot.

239
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:19,000
This is a poem by Sikong Tu,
known as 'Enduring-Humiliation Recluse'.

240
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:22,566
Even him, a stubborn old scholar without no money soldiers ,

241
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:24,800
refused to bow to Zhu Quanzhong, the rebel.

242
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:30,430
And yet we Wuyue, commanding twelve prefectures,
with over a hundred thousand armored troops,

243
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,033
should just bow and submit to the nomad, the barbarians?

244
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:36,900
Wouldn't that make us a laughingstock to the world?

245
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:41,133
This analogy is not suitable here.

246
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,233
The Later Tang Li family and the Jin Shi family were all nomad,

247
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:47,933
barbarians from nomad regions.

248
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,700
On the contrary, that Zhu Quanzhong was a Han people.

249
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,733
Now that, such is the situation.

250
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:56,033
Social order has collapsed for nearly a century.

251
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:59,700
What's the point caring about the distinction
between Han and the nomad?

252
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,533
Then must my family also submit to the barbarians?

253
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:08,866
Since the previous King's time, Wuyue and the Khitan

254
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:12,600
both had the tribute relationship,
and it has not changed for decades.

255
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:17,700
Not to mention us, even the late King himself
were here, he would have to serve them.

256
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,033
Again, "serving the great", these words again!

257
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,533
Hongchu, this is a state affair,
not a children's play for you to act on emotion.

258
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,800
Is Lord Feng also acting on emotion childishly?

259
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,270
We have been too indulgent with him these years.

260
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,333
At such a critical time, he throws a tantrum.

261
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,833
Then you go and persuade him.

262
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,166
I...

263
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:58,600
You tell him that's state affairs,

264
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,900
and he can no longer act willfully.

265
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:08,566
You all keep talking nothing but these grand principles.

266
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,466
If everything in this world followed principles,

267
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:14,900
how could there be these tragedies around?

268
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,566
Taizhen, you don't understand these affairs.

269
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:18,966
Don't interrupt.

270
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,866
Yes, I don't understand, but I think Mother does.

271
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:28,200
If Mother were here, what do you think she would do?

272
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,570
Would you like some tea?

273
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:38,900
Yes.

274
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:43,500
Lord,

275
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,800
why be so emotional on this matter?

276
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,633
Who says I'm emotional?

277
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:55,433
You are filled with grief and indignation
for Minister Sang's tragedy.

278
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,833
I can understand that.

279
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,666
But now,

280
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:05,233
after all, with state affairs be like that,

281
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:06,730
if you still don't show up,

282
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,270
everyone will be uneasy.

283
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,633
People of our generation,

284
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,933
Do we the privilege to be emotional?

285
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:22,100
You think Minister Sang, in Kaifeng Prefecture,
smashing the official seal, burning the imperial registers,

286
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:27,233
and publicly denouncing Zhang Yanze in court,
was just being emotional?

287
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:28,666
Isn't it?

288
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:31,233
Only the living can be emotional.

289
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:34,100
Sang Guoqiao and I,

290
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,133
were dead ten years ago.

291
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:42,166
What emotion can dead men have?

292
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:48,533
Has anyone visited Zhang Yanze's
central army in recent days?

293
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:52,300
High officials have all sent people there.

294
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,933
Who went in person?

295
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:58,533
Some sent servants, some sent lavish gifts.

296
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,633
But no one has

297
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:02,966
been there in person.

298
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:04,500
Tonight,

299
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,466
he is hosting a banquet at his office,
all officials of the court invited.

300
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,800
Not a single one attended.

301
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,466
Sang Guoqiao,

302
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:16,300
died a meaningful death..

303
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,000
You don't need to persuade me.

304
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,633
I know.

305
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,833
They are all right.

306
00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:30,700
You don't need to stay here with me either.

307
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,800
When I'm tired of sitting here, I'll go down to sleep.

308
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:38,570
I don't need anyone to attend to me.

309
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,366
You've got some nerve.

310
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,066
Who's here to attend to you?

311
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:46,666
If you don't want to go to him, then don't.

312
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,066
Who can really force you to?

313
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:10,100
Actually, in my heart, I know that
Lord Shuiqiu and Third Brother are right.

314
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,566
This is a state affair.

315
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:18,366
Handling a state affair, must follow the rules
of handling state affairs.

316
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,200
No one can act willfully or recklessly.

317
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,766
But I just don't understand how the state affairs

318
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,766
have become such things.

319
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:34,766
There are no more benevolence, righteousness, and morality.

320
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,533
People who were alive yesterday,

321
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
can die suddenly.

322
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,233
The one who were still the emperor yesterday,

323
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:53,366
now leads sheep, with hair disheveled, kneeling in the dust,
subject to humiliation and trampling.

324
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,433
The roads are so wide,

325
00:29:57,733 --> 00:29:58,933
yet on both sides

326
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,433
are piled human bones.

327
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,966
Those who are utterly wicked

328
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,033
become nobles, and ministers,

329
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,000
holding great power.

330
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,700
Good and kind families,

331
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,000
on the contrary, have their entire clans wiped out.

332
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,400
Lord Shuiqiu says it's a state affair.

333
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,166
Third Brother also says it's a state affair.

334
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,733
But I just don't understand what kind of state affairs,

335
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,166
could turn the right and wrong,

336
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,633
good and evil upside down.

337
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
Rubbish state affairs!

338
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:46,630
The four intersections around West Corner Tower in
Junyi Bridge Street must be guarded and we should keep alert.

339
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,833
We will change our clothes in
the river channel under Junyi Bridge.

340
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,700
Then, we will sneak in through the southern side gate.

341
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:58,200
Make sure to hide the boat used to escape well.

342
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,933
That is the only way out.

343
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:02,933
We can't afford mistakes.

344
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:23,330
Tonight, First Command of
the Zhangyi Army's Inner Guard will guard the office.

345
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,900
The deputy commander Zhang Miao
is a distant nephew of Marshal Zhang.

346
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,733
He will be on duty.

347
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:30,766
The password to the office is "Chang'an Emperor".

348
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,733
We have a hundred and eighty one devoted warriors.

349
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:38,000
There is a full-strength command
inside the government office,

350
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,600
Once if things get out of hand, within two quarters
, three to five commands will surely come to reinforce.

351
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,266
Therefore,

352
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:48,600
we must succeed with a single strike.

353
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:02,133
Halt!

354
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,770
What are you going to do?

355
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,866
Kill the traitor.

356
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:18,366
Who do you think you are?

357
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,033
And who do you think Zhang Yanze is?

358
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,700
He's a man who has crawled out
from piles of corpses countless times,

359
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,400
how could he possibly killed by you
young and shallow boy?

360
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:38,800
Is it wrong to do one's best for state affairs?

361
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:40,966
State affairs?

362
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:44,200
You dare speak of state affairs?

363
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,800
Bring them here.

364
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,266
With just a dozen or so greenhorns like you,

365
00:32:57,633 --> 00:33:00,333
leading a mere one hundred and eighty-one men,

366
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:04,066
you think you can kill an experienced general,
the current Marshal,

367
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,800
in this capital crawling with beasts,

368
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:11,533
amidst the protection of tens of thousands
of armored soldiers, just under cover of night?

369
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,933
I think you have a fever

370
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:17,566
that's fried your brain.

371
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,333
Father.

372
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:24,133
You dragged back some grain ships from the Left Treasury.

373
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,966
The Yexia troops have been in the city for days.

374
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:29,833
Thousands of households in the entire city have been looted.

375
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yet he specifically missed your few ships.

376
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:35,766
What a strange coincidence.

377
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,800
Marshal Zhang,

378
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,600
a veteran general of many years,

379
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,500
you think he failed to find it out?

380
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:45,700
Do you think these Weibo elite soldiers are all blind?

381
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,700
You couldn't even fool

382
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:49,800
my old eyes.

383
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:53,666
And you want to scheme against a military governor?

384
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Not to mention your one hundred and eighty-one men,

385
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,433
even if I gave you eighteen thousand men,

386
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:00,000
you,

387
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:03,166
will still get yourself killed.

388
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:07,533
Tomorrow morning,

389
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:10,366
go and make amend to the Lord.

390
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:17,100
Rise.

391
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:18,833
Rise.

392
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,466
Spare my life.

393
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:22,666
Run out the door and you can go home.

394
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:05,933
Marshal.

395
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,166
No one came out?

396
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:12,866
We watched the entire night and no one left Zhao residence.

397
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,766
The personal guards and the infantry also showed no movement.

398
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:17,633
The boats?

399
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,000
Those grain boats are still under
the Water Gate at Caomen without being collected.

400
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,500
Enough.

401
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:30,866
Who was that woman we saw in the blue gown during the day?

402
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:33,466
She is Lady Ding, State Lady of Chu,

403
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,466
At the midday banquet today,

404
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:38,866
have her come here to accompany us.

405
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:40,366
Marshal.

406
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:44,433
The State Lady of Chu is the birth mother of the Eldest Prince.

407
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,800
Who is the Eldest Prince?

408
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,833
There is only the Marquis of Betrayal.

409
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:19,500
Lord.

410
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,530
You've returned.

411
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:24,933
Yes

412
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,566
Since you are still alive,

413
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:30,300
go to work.

414
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:38,600
The soldiers defending the city with you for ten days,
who died in battle or were wounded and disabled

415
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,566
have not yet received compensation.

416
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,800
The meritorious oness
have also not been rewarded.

417
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,900
Their wives, children,

418
00:36:52,733 --> 00:36:54,000
their elderly parents,

419
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,766
may still be alive,

420
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:02,200
or perhaps died in the war.

421
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:05,700
The dead are gone,

422
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,500
and they can rest now.

423
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:11,430
But those who are still alive,

424
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,600
will have something to do.

425
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:18,666
Lord.

426
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,833
What's the point in,

427
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,200
doing that now?

428
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:34,600
Young man.

429
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,833
I spent whole life in chaos.

430
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:54,433
I was born in chaos, and I grew up in chaos,

431
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:58,866
In military affairs, I could not quell the turmoil.

432
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:01,970
In political affairs, I could not bring peace and prosperity.

433
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,300
Most of what I have done has been useless.

434
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:09,566
What is useful,

435
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:11,600
and what is useless,

436
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,333
should always be done.

437
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,400
Regardless of being useful or not,

438
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:21,100
whether they are done is another matter.

439
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:24,100
Do you think

440
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,966
such things

441
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:29,000
should be done?

442
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:33,433
Yes.

443
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,966
Then do it.

444
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,066
Just do,

445
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:57,733
what should be done.

446
00:39:01,066 --> 00:39:02,066
Enjoy it!

447
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,900
Come on, drink some.

448
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,533
Come on!

449
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:05,933
Come on!

450
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:06,766
Harder!

451
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,000
Hit harder!

452
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:08,900
Hit!

453
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,133
Wonderful!

454
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:14,266
Still wrestling?

455
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:17,966
You bunch of scoundrels,

456
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,466
can't even drink your wine quietly?

457
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:23,066
You only get up to some rough business.

458
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:28,300
What will those high officials in the capital think of us?

459
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,233
You are right, Marshal.

460
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,866
Since we are now in the capital,

461
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,866
we should engage in some more elegant events.

462
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:41,433
But we know nothing except fighting and gambling,

463
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,066
what elegant events can we engage in?

464
00:39:52,566 --> 00:39:53,233
Go there!

465
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,166
Are you blind?

466
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:54,866
Go!

467
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:56,133
Hurry up!

468
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:57,233
Hurry up!

469
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,700
We are all rough men

470
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,833
knowing little about elegent events.

471
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,366
Madam, you have long been in the palace,

472
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,833
serving by the monarch's side.

473
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:22,766
presumably,

474
00:40:23,266 --> 00:40:25,733
your talents, and beauty,

475
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,200
are both exceptional.

476
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:29,500
Why not show a bit of them

477
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,433
to give us a peek at such elegence?

478
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:33,366
Good!

479
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:34,266
That's great!

480
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:35,700
Let us see!

481
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:36,800
Let's see!

482
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,833
Marshal, forgive my offense.

483
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:40,466
I...

484
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:42,933
I have no talents.

485
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,966
No talents?

486
00:40:58,733 --> 00:40:59,400
It doesn't matter.

487
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,666
Then just,

488
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:06,266
show us your beauty.

489
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,666
It would also be enjoyable.

490
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:13,300
What's wrong?

491
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:17,866
Unwilling to give face

492
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,300
to the brothers in the army?

493
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:22,233
I, am too dull,

494
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:27,800
to understand what kind of beauty
the Marshal and all the generals wish to see.

495
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:30,866
Oh that's easy.

496
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,300
Madam,

497
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,966
within the palace chambers,

498
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:44,133
under the bed curtains,

499
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,033
what beauty did you show,

500
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:47,866
to the Marquis of Betrayal?

501
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,766
Today,

502
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,266
just show the brothers

503
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:52,400
that BEAUTY.

504
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:53,833
Yeah! Yeah!

505
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:54,300
Let me go!

506
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:01,933
Madam,

507
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:06,266
are you still living in the old days?

508
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,400
Shi Chonggui

509
00:42:09,266 --> 00:42:11,166
is no longer the Emperor.

510
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:14,500
He is the Marquis of Betrayal.

511
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:18,900
And your son, is no longer the Crown Prince.

512
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:20,633
You,

513
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:22,533
either take off your clothes

514
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,700
and let show us your beauty,

515
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,600
or

516
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:29,800
we'll have your son here,

517
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:35,433
and show him the "beauty" of us.

518
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:40,900
Let us see

519
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,333
how beutiful you are.

520
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:47,433
She hit him!

521
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:48,666
Haha, come down here!

522
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:49,366
Away!

523
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,600
Away from me!

524
00:42:54,933 --> 00:42:55,766
Come on!

525
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:58,366
Let go!

526
00:42:58,533 --> 00:42:59,333
Let go! Let go!

527
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,366
♫ Across tens of thousands of miles
strech towering mountains. ♫

528
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:30,833
