[Lim sighing]

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,442
My goodness.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,281
Oh, wow.

6
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,658
Been a while.

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,535
I'm so rusty.

8
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,455
- [breathing shakily]
- [sighing]

9
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,752
[victim continues groaning]

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,839
Ah. Refreshing.

11
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,258
- [panting]
- [Lim] Hmm.

12
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,678
Goodness. [sighing]

13
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,478
Hmm.

14
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,815
Oh.

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,443
- [chuckles]
- [grunting]

16
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,236
So, uh…

17
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,447
- You like the place?
- [groaning]

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,908
Huh?

19
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,285
The ambience in here.
What do you think of it?

20
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,661
[victim groaning]

21
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,246
I bought it with my severance pay.

22
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,416
When I was a kid,
my house was near a railroad.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,293
My goodness, it was loud.

24
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,881
You ever live by a railroad? Hmm?

25
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,674
- [groaning]
- No?

26
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,759
Ah.

27
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,220
Well, I, uh…

28
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,556
grew up watching all the trains go by.

29
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,225
Ah.

30
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,477
Look at that. [blows]

31
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,148
It was so rare back then
to see a train car stay still.

32
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,317
But one day,

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,904
for the first time,
I saw a stationary train.

34
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,534
And I was absolutely captivated.

35
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,743
Yeah.

36
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,787
It became my dream to own a train.

37
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,872
I wanted one so badly.

38
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,208
You don't get it, do you?

39
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,169
Not a car, not a house,

40
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,838
but a train.

41
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,049
I mean, surely,

42
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,219
no one else has to understand
your dream, right?

43
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,013
- Ah, there's blood everywhere.
- [breathing shakily]

44
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,723
Ugh.

45
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,143
Now, why--

46
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,813
Why am I still working
after having retired?

47
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,190
You might not know this,

48
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:34,112
but civil servants like me
don't get much from our pension.

49
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,615
After buying this train car
and decorating it…

50
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:42,203
[sighs] …as you might expect,
it turned out to be rather expensive.

51
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,706
[laughs]

52
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,251
- But you know what?
- [continues breathing shakily]

53
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,170
You're the first guest I've had here.

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,255
So I just wanted your opinion.

55
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,885
Okay, on that note…

56
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,306
For the last time,

57
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,392
I want to confirm the location with you.

58
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,895
So, let's see…

59
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,396
Mmm.

60
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,149
Yeah.

61
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,193
Right here.

62
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,694
This is the place, correct?

63
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,863
- [grunting]
- Okay.

64
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,699
At this point,
it doesn't seem like you're lying.

65
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,492
Hmm.

66
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,455
Well, I'm sure you're telling the truth,

67
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,041
but if this turns out to be a lie…

68
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,834
Mmm.

69
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,836
Yeah, here it is.

70
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,923
Uh, not only your dear mother,

71
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,969
but also your younger sibling
and their whole family will die too.

72
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,054
[straining, panting]

73
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,015
They will go through
the same torture you just did.

74
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,518
- Do you understand…
- [crying]

75
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,563
- …what I mean?
- [strains]

76
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,193
- [muffled crying]
- All right.

77
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,987
We're on the same page then. Yeah.

78
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,245
This will be very quick.

79
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,454
[muffled scream]

80
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,374
Wow.

81
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,043
Ugh.

82
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,131
How am I gonna clean all this mess?

83
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,800
My goodness.

84
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,574
THE TYRANT

85
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,292
THE PURSUERS

86
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,675
How much longer do you think?

87
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,260
Uh…

88
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,845
Can't be sure,

89
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,473
but at least four to five hours per group.

90
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,641
Oh, also…

91
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,893
Something is a little off.

92
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,272
I think the last digits
of the security code are reset.

93
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,150
The log-in timeline doesn't match
with previous records.

94
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,445
I think they've been changed manually.

95
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,990
Someone must have gotten
their hands on the case.

96
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,996
HANGOVER SOUP

Oh. [sighs]

112
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,491
What's that?

113
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,577
[exclaims]

114
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,205
What the…

115
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,666
[driver mutters]

116
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,336
- Huh? Whoa.
- [tires screech]

117
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,879
Hey! Hey!

118
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,339
Hey, that's my car!

119
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,174
That's my car!

120
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,802
Oh, no. No, no. Fuck me, fuck me!

121
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,512
Fuck!

122
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,883
[exhales deeply]

123
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,968
[elevator bell dings]

124
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,781
[Paul] Seoul is so interesting.

125
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,076
Every time I visit,
the landscape is different.

126
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:24,457
I live in Tokyo, and things are always
pretty much the same in Tokyo.

127
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,877
Maybe you Koreans
are obsessed with change.

128
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,296
Hmm?

129
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,548
It's been a while.

130
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,092
Yes, it's been a while.

131
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,136
[exhales sharply]

132
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,809
Now, I told you at the start.

133
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,894
Hmm?

134
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:50,232
I don't want to have to come here
and meet face-to-face if I don't have to.

135
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,069
Remember that?

136
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,905
- It won't happen again.
- Damn right.

137
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,991
You shouldn't have allowed this to happen
in the first place.

138
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:03,913
I gave you the necessary information,
resources and a detailed itinerary. Huh?

139
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,041
And yet Mr. Vice Minister,
it was literally spoon-fed it to you.

140
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,378
You just needed to chew your food,
and you couldn't even do that?

141
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,255
So what?

142
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,841
Did someone throw a wrench in your plans?

143
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,345
Ah, well.

144
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,893
You think you have what it takes
to bring down someone like Director Choe?

145
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,020
Do you not understand
who you're up against?

146
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,190
While your office
went through several name changes

147
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,526
and so many of your
superiors were taken out,

148
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,029
there's an inner circle
that has endured the trend for 40 years.

149
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,073
And Choe is its leader.

150
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,034
Did you forget?

151
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,454
Or did you underestimate him
simply because he's young?

152
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,206
Apologies.

153
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,126
I'll find him. Right away.
Whatever it takes.

154
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,585
- How?
- What?

155
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,879
I said, how?

156
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,299
Ah, geez. Forget it.

157
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,801
It's fine.

158
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,263
We'll take care of it ourselves, okay?

159
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,974
I can't stand incompetent bastards.

160
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,518
But do you know what's even worse?

161
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,563
Incompetent bastards
who are filled with filthy greed.

162
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,356
That's exactly what you are.

163
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,151
[clears throat]

164
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,946
Let me have Director Choe.

165
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,907
Sorry?

166
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,118
Your people are no match
for Director Choe.

167
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,830
And let's be honest, Vice Minister.

168
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,750
It's good for you
if he's out of the picture.

169
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,667
Let me do it.

170
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,963
- But I don't--
- I could just get rid of you instead?

171
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,715
If you want.

172
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,094
[chuckles]

173
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,555
Just go home, okay?

174
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,307
Get outta here.

175
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,604
Your youngest daughter
just left her tutor's house to go home.

176
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,813
It's her birthday, right?

177
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,691
Over there. Take that cake with you.

178
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,109
[laughs]

179
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,888
What you want to drink?

180
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,892
Ugh, just get whatever.

181
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,501
Is Hangom here?

182
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,169
[in Russian] Listen, you.

183
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,089
He's not here now. So you can fuck off.

184
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,135
[in English] Hey, Russian.

185
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,933
[goon groans]

186
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,729
[goon exclaims]

187
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,149
I asked if Hangom is here?

188
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,275
[strains]

189
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,860
See?

190
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,780
Honestly, you should've just answered me
when I was asked nicely.

191
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,995
[flesh squelching]

192
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,623
[bag thuds on floor]

193
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,793
[goons chattering in Russian]

194
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,592
[chattering continues]

195
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,137
- Nice gun.
- Yep, really nice.

196
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,305
[cocks gun]

197
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,852
The hell?

198
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,982
[Jagyeong, in English] Wait.

199
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,109
Who would be quicker, you or me?

200
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,863
I guess, you would.

201
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,283
[chuckles]

202
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:56,121
I mean, I'm just surprised, a little,
that you barged in like this, you know?

203
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,374
[chuckles] You should have
given me a call or something.

204
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,917
W-W-What brings you here?

205
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,628
I don't know.
Do you want something to drink? Uh--

206
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,630
- We--
- Calm down. Just sit.

207
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,633
Yeah, okay.

208
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,513
[in Russian] Who is this bitch?

209
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,434
This is Chae Jagyeong.

210
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,604
Remember Mr. Chae? This is his daughter.

211
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,272
As in Mr. Chae the hit man?

212
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,775
But that old man is dead.

213
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,194
I heard he was deep-sixed
after a gig for the office.

214
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,278
[goon 2] Mmm.

215
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:33,450
Hey, let's not be insensitive.

216
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,579
We don't have to bring that up now, do we?

217
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,249
I heard there's a price on her head.

218
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,751
Such a pity to just kill her though.

219
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,628
[chuckles] I fucking agree.

220
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,756
Come on, guys. Let's keep our cool.

221
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,674
Eh?

222
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,802
[in English] Uh, it's nothing.

223
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,055
- They said you're pretty.
- [goon 2 chuckles]

224
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,850
They said the rumors
were completely wrong.

225
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,478
I know damn well how pretty Jagyeong is,
so tell them to stop checking her out

226
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,105
before I rip out their eyeballs.

227
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,608
- What?
- Where's your merchandise?

228
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,277
Merchandise?

229
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,738
Uh-- Oh, right.

230
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,364
Oh, merchandise. Yeah, yeah.

231
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,825
Of course. Of course. Uh, give me a sec.

232
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,161
Uh, let's see.

233
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,916
Take a look.

234
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,426
[in Russian] Hmm. For real?

235
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,927
Impressive.

236
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,391
[in English] Bullets.

237
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,101
Hey.

238
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,270
You have to pay first.

239
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,024
[whispers] Jesus.

240
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,817
You gotta be kidding me.

241
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,381
Are we good?

242
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,008
And can you pay now?

243
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,012
[in Russian] It would be a shame
to kill her just like that.

244
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,725
Let's have some fun with her first.

245
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,103
Fuck. Hey, guys.

246
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,896
Don't do this, okay?

247
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,567
[in English] No, no, no.

248
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,738
[screams]

249
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,367
[yelps]

250
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,161
[Hangom, in Russian] What the-- Fuck!

251
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,704
What the fuck?

252
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,550
[Hangom sobbing] Don't kill me.

253
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,065
[Hangom wailing]

254
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,116
[groaning]

255
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,367
No.

256
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,579
[groaning, panting]

257
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,206
[in English] W-Wait. Jagyeong.

258
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,001
It's just a misunderstanding, okay?

259
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,545
I wasn't going to do anything to you.

260
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,255
S-S-Stupid bastards.

261
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,966
Look, they lost their minds
and fucked up, okay?

262
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,178
[breathing shakily]
I would never do that to you.

263
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,014
[screams]

264
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,561
[groaning] Oh, fuck. Fuck me!

265
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,106
[continues groaning]

266
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,987
Fuck.

267
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,408
Call him.

268
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,536
- Call who?
- Your friend, Yeon Moyong.

269
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,331
Why would you think he's my friend?
We-- [sniffles]

270
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,041
We're not that close.

271
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,084
[screaming]

272
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,630
[panting]

273
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,716
Call him now.

274
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,261
You were gonna serve him
my head on a platter, weren't you?

275
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,346
No way.

276
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,056
Quickly or your kneecap's next.

277
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,599
[grunts] Mr. Seong.

278
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,809
It was Mr. Seong.

279
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,604
- What?
- Mr. Seong was the one who gave the order.

280
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,023
- Mr. Seong?
- Yeah. I-I-It was him.

281
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,858
Mr. Seong from Paradise?

282
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,652
Yes. That's right.

283
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,736
Why would he do that?

284
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,113
That's what Mr. Seong
from Paradise actually does.

285
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,407
[yelps]

286
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,576
What the fuck!

287
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,037
[crying] Why? Why?

288
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,872
Fuck me!

289
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,833
I told you everything!

290
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,879
- Yeon Moyong.
- Yeah, seriously.

291
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,048
Where is Yeon Moyong?

292
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,424
[breathing heavily]

293
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,218
[whimpers] Busan.

294
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,931
[crying] I don't know where else he'd be.

295
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,109
[Paul chuckles]

296
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,777
Ah.

297
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,821
You're getting better at that, aren't ya?

298
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,281
Make a living doing that.

299
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,491
- [chuckles]
- True.

300
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:29,246
I wouldn't be in this pile of shit
if I'd just gone to art school.

301
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,873
- [chuckles]
- When did you get here?

302
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,750
[Paul] Late last night.

303
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,919
So, you are not
making this easy for me at all.

304
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,337
Don't blame me.

305
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,424
Those boys in Beijing cheated you
over and over again.

306
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,675
[chuckling] Wow.

307
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,011
Bad news travels fast, doesn't it?

308
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,221
Oh man, that's embarrassing.

309
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,058
I mean, I'm pretty damn famous.

310
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,519
[cackles]

311
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,649
Hey, but Madam Gwan's sources
are compromised.

312
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,526
Haven't you just been flying blind?

313
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,278
[chuckles]

314
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,115
[sighs]

315
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,743
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

316
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,661
Yeah.

317
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,331
Uh, I'd say about ten years?

318
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,624
Mmm. It was when you came
as an exchange student.

319
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,294
So yeah, you're right.
About 12 or 13 years ago?

320
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,755
You were a part of this office
back then too, right?

321
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,551
And you were a part of your office.

322
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,511
Hey.

323
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,473
Were you aware of that back then?

324
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,437
You assholes tend to think of us
as complete fucking losers.

325
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,316
[chuckles]

326
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,237
- You're as eloquent as ever, huh?
- Yeah, I am.

327
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,989
Quite an eloquent person.

328
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,409
You know why I'm here this time, right?

329
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,494
Do I need to know?

330
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,705
Come on. Just give back
what you took from us.

331
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,666
You won't even be able to do much
with it in Korea anyway.

332
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,253
Huh? You don't know
how to handle something like this.

333
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,799
So just hand it over.
We'll make good use of it for world peace.

334
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,514
- What should I hand over?
- Ugh, come on. Don't pull that shit.

335
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,183
I have to take care of this quickly
and get back right away.

336
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,060
I'm going to get fired
if this doesn't work.

337
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,938
You know how hard it is
to find a new job in this industry.

338
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,314
Help a brother out.

339
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,275
Well, if you don't tell me what it is,
I can't help you.

340
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,861
[sighs] Jesus.

341
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,029
[chuckles]

342
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,824
Looks like we're in
for a long chat, my friend.

343
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,992
All right, so…

344
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,328
- You still haven't had breakfast, huh?
- No.

345
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,914
Should we grab a bite to eat
before we continue?

346
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,708
There's a place
where they make kimchi stew

347
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,336
like the one we used to get
as students. Shall we?

348
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,004
[Paul] Mmm.

349
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,798
Kimchi stew sounds nice. Let's do it.

350
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,760
Before that,
how about I finish this first?

351
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,637
Hmm.

352
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,140
[Paul sighing]

353
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,603
Holy shit, look at that.

354
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,897
Are they geese?

355
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,942
What are those? Seagulls or geese?

356
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,736
Wow.

357
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,240
Seagulls also live by rivers? Ha.

358
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,702
Ha, what a funny place.

359
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,745
[chuckles]

360
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,497
[Choe] Those are ducks.

361
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,709
[Paul] Ducks? Those are ducks?

362
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,966
Oh, it's hot. [blows]

363
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,970
[grunts]

364
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,724
Oh, my…

365
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,894
Hey!

366
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,357
Snot-nosed kids.

367
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,506
[elevator bell dings]

368
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,277
[sighs]

369
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,865
Ah, that's very unfortunate.

370
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,160
The view isn't very nice. No.

371
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,207
[clicks tongue]

372
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,461
[person] They haven't been in touch with
me since the last delivery of merchandise.

373
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,764
[cocks gun]

374
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,891
- [goon 1 shrieks]
- [goon 2 shouts]

375
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,395
Fuck! [groaning, shrieking]

376
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,356
What the fuck? [yelps]

377
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,567
[goon 2 panting]

378
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,610
[screams]

379
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,374
[youngsters chattering]

380
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,129
[chattering, laughing continues]

381
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,050
Ugh, ignore it.

382
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,011
Can we go?

383
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,307
You stay put.

384
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,310
I'll just ask nicely for a cigarette.

385
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,529
- Yeah. Yeah, sounds good. Yeah.
- [laughing]

386
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,825
- Check this bitch out.
- The fuck's happening here?

387
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,118
What the hell, bro?

388
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,579
- Is she a guy or what?
- Hey, she must be your daughter.

389
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,788
[all laugh]

390
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,125
- She's just begging to get robbed. Look.
- She's looking at you.

391
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,127
[person] Look at her face,
she's already gotten her ass kicked.

392
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,381
[goon 2 straining, panting]

393
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,514
[Lim] You're really struggling.

394
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,725
- [breathing shakily]
- Yeah. Really struggling.

395
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,563
[groaning]

396
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,571
- Okay, sir.
- [stuttering] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

397
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,531
Sir, I'm gonna ask you one last time.

398
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,658
[goon 2] Yeah.

399
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,494
You see this, right? Mr. Yeon Moyong.

400
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,412
Where is he?

401
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,581
- Where can I find the guy?
- I don't know where he went.

402
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,958
[breathing shakily] I-I-I don't know it.

403
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,753
Please, Moyong just told me
to get off the grid, s-so it's just--

404
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,338
It's-- It's just us here.

405
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,091
Please-- Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

406
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,468
Ah, I guess you really don't know
where I can find him.

407
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,470
- [gunshot]
- [flesh splattering]

408
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,689
[elevator bell dings]

409
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,739
Excuse me.

410
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,658
- Would you…
- No, thank you.

411
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,661
I'm not interested in your cult shit.

412
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,787
So, piss off.

413
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,295
Well, it just might help you
to find some inner peace, honestly.

414
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,382
Yeah. Well, okay.

415
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,193
Not her?

416
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,113
Maybe… Oh, geez.

417
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,161
[sighs]

418
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,020
Darn it, it was.

419
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,857
It was her. How could you not--

420
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,609
I mean, it was so dark that…

421
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,488
[youngster]
That bitch had a cap on, right?

422
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,864
[youngsters chattering continues]

423
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,574
- [grunts] Oh, goodness.
- Oh, shit. Fuck.

424
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,785
- Oh, fuck. Fuck, man.
- Who's this asshole?

425
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,453
- Hey.
- Hey, old man.

426
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,540
- Oh, I, uh--
- Fucking watch where you're going, huh?

427
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,209
Come on, guys. I was just standing still.

428
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,170
And you ran into me, didn't you?

429
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,090
Oh, this old motherfucker
sure has a lot to say, doesn't he?

430
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,384
What are you looking at? Hey, shithead.

431
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,428
We're not the sort of people to piss off,
you dumb bitch.

432
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,597
Oh, I see.

433
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,142
Well, I wonder what pissed you guys off.
I really do.

434
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,103
- It's too bad you're upset now.
- What the fuck? Seriously?

435
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,355
Hey, hey. So, you really think
you're funny?

436
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,524
- You old ass piece of shit.
- Oh, well. I apologize. Sorry about that.

437
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,692
- Please excuse me I--
- Hey!

438
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,943
- Take him!
- Let's take him with us.

439
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,862
- You really shouldn't be doing this.
- You are so fucked.

440
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,155
- Do we have to do this right now?
- What a fucking loudmouth.

441
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,659
- You should really reconsider this, guys.
- Come on. Hurry the fuck up!

442
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,910
[Lim] Please! Wait!

443
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,207
[breathing shakily, coughing]

444
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,310
[Lim sighing]

445
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,814
[breathing heavily] Goodness gracious.
I must be getting old.

446
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,399
Huh?

447
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,152
I am old. [coughs, clears throat]

448
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,529
[groans, strains]

449
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,614
[sighs]

450
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,868
[sighs] Do I have a herniated disc?

451
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,745
Boy, that is painful.

452
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,081
I'm way too old.

453
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,878
[papers rustling]

454
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,838
Paul took Director Choe, apparently.

455
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,757
Did you agree to this?

456
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,634
- Like I had a choice.
- Sir?

457
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,968
[clicks tongue]

458
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,511
He asked us to hand him over.

459
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,680
That bastard, Paul,
is about to lose it right now.

460
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,641
You think you can handle him?

461
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,394
- But still, don't you think that's just--
- Look.

462
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,064
There's nothing to gain
if we get on their bad side.

463
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,277
While we work for the office,
we can't let our ego get in the way.

464
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,199
Those stupid punks who put us at risk
making nuclear material?

465
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,659
All Choe's predecessors.

466
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,745
Those fucking assholes take pride
at being true patriots.

467
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,332
They label us as traitors.
How's that for irony, Director Sa?

468
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,883
What exactly is in that sample?

469
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,304
Sir, why are both sides putting
so much on the line for this?

470
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,144
Director Choe… [exhales deeply]

471
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,648
…destroyed every shred of evidence
and core human resources.

472
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,274
So I don't know much.

473
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,739
But you must have heard about it too?

474
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,534
This Super Army.

475
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,079
In the US, the Pentagon
has been developing it.

476
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,707
So an army of people with superpowers?

477
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,291
[sighs]

478
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,877
You do know what they're doing in China?

479
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,256
Lab 507 and the Body Science
Research Council.

480
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,346
Oh. [chuckles] So sorry, man.

481
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,682
I made our VIP guest wait.

482
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,101
It took me way too long
to get here. [sighs]

483
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,353
It's fine. You must be busy.

484
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,193
Did you bring me a gift or what?

485
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,946
This is the rundown of your crew.

486
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,531
Both inside and outside the office.

487
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,284
Do you call them your babies
or do you call them minions?

488
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,578
Anyway, you're quite impressive,
aren't you?

489
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,996
I'm curious. How do you manage

490
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,665
to have such a skilled and talented team
working for you? [chuckles]

491
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,584
It's all thanks to my superiors.

492
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,170
I've been in their favor from the get-go.

493
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,421
Oh…

494
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,965
You mean those same remarkable superiors

495
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,509
who have no name plates on their tombs?

496
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,803
I should make you aware that

497
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,765
how these people die
will depend on the choices that you make.

498
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,517
I mean, they'll all be
eliminated eventually.

499
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,688
But if they're going to be killed,
they may as well die without agony, right?

500
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,774
- How terrifying.
- Yeah.

501
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,778
The world is terrifying to the powerless.

502
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,822
Look.

503
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,033
I think you've seen this guy a bunch.

504
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,826
Right? Dr. Jonas Hilm.

505
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,203
- Show yourself!
- [gunshot]

506
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,082
I mean look at all the atrocious things
that were done by this man.

507
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,167
See what I'm talking about? Really nasty.

508
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,127
It started with lobotomies
and joining brains,

509
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,170
and mixing and matching bodies

510
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,714
with a cocktail of multi-species
interbreeding genes.

511
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,715
Ugh.

512
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,469
But one day, his entire team disappeared.
All gone. Out of the blue.

513
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,804
And where did they go, huh?

514
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,056
They were taken by your people.

515
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,183
And the hiring manager in question

516
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,144
was none other than
your former university professor.

517
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,649
So, I wonder. Is your professor
alive and well? Hmm?

518
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,777
Oh… [chuckles]

519
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,362
Of course he isn't.

520
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,284
We, uh…

521
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,246
We've been observing your people
for a long time.

522
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,249
It got me so curious because we got rid
of your nuclear weapons

523
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,709
and your ICBM, so what else
could there be left, huh?

524
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,170
What on earth could
these extremists in Korea

525
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,588
be doing behind our backs this time?

526
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:38,344
You all kept this secret so well-guarded,
it took me a while to figure it out.

527
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,888
And eventually…

528
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,266
Ooh.

529
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,352
We found this.

530
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,771
The so-called "Tyrant Program."

531
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,607
A drug that can make
the superhuman gene grow.

532
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,942
Mmm.

533
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,068
[smacks lips]

534
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,237
This is really dangerous.

535
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,615
How did you end up creating
a virus you can't even handle?

536
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,742
Korea doesn't have what it takes.

537
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,869
No, no.

538
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,370
So…

539
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,247
Hand it over, while I'm still being nice.

540
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,331
Or should I use force?

541
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,876
And murder everyone?

542
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,503
That's my specialty. As you probably know.

543
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,714
But why not?

544
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,675
Why aren't we allowed to?

545
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,887
To do what? What do you mean?

546
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,680
Why aren't we allowed to do it?

547
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,932
Manufacture nuclear weapons and missiles.

548
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,475
Or develop this?

549
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,519
You guys do it.

550
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,022
So do China, Japan, Russia…

551
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,982
And even those North Korean bastards.

552
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,611
They certainly get to, so why not us?

553
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,373
You think we're pushovers?

554
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,841
[chuckles]

555
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,596
Wow. Do you realize how dangerous
your way of thinking could be?

556
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,765
You're a threat to world peace, man.

557
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,476
You think you're a hero,
but you're actually a villain.

558
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,604
Come on, we all play
in different leagues. You get it?

559
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,315
We should play in our own leagues.
You know?

560
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,402
You guys can just keep on building cars
and semiconductors

561
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,154
and everything else
you guys are good at, man.

562
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,573
I promise. Nobody is gonna have
a problem with that stuff.

563
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,243
Come on. Why are you being so arrogant?

564
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,078
[chuckles]

565
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,162
[exhales]

566
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,252
So what is it going to be? Hmm?
We don't have time so make up your mind.

567
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,420
[whispers]
What do you think I have in mind?

568
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:37,838
[smacks table]

569
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,716
[groans] Fuck!

570
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,427
Come on! Really?

571
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,264
You want to take this all the way?

572
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,392
I will kill everyone.

573
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,394
Do what you want.

574
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,022
Fuck you, you son of a bitch.

575
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,566
[sighs] This is so irritating.

576
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,110
[inhales sharply]

577
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,028
[subordinate on device] We found him.

578
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,243
We found Moyong.

579
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,002
Holy fuck. Whoa. [chuckles]

580
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,088
Talk about perfect timing.

581
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,589
Hmm?

582
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,343
Such a pity, Mr. Conservative Patriot.

583
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:25,886
[chuckles]

584
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,722
This means it's game over.

585
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,598
[clicks tongue] Doesn't it?

586
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,059
[chuckles]

587
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,898
Why is that bastard
stuffing his fucking face here?

588
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,445
[Moyong] Mmm. Mmm.

589
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,574
Oh, wow.

590
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,744
Food here is so much better now, hmm?

591
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,165
Maybe it's because I only ate Haejangguk,

592
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,083
but this is pretty good.

593
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,630
[exhales deeply] Oh.

594
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,093
Looking for me, right?

595
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,970
[chuckling]

596
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,556
I'll cooperate.

597
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,934
Oh, but in return,

598
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,269
take me off the list.

599
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,731
Everyone, out!
Stop fucking eating and get out!

600
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,489
I believe we can officially summon
Director Choe now.
