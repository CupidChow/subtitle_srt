1
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,974
[person] Yesterday,
the National Intelligence Service

2
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,059
carried out a sudden ambush
at the factory.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,564
Currently, Dr. Jonas's team and the rest
of the researchers are all detained.

4
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,859
The men from the office
are turning the place upside down.

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,779
As you suggested, Choe,
we disposed of almost everything.

6
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,576
But the issue is Jonas's team
must have kept one sample alive.

7
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,454
That's what the men from the office took.

8
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,415
[Choe] Yes, Professor. I am aware.

9
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,250
Don't worry. You can rest assured.

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,294
I'll take care of it.

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,880
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,215
Yeah.

13
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,634
I'll see you at Jeongjinam.

14
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,833
[inhales deeply]

15
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,170
They say good-byes are inevitable,

16
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,922
but I admit this is a bit sudden.

17
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,675
I'm sorry, Director.

18
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,343
We should be the ones apologizing.

19
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,513
Thank you for everything
you've done for us, ma'am.

20
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,267
I remember the first time I saw you,
Director Choe.

21
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,646
I got the distinct feeling that
your superiors were keeping an eye on you.

22
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,982
Looking back at it now,

23
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,695
it seems they always thought of you
as their potential successor.

24
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,242
I'm afraid they may have chosen
the wrong man for the job.

25
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,079
I don't think so.

26
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,667
The men who came before you knew
what they were doing.

27
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,546
If they sacrificed themselves
so that you'd be spared,

28
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,548
they must have had a good reason.

29
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,467
As a matter of fact, I think

30
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,096
you got this far
because you're a man of conviction.

31
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,557
Don't blame yourself.

32
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,685
That's very kind. I'm flattered.

33
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,230
Thank you, ma'am. [inhales deeply]

34
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,317
The late payments.

35
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,236
I'll definitely bring them
to you next week.

36
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,737
[exhales]

37
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,741
That's not what I was implying.

38
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,494
You don't need to worry about that now.

39
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,082
It looks like I won't need
that money anymore.

40
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,461
I already told you I can no longer
provide you with information.

41
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,213
All of our…

42
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,383
antennas have also been cut off.

43
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,553
Head one Japan sent me
a package of the Alligators' handiwork.

44
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,934
I mean, at this point,

45
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,020
there is no place left
for me to run away to.

46
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,393
The last piece of intel we have for you.

47
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:14,272
The port of entry date and a blueprint
of a portable Swedish-made vault

48
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,773
bought by Head one Japan.

49
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,899
We're short on time.

50
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,402
You're thinking of ending the program?

51
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,903
No, not at all.

52
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,114
I've been keeping track
of their movements.

53
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,282
They will come to us.

54
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,994
As long as they remain concealed,
the contract I have with them is valid.

55
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,747
Whatever happens,
I won't abandon the program.

56
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,831
We will keep going.

57
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,835
[grunts]

58
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,921
[groaning]

59
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,970
[Choe] This…

60
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,806
is gonna complicate things.

61
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,976
Mr. Chae's daughter is quite skilled.
She'll crack it easily.

62
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,937
From what I've heard,

63
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,773
she's mentally unstable.

64
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,317
She has some kind of, uh,
personality disorder.

65
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,235
Dissociative identity disorder.

66
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,072
She has another personality
as her twin brother.

67
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,450
- [thuds in distance]
- [grunting, screaming in distance]

68
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,994
Shit.

69
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,705
[grunting, groaning]

70
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,083
I believe it's time…

71
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,460
[grunts, screams continue in distance]

72
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,961
…for us to bid our good-byes.

73
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,301
- [thud in distance]
- [shout in distance]

74
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,388
[bodyguard 3 grunting, groaning]

75
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,223
[grunts]

76
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,811
[groaning]

77
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,880
[flesh squelching]

78
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,028
THE TYRANT

79
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,450
DELIVERY ACCIDENT

80
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,637
[Mr. Chae's daughter sighs]

81
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,474
Just a little longer and the sun will set.

82
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,603
Since when are days so long in the winter?

83
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,314
Anyway,

84
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,316
life is…

85
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,152
interesting.

86
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,614
Always full of surprises.

87
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,116
[sighs]

88
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,370
How on earth did all this happen?

89
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,935
We found Dad in the parking lot
of the water treatment plant

90
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,812
near Sihwa Industrial Complex.

91
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,730
[tires screech]

92
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,612
[gunshots]

93
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,493
[goon] What do you mean,
"He doesn't know what he's talking about"?

94
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,328
- How does he not know--
- Fuck it-- [grunts]

95
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,295
[Mr. Chae's daughter]
I wouldn't have recognized him

96
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,629
if it weren't for the tattoo.

97
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,050
I wonder how they crammed
someone so big into such a tiny bag.

98
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,636
I felt a lump in my throat, for a second,

99
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,097
but I wouldn't say I was particularly sad.

100
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,142
It was bound to happen,
one way or another.

101
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:06,022
The only thing I regret was that
we were getting ready to retire.

102
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,275
Since Dad was getting on in years,

103
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,069
we talked about running a pub
in Southeast Asia.

104
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,863
Somewhere warm.

105
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,741
Of course, Dad was always right.

106
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,410
He would always say things like,

107
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,121
"Life never goes according to plan.

108
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,791
No one can predict
what surprises life has in store.

109
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,462
Don't be discouraged
if things don't go your way.

110
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,839
That's just how it is."

111
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:37,428
That's why, back then,
I was willing to let it go quietly.

112
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,513
Back then.

113
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,223
But, now…

114
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,731
[sighs]

115
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,789
[sighs]

116
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,848
[sighs]

117
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,602
Have you eaten?

118
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,984
I mean, Mr. Chae's gone, so that's it.

119
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,778
Let's talk business.

120
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,699
Come to my restaurant. Have a bite.
How's that sound?

121
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,326
[chuckles] Just got some good seonji.

122
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,587
[loud slurping]

123
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,595
[sighs]

124
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,527
Did you need jjajangmyeon
delivered to my haejangguk restaurant?

125
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,321
- [slurps]
- You got no damn manners, kid.

126
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,533
No rush. Take your time.

127
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,452
Yeah.

128
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,454
- [slurping loudly]
- Yeah, take your time.

129
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,081
Here. Have some pickled radish too.

130
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,876
[exclaims]

131
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,627
You okay?

132
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,256
Want something else to eat?

133
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,549
How about jjamppong?

134
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,342
Tangsuyuk is an option too.

135
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,720
If not, you can have some of our seonji.

136
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,474
Mm.

137
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,143
Oh, yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah.

138
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,395
We should talk about work, huh?

139
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,480
[chuckles]

140
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,197
Okay, look, Jagyeong.

141
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,157
I've got a job for you.

142
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,451
It's made in Sweden. [clicks tongue]

143
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,206
It's a state-of-the-art,
portable, handcrafted vault.

144
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,374
It'll be in transit.

145
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,086
There will be high-end security personnel.
A five-to-ten-minute window.

146
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,671
So the job is… [inhales sharply]

147
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,923
…complicated.

148
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,802
[sighs] With Mr. Chae gone,

149
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,388
your hands are the only ones
in this country that can crack it.

150
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,474
Right?

151
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,975
[chuckles]

152
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,060
Also…

153
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,439
[sighs]

154
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,317
Think of it as down payment for the gig.

155
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,319
That's all yours.

156
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,489
[breathes deeply]

157
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,824
I know, okay?

158
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,492
I know it's an insult.

159
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,077
But cut me some slack.

160
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,162
I mean…

161
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,122
Damn it, this is embarrassing as fuck.

162
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,292
But I'm flat broke at the moment, so…

163
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,711
I had to hustle hard to make this happen.

164
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,463
Listen.

165
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,757
Finish the job, I'll double the amount.

166
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,217
Huh? [clicks tongue]

167
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,227
No chance. Forget it.

168
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,480
- Huh?
- Wait a minute.

169
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,899
Why are you calling the shots?

170
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,155
Don't I get a say in this
as your big brother?

171
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,616
- Why do you always decide for us?
- [coughs]

172
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,204
- [thug clears throat]
- Think about it.

173
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,540
Dad told us
not to get involved with moles.

174
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,667
Fuck you. Who are you calling a mole?

175
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,421
You little…

176
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,718
Yeon Moyong.

177
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,804
What's wrong with you?

178
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,099
You wanna die?

179
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,103
No.

180
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,271
I'd rather not.

181
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,648
Right.

182
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,317
Um…

183
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,320
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry. [sniffs]

184
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,741
Okay. I got, uh, worked up a little,
didn't I? [breathes shakily]

185
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,911
[exhales deeply]

186
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,538
Everyone knows you're working
for the office as their mole.

187
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,916
Ugh. Seriously, I'm not. Okay?

188
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,792
Hey.

189
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,254
Rumor has it that you're…

190
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,137
Let's not do this. Hmm?

191
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,974
You… [sighs]

192
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,019
We're both broke as hell, aren't we?

193
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,855
You made all that cash,
but spent it all tracking down his body.

194
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,274
You gotta admit, if it weren't for me,

195
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,027
Mr. Chae's body wouldn't have been found.

196
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,823
We have a history, don't we?

197
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,159
Hmm?

198
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:57,039
On behalf of your father,
please help me out this one last time.

199
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,165
Hmm?

200
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,127
I'll double the payment
and give you a bonus on top of that.

201
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,882
Hmm. That's enough to retire,

202
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,300
go to, hmm,

203
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,178
Southeast Asia
and open a pub there, right?

204
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,305
Come on. Do me this favor.

205
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,932
Yeah?

[agent] Hey, what's happening?

209
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,781

212
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,374
[agent] What the hell?

213
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,959
- Cover those guys!
- [hammer cocks]

214
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,461

[gunshots continue]

217
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,677
[agent 3] Take 'em out! Take them out!

218
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,804
Oh, shit!

219
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,480
[thunder rumbling]

220
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,192
[person] Fuck.

221
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,403
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

222
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,363
[muttering]

223
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,448
Fuck!

224
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,365
[groans]

225
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,202
Come out!

226
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,247
Come the fuck out!

227
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,624
Show yourself!

228
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,715
Show yourself!

229
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,886

233
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,439
Man.

234
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,067
[in Korean] Goddamn. Impressive.

235
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,559
HANGOVER SOUP

236
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,241
[news anchor] Now let's go live to
our reporter on the scene. Ahn Taegeun?

237
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,078
[Taegeun] Yes, I am here
at Chuncheon Dam in Gangwon-do.

238
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,415
[news anchor] And what's the situation
around the Chuncheon Dam?

239
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,834
[Taegeun] Although the storm's intensity
has diminished,

240
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,837
the sky remains filled with thick,
ominous clouds.

241
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,717
Due to extremely heavy rain,
a severe weather warning has been issued.

242
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
Because of the rainfall,
as you see behind me,

243
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,929
Bukhangang River levels
are rising rapidly…

244

248
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,491
Fuck, man. You been fasting or what?

249
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,659
You should try it.

250
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,038
- We only use fresh, high-quality blood.
- [scoffs]

251
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,498
Shove all the fresh, quality shit
down your throat.

252
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,753
What am I doing here?

253
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,714
You know your phone's off?
What the hell is going on?

254
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,050
My phone battery died.

255
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,384
Such an ass.

256
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,930
You are one shitty gangster, aren't you?

257
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,014
Hey.

258
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,184
I don't want this new suit to smell.

259
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,104
Come on. Finish your damn food,
so we can talk.

260
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,245
[news anchor] Na Yeonju,

261
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,997
how much water is being discharged
from Paldang Dam?

262
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,919
[Yeonju] Yes, I am near an area
that is downstream of Paldang Dam.

263
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:59,174
Right now, the dam is still filling up
with water, from yesterday's heavy rain

264
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,384
that we saw in Jecheon…

265
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,177
[manager] What about the other issue?

266
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,971
[Yeonju] …places in and around Gangwon…

267
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,722
[sighs]

268
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,015
Do you even need to ask?

269
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,602
[Yeonju] …1,500 tons of water per second…

270
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,021
- Listen to the news.
- [news report continues on TV]

271
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,148
- Why?
- [sighs]

272
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,944
That dam is releasing
1,500 tons of water per second.

273
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,614
Wow. 1,500 tons.

274
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,950
What would happen if she fell into that?

275
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,827
Think she'd live?

276
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,663
Hey. Make sure you cover your ass.

277
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,541
- The office will identify the body quick.
- [drops spoon]

278
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,752
Ah. Man, you know how long
we've been doing this together?

279
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,462
What are you so freaked out about?

280
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,631
Quit your worrying.

281
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,093
Now, why don't we settle
those overdue payments, huh?

282
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,220
[lighter clicks]

283
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,640

Don't kill me, sir.

299

- [driver] I was kidding.

Come on. You're an adult.

303
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,969

00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,487
[groaning]

360
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,923
[phone buzzes]

361
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,648
[line ringing]

362
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,653
[person] Hello?

363
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,202
[sniffs]

364
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,540
[sighs]

365
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,446
[politician] An accident
during the delivery?

366
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,698
Yes, sir.

367
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:10,660
Such refreshing news you've brought me
so early in the morning, huh?

368
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,746
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You think an apology's gonna cut it?

369
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,914
[clicks tongue]

370
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,717
You bastards can take the stairs.
It's only a couple of floors.

371
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,349
Are you sure they were Choe's men?

372
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,645
Yes, sir. He's put together
a black ops team from the opposition.

373
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,272
We're identifying them now.

374
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,736
How far is Director Choe willing to go,
that crazy prick?

375
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,323
He'll try anything
now that he's cornered, won't he?

376
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,950
This is an issue.

377
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,329
Paul, that savage,
will lose his goddamn mind over this.

378
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,041
Get Choe to meet with you here.

379
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,834
Huh?

380
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,461
Choe and me?

381
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,300
- An official summons?
- For God's sake, you idiot.

382
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,594
On what grounds?
We don't have any evidence yet.

383
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,805
You want to get screwed?
By that sly prick?

384
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,892
Don't poke the bear.

385
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,602
You two just have some tea.

386
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,105
We've shown our cards
and it looks like they have too.

387
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,941
Now let's see if there's a way
for us to win.

388
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,279
Out of the way, useless morons.

389
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,449
[sighs]

390
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,296
Have a coffee on me.

391
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,967
I don't drink crappy coffee.

392
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,430
Sure, Planning Committee officials have
such refined tastes.

393
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,809
I get to return to the office this time
like you promised, right?

394
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,688
Stay put and be on standby
until I give you further orders.

395
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,898
[Moyong sighs]

396
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,025
Still on standby?

397
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,569
Yeah, okay.

398
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,447
My team is always just a phone call away.

399
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,284
Tell Director Choe I said hi.

400
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,661
Wait.

401
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,664
Does that dude remember that he's
the one that got me stuck up here?

402
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,790
"Dude"?

403
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,542
Director Choe?

404
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,878
So not good.

405
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,714
Right, "Director Choe."

406
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,507
Watch your mouth, kid.

407
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,427
I'm out.

408
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,194
[phone buzzes]

409
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,616
- Yeah?
- The sample's been retrieved.

410
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,202
Check the contents
and eliminate the team immediately.

411
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,788
The entire field ops team?

412
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,459
[Choe] Yes, the entire team.

413
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,587
I'll take care of the rest here.

414
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,921
[team member] Oh, man.

415
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,223
Let's get ready to go!

416
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,975
We're going off the grid.

417
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,995
So, what happened? Did they get in touch?

418
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,121
Yes, Professor.

419
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,874
- It's all taken care of.
- Oh, great.

420
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,085
Dr. Jonas and his staff members.
They are all unharmed.

421
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,461
Good to hear.

422
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,839
So then, we just need to go into hiding.

423
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,175
Come on. Let's get you to the safe house.

424
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,259
Yeah.

425
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,326
[muffled screams from video]

426
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,995
[groans]

427
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,415
- What the fuck?
- [screams continue]

428
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,959
What do you think?

429
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,003
[caller]
We think what's being developed in Korea

430
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,714
is closer to a virus
than an ordinary serum.

431
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,761
Unlike ours, it doesn't need
to be administered directly to the brain.

432
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:06,307
It appears it can be activated
through the skin or the mucous membrane.

433
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,061
Fucking idiots.

434
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:14,523
Why do they keep making shit
that they can't control?

435
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,900
Huh?

436
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,195
I can't say for sure,
but I don't think it was created.

437
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,697
I think they found
something already existing.

438
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,617
[chuckles]

439
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,620
"Already existing"?

440
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,625
[person screaming]

441
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,504
[screaming continues]

442
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,342
[captive mumbling, screaming]

443
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,762
[chuckles]

444
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,681
What's he saying?

445
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,267
He's too far away. I can't hear shit.

446
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,979
He's saying he'll do anything you want
if you just give him a chance.

447
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,563
Just tell him what you want.

448
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,279
No, too late.

449
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,739
I fucking hate useless people.

450
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,702
Cut their heads off. Send them back
to their headquarters for me.

451
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,038
All right.

452
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,249
To Korea.

453
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,334
Got to go clean up their mess.

454
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,004
What's the weather in Seoul?

455
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,090
[screaming continues]
