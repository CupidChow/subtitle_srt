00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,025
THE TYRANT

00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,992
[♪ techno music crescendo playing]

3
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,702
[crowd cheering]

4
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,377
[music continues]

5
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,016
Well, fuck me.

6
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,940
Been a long time.

7
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,818
- How did you get in?
- Does it matter?

8
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,904
Did you really think
a few guards would keep me out?

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,032
[sighs]

10
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,206
[sighs]

11
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,132
[sighs]

12
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,010
[Seong] For fuck's sake.

13
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:21,182
Are you seriously pulling out knives
and guns before we even start talking?

14
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,477
See this? My hand still aches
when the weather is bad

15
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,604
from when you stabbed me ten years ago.

16
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,150
Come on.

17
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,402
Just, uh… Put those away, and we'll talk.

18
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,405
Uh, where are my cigarettes?

19
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,743
[objects clattering]

20
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,000
[sighing] Ah, sh…

21
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,295
I know nothing. Absolutely nothing.

22
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,880
Don't bullshit me, Seong.

23
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,465
Where is Yeon Moyong?

24
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,593
What do you think I am, his keeper?

25
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,636
[chuckling]
How am I supposed to know that?

26
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,472
Everybody in our line of work
knows that you, Yeon Moyong,

27
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,600
and even Hangom are close like brothers.

28
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,061
Come on, don't associate my bloodline
with that piece of shit.

29
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,982
Why would I be like brothers
to those bastards?

30
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,610
So we went fishing a couple of times.

31
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,111
So?

32
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,532
So, you're the one who put the bounty
on our heads?

33
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,994
That's what you're saying?

34
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,998
Oh… Well… [stammers]

35
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,083
[clears throat] About that--

36
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,376
[Jagyeong] Why?

37
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,921
Did your life get boring?

38
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,214
[stammers]

39
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,340
You wanna die?

40
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,799
[sighs]

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,136
I received orders, okay?
But it wasn't from Moyong.

42
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,180
It's not only you they want.

43
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,515
They want Moyong taken out, too.

44
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,850
Who gave the orders?

45
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,770
Oh, come on.

46
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,023
You know I really can't tell you
any of that.

47
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,608
[gulps]

48
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,568
If I open my mouth, I'll be dead.

49
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,904
You'll die now if you don't tell me.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,615
[sighs]

51
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,660
Hey, let's just use the knife. Hmm?

52
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,912
Nuh-uh.

53
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,039
Which would you prefer?

54
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,707
It's your choice.

55
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,545
[lighter flicks]

56
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:29,143
Jagyeong, you've heard that Yeon Moyong
is a spy for the office, right?

57
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,482
This is 100% a government operation.

58
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,656
- Look, Jagyeong--
- Shh.

59
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,488
[people clamoring in distance]

60
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,412
[hammer cocks]

61
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,792
So,

62
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,919
we meet again.

63
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,589
Indeed.

64
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,759
Do you know who I am?

65
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,885
Do you know me?

66
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,179
All I know is that

67
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,389
you're supposed to be dead.

68
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,809
You should have died a long time ago,
for that matter.

69
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,102
What do you know?

70
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,688
You're the one who killed Moyong's guys
in Busan.

71
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,856
Right?

72
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,358
Oh.

73
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,151
How did you know that?

74
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,111
You reeked of serious gunpowder.

75
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,571
And a little blood.

76
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,823
Oh.

77
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,451
Impressive.

78
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,537
- Yes, very impressive.
- Mm-hmm. Impressive.

79
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,705
Uh-huh.

80
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,750
That is impressive.
That's quite impressive.

81
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,003
But you were supposed to be
dead already, which means…

82
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,546
Sure, let's do it.

83
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,090
But take me with you.

84
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,800
Take you with me?

85
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,428
[grunts]

86
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,932
If you're lucky, you'll die.

87
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,018
If you're unlucky,
you'll be a eunuch forever.

88
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,145
You're even more impressive
than I thought.

89
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,605
You don't have to keep saying that.

90
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,023
[growls]

91
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,071
[both grunting]

92
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,367
[grunting continues]

93
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,208
[both groaning]

94
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,549
[gun clicking]

95
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,511
[both grunting, groaning]

96
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,272
[panting]

97
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,525
[grunts, groans]

98
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,446
[panting]

99
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,865
[Jagyeong] Goddamn it.

100
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,284
[breathing heavily]

101
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,078
[grunting]

102
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,459
[groaning]

103
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,169
[thud]

104
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,504
[groaning] Oh, that hurts.

105
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,180
[hammer cocks]

106
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,601
Let me ask you a question.

107
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,811
Did Yeon Moyong get his orders…

108
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,189
from your people?

109
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,318
Well, I believe so, yeah.

110
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,820
Did you kill Yeon Moyong?

111
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,698
No, I'm afraid we haven't yet.

112
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,035
[sighing] Thank God.

113
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,083
I have to be the one to kill him.

114
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,836
[phone buzzes]

115
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,422
[breathing heavily]

116
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,516
Oh, my-- Sh…

117
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,602
[door opens]

118
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,187
Oh, dear. We're in trouble.

119
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,188
[sighs] The hell?

120
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,233
Hey, I-I… I won't shoot. No shooting.

121
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,237
I'm sorry, but how about
we put this on hold, and you come with me?

122
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,905
Come on.

123
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,075
We have to take care of an emergency.
Let's go.

124
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,203
Hey. What the hell are you talking about?

125
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,747
We gotta finish this. Come on!

126
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,958
Oh, I would love to as well. [grunts]

127
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,168
Unfortunately, we don't have time.

128
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,462
Yeon Moyong has just resurfaced.

129
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,631
Oh, my… [groans]

130
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,801
[grunts]

131
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,389
So, uh, you a good driver, by any chance?

132
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,100
Goodness, it appears
you've destroyed my foot.

133
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,184
So, please?

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,356
[grunting]

135
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,158
Where's the bastard now?

136
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,790
THE TYRANT

137
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,797
[Moyong sighs]

138
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,972
What's that?

139
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,272
[agent] What the…

140
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,898
[agents exclaim]

141
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,985
[stammers]

142
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,381
What the fuck's going on here?

143
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,800
How scary.

144
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,803
[sucks teeth] You're not gonna shoot me.

145
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,846
Put that away.

146
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
Uh,

147
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,351
we'll take the kid.

148
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,147
[pounding]

149
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,442
[sighs]

150
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,987
- [grunts]
- [Moyong] What the…

151
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,202
[shouting]

152
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,958
- Nice. An open top. Hmm?
- [shouting continues]

153
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,880
- So much better as a convertible.
- My hair! Come on, man. That hurts--

154
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,465
- [screams]
- Hey, bro.

155
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,135
This is where you stop. Hmm?

156
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,345
[Moyong shouting in distance]

157
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,681
Once I'm done,
I'll send you Director Choe's head,

158
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,309
so you wait for me like a good boy. Hmm?

159
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:31,399
It's time to stop
causing division in our alliance.

160
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,777
Okay?

161
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,697
[laughs]

162
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,704
[sighs]

163
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,042
[scoffs]

164
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,963
You two haven't seen each other
in a while, hmm?

165
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:54,964
Say hi. Come on.

166
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,215
[groans]

167
00:11:56,298 --> 00:12:00,094
I mean, a superelite guy
like Director Choe recognize a lowly,

168
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,929
disposable scumbag like me,

169
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,807
who only sells haejang-guk.

170
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,309
Do you know my name?

171
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,273
- Can I have a smoke?
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,524
But, Director Choe,

173
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,069
how can you be so inconsiderate?

174
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,698
You tried to have me killed
without even a word of appreciation

175
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,283
after all the shit I've done for you.

176
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,870
How could you do something like that?

177
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,081
Did you need to have me killed, huh?

178
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,544
Well,

179
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,713
if I had to say a reason,

180
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,799
for the nation and the people?

181
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,968
- [laughing]
- Really?

182
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:42,970
That's what we do.

183
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,474
That is why the government is paying you.

184
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,684
To take a bullet when the time comes.

185
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,352
- [chuckles]
- [Choe] Thanks to you,

186
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,356
it looks like everything our superiors
sacrificed their lives to protect

187
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,693
will be handed over to these bastards.

188
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,903
[chuckles]

189
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,947
Thanks a lot, Yeon Moyong.

190
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,867
Happy now, you son of a bitch?

191
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,494
Useless fuck.

192
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look at you go.

193
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,082
[inhales] Whoo! That's cold.

194
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,002
How about you stop getting on my nerves,
huh?

195
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,379
[Paul laughing]

196
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,589
[Moyong] Ah, shit.

197
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,220
[Lim groans] Huh?

198
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,056
Ooh, ooh, ooh! It's them. Up there!

199
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,164
[subordinate] We got a tail, go check.

200
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,301
[hammer cocks]

201
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,930
[tires screeching]

202
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,647
Whoa, that car. Was that Manager Lim?

203
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,401
Manager-- Wait, Lim Sang?

204
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,528
[stammers] The ace assassin?

205
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,072
Wait, didn't that monster retire?

206
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,408
Yeah, but severance pay is pretty low.

207
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,285
He needed money to buy a train car,

208
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,287
- so I gave him a few gigs.
- Wait. A train car for what?

209
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,541
To open a café.

210
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,419
[Paul scoffs] Shit.

211
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,129
He's not a good cook though.

212
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,340
[subordinate] You take care of it.

213
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,396
Brace yourself.

214
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,856
[gunshots]

215
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,543
Goodness.

216
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,378
[both shout]

[agents grunting, groaning]

227
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,133
Wow. [laughing]

228
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,684
Door.

230
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,282
[chuckles]

231
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,010
Huh.

232
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,780
Huh?
What the fuck are you looking at me for?

233
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,990
I swear, don't know anything.

234
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,826
I just did everything
you guys told me to do, okay?

235
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,024
[grunting]

236
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,154

[groans]

238
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,760
Where is he?

239
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,096
Come on out!

240
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,140
[sighs] Where is that old man?

241
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,434
It's fine. Let's go find Yeon Moyong.

242
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,812
Okay?

243
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,783
[coughs, gasping]

[jaw clicks]

247
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,636
Hey, Jagyeong, cut his wrists…

248
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,347
Come on. Just fucking cut them off.

249
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,686
[both grunting]

250
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,734

- [gunshot]
- [hammer cocks]

253
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,338
[Lim] Over here. Here.

254
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,010
Oh, my. My goodness. [groans]

255
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,888
Stay right where you are.

256
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,182
Yeah, right there. That's good.

257
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,774
[panting, groaning]

258
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,153
- You okay? My goodness…
- Uh…

259
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,448
- You are not looking too good, are you?
- [panting]

260
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,410
- Okay, so now, let's… [grunting]
- [grunting]

261
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,414
Let's go get Mr. Yeon Moyong.

262
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,791
[both grunting]

263
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,669
[Jagyeong] What the fuck is this?

264
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,464
[grunts]

265
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,425
Shit.

266
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,430
Hey. What is this?

267
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,810
I don't know.

268
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,770
Something's crawling inside me.

269
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,650
What the…

270
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,820
You fucking had that all along?

271
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,282
How can you--

272
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,367
What do you mean, how?

273
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,287
I couldn't trust Moyong.

274
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,831
Obviously,
I had to keep it until I got paid.

275
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,458
But… Fuck!

276
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,960
Ah! [sucks teeth]

277
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,587
What the fuck is this?

278
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,970
I apologize, but this is
very serious government business.

279
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,513
- [hammer cocks]
- [Jagyeong] What?

280
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,099
Fuck! Fuck!

281
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,606
[chuckling] Hey.

282
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,278
You're fucking with me, right?

283
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,988
Huh?

284
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,072
[hammer cocks]

285
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,909
Where the fuck is the Tyrant?

286
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,120
Huh?

289
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,004
- Okay.

[sighs]

293
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,518
I gave you so many chances, didn't I?
[scoffs]

294
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:35,937
Fine. Okay.

295
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:45,072
If that's what you want, let's see
who comes out ahead. [chuckles]

296
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,992
Bring them out.

297
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,249
Oh, fuck.

298
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,678
Take it easy.

299
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,680
I really have no idea where it is.

300
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,766
[laughing]

301
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,601
You have no clue?

302
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,188
Yeah, yeah, of course. I'm sure you don't.

303
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,439
Yeah, I get it.

304
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,485
Even if I wind up
killing every single bastard up there,

305
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,278
you wouldn't flinch at all, would you?

306
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,489
I know you way too well.

307
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,327
Just sit and watch. You fucked me over,
so I have something for you.

308
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,829
That's only fair, isn't it?

309
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,668
Feel the pain of watching my men
blow your men's brains out one by one.

310
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,840
Then you'll be the last to be eliminated,
you motherfucker. [chuckles]

311
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,552
[grunts]

312
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,349
What are you doing?

313
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,353
I told you to calm down, you bastard.

314
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,149
Next.

315
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,614
[Choe scoffs]

316
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,742
You fucking lunatic.

317
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,121
I told you,
I don't fucking know where it is!

318
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,624
Chae Jagyeong.

319
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,127
Yeah, it's that bitch, Chae Jagyeong.

320
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,045
She took whatever it was inside.

321
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:28,383
She broke into your Swedish-made vault
or whatever in under three minutes.

322
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,386
For her, breaking into that briefcase
would have been a walk in the park!

323
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,472
Chae Jagyeong?

324
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,640
Who the hell is that?

Hey, is Yeon Moyong in there?

330
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,913
Why won't anyone answer me?

331
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:02,959

Director Choe, hi.

352
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,354
I seem to have impeccable timing.
[chuckles]

353
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,025
You're, uh, just a bit late.

354
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,696
- Ah. It's my foot, you see. So…
- [chuckles]

355
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,740
All right.

356
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,118
Aren't you and I past such theatrics? Huh?

357
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,413
Put it away. You won't shoot me anyway.

358
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,043
Guess not, huh? [chuckles]

359
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,924
Well?

We won, right? Hmm?

361
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,315
You don't think I'll shoot you.

[chuckles]

363
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,155
Fuck, man. You'd shoot me in a heartbeat.

364
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,076
But you ought to think carefully
about what might happen next.

365
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,997
You don't wanna wage war with us,
do ya? Huh?

366
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,165

00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,715
- I know what I'm doing.
- [chuckles]

369
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,678
[screaming]

370
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,139
[groans] Fuck!

371
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,058
Mr. Lim, why'd you shoot him in the leg?

372
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,018
Huh?

373
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:53,273
Well, Director Choe,
I made a deal with someone.

374
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,150
His life isn't mine to take.

375
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,870
[breathing heavily]

376
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,875
[Lim] Oh. [chuckles]

377
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,294
Don't tell me…

378
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,713
Yeah, that's right.

379
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,674
The Tyrant.

380
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,337
[grunts]

381
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,136
[breathing heavily]

382
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:21,903
[grunts]

383
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,406
[grunts]

384
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,329
[both grunting]

385
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,052
[coughs]

386
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,023
[growls]

387
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,779
[grunts]

388
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,283
[Lim] Oh, goodness!

389
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,224
[grunting]

390
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,666
[breathing heavily]

391
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,673
[breathing heavily, grunts]

392
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,600
[grunting]

393
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,675
Aw, fuck. Seriously?

394
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,718
[panting]

395
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,349
[Moyong groans]

396
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,694
- Jagyeong…
- You don't have the money,

397
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,071
do you?

398
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,572
[screaming]

399
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,430
Ah. Right.

400
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,558
We have business to finish.

401
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:42,228
I apologize, but this is
very serious government business.

402
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,564
[altered voice] Don't shoot!

403
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,444
[normal voice] Damn it. Who are you?

404
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,528
[groaning] Hold on a sec.

405
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,488
[altered voice] Just kill him.

406
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,783
[normal voice] This scumbag? Why kill him?

407
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,869
Just stay put, you bastard.

408
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,290
We don't know where Yeon Moyong is.

409
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,460
Let's go get Moyong first.

410
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,920
Then we can get back to our business.

411
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,465
[laughing]

412
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,343
Let's do it.

413
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,887
[laughs]

414
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,390
Excuse me.

415
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,311
If you don't mind, can you tell me
how you're feeling right now?

416
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,022
What are you, a pervert?

417
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,940
Why are you asking how I feel?

418
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,776
[chuckling] Well,

419
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,153
how do you think I'm feeling?

420
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,237
[Choe scoffs]

421
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,698
You've completely adapted to it.

422
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,451
Yeah. I can adjust pretty damn well.

423
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,871
Hit the lights!

424
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,209
[groans]

425
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,378
[altered voice groaning]

426
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,396
[grunting continues]

427
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,830
So you must have noticed by now,

428
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,584
the black blood
that's pulsing through your veins…

429
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,383
It gets incredibly difficult to control.

430
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,678
We find it's unpredictable,

431
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,597
but it has one weakness.

432
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:46,269
[distorted]
It cannot withstand really strong light.

433
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,567
[echoing] So far,
no one's been able to control it.

434
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,407
Upon injection, it takes over the host's
brain and eventually the host's DNA,

435
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,285
which can cause
a tremendous amount of damage.

436
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,622
So we need to eliminate it right away.

437
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,805
[Lim groaning]

438
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,725
[groaning continues]

439
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,728
[Lim screams]

440
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,608
[Lim] Director Choe, it's working!

441
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,743
[Jagyeong breathing heavily]

442
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,290
[chuckles]

443
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,919
[altered voice] You're laughing?

444
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,671
You want me to kill you all? Really?

445
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,299
[normal voice] Shit.

446
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,218
[Jagyeong grunts]

447
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,845
Both of you, be quiet.

448
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,641
- Let me talk now.
- Stop.

449
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,185
There's no time.

450
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,020
What?

451
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,731
The sun will be up soon.

452
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,569
Leave right now.
It'll be hard if you wait.

453
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,613
Find somewhere very dark.

454
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:24,158
It'll be extremely painful during the day,
so avoid the sun at all costs.

455
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,786
They will be looking for you.

456
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,539
From now on, you're government property.
Remember that.

457
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,625
[laughing]

458
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,170
[altered voice] Fuck that shit.

459
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,131
Who says I'm government property?

460
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,509
[normal voice] Hey, I said be quiet.

461
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,220
This isn't your body.
Who said you're in control?

462
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,938
Go now. Wait any longer,
and you'll die with us.

463
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,481
[altered voice groans]

464
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,360
He says to hurry, right?

465
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,113
Let's just go. Come on.
The sun is coming up.

466
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,040
[normal voice] Goddamn it.

467
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,844
[Lim groaning]

468
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,611
Oh! My wrist! My wrist! [groaning]

469
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,291
[sighs] You crazy bastard.

470
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,420
Are you out of your mind?

471
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,257
How are you gonna deal
with the consequences?

472
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,890
You'll take care of it.

473
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,559
What?

474
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,105
You'll clean up everything. Got a light?

475
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,859
[sighs]

476
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,540
You must be glad that bastard Paul's gone.

477
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,919
Thanks to me,
you have one less competitor.

478
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,504
Right?

479
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,049
What the hell are you talking about?

480
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,886
Well…

481
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,390
How'd you find this place?

482
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,601
And don't tell me it was Yeon Moyong.

483
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,479
Because he just wasn't that stupid.

484
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,316
He wouldn't run his mouth without knowing
who's on our side at the office

485
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,361
and who's employed by Head one, would he?

486
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,406
Paul didn't know about
this location either.

487
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,534
That's the reason
why he took Yeon Moyong from you.

488
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,162
And right here, right now…

489
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,833
[scoffs]

490
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,960
…I don't recognize
any of your little helpers.

491
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,348
So are you…

492
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,851
also with Head one?

493
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,396
Where is it? The Tyrant.

494
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,984
[grunting]

495
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,392
[gunshots continue in distance]

496
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,280
Well…

497
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,657
Looks like you made a mistake.

498
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,165
Now I'm the only one left.

499
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,167
Answer me.

500
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:44,877
Where is it?

501
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,546
Underground.

502
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,799
- [chuckles] What?
- You seem to know everything.

503
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,513
Although this time you guys were too late.

504
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,598
[chuckles]

505
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,853
We weren't.

506
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,897
This is just the beginning for you.

507
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,399
We'll figure everything out,

508
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,194
even if we have to dig into your brain

509
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,821
and break it down
into each of its components.

510
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,950
Let's see how well you withstand the pain.

511
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,839
Hey.

512
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,800
You look surprised.

513
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,553
How rude of you.

514
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,931
You think because I work behind a desk,

515
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,100
I couldn't pull it off.

516
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,184
Listen.

517
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,688
You really think
you can get away with this? Huh?

518
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,606
I don't.

519
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,857
Not at all.

520
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,112
I'm not an idiot.

521
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,200
Hey.

522
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,786
Director Choe.

523
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,625
You can't take anything from us this time.

524
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,669
The Tyrant is ours.

525
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,753
Let it go.

526
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,436
Goddamn it!

527
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,316
[gunshots]

528
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,046
[Jagyeong] As always, Dad was never wrong.

529
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,424
No one can predict what life will bring.

530
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,512
And you never know
where life will take you.

531
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,182
Plans are only wishful thinking.

532
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,435
Damn.

533
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,480
The sun's stronger than usual.

534
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,817
Looks like it's gonna be a long day.

535
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,278
But who are those bastards?

536
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,864
How long have they been there?

537
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:05,536
THE TYRANT

538
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,627
15 YEARS AGO

539
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,656
[bell jingles]

540
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,956
How'd you get here?

541
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,879
You alone?

542
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,134
Where's the head nun?

543
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,018
Come on in. It's cold out there.

544
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,385
You hungry?

545
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,557
Come on.

546
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,935
Let's clean you up.

547
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,937
Get us something to eat.
