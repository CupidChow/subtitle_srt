- [villager] Here you are. [laughs]
- [guest] Thank you.

46
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,610
My name is Hong Jinuk,
I work for Suwon Daily as a reporter.

47
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,404
Oh, okay. [chuckles]

48
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,365
Sorry, Mr. Hong. I feel bad.

49
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,409
You came all this way,
and he's such a mess…

50
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,160
Oh, no. It's okay. Don't worry about it.

51
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,995
You're fine.

52
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,581
I won't be long.
Just need to ask a few questions.

53
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,874
Oh, yeah.

54
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:01,421
I'm just glad someone is willing to listen
to what he has to say and believe him.

55
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,382
This might make him feel
a little bit better now.

56
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,717
So, what you're telling me is

57
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,887
none of the other villagers believe
what he's been saying?

58
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,597
Who's going to believe it?

59
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,474
Even I find it hard to believe.

60
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,311
They all say he must have
mistaken a wild boar for something else.

61
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,773
Wild boar come stampeding
their way down here every winter.

62
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,732
Huh.

63
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,235
Wild boars, huh?

64
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,237
Oh, on my way here,

65
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,158
I thought I saw that the rest
of the village has left for a trip today?

66
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,618
[chuckles] Out of nowhere, they told us

67
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,372
some generous soul paid for a trip
to the hot springs for the entire village.

68
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,210
It's strange that we're getting these
perks when it's not even election season.

69
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,880
If it wasn't for him,
I would have gone too.

70
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,797
Too bad.

71
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,551

was so unexpected, geez.

73
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,139
By the way, Mr. Hong. [chuckles]

74
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,891
About this interview…

75
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,894
How much could you pay us?

76
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,480
Uh…

77
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,232
Well, that depends
on the content, basically.

78
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,277
In this case, it may not be
a big amount, but I'll say…

79
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,197
we won't be too stingy with it either.

80
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,449
So no need to worry, huh?

81
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,783
- Of course not.
- Yes.

82
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,494

83
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,121

Sir?

00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,875
Sir.

86
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,084
Oh.

87
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,296
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to ask a couple questions.

88
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,548
- If you don't mind--
- Oh, ask him as many as you want.

89
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,883
[both chuckle]

90
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,428
About the thing you said you saw. Uh…

91
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,974
Hmm.

92
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,269

[villager] What's wrong?

98
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,744
- What's happening to him?
- So you did see it.

99
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,788
- [villager] Honey, pull yourself together.
- [choking]

100
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,998
Oh, God! What's wrong with your eyes?
Why are you doing that?

101
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,792
- Does he need water? What is it?
- [choking, gasping]

102
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,835
You need water? My God.
Just tell me what you want.

103
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,630
- What do you need? Just tell me.
- [choking, straining]

104
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,675
I can get it for you.
What do you want me to do?

105
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,677
Why are you doing that? No! Look at me.

106
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,555
- Look at me. You're scaring me.
- [continues choking, gasping]

107
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,390
What's wrong?
What's the matter? What's going on?

108
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,643
Come on. Come on.
Why are you doing this, for God's sake?

109
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,520
What is wrong with you? Tell me. Come on!

110

Hello, Mr. Seong?

137
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,288
Yeah, it's me.

138
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,542
I want to ask you…
It's that girl, Chae Jagyeong.

139
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,877
Yes, that Chae Jagyeong.

140
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,004
There's a bounty on her head, right?

141
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,883
I mean, she's alive for now.

142
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,718
Would she be worth more dead?

143
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,181
Oh. [chuckles]

144
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,017
Well, she does have a few stab wounds.

145
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,103
Mmm. The bullet just grazed her head.

146
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,981
Yeah.

147
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:21,402
The thing is, I have a feeling that
we're dealing with something major.

148
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,736
It sounds like payday,

149
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,822
doesn't it?

150
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,213
Chae Jagyeong is alive?

151
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,299
Yeah. The office just
received fresh intel.

152
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,302
She's at an underground clinic
the opposition uses.

153
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,845
So,

154
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,264
it's still operating.

155
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,724
Where is it?

156
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,309
[agent] Hongje-dong, Iryong Plaza.

157
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,645
- [manager] Did you dispatch a unit?
- ETA 10 minutes.

158
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,771
Tell 'em to hurry.

159
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,690
We gotta take her out
before the office gets there.

160
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,693
Make sure they handle it
as quietly as possible.

161

Is that you, Mr. Seong?

165
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,170
Wait, who's there--

166
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,229
Shit. Where is she?

167
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,986
[Jagyeong] Are you here for me?

168
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,245
Wow.

169
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,581
It's a pleasure.

170
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,043
You're Chae Jagyeong. Mr. Chae's daughter.

171
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,544
Who the hell are you guys?

172
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,130
That bastard Yeon Moyong sent you?

173
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,591
Good question. Does it matter?

174
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,093
You're gonna die soon anyway.

175
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,639
You know, I gotta say.
Really too bad about you two.

176
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,349
You and your dad.

177
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,394
You should have led a good life.
Spared yourselves from the likes of us.

178
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,645
Ah.

179
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,898
So, my dad…

180
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,192
You guys killed him?

181
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,860
- [goon 1 scoffs]
- Something funny?

182
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,278

Oh, you don't know me very well.

184
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,367
Let me show you.

185
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,204
[grunting, groaning]

186
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,878
- [straining]
- [grunts]

187
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,630
Damn. You fucking bitch!

188
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,801
- [straining]
- [grunting]

189
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,304
[goon 1 grunts]

190
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,432
[grunting, groaning continues]

191
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,939

192
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,775
[croaks]

[breathing heavily]

197
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,510
[groaning, spluttering]

198
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,636
What? What's wrong?

199
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,973
You still think it's funny?

200
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,475
What?

201
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,899
You should've led a good life and
spared yourselves from a bitch like me.

202
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,317
- [grunting]
- [spluttering]

203
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,807
[groans]

204
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,571
[groaning]

205
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,364
[Jagyeong] You fucking--

206
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,465
[exhales sharply]

207
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,225
[scoffs] Yeon Moyong, you son of a bitch.

208
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,106
What is this?

209
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,692
Ugh, just throw anything on.

210
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,779
Come on, I'm not being picky.

211
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,366
Look for yourself.
There's nothing to wear!

212
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,576
Oh, the stench…

213
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,411
Scumbag.

214
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,667
What? Just wear whatever.

215
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,504
[commentator chattering on TV]

216
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,538
[vehicles approaching]

217
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,956
[tires screech]

218
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,584
[footsteps approaching]

219
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:46,972
[police radio beeps]

220
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,126
[delivery person] Ah, shit. Hey, stop!

221
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,794
Thief! My truck!

222
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,880
[chattering, laughing on radio]

223
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,646
[switching radio stations]

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,232
[pop music plays on radio]

00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,714
[devices beeping]

226
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,142
[agent] We lost her.

227
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,814
[sighs]

228
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,944
Put Chae Jagyeong on Lim's list.

229
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,029
[all cheering, shouting]

230
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,370
[race caller] On the outside,
No.1 Monomono takes second place…

231
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,582
- [crowd clamoring]
- [race caller speaking indistinctly]

232
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,419
[bettor] Go! Go, go, go. Come on! Faster!

233
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,753
What are you doing? Let's go.

234
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,214
No. 3, No. 6, No. 3, No. 6!

235
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,217
- [bettor's date] Yeah.
- Yeah, it's the red horse. Let's go, yeah!

236
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,010
- [bettor cheering]
- [phone buzzes]

237
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,012
[bettor] Go! Go!

238
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,224
[clamoring continues]

239
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,936
FROM: THE OFFICE

240
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,568
- [race caller continues through speaker]
- [bettors chattering]

241
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,299
[sighs]

242
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,050
Hey, you out?

243
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,306
Hey, you.

244
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,976
[grunts]

245
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,103
[choking] Who are you?

246
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,688
[sighs]

247
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,067
This is why I never wanna work
with someone who's a gambler.

248
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,737
- You know?
- [breathing heavily]

249
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,156
See what I mean?

250
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,992
The lives around them are ruined.

251
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:03,543
I mean, with everything going on,
how can you even consider gambling?

252
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,048
All right.

253
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,300
Start driving.

254
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,683
[groaning]

255
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,227
[screams]

256
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,275
- Your eyes are next.
- [panting]

257
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,320
Just so you know,

258
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,657
I really hate repeating myself.

259
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,325
[breathing heavily]

260
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,543
I said, start driving.

261
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,128
Now.

262
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,460
You should eat.

263
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,046
The toast here is splendid.

264
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,011
Oh. The coffee's good here too.

265
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,095
And coffee beans…

266
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,557
These punks ground 'em to perfection.

267
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,350
The coffee's really smooth.

268
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,102
It's just coffee pods.

269
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,648
Well, I mean… No wonder.

270
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,401
Really smooth.

271
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,487
Too smooth.

272
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,742
You're really taking your sweet ass time.
How could you possibly have an appetite?

273
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,162
Why not? Why shouldn't I have an appetite?

274
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,288
This is so good.

275
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,415
[sighs]

276
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,042
You've had enough, I think.

277
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,711
Let's talk about
the Hae Dong Factory delivery incident.

278
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,129
What delivery?

279
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,756
You know what I mean.

280
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,300
The sample from the unauthorized program.

281
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,595
The operation you've been running
without the office's approval.

282
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,725
What's with this nonsense
during a perfectly delicious meal, hmm?

283
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,353
The office has already
taken over the factory.

284
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,938
Every money trail connected
to the factory has been blocked.

285
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,858
As we speak, we're conducting
an internal investigation

286
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,360
on you and your people.

287
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,528
But you already knew that, didn't you?

288
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,446
[burps]

289
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,036
So what about it?

290
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,580
What is it you want from me?

291
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,332
[sighs] Don't do this, Choe.

292
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,585
I need you to give us what you took.

293
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,838
Please tell me what it is
that you want me to return to you.

294
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,006
You have my word.

295
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,469
Nobody will be asking you or anybody else
to take responsibility for this matter.

296
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,262
Come on.

297
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,056
You want it in writing?

298
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,483
Okay. Sir, let me get this straight.

299
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,236
Hmm. So you're saying,

300
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,364
"Give up what you took
while I'm asking nicely.

301
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,700
Then, quietly resign.

302
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,537
We won't touch your damn severance pay
or pension, so you can take it and go."

303
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,372
Did I get that right?

304
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,040
[scoffs]

305
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,376
Good God, your generosity abounds.

306
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,921
You guys really racked your brains
over this one, hmm?

307
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,841
- Hey, you got a light?
- [sighs]

308
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,395
But I'm wondering
what's got you playing hardball.

309
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:54,065
- Oh, you got sponsors, huh? The Americans?
- Watch it, Director Choe.

310
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,108
[sucks teeth]

311
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,819
Head one?
It's Paul, isn't it? That bastard.

312
00:28:59,028 --> 00:28:59,904
Ah.

313
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,489
Knew it.

314
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,576
You couldn't be this bold
without their support.

315
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,205
So?

316
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,583
What is the angle here?

317
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:16,796
You recruited those idiots to eliminate
each and every one of us on your behalf.

318
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,799
Was that scumbag Paul gonna
get the whole project in return?

319
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,718
So he can serve it up to Head one?

320
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,137
You don't have to tell me. I get it.

321
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,057
Things here always seem to stay the same.

322
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:36,191
There's this thing that all our superiors
used to share with us all the time.

323
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,403
"It's always been obvious…

324
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,033
that there are a great number
of American assholes with dark hair

325
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,203
who are earning their monthly wage
from us here in Korea.

326
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,413
Yet their allegiance is
still to those bastards--

327
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,498
[hits table]

328
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,250
Careful, Director Choe.

329
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,512
Your eyeballs are about to pop out.
Relax, asshole.

330
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,597
- The fuck?
- If you want my respect,

331
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,516
you better earn it.

332
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,768
We both hold the same rank.

333
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,852
How dare you say anything--

334
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,271
Let's at least show
each other basic manners.

335
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,358
Oh, yeah… [clears throat]

336
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,401
…you're not arresting me, are you?

337
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,072
Thanks for the coffee.

338
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,825
Next time you call me,

339
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,369
bring me hard evidence
instead of wasting my time.

340
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,038
I'm busy too, you know, Director.

341
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,375
If you keep making false accusations,

342
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,837
I'll be compelled
to lodge a formal complaint.

343
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,926
Hey. I'm sure you know the investigation
into the delivery accident is almost done.

344
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,595
Your people have already been identified.

345
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,306
They've been put on the wanted list.

346
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,602
Wow. Very impressive, Mr. Sa.

347
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,689
[chuckles] So what?
Is my face on the list too?

348
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,483
It's only a matter of time.

349
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,653
We will capture your black ops team.

350
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,196
Oh, I see. Go right ahead.

351
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,532
Keep up the good work.

352
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,616
[clicks tongue]

353
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,539
Hey, where are your manners? Huh?

354
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,292
What the fuck happened
to respecting your superiors?

355
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,685
Oh, sorry.

356
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,855
Uh, it's fine. You go ahead.
