3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
Is there any way to help her?

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,280
Jet, are you with Master?

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,760
Ramphueng's messing with us.

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,320
There are 40 subjects of meditation.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,870
But it takes time to master each one.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,840
You came all the way here.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,000
Is there a reason for your visit?

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,920
I need your help, Master.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,800
Oh...

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,240
You're Pong, right?

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Master...

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,280
What about breakfast?

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm not hungry.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,720
I feel like
I've been making him uncomfortable.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,000
I think...

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,480
I won't bother Master anymore.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
What are you doing?

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,960
Prim?

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
When did you get here?

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,520
Don't you have any tutorial classes?

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
For today, no.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,120
Why are you here?

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,000
Did you miss me?

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
Come on.

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,160
My dad wanted to talk to Elder.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm just waiting for him.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,600
Is Auntie's tape broken?

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,000
This is how you listen to music now.

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,400
But that's not my mom's tape.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
Found it.

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,800
How did you know I like this song?

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,320
I just think it's such a beautiful song,

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
so I saved it.

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,160
♫Search your heart and tell me who,♫

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,040
♫Who can love you...♫

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,800
I miss Auntie.

39
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,840
♫Why keep your secrets?
Give me a clue♫

40
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:18,000
♫We're not strangers,
tell me what's true♫

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,120
Hey,

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,400
it's okay to cry sometimes.

43
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,160
Maybe it'll make the longing hurt less.

44
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,480
My grandpa told me that

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,880
to be a shaman who everyone relies on,

46
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,880
you can't let them see you cry.

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,760
But I'm not them.

48
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,800
Don't tell me that

49
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,400
once you become a shaman,

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,880
you'll hide your eyes
behind those glasses like Grand Master.

51
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,440
It's like he's trying to look cool.

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,840
I mean, his eyes
are just sensitive to sunlight.

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Anyway,

54
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,600
shamans are human, too.

55
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,560
They can think and feel anything,

56
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,820
and expressing it
should be okay, right?

57
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,080
And when you're with me,

58
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,360
don't even try to look cool.

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,920
You need to smile like this.

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,120
We can get the tape fixed later.

61
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
I'll find you a place.

62
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,160
Okay.

63
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,800
♫Please, please save your tears♫

64
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,120
♫If your love's for him,
just erase me here♫

65
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,580
So you can check it out together

66
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,620
'cause you're all seniors now.

67
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,880
I just want it to look better,
you know...

68
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,320
I want this to be flawless.
The team leaders should be in...

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,960
Whoa.

70
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,200
Hello.

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,710
This is amazing.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,360
They'll even perform a play.

73
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,760
Oh...

74
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,480
Hello, Master.

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
- Hello, guys.
- Hello.

76
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,560
Hi.

77
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,080
Thanks for giving us a ride.

78
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,280
No problem.

79
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,520
The students are setting up the scene,

80
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,240
so it'll be a while before we start.

81
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:34,920
Okay.

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,240
Then, please take me to them.

83
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
This way, please.

84
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,920
Right, Jet.

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,159
In the meantime, have your friends
ask the local spirits for permission.

86
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,020
They're outsiders.

87
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,520
Doing something wrong
could cause problems.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,360
Okay.

89
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,200
This is where the massacre took place.

90
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,200
When they crushed
the Holy Man's Rebellion,

91
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,680
countless people were killed.

92
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,320
Whoa,

93
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,040
so they're doing it in the actual field?

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,040
The spirits here

95
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,440
were accused of being rebels

96
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,240
and then killed.

97
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,010
They called themselves the 'Holy Man,'

98
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,440
but...

99
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,460
the government of Siam
called them 'Phi Bun ghosts'

100
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,040
before they even became ones.

101
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,800
Oh, I just found out about that.

102
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,880
They don't really teach
this part of history, do they?

103
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,560
You can sense it, right?

104
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,440
Yeah.

105
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
It's nothing.

106
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,260
The students are just using the place
to tell the story of their ancestors.

107
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,680
We just need to ask for permission

108
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
and let the spirits know
we mean no harm.

109
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,720
Keep this in mind.

110
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,800
You're using their place.

111
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,720
When you're done,

112
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,200
make sure to clean it up

113
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,840
so they don't get bothered.

114
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Good luck.

115
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,560
Alright, you can now dress up.

116
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,840
Since we have some time,

117
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,960
do you want a break?

118
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,000
There's a temple near here.

119
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Come take a break with me there.

120
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,800
I'll be around here,

121
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,240
and you can help out the students.

122
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,280
Professor,

123
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,040
where should I display these paintings
from the fine art students?

124
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
Thought you wouldn't ask.

125
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,800
Come with me.

126
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
I gotta go now.

127
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,720
Master.

128
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Well,

129
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,400
I just realized that

130
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,520
if there are spirits here,

131
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
will Ramphueng be able to control them?

132
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,800
And...

133
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
should I leave now?

134
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
She can't do anything.

135
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,040
What do you mean?

136
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
You'll see.

137
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,280
You're not feeling comfortable
right now, are you?

138
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
Yes.

139
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,120
Grand Master Sek's amulet...

140
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Your wrist.

141
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,520
I'm only lending it to you.

142
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,360
Don't ever lose it.

143
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,120
Yes, Master.

144
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,600
Pang!

145
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,520
I told you to use the ladder!

146
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,720
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry!

147
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,640
Are you alright?

148
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
- Whoa...
- Paran!

149
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,680
Is everyone okay?

150
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,520
You should ask yourself.

151
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Let me see.

152
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Please have his wound treated,
Professor.

154
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,800
We'll take care of things here.

155
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,280
It's okay. This is nothing.

156
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,400
Nothing, you say?

157
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,080
It can be infected.

158
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,440
Khem is right.

159
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,740
Let's get your wound treated.

160
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,040
Come on.

161
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,440
Gosh...

162
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,480
What can I do?

163
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Oh, my...

164
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Gosh!

165
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Do you happen to have any photos of it?

166
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,880
I think I can help recreate that.

167
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Thanks.

168
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,280
Thank you so much for saving me,

169
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
and I'm sorry
for calling you by your name.

170
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
It's totally okay.

171
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,480
We were friends
before I became a shaman.

172
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,920
Okay.

173
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Well,

174
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,440
I wasn't comfortable around you at first

175
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,520
'cause I wasn't sure
if I was making you uncomfortable.

176
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,280
But you're still so kind to me, Paran.

177
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,880
You needed my help.

178
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,680
If that's what a shaman should do,

179
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,600
I'm willing to help.

180
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,720
I wasn't talking about today,

181
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,680
but us.

182
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,640
Found you!

183
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,440
You're actually here.

184
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,800
You could've just sent me a picture.

185
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,800
What? You said you needed it right away.

186
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,280
What is it, though?

187
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Is it important?

188
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,520
Yeah, it's a speech

189
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,720
I wrote for my students.

190
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,720
Give it to me.

191
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,040
Thanks.

192
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,600
Okay.

193
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,880
Hi, Master.

194
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,360
I guess you got yourself hurt
instead of me.

195
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Hey!

196
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,680
Watch your language.

197
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,080
He saved me.

198
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Sorry.

199
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,200
I'll go help the kids, then.

200
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,400
Help them. Don't mess with them.

201
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,640
I know. I won't.

202
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,480
Anyway, please take care of my sister.

203
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Pong just keeps joking around

204
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,200
like he always does.

205
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,360
He hasn't changed at all.

206
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,640
Neither have you, Prim.

207
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,840
Still getting physical like before.

208
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Uh...

209
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,280
after this project,

210
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,500
I have something to talk to you about.

211
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,960
You'll end up sunburned all over.

212
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Sorry?

213
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Oh...

214
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,760
Nothing.

215
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
He literally offers help to everyone.

216
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,360
Instead of enjoying our time here,

217
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,280
he's now working on a painting.

218
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,080
Just let him.

219
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,560
Which color do you want to take?

220
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,360
Well...

221
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Just take all of them.

222
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,960
Grab one or two each.

223
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
Let's see
if they're all still good, then,

224
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,080
- so we don't bring the bad ones.
- Yeah.

225
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,520
This one's dry.

226
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,360
Why did they bring the bad ones anyway?

227
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,320
But these are the primary colors,

228
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,680
so we can probably mix them.

229
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Let me try.

230
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,440
Hey...

231
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,480
What are you doing?

232
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,920
My glasses are now messed up.

233
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Whoa,

234
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,360
has anyone ever told you that

235
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,560
you look so good without your glasses?

236
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,440
Give me some more time.

237
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
You're so gorgeous
without your glasses.

238
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,040
Come on, Jin.

239
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,720
Jet!

240
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
I'm not gonna fall for it.

241
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,880
Let's just go.

242
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,080
They're waiting for us.

243
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,440
Jin again?

244
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,800
Jin who?

245
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,680
Jin Carrey?

246
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,890
We are here today

247
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,720
to remind ourselves of the injustice

248
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,280
that cost the lives of people

249
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,480
who fought for equality

250
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,680
through our play,

251
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,000
as we were born and grew up here,

252
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,840
in a place where the bloodshed

253
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,200
has long been buried beneath the land.

254
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,840
Khemjira...

255
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,520
So that is Ramphueng?

256
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,520
Thanks to all of you
for letting me have a fun time.

257
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Master,

258
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,960
you're not gonna do anything?

259
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Master!

260
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,240
How did you do that?

261
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,120
You didn't even cast any spells.

262
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,280
It wasn't me,

263
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,440
but them.

264
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,880
The holy men were once
people of great power.

265
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Any spirit that disrespects them

266
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,480
shall face the consequences.

267
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,920
♫I shall vanquish them all,
the wicked kin♫

268
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:31,560
♫I shall now rise
to defeat all that's wicked within♫

269
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,560
We sincerely hope
that you will pass this story on.

270
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,210
The honor of the Holy Man

271
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,600
must not die along with them.

272
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,160
We wish you all the best.

273
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,120
Why are you smiling, Khem?

274
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,760
I wish everyone could see what I see.

275
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,240
The play...

276
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,520
must mean a lot to them.

277
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,360
They brought about changes,

278
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,800
but were erased.

279
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,160
To be remembered

280
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,160
must feel really good.

281
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
I may have failed this time,

282
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,240
but next time...

283
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,000
I won't let you get away.

284
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,960
Some water, Master.

285
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Thanks.

286
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,760
Today's play was excellent, Prim.

287
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,720
I've already called the driver.

288
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,360
He should be coming soon.

289
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,240
If you have something to say,
just say it.

290
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,440
Consider me a friend.

291
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,100
I've got a question

292
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
that's been bothering me for some time.

293
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,440
Do I still have a chance
with you, Paran?

294
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,400
I know

295
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,760
that we're not as close as we were.

296
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
You've become a shaman, but I...

297
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,720
I've never stopped loving you.

298
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,680
Prim,

299
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
but we've always been friends.

300
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm so silly.

301
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,880
I don't want to be this way, either.

302
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,480
I hope you really think this over

303
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,140
and see if you can give me a chance.

304
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
At least...

305
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,240
I hope you accept this.

306
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,360
Khem!

307
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
Is something wrong?

308
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Uh...

309
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,780
Pong's taking me
to the temple fair tonight,

310
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,120
so I was gonna ask for your permission.

311
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,080
Just the two of you?

312
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,220
Jet and Charn are coming, too.

313
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,860
How are you gonna go?

314
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
Well...

315
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,840
Pong's gonna pick us up later.

316
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
If you're not okay with it,

317
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,920
you can let me know.

318
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,240
Just go if you want.

319
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,000
You didn't even need to ask me.

320
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,240
- I'm not your guardian.
- But you had so many questions.

321
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,880
You can tell me if you're not okay.

322
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,640
I'll listen to you anyway.

323
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,400
You guys are not kids anymore.

324
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,000
Just go if you want.

325
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,860
- Thank you.
- If anything goes wrong,

326
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,880
Pong will be the first one I blame

327
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,400
since he's the oldest.

328
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,520
Make sure he takes care of you.

329
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,600
Right...

330
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,120
Your amulet.

331
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,120
Don't take it off yet.

332
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,320
Return it to me after you come back.

333
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,420
Khem...

334
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,380
Don't stay out too late.

335
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,000
Come on, Pong.

336
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,199
I thought we'd get to ride
in a fancy car.

337
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,760
As kids of an MP and a village head,

338
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,280
if we drove a fancy car
to the temple fair,

339
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
people would think
we were trying to show off.

340
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,000
Well, I thought that was what
you were trying to do.

341
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,639
Come on, get in the car.

342
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,719
Wait, but Khem...

343
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,440
The passenger seat is yours.

344
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,639
Please check the maps for me.

345
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,040
Hey, don't bother him.

346
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,480
Leave it to me. I'm from here.

347
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,800
It's okay.

348
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
I'll take the seat.

349
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
You should be with Charn.

350
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,280
Could it be that
Khem is giving Pong a chance?

351
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Stop that.

352
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
Abandon your ship now.

353
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,320
I'm not boarding that ship of yours.

354
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Come on, just go.

355
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,280
So...

356
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,640
anything you want to try at the fair?

357
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,480
Maybe...

358
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,320
some buttered corn.

359
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,600
Buttered corn?

360
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,880
Ake, keep an eye on them,

361
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,920
and let Thong know what's going on.

362
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,880
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

363
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,800
If they split up,

364
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,480
who should I keep an eye on?

365
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,600
We've taken a break from this
for too long, huh?

366
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Yummy buttered corn right here!

367
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,920
Jeez, if they're this slow,

368
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,320
it'll get dark before we get it.

369
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,400
Hey!

370
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Let's play the balloon dart game!

371
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,120
Twenty baht for three darts.

372
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Twenty for three?

373
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,050
I wanna try that, too.

374
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,600
Throw it.

375
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,320
- Oh...
- Jeez, Charn!

376
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,800
Let Khem try it.

377
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,920
- I don't know how.
- Come on, give it a shot.

378
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,000
Just throw it. They're all the same.

379
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,680
- Whoa!
- Hey, do you even have any strength?

380
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,400
That was close, Jet!

381
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,560
It's okay.

382
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,920
Wanna get more darts?

383
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,720
How many?

384
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,280
- What about a single one?
- When did you get here?

385
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,520
Let's get some popsicles over there.

386
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,160
Whoa, this boy is too good at this.

387
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,840
Whoa,

388
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,880
they've got nice clothes here.

389
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
The length is just perfect.

390
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,840
One set of spring rolls, please.

391
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,070
Here.

392
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:07,240
Hello to all the fans of
Morlam Sing: the Sounds of Isaan!

393
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,080
Yes, morlam!

394
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,320
Come on, guys.

395
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,840
Let's go dance by the stage.

396
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,440
I'll pass, Jet.

397
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,080
- What?
- I don't like crowds.

398
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'll pass, too.

399
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,520
Dancing with you is too risky.

400
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,680
You come with me, then.

401
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Hold on, Jet!

402
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
I'm introverted.

403
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,440
That's not true.

404
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,240
If you were, you wouldn't be here.

405
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Come on now.

406
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,800
Wait, Pong...

407
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,560
What did you mean by risky?

408
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,780
Why is dancing with him risky?

409
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
What should we do, then?

410
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,720
Looks like everyone came as couples.

411
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, so did we.

412
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
We're two individuals, Pong.

413
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,640
I'm not with him.

414
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,040
I don't know him.

415
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,560
We're strangers.

416
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,800
No, I don't know him at all.

417
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Jettana... Wait, no.
I don't know his name.

418
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,880
I really don't know him.

419
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,760
Life is short, man.

420
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,360
Just enjoy it while you can.

421
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,440
Don't blame me
for not telling you, then.

422
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,040
Come on.

423
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,240
Come on, dance.

424
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,920
Like this. Here.

425
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Just kick.

426
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,040
♫Don't know
what kind of spell you cast,♫

427
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:32,630
♫But it makes my heart beat so fast,♫

428
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:39,280
♫Losing myself whenever you walk past♫

429
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,240
♫Is this the love
that will forever last?♫

430
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,480
♫Is this love?♫

431
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,680
♫Is this love?♫

432
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,880
♫Is this love?♫

433
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:07,200
♫Is this the love
that will forever last?♫

434
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,880
Pong's so scared of ghosts

435
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,800
that he's holding Khem's arm tight.

436
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
That's enough.

437
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,080
You're supposed to watch out for danger.

438
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,840
I don't care about this stuff.

439
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,320
Yet you're all ears, Master.

440
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,400
Khem!

441
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Khem, you're okay, right?

442
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,600
We're outside now.

443
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,720
No need to be scared anymore.

444
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,960
Are you shocked?

445
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,880
Khem,

446
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,760
don't be scared, okay?

447
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,920
Pong!

448
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,640
Pong...

449
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,000
Wait...

450
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,440
Oh...

451
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,360
Sorry.

452
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,400
You...

453
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,920
You're not scared of ghosts?

454
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Well...

455
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,920
The ones I've experienced
were way scarier.

456
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,560
Oh...

457
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,560
The haunted houses in Bangkok
must be really well done, right?

458
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,080
Yeah.

459
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,600
Jet and Charn are probably dancing.

460
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,520
Should we find a place to wind down?

461
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,480
Up there.

462
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,920
Uh...

463
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,940
Actually, just strolling around here
feels alright.

464
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,560
Are you tired, though?

465
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,520
- Should we go over there?
- Hey.

466
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
Actually,

467
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,440
I have something to tell you,

468
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,440
and I think up there
would be a great place to do it.

469
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,120
Let's go before the line gets long.

470
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,520
Uh...

471
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,520
I mean...

472
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,280
Pong,

473
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,960
I...

474
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
Well,

475
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,140
what you want to tell me...

476
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,160
I just think...

477
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,680
it's best if you keep it to yourself.

478
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
Oh...

479
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,200
I see.

480
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,960
Already got a no, huh?

481
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,480
We haven't reached paradise yet.

482
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
I'm...

483
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,160
sorry for disappointing you,

484
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,160
but I really see you
as a kind older brother.

485
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,320
And right now,

486
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,680
I'm actually going through a lot.

487
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,120
- Also...
- Is that actually the reason,

488
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,800
or is your heart already taken?

489
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
So refreshing.

490
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,160
Haven't danced in a while.

491
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,220
I'm surprised you haven't.

492
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,520
By the way, where's Khem?

493
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,980
He's with Pong.

494
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
I know who he's with,

495
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,900
but where are they?

496
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,060
I've got a weird feeling

497
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,700
that something might happen.

498
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,420
What could it be?

499
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,020
Ramphueng was just dealt with
this morning.

500
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,960
Forget it. It's okay.

501
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,100
It's none of my business, is it?

502
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,560
Uh...

503
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,440
You yelled so loudly just now.

504
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,880
Your throat must be sore.

505
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,000
How about...

506
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,680
we go get some drinks from that stall?

507
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,400
Come on.

508
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,560
Hey, hey!

509
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,160
Aw, man.

510
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,880
- Kla?
- Hey,

511
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,560
thought it was someone else.

512
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,440
Turns out it's my buddy, Pong.

513
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,710
- Aw, buddy!
- Aw, buddy!

514
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,830
Hey, bro.

515
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,400
You're on a date?

516
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,280
I'm busy.

517
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,200
Excuse us.

518
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,000
Hey!

519
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,950
- Come on.
- What's the rush?

520
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,200
What's the hurry, man?

521
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,360
You're enjoying yourself now.

522
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,000
Are you all set and ready to fight me?

523
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,240
- Aw!
- Are you? We're so ready to fight.

524
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,480
I think...

525
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,000
you should save the talking
for the ring.

526
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,680
I'm not interested
in talking to a loudmouth.

527
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,240
I may be a loudmouth,

528
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,760
but I sure can bust
that mouth of yours.

529
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,280
- He can get your mouth busted!
- He can get your mouth busted!

530
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,040
You brave enough?

531
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,160
- You ready?
- Uh...

532
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,680
It might be better if we split up.

533
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,280
Staying here could bother everyone.

534
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,920
Bother everyone?

535
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,240
Everyone who?

536
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,040
Are you a life coach or something?

537
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,940
You think you can boss me around?

538
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,360
I asked if you're a life coach.

539
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,760
What's your problem?

540
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,640
Hey, hey!

541
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,000
- Run!
- You bastard!

542
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,440
Get them now!

543
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,080
Jet, run!

544
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,200
Jet, Charn, come on.

545
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,520
Now!

546
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,120
Hey,

547
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,120
are you the MP's son?

548
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,040
I see.

549
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,480
You're with them, huh?

550
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,480
Oh!

551
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,200
Hi, Kla.

552
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,720
It's been a while, huh?

553
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,880
Get ready to run.

554
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,760
This is Kla,

555
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
- Pong's rival...
- You'd better hurry, Jet.

556
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,000
Your buddy's gone.

557
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,560
Gosh...

558
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,080
You're so fast
now that you trust your gut.

559
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,110
See you, man.

560
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,150
Hey!

561
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,400
Turn into wasps!

562
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,480
Hey,

563
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,000
what did you do to them?

564
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,280
They messed with me,

565
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,360
and even with Khem,

566
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,000
so I gave him a punch.

567
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,040
Fuck!

568
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,080
Khem,

569
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,240
are you alright?

570
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,400
Come on, it was nothing.

571
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,560
You guys were too impatient.

572
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,920
Forget it.

573
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,340
They've probably stopped.

574
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,760
They haven't.

575
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,200
Here they are.

576
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,960
What is that?

577
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,400
Phayon.

578
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,520
It's black magic.

579
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,160
Only the intended targets can see it.

580
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,520
Master,

581
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,000
Ake told me
something serious has come up.

582
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,400
Pong,

583
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,040
you still got your Zippo with you?

584
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,200
Clear the way for everyone.

585
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,760
Guys, just go with Pong.

586
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,520
What about you?

587
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,400
Don't worry about me.

588
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,800
My magic is the most powerful here.

589
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:12,840
Pong,

590
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,080
there's no time.

591
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,280
- Do it now.
- Jet!

592
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,640
- Jet!
- Jet...

593
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,320
Come!

594
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,320
That's sick, boss!

595
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,920
Why did nothing happen?

596
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,400
Hey!

597
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,440
Why didn't you go with them?

598
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,400
Jeez, the MP's son is running away.

599
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,800
- Get him!
- Get him!

600
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,320
- Goddammit.
- Stop now!

601
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,280
Hey!

602
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,560
Hey,

603
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,520
this time, you'll be bedridden

604
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,800
and never get to fight again.

605
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,800
Argh!

606
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,560
Take a look. Are they here?

607
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,110
- I'll make sure to beat them up good.
- You're around here?

608
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,760
- Check under the cars.
- You'd better hide well,

609
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,360
- Come on, hurry.
- or I won't let you go.

610
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,440
- Where are you?
- Stop rushing me.

611
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,520
Just find them!

612
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,470
You should hurry up!

613
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,360
Where the fuck are they?

614
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,800
Hey, where are you?

615
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Are you okay?

616
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,280
I'm fine.

617
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,520
Master's Lek Lai!

618
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,660
You were almost doomed!

619
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,360
I already checked here.

620
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Are you okay?

621
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,160
Were you stung anywhere?

622
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,360
Oh, no.

623
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
I'm alright.

624
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,280
Jet, they're gone.

625
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Wait, you're also here?

626
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,040
Don't worry.

627
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,080
Master's magic is protecting everyone.

628
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,560
I'll be back for this.

629
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,800
- Khem!
- Pong...

630
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,400
- Khem!
- Pong!

631
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Are you okay?

632
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,160
I'm fine,

633
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,580
but Pong's not.

634
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,240
- Pong!
- Hey!

635
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,640
Let's take him to Master
and have the spell removed.

636
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,760
- Come on.
- Let's go.

637
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,840
The spell is already removed.

638
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,200
He just needs time to recover.

639
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,720
So...

640
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,000
you keep an eye on him tonight, then.

641
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,800
Charn and I will sleep somewhere else.

642
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,600
But...

643
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,440
All of us won't fit in here.

644
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,320
Let's go.

645
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,040
Uh...

646
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,040
I actually bought you some spring rolls.

647
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,600
I even got the vegetarian ones,

648
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,600
but I came back too late,

649
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,320
so...

650
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
they're all soggy now.

651
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,000
I'll eat them.

652
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,200
Put them on a plate for me.

653
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,680
Okay.

654
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,800
What's wrong with you?

655
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,840
Uh...

656
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,200
I'm not used to
sharing a room with someone.

657
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,320
That's nonsense.

658
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,440
We've been sharing a room
this whole time.

659
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,160
Well...

660
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,760
But this is just us.

661
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,720
Uh... I mean...

662
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,720
Nothing. I mean nothing.

663
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,400
Just say it.

664
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,800
What are you hiding from me?

665
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,920
I'm hiding nothing.

666
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Lately, you've been acting damn strange.

667
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,440
Does it...

668
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,960
have something to do with Jin?

669
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,920
You keep saying that name in your sleep.

670
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,100
Anyway,

671
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,440
who's Jin?

672
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,960
Your lover?

673
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,400
Are you jealous of me?

674
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,520
Don't try to change the topic.

675
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,800
Tell me all of it.

676
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,720
It's ready, Master.

677
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,080
Reach your hand out and catch it.

678
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,240
So this is...

679
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,200
what saved me, right?

680
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,920
Thank you, Master.

681
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,300
What's that?

682
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,560
What, Master?

683
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
On your back.

684
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,480
How did you get that wound?

685
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,320
Uh...

686
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,080
Well...

687
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,360
Someone threw a rock at me.

688
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,280
Nothing serious.

689
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,720
Let me see it.

690
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,680
Oh, my God!

691
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,800
So...

692
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,800
we were Khem's best friends
in our past lives,

693
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,840
and we even dated without Khem knowing.

694
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,660
What a typical drama plot.

695
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,480
What are you so worried about?

696
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,800
We're not dating now.

697
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,720
- Worried I'll sleep with you?
- I'm worried about myself.

698
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,440
I'm worried
I won't be able to control it.

699
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,520
I'm not even sure if...

700
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,800
these feelings are from my past life
or this one.

701
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,320
This one?

702
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,760
- Do you...
- I'm sorry.

703
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,120
I can't figure it out myself,

704
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,240
unlike Khem.

705
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,360
If you feel uncomfortable,

706
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,540
I can go meditate outside.

707
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,760
Don't assume things.

708
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,240
Who said I was uncomfortable?

709
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,560
What did you just say?

710
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,480
Well,

711
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,910
I don't really know what I'm feeling,

712
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,440
but you've been helping me.

713
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,440
But I also cursed at you.

714
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,120
But you're still nice to me.

715
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,320
You even mess with me sometimes,

716
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,680
but maybe I started it.

717
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,280
Shit, what did I just say?

718
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,680
I'm sorry.

719
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,640
How was it?

720
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,240
How was...

721
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,760
How was what?

722
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,960
Jeez,

723
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,400
do I have to say everything?

724
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,240
What I did...

725
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,800
Did you like it?

726
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,400
I don't know!

727
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,440
It was too fast.

728
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,680
I want to try it again

729
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,520
to make sure my hypothesis is right.

730
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,360
Is it better this way?

731
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,640
We'll see.

732
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,360
Jet...

733
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,800
Is it this bad?

734
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,480
Master!

735
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,160
Master...

736
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Turn around.

737
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,180
Uh...

738
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,860
It's okay.

739
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:22,800
I can do it myself.

740
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,920
Turn around.

741
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:22,899
Uh...

742
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,260
Are you mad, Master?

743
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,020
I am.

744
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,460
I'm sorry.

745
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,620
Not at you.

746
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,600
But at Pong

747
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:58,100
for taking you
and not keeping you safe.

748
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:06,060
I'm mad at those who did this to you.

749
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,319
And I'm mad at myself.

750
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,140
What do you mean, Master?

751
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,819
You came to me for help

752
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:29,220
and are staying under my roof.

753
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,840
That makes you mine now.

754
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,300
I've helped you many times,

755
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,700
not for someone to hurt you like this.

756
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,200
Master...

757
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,120
♫Dear today's breeze, drifting by,♫

758
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,760
♫Dear tonight's moon in the sky,♫

759
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,240
♫Please hear my plea, my tender cry,♫

760
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,080
♫Let me stay forever by your side,♫

761
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:04,480
♫Through endless time,
may our love never die♫

762
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,600
Hi, guys.

763
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,600
Master, Prim's here.

764
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,750
Are you ready to give me an answer?

765
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,840
I...

766
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:22,980
Master,

767
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,680
if you lose him,

768
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,600
you'll regret it.

769
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,870
Stop it, Charn.

770
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:29,430
We're not by ourselves.

771
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:31,600
Let's just talk about this later.

772
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,120
My face's up here.

773
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,230
In fact, both Jet and Charn

774
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:40,680
have been bound to you
since your past life.

775
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,480
Perhaps...

776
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,560
it's time for us
to recall our previous lives.

777
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,920
♫No matter how long time's passed,
you still have me♫

778
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:59,000
♫Through storms and stars,
together we shall be♫

779
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,080
♫Even if nightmares come,
we shall make them flee♫

780
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,880
♫With our hearts aligned,
we'll win gracefully♫

781
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:14,220
♫You still have me,
we're destined for eternity♫

782
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:19,440
♫Through storms and stars,
together we shall be♫

783
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:24,560
♫Even if nightmares come,

784
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:36,200
♫With our hearts aligned,
