3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,540
What has he done to you?

4
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,920
Can't you just let him go?

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,360
I shall never let him go.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,840
This is Charn,

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,850
also a junior.

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,650
This is Jet,

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,690
my best friend.

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,330
We've gone through this bamboo grove
over and over.

11
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,080
My duty

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,760
is to take care
of the people in this village.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,210
I'll do whatever it takes
to stop being an outsider in your eyes.

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,430
The Peace Treaty
[1937]

15
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,440
between Thailand and France

16
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,360
was signed in Tokyo, Japan,

17
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,920
following the Indochina War.

18
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,520
Mother, Father,

19
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,120
I'd like to let you know something.

20
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,960
Khem and I...

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,200
We're engaged, Mom!

22
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,240
Sweetie, mind your manners.

23
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,880
There are people watching.

24
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,920
No worries at all.

25
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,360
We'll soon be one family anyway.

26
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,280
The ring Khem has on...

27
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,920
Wat's grandfather used it
to propose to his grandmother

28
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,760
before he left for military service.

29
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,040
And later, his father used it
to propose to me.

30
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,600
So you can be sure that you're destined

31
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,480
to be my daughter-in-law.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,280
Okay, Father.

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
Didn't take long, did it?

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,440
You're already
calling Colonel "Father," sweetie.

35
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,960
I don't mind at all.

36
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,320
We're just as delighted

37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,160
to have Khemmika join our son's life.

38
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,960
That's right.

39
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,400
You can speak to me casually, okay?

40
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,040
Okay.

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,360
- She's so sweet.
- Right.

42
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,160
Chayod,

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm officially your sister-in-law now.

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,279
[December, 1941]

45
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,680
Some desserts, girls.

46
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,680
Those look fantastic.

47
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,280
Look, now that Khem has her own place,

48
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,800
we can have sleepovers more often,

49
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,720
just like when we were in school!

50
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,040
Calm down a bit, Jin.

51
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,800
This is Khem's place, not yours.

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,320
And keep that fascinator on.

53
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,480
It's the leader's
latest fashion, you know.

54
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,320
Alright, Miss Chayada.

55
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,640
I apologize for causing you
any displeasure.

56
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,320
You guys really need to
come hang out with me often.

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
I hope to keep this place cheerful.

58
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,960
- Khem...
- Yes?

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,360
Wat's definitely in a hurry.

60
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,160
He's proposed, has a home for you,
and will marry you after you graduate.

61
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,680
Can you believe that?

62
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,400
I'd say it's our friend...

63
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,000
that's in a hurry.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,240
What made you wanna marry so soon?

65
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,480
To be honest,

66
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
I just feel like...

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
I couldn't find...

68
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,240
a better man than Wat in this life.

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,800
- Aw!
- Aw!

70
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,200
The Japanese Ambassador to Thailand
has issued an ultimatum

71
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,840
to the government
[Wartime Draft Notice]

72
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,440
that if the leader does not authorize

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,000
the Japanese Navy
to traverse Thai territory

74
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,240
by 10 o'clock today, Japan will initiate
an assault on Thailand...

75
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,480
Does Khem know about this yet?

76
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,640
Our parents still don't know.

77
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,840
Only you do.

78
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,200
This is serious, Wat.

79
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
Didn't you catch the news?

80
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,160
They're coming in full force.

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Military doctors are scarce in Thailand.

82
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,840
I must fulfill my duty.

83
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
What about your wedding to Khem?

84
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,159
My biggest concern is her health.

85
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,680
Her heart valve regurgitation
could worsen at any time.

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,520
Yod,

87
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,080
you've known her for a long time,

88
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,840
even longer than I have.

89
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Can I leave her in your care?

90
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,320
What do you mean?

91
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
I want you to look after her

92
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
and keep her company while I'm away.

93
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,680
I'll try to come back as soon as I can.

94
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,720
You don't need to worry.

95
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,600
I've known Khem
even before you met her.

96
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll make sure she's happy.

97
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,960
Make sure everything's secured.

98
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,160
Don't worry, Wat.

99
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
I'll come by to see Khem all the time

100
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,840
so she never feels alone.

101
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,120
With someone as talkative as Jin around,

102
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,640
she will be too annoyed
to ever feel lonely.

103
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
Ouch!

104
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,640
- Da!
- Thanks, Jin, Da.

105
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,560
I'll come back
before she can't handle you.

106
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,159
Right,

107
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,240
make sure Khem eats
and takes her meds on time.

108
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,400
If anything happens to her
while I'm gone,

109
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,840
you'll be in big trouble.

110
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
Come on,

111
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,000
is that how a big brother says goodbye
to his little brother?

112
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Take care of her.

113
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,440
You said you wouldn't cry.

114
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm just going to work, not to die.

115
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,920
I tried.

116
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,200
But ever since
we've known each other,

117
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,760
I've never had to be away
from you this long.

118
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,720
I'll write to you every day,

119
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
so it feels like I'm always with you.

120
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,760
I'll be waiting for you.

121
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,520
I'll be back as soon as I can.

122
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,840
Promise me
you'll take good care of yourself.

123
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,540
I promise.

124
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,320
It's gonna be alright.

125
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,280
How am I supposed to live after this?

126
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,200
Let's go inside.

127
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,320
Dinner is ready, Khem.

128
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,640
Just a moment!

129
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Whoa, Yod.

130
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,760
What a fancy meal.

131
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,920
Is there some special occasion
or something?

132
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Well...

133
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,040
The head of my department is retiring

134
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,480
and wants me to take over the position.

135
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,280
Really?

136
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,740
Congrats.

137
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,880
At such a young age,

138
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,870
you're already holding
such a high position.

139
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm happy for you, Mr. Yod.

140
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,440
Why are you on one knee?

141
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,920
Get up.

142
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,080
Marry me, Khem.

143
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,560
Come on,

144
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,650
stop messing around.

145
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,920
Get up now.

146
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
Let's just have dinner.

147
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,670
Come on.

148
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,970
I'm being serious, Khem.

149
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,720
Wat asked me to look after you.

150
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,840
It's been over a year,

151
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,680
and he still shows
no sign of coming back.

152
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,320
But you can't marry me

153
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,040
just because you're taking care of me.

154
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,340
It's not right, Yod.

155
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,680
That's not the only reason, Khem.

156
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,760
Can't you really tell
how I feel about you?

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Look into my eyes.

158
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Do you really think
I've been good to you

159
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,160
just because I'm Wat's brother?

160
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Stop it, Yod.

161
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Just find someone better than me.

162
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,560
Khem!

163
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,280
There's no one like that.

164
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
And nothing will ever change.

165
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
This house is still your home.

166
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,160
My parents will still love you.

167
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Please, Khem.

168
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,760
Please marry me.

169
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,480
Stop it, Yod.

170
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sorry,

171
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
but my love is for Wat.

172
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,200
Even if he never comes back,

173
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,920
I'll keep waiting for him.

174
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I've loved Khem

175
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,480
long before she even met you.

176
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,800
He doesn't even know who you are.

177
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,510
This will only bring him more pain.

178
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Let him go.

179
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,680
He's not the Khemmika you knew.

180
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
You were part of the reason she died.

181
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
You chose duty over her.

182
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,560
I'm taking Khem with me.

183
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,800
Forgive me for what I have to do.

184
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,520
- You think you could've set foot in here
- Let me go.

185
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,920
if I hadn't allowed it?

186
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Spying isn't very nice, you know.

187
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,760
We're sorry, Khem.

188
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,580
You didn't have to go that far, Ake.

189
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,120
But Master told us
to keep everyone else out.

190
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,680
What are you doing?

191
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
They're Thong and Ake,

192
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,440
my spirit servants.

193
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,280
- Hello, Khem.
- Hello, Khem.

194
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Hi.

195
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Go back to sleep.

196
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Hold on, Master.

197
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,520
Do you know that spirit?

198
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,560
It's none of your business.

199
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,280
How is it not?

200
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,160
You literally said,

201
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,680
"He's not the Khemmika you knew."

202
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,920
You talked about me, didn't you?

203
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,040
And who's Khemmika?

204
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,480
Last time, things went wrong

205
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,920
because you stuck your nose
into someone else's mess.

206
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,880
Now, you've screwed things up again.

207
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Just go to bed

208
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,000
and stay out of my business.

209
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Master!

210
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,560
Can't we talk nicely just for once?

211
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,840
You're crossing the line.

212
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
I gave in on everything else,

213
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,560
but don't I have the right
to know about this?

214
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,960
Not everything is meant to be known.

215
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,640
What good will it do,

216
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,440
knowing something you can't change?

217
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm begging you, Master.

218
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
Please tell me the truth.

219
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,080
It might have something to do
with my family's curse.

220
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,560
Please, Master.

221
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,880
Go live your life

222
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,160
while you still can.

223
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,100
And stay out of my business.

224
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
We're not that close.

225
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Alright.

226
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,160
But I'd appreciate it if you'd stop
using such improper language with me,

227
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
since we're not that close.

228
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,000
Khem...

229
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,680
Argh!

230
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,480
Please wait for me, Khem.

231
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,920
My deepest respects to you, Master.

232
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,960
It's been a while, Auntie.

233
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Thank you so much, Master.

234
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,000
Tonight is the first time
I've felt safe enough

235
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,040
to let Khem rest
without needing to protect him.

236
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,920
Your soul has deteriorated so much.

237
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,280
Should you continue to do this,

238
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,800
you may never find your way
back into reincarnation.

239
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,280
As long as Khem is safe,

240
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
that's more than enough for me.

241
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,840
Take some time to recover.

242
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
While he's here,

243
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,920
no harm will come to him.

244
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Thank you so much

245
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,300
for always protecting him.

246
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
Please excuse us.

247
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Come on, Khem.

248
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,000
The sermon is about to begin.

249
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
What? Isn't this Master's bike?

250
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,320
Won't he be mad that we took it?

251
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,680
Whatever. I'll return it after noon.

252
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
He won't even notice.

253
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,480
Come on.

254
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Please excuse us.

255
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,640
Sorry.

256
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,900
(Chanting)

257
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,040
Ouch!

258
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,400
Oh, Grandma Si?

259
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Why did you hit me?

260
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,840
Well,

261
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,560
if you hadn't done that,
would you even remember me?

262
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,040
You left and just went silent.

263
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
Do I even matter to you?

264
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,080
Aw, Grandma Si.

265
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,280
Of course you do!

266
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,040
I miss you so, so much.

267
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,120
This is Grandma Si,

268
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,320
a respected elder of the village.

269
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,720
Good morning, Grandma Si.

270
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,800
She's cared for Master
since he was little,

271
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,160
as if she were really his grandma.

272
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,320
Grandma,

273
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,520
this is Khem,

274
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,240
my friend.

275
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,240
You really dragged
some serious trouble over here.

276
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Well, I guess.

277
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,620
(Chanting)

278
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,840
- Sadhu.
- Sadhu.

279
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,440
Your soul is weak,

280
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,400
but your vital force remains intact.

281
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,320
You've grown up well.

282
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,920
If you ever need my help, let me know.

283
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,680
I'll be here to support you.

284
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,200
Thank you so much.

285
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,760
Well,

286
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,200
what an adorable face you have.

287
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,200
If I had a grandchild,

288
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,960
I'd love to introduce you.

289
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,480
Has anyone here caught your eye yet?

290
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,480
That would never come
to my mind, Grandma.

291
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,400
This afternoon, Master will lead
An Invitation to the Devas.

292
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,960
You need to attend.

293
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,800
It will bring you good fortune.

294
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Holy shit!

295
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Sorry.

296
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
His bike!

297
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,680
If he doesn't wanna help,

298
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,600
should we leave?

299
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,720
He's pretty late.

300
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,780
Master's here!

301
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,480
Over there. He's coming.

302
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,680
See? He looks so fine.

303
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,840
- He does.
- He's gorgeous.

304
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Jet, come on.

305
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,440
Wearing those sunglasses again?

306
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,640
The ritual is starting soon.

307
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,720
Is he not gonna take them off?

308
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,400
Just look at the girls over there.

309
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Whenever he looks someone in the eye,

310
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
young or old ladies,

311
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,920
or even men,

312
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,040
they all fall for him.

313
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,520
That's why he hides behind those shades.

314
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,640
Seriously?

315
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,000
Seriously.

316
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,520
Someone once fainted
just from making eye contact with him.

317
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,360
That's why he wears them.

318
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
It's starting now.

319
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
Focus and pray.

320
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,320
May all the devas,

321
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,000
Varuna,

322
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,720
Goddess of the Earth,

323
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,480
and the deities full of divine power,

324
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
shield and protect
everyone in this village

325
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,000
from all evils and ill omens.

326
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,440
See? That's my master.

327
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,880
This is full of crap.

328
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,000
Hey, be respectful.

329
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,880
He literally summoned the rain.

330
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,400
Not even Doctor Strange
can pull that off.

331
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,720
Hey!

332
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,360
What?

333
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,520
It's not worth it, Jet.

334
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,940
But they're disrespecting Master.

335
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,480
This place is nuts.

336
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,800
That lady acted like she was possessed,
trying to kill her husband.

337
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,560
I'm done with this damn camp.

338
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,600
Not everything you think
needs to be said,

339
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
but it's wise to think before you speak.

340
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Master!

341
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,080
Master...

342
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,720
Your bike.

343
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,200
Tell me where you're going.

344
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,840
Where are you guys going next?

345
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,080
Not everything is meant to be known.

346
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,080
Uncle Chai's taking us to go swimming.

347
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Give me your hand.

348
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Don't lose it.

349
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,760
So many damn bugs. Fuck this.

350
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,280
I should've stayed in
and watched something.

351
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,400
- I think it's gonna be...
- Got bug spray on you?

352
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Nope. I only got cigs.

353
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,680
- It looks so nice!
- Want any?

354
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,850
- No.
- Let's get a picture there!

355
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,840
- Wait, hold on.
- Prae...

356
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
- Where are you going?
- What the hell?

357
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,040
Come back here.

358
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,440
Alright,

359
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
listen up.

360
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,840
Before swimming,

361
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,240
let's pay respect
to the local spirits first.

362
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,260
Just to be safe, okay?

363
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,880
Here.

364
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,240
One for each person.

365
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,830
Make sure everyone gets it.

366
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,520
Here, a lighter, too.

367
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,280
Let's go.

368
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
Seriously?

369
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,160
A whole ritual just to swim?

370
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,720
Everyone just blindly believes
this kind of stuff.

371
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,360
No wonder

372
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,840
this fucking country
never moves forward.

373
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
You bastards!

374
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,120
Then you need to respect
other cultures, too.

375
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,680
You're not forced to believe it.

376
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,520
Just respect those who do.

377
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
It's called multiculturalism.

378
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,639
Ever heard of it?

379
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,120
Cut the "multi" bullshit, nerd.

380
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,639
You've been getting on my nerves.

381
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,920
I'm only holding back
'cause you're Prae's friend.

382
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,239
You don't need to.

383
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,480
Just think about the point I'm making.

384
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
- You're not getting it or what?
- Hey!

385
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,360
You're the one not getting it.

386
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,840
All you do is yap all the time.

387
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,840
What the fuck is your problem?

388
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,040
You think you can do anything
just 'cause your dad is some MP?

389
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Get him.

390
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,920
You're the one who brought us here, huh?

391
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,210
We need a word.

392
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,600
Just do it here.

393
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,159
Stay away, Khem.

394
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,330
You're literally asking for it!

395
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,270
Hey!

396
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,520
Why would you get in the way?

397
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,840
You bastards, get this!

398
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,800
Stop!

399
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,239
- Fuck you.
- I told you to stop!

400
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,320
What are you doing, huh?

401
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,639
Go away.

402
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,760
Go swim somewhere else.

403
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Leave!

404
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Just go already.

405
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,200
- Go!
- Fuck off.

406
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm coming for you.

407
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
You, too, nerd.

408
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,680
I shouldn't have come.

409
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
I'm sorry.

410
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Look,

411
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,240
calm down a bit, alright?

412
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,520
Control your temper.

413
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,240
Okay?

414
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,160
Okay.

415
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,880
Let's go, Khem.

416
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,560
Come on.

417
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,920
Khem!

418
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Come on here.

419
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,320
This spot has really cold water.

420
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,920
- Come on.
- Really?

421
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
Come here.

422
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It's really cold.

423
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,720
Join us.

424
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,960
You just took the punch yourself.

425
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
I didn't ask for your help.

426
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,200
Yes.

427
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,640
I know.

428
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
So...

429
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
does it hurt?

430
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,480
It doesn't.

431
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,080
The punch wasn't very hard.

432
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Let me see it.

433
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,640
Ouch...

434
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,480
It doesn't hurt, does it?

435
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,360
It doesn't hurt when you don't touch it.

436
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,880
Anyway,

437
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,040
Praemai told me that...

438
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,440
you carried me out of Worn's house?

439
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Obviously.

440
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,440
You're freaking heavy.

441
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,040
My aches still haven't gone away.

442
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
Thank you.

443
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,920
Wait.

444
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Today...

445
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,520
For shutting those assholes up...

446
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Thank you.

447
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,040
Sorry? What did you say?

448
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
Thank you.

449
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Thanks for that.

450
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,240
What?

451
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,760
What did you say?

452
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,840
I couldn't hear you.

453
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,320
Come here.

454
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,040
Oh...

455
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,770
Thank you, khob khun, kamsahamnida!

456
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,740
Clear enough?

457
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,660
Charn!

458
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,880
Charn,

459
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
are you alright?

460
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,480
I'm okay, Khem.

461
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,000
You should go swimming.

462
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,160
Charn, that's Praemai.

463
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,440
I'm right here.

464
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,000
Charn, how shortsighted are you exactly?

465
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,720
Where are my glasses?

466
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,800
Guys, my glasses!

467
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,360
Where are they?

468
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,440
Have you seen my glasses?

469
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,680
I lost them.

470
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,080
How did you lose them?

471
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,600
Look what you did, Jet!

472
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,110
Gosh.

473
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,520
What were you thinking?

474
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,960
I never said I wanted to swim.

475
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,920
I'm drenched now.

476
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm gonna get sick again.

477
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
Why did you kick me?

478
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,830
My clothes are soaked,

479
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
and so is my body.

480
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,640
I'm gonna catch a cold for sure.

481
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,040
Charn,

482
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,520
you want to show off, don't you?

483
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
What a great idea.

484
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,640
Yo, give me a light.

485
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,680
Man, I'm so sick of their bullshit.

486
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm so freaking done.

487
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,280
I bet this place is cursed or something.

488
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,880
If Te hadn't been so damn clingy
with his girl,

489
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,720
we'd be off enjoying ourselves by now.

490
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,960
I mean, come on.

491
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,600
We came all this way here,
so we gotta have some fun, right?

492
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,800
Have fun? We're in a fucking forest.

493
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,400
Exactly, man.

494
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,440
See that sign over there?

495
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,640
[Keep out]

496
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,680
It used to be a viewpoint.

497
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,200
How about...

498
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,640
we pitch a tent
and do some stargazing tonight?

499
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,840
Yo.

500
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
Sounds good?

501
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,320
Yo,

502
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,480
with...

503
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,160
Te is definitely coming.

504
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,280
He never misses it.

505
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,080
Obviously.

506
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,280
Yo, let's do it.

507
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,840
- Go.
- Hell yeah.

508
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
I'll go hit him up, too.

509
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,520
How much beer do we have left?

510
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,400
Man, a lot.

511
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,160
I can find more if you want.

512
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,720
Honestly, man,

513
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,840
since that nerd already took one punch,
[Keep out]

514
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,560
I should've thrown in a couple more.

515
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,520
Hell yeah.

516
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,720
He deserved it.

517
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,400
Damn, I wish I were there.

518
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,480
If I were,

519
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,160
- I'd have just...
- What?

520
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,960
Te!

521
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,680
Come on, Sod...

522
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,080
- Sod Chaeng!
- Sod Chaeng!

523
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,080
Nice shot.

524
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,800
Hey!

525
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,400
Bro, we barely started.

526
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,760
Going to sleep already?

527
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,560
Sleep my ass. I'm taking a piss.

528
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,120
Wait, I'm coming with you.

529
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,960
Yeah, fine.

530
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,240
Babe,

531
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,600
I'll be right back.

532
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,520
Won't take long.

533
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,720
Okay.

534
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,640
Babe!

535
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,680
Wait up! I'm taking a piss, too.

536
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,560
- What's wrong with you?
- Keep me company.

537
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,820
What's your problem?

538
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,960
You sure this is the right way?

539
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,000
What the hell? You're drunk already?

540
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,240
What the fuck?

541
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,920
I'm not drunk, dumbass.

542
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,360
I just gotta pee like you.

543
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,640
Yo, Phu,

544
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,520
you're aiming way too close.

545
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,560
Check this out.

546
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,960
I've got a long-range rifle, baby!

547
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,920
What's the point, man?

548
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,600
Bro, you sure that is long?

549
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,440
It can even reach the ground.

550
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,200
Mine's not long...

551
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,160
Come on, dude.

552
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,600
But it's right on the spot.

553
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,640
Te!

554
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,920
Te, are you done?

555
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,400
Hey, are you done yet?

556
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,240
Te!

557
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
Te...

558
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,920
Korn...

559
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,440
Phu!

560
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,360
This is not funny.

561
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,030
[Keep out]

562
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,280
Help!

563
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,680
- Prae?
- Help me!

564
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,840
- Help me.
- Prae,

565
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,520
- Please help me.
- What happened?

566
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Help me.

567
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,560
Prae...

568
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:02,840
Everyone,

569
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,200
something's wrong with Prae.

570
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,600
Uncle Chai, Auntie Kaew!

571
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,040
Prae!

572
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,080
- Prae!
- Why is she like this?

573
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,880
- Prae...
- Where are the others, Prae?

574
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,840
What's going on, Mint?

575
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,200
Where has she been?

576
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,200
Uh...

577
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,960
She went camping
with her boyfriend at the viewpoint.

578
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,040
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

579
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,030
- Prae...
- Prae...

580
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,330
- I'm sorry.
- Prae!

581
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,200
- I'm sorry. It's my fault.
- Listen to me, Prae.

582
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,840
Calm down.

583
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,940
Calm yourself down and listen to me.

584
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,760
Take your time,
and tell us what happened.

585
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,240
- Prae!
- Prae...

586
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
Prae!

587
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,320
Charn, take her to Master.

588
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,360
Hurry up!

589
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:51,960
Praemai!

590
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,640
Praemai...

591
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,520
Praemai!

592
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,600
Prae...

593
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,080
She's the only one who got out,

594
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,320
but as we can see,
she's not in the same state.

595
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,920
Aw, sweetie.

596
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,200
Praemai...

597
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,040
Praemai!

598
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,560
At least they let her out.

599
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,160
Where is she? Let me see her.

600
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,400
Mother Si!

601
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,920
Let me get through.

602
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,600
Let me check her first.

603
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,000
What happened to her?

604
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,040
Aw, dear.

605
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,680
Oh, dear.
Her vital force has left her body!

606
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,800
- Really?
- Yeah!

607
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,920
Master,

608
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
will they allow us back up there?

609
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,160
We need to get her vital force back.

610
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,880
If we don't, things will only get worse.

611
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,070
Jet,

612
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,520
you're going with Uncle Chai

613
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,920
and helping him
gather the entire village.

614
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:54,760
Okay.

615
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,360
Split them into two groups.

616
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,400
All able-bodied men,
send them to find those three guys.

617
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,680
Everyone else,

618
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,440
go help Grandma Si
draw back the vital force.

619
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,040
Who's her best friend?

620
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,400
They need to come with me.

621
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
You should go, Mint.

622
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,320
I'll take care of her here.

623
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,160
Let's go. We should hurry.

624
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,000
- Let's go.
- Be careful.

625
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
- Prae...
- Go.

626
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,640
Come on, Jet.

627
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,080
Khem.

628
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,440
You stay.

629
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,920
Praemai...

630
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,040
Let's go.

631
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,240
Praemai, can you hear me?

632
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,960
- Sweetie...
- We need only men born on Saturday,

633
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,960
Tuesday,

634
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,520
Wednesday,

635
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,200
and Sunday.

636
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,080
Just those four days.

637
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,920
We'll form search groups
to look for Te, Korn, and Phu.

638
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,920
They must be found before noon.

639
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,960
Wait, Jet.

640
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,280
I mean, why before noon?

641
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,960
If they're not found by noon,

642
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,280
we're looking for bodies.

643
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,200
Te!

644
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,880
- Where are you? Can you hear us?
- Te!

645
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,520
- Korn, where are you?
- Phu.

646
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,760
- Where are you?
- Te!

647
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,640
- If you can hear me, make a noise!
- Make sure you look everywhere.

648
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,600
- Korn!
- Don't miss any spot.

649
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,720
- Got it.
- Okay.

650
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,960
- Te, Korn...
- Phu!

651
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,160
Mint,

652
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,560
did you bring what I told you to get?

653
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,360
Yes, I did.

654
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Here you go, Grandma.

655
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,080
These are what Prae uses a lot.

656
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,560
Let this ritual succeed and be blessed.

657
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,140
- Sadhu.
- Sadhu.

658
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,640
- Phu, Korn!
- Te, can you hear me?

659
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,680
Guys!

660
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,280
- Can you hear us?
- Where are you?

661
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,000
- Where are you?
- Answer us if you can hear this.

662
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,320
- Korn!
- Can you hear us?

663
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,520
- Can you hear us, guys?
- Where are you?

664
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,640
- Praemai, come with us.
- Come back.

665
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,440
- May your vital force come to us.
- Prae...

666
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,240
- Come with us.
- Come back, Praemai.

667
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,840
- Come back to me.
- Come on now.

668
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,640
- Come home with us.
- Praemai...

669
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,480
- I'll take you back to your parents.
- Come on, Praemai. Come back.

670
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,520
- Praemai...
- Come to us.

671
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,080
- May your vital force come to us.
- Please come back here.

672
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,160
Praemai, come home with us.

673
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,240
We'll go together.

674
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,440
Praemai...

675
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,360
- Let's go home.
- It's here!

676
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,360
- Really? Is it here?
- Yes!

677
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,000
Her vital force is here.

678
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,400
- We got it.
- Is Prae with us now?

679
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,600
- Yes, she's with us.
- Let's go home.

680
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,160
- Let's head back home.
- Okay, let's go.

681
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,240
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's head home.

682
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,440
Here we go.

683
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,000
Let's go home, okay?

684
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,680
Praemai's vital force is back.

685
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,960
Now, may it find its way
back into her body.

686
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,720
Let's tie her wrist.

687
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,680
Tying her wrist...

688
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,760
with the holy thread.

689
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,200
Praemai's vital force is back.

690
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,640
May it find its way back into her body.

691
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:41,040
(Chanting)

692
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,840
May her vital force come back,

693
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,800
and may it bring relief
and healing to her.

694
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,160
Sadhu.

695
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,680
Come, tie her wrist.

696
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,040
Kaew, you do it, too, okay?

697
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,080
Let's call her vital force together.

698
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,580
Alright, I'll tie her wrist.

699
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,440
Mother Si...

700
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,400
It's back in her body. See?

701
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,080
- Really?
- Yes!

702
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,760
Praemai...

703
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,640
You're okay now, sweetie.

704
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,160
She is healed

705
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,560
and perfectly alright now.

706
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,200
Master!

707
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,640
How's everything, Jet?

708
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,720
Go and stay at Auntie Kaew's place.

709
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,440
Come on, guys.

710
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,680
Let's take her there to get some rest.

711
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,530
Come on.

712
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,600
- Let's go to my place.
- Go.

713
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,520
Be careful.

714
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,580
I'll take this.

715
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,360
You should go with them.

716
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,400
Let's go.

717
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,800
Why did you tell Khem
to go stay somewhere else?

718
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,800
I'll project my spirit somewhere else.

719
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,080
And you can't watch over him tonight.

720
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,480
It's safer for him
to stay with many people,

721
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,040
so they can keep an eye on him.

722
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,080
Are you...

723
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,440
leaving your body? Where to?

724
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,280
And...

725
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,640
Go take a look around.

726
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,840
Let me know right away
if anything's not right.

727
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,080
Okay.

728
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,760
Khem...

729
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Khem!

730
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,730
Are you okay?

731
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,760
Well,

732
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,880
I just feel like

733
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,960
I can't help them at all.

734
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,600
Please don't think that way, Khem.

735
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,360
I just thought...

736
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,920
if I could be a bit more helpful,

737
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,080
it might be better.

738
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,960
I think you've got
the wrong perspective.

739
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,880
It was you, wasn't it,

740
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,720
who kept holding Praemai

741
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,600
during her seizures?

742
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,160
It didn't really matter.

743
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,720
It felt like I wasn't helping at all.

744
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,040
But it did matter for Prae.

745
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,720
At least,

746
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,840
you were there
to share some of her pain.

747
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,360
Thanks, Charn.

748
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,960
Whatever we could do,

749
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,920
we've already done it all.

750
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,600
Let's go to bed now.

751
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,120
Have you found them?

752
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,640
No, Master.

753
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,240
What about you?

754
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,520
Is he in the cave?

755
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,240
Yes.

756
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,520
But, Master,

757
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,520
he seems quite upset right now.

758
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,160
I need to go anyway.

759
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,080
He's the only one who can help me.

760
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,160
Dear guardian of this land,
forest, and mountain,

761
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,480
if I have committed
any offense against you

762
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,480
whether by action, speech, or thought,

763
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,920
intentional or unintentional,

764
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,880
I humbly ask for your forgiveness.

765
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,720
I have a troubled mind

766
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,800
and humbly ask for your mercy and help.

767
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,640
If my merit is insufficient,

768
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,360
I shall respectfully take my leave.

769
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,680
Had your merit not been sufficient,

770
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,640
you wouldn't have made it here.

771
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,240
You may rise.

772
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,600
You came because of
those three boys, didn't you?

773
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,160
We're in trouble, Master.

774
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,600
Khem's disappeared.

775
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,840
Your instincts are strong.

776
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,920
Focus your mind on Khem,

777
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,760
and follow wherever your gut leads you.

778
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,440
I have cherished and protected you

779
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,000
for over 80 years.

780
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,880
How could I let you be taken
by someone else so easily?

781
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,280
Master,

782
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,920
can you please stay with me for now?

783
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,440
At least until I fall asleep.

784
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,880
♫No matter how long time's passed,
you still have me♫

785
