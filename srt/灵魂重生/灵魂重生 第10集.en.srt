3
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,440
No.

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,640
It can't end like this.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,840
Wake up, Grandma.

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,520
I'm ready.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,940
Please send me to him, Master.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,160
Please don't go, Khem.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,360
Please stay with me.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,720
I have no one left, Khem.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,520
Peem,

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,640
I truly thank you for everything.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,200
You let me experience a kind of love.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,800
But from now on,

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,560
I'll find my own way,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,480
so no one else gets hurt because of me.

17
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,960
Is everyone okay?

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,720
That was close, man.

19
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,160
- That was damn close.
- Are you alright?

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,440
How did it even fall?

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Whoa,

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,220
you look...

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,860
as if you were cursed.

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,580
Better stop by Gangnam Clinic sometime.

25
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,280
What are they looking at?

26
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,410
Can you...

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,920
see him?

28
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,500
Hey,

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,610
are you okay?

30
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,960
- Did you get hurt?
- What happened?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,829
Are you alright?

32
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,480
- You okay?
- Are you hurt?

33
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,770
Don't pile on him.

34
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,970
He's already freaked out.

35
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,800
- We're just worried.
- We're just worried.

36
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,160
Hey, hey.

37
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,160
Freshmen,

38
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,760
return to the base
if you've got nothing to do.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,010
Don't slack off.

40
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,840
Come on, bro,

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,120
the sign you set up
almost crushed my friend's head.

42
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,320
Talking back?

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,880
Do squat jumps

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,680
as many times as your year of entry.

45
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,400
What?

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,500
Just do what we say.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,180
Excuse me.

48
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,240
I'll take the punishment for everyone.

49
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,600
I'll do it.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,620
I talked back.

51
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,410
You wanna do it, huh?

52
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,079
Then do it, both of you.

53
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,540
One,

54
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,750
two,

55
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,400
- Louder!
- three,

56
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,200
four...

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,180
[Welcome, FAA 2022 freshmen
to the art side!

58
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,890
May 25â€“27, all day at the square,
see you!]

59
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,820
So that's why you've been acting weird.

60
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,000
Everyone's been talking about you
since the first day.

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,520
When I was in elementary school,
my parents got called in a lot.

62
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,060
The teachers thought
something might be wrong with me.

63
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,060
I mean,

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,060
I barely talked to anyone,

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,420
and sometimes I got scared

66
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,710
even when nothing was there.

67
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,780
I've been through the same.

68
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,950
My dad was so afraid
I wouldn't have any friends.

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,640
So,

70
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,460
is the ghost that attacked you

71
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,159
connected to the curse
you told me about?

72
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,580
I...

73
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,970
don't know, Jet, but I guess...

74
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,200
ghosts are just like us.

75
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,620
Some are good, and some are bad.

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,360
I'll help you.

77
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,340
I'm the number one disciple

78
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,120
of the country's top shaman.

79
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,330
Look.

80
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,760
Sacred rice grains,

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,720
holy water,

82
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,280
and a talisman cloth.

83
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,890
I've got it all.

84
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,200
Thanks a lot, Jet.

85
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,500
We only met today,

86
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,890
but it feels like

87
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,780
I've known you for a long time.

88
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,540
That's good.

89
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,020
I can feel

90
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,120
that you...

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
are gonna bring
good things into my life.

92
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,700
Well, obviously.

93
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,930
This is just our first day.

94
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,080
Come on.

95
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,600
First day or ten years,

96
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,000
you're my friend now.

97
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,960
I'll never let my friend suffer.

98
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,390
Thanks, Jet.

99
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,180
Yeah.

100
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,010
From now on,
you need to tell me everything,

101
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,000
ghosts, people, whatever.

102
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,220
If I can help, I will.

103
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't keep it to yourself.

104
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,760
Yeah.

105
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,380
And don't dump me.

106
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,890
It's not easy
to find a friend who also sees ghosts!

107
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,940
I know,

108
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,240
but I'll dump you for now.

109
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,240
I gotta go.

110
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,580
Alright, then.

111
00:06:59,190 --> 00:06:59,900
Khem!

112
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,590
Khem!

113
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,560
You promised

114
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,010
you'd never dump me.

115
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,640
I'm sorry, Jet,

116
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,540
but you love Grandma Si,

117
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,280
Thong, and Ake.

118
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,050
I...

119
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,370
Don't you think I love you, too?

120
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,900
You think...

121
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,950
I'll hate you after all this?

122
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,060
I don't know, Jet.

123
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,130
I even hate myself.

124
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,400
I can't bear losing anyone again.

125
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,710
So you're...

126
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,960
handling this by leaving us?

127
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,200
It's not your fault, Khem,

128
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,220
but it's Ramphueng's.

129
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,720
If you leave,

130
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,890
that means she wins.

131
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,850
Please, Jet.

132
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,180
Ever since you met me,

133
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,010
I've always caused you trouble.

134
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,620
From the first day,

135
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,460
when you said
I'd bring you good things...

136
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,970
I have not.

137
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,390
I have not, Jet.

138
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,970
That's not true.

139
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,500
Coming to this camp together...

140
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,960
is a good thing, isn't it?

141
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,940
You met Master.

142
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,500
We met Charn.

143
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,680
We've been through so much together.

144
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,890
Don't you think
that's a good thing, too?

145
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,140
I've never had a friend in my life,

146
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,580
but helping someone,

147
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,800
protecting them,

148
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,820
and knowing they can count on me...

149
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,800
It makes me feel so appreciated.

150
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,480
Whatever,

151
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,480
I won't let you leave.

152
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,220
But if you're actually leaving,

153
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,080
I'll cling to the train
to come with you.

154
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,460
Me, too.

155
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,550
I've been willing to go through
everything with you,

156
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,180
even though we just met,

157
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,830
because you mean a lot to us, Khem.

158
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,090
But...

159
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,760
the villagers have already lost enough.

160
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,150
We won't go back there, then.

161
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,530
Let's all go to Bangkok.

162
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,260
I've packed everything.

163
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,240
Wherever you go,

164
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,410
we'll go with you.

165
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,080
Don't cry.

166
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,580
I'm sorry

167
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,860
that I put you through all this.

168
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,270
Right,

169
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,840
when I said I'd cling to the train,

170
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,130
I was joking.

171
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,960
We'll catch a flight.

172
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,620
I'll cover the tickets.

173
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,080
Let's take the plane.

174
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,660
Thanks, Jet.

175
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,480
I'll sleep on the floor.

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,550
You guys can take the bed.

177
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,400
Come on,

178
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,720
no need to feel bad anymore.

179
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,850
I'll sleep on the floor.

180
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,970
In fact,

181
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,750
you should take the bed,

182
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,500
and Jet and I can be at ease.

183
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,990
That's...

184
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,060
what Master gave you.

185
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,800
You made it a necklace now?

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,920
We each have one, then.

187
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,990
Got anything?

188
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,430
What'd she say?

189
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,040
Well,

190
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,440
she's an atheist,

191
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,520
so she doesn't want a shrine
in front of the dorm.

192
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,410
I asked to set it up on the rooftop,

193
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,780
and she was fine with it
as long as it didn't cause any trouble.

194
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,390
It should be ready in three days.

195
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,140
Anyway,

196
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,630
are you sure you can handle this

197
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,900
without your master?

198
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,240
He's already lost so much for me.

199
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,290
What now?

200
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,070
One sec.

201
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,320
What's their problem?

202
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,770
Hello?

203
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,970
What?

204
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,260
Gosh, no more revisions.

205
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,690
Can you stop calling me, too?

206
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,720
Hey,

207
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,920
my brother's about to get killed
by a ghost.

208
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,870
I'm serious.
Who would joke about that?

209
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,020
Yeah.

210
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,760
If he doesn't make it,

211
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,380
I'll blame you instead of the ghost.

212
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,720
Yes.

213
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,600
Go ahead, cancel it. I don't care.

214
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,380
Khem's birthday is in seven days.

215
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,980
As soon as June 5 ends,

216
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,250
he'll turn 21.

217
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,490
If he makes it until then,

218
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,950
the curse will be lifted.

219
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,610
Come on.

220
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,640
Let's give our all.

221
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,960
Jane, come on.

222
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,260
Time to cheer ourselves up.

223
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,550
What's this?

224
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,560
What do I need to say?

225
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,760
Charn's prepared it.

226
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,940
One, two, three...

227
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,840
- Khemjira must survive!
- Khemjira must survive!

228
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,710
How about taking a break
until it's past your birthday?

229
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:00,980
Whoa,

230
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,380
even you want him to skip his classes?

231
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,300
Don't worry.

232
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,460
I'm in the same section as him
for every class.

233
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280
I won't let him out of my sight.

234
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,160
Let me be a student for one more day,

235
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,819
just in case.

236
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,970
So, I won't regret it
if I never get the chance again.

237
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,349
Don't say that.

238
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,140
Forget it.

239
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,900
Don't move!

240
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,100
Are you okay, Khem?

241
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,310
Khem,

242
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,040
are you alright?

243
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,130
I think you should stay in your room

244
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,440
until your birthday.

245
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,260
Don't be afraid, Khem.

246
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,480
Jet and I will take turns
staying with you.

247
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,400
Give me an update.

248
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,850
What?

249
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,750
All good.

250
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,330
The target is safe.

251
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,410
Passing the duty to Bodyguard No. 2!

252
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,140
Hey,

253
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,540
I'm No. 1!

254
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,230
Passing the duty to Bodyguard No. 1

255
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,020
from Bodyguard No. 0!

256
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,160
You won't let me win, huh?

257
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,320
Take care of yourself, Charn.

258
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,650
See you later.

259
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,100
I offer this food

260
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,020
to pass merit

261
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,680
to all wandering spirits.

262
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,460
During this time,
I kindly ask that none of you

263
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,810
enter this dwelling.

264
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,380
If you do,

265
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,740
Ramphueng might
take control of your mind.

266
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,490
How about writing them an essay?

267
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,840
Just tell them
you'll do a big offering later.

268
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,820
I just gave them a warning.

269
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,940
I don't think

270
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,160
they'd want anyone
controlling their minds.

271
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,260
Come on,

272
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,700
I'll purify you

273
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,430
before we go up.

274
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,420
Hey...

275
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,880
Here.

276
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,850
Now it's my turn.

277
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,200
If you want to take your turn,

278
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
make it quick.

279
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,840
â™«The one who makes my dreams come true,â™«

280
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,560
â™«The one in my heart, baby, it's youâ™«

281
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,360
â™«It's you I've been longing for,â™«

282
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,200
â™«The one I've always adoredâ™«

283
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,760
â™«Right by my side, it's truly youâ™«

284
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,960
â™«It's you I want, nothing moreâ™«

285
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
â™«From now on, you'll be my allâ™«

286
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,840
Will you ever stop, huh?

287
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,840
Purify me, too.

288
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,640
Okay, Miss Jane.

289
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,320
No need to be so formal.
Just call me Jane.

290
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,410
Okay, Jane.

291
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,630
Are you guys done?

292
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,110
I made you some noodles.

293
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,210
Aw,

294
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,990
as if you could read my mind.

295
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,450
You should join us, Jane.

296
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,080
Let some tom yum freshen you up.

297
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,520
That's perfect.

298
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,820
I was looking for something
to balance out the sweetness.

299
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,700
I have a room ready for you downstairs

300
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,560
in case you need some water...

301
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,890
I've got an urgent matter

302
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,320
and need to go now.

303
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,270
Yes, Father.

304
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,610
There's nothing to fear.

305
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,340
All my friends are with me.

306
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,250
After my birthday,

307
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,890
I'll bring them to meet you.

308
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,290
That's great.

309
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,560
Is Master there with you, too?

310
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Master...

311
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,560
He's performing a ritual
to keep the wandering spirits away.

312
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,440
He'll also ward off
bad luck for me tomorrow.

313
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,180
Knowing that
someone is looking after you,

314
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,000
I feel at ease.

315
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,260
You don't need to worry, Father.

316
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,570
I'm doing well.

317
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,440
Alright, I won't bother you now.

318
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,060
Relax

319
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
and get some rest, Khem.

320
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,080
I'm tired.

321
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,520
Help me do it.

322
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,400
- Wait up.
- What?

323
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,690
May this lantern

324
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,780
rise up to the Heaven of Tavatimsa,

325
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,880
offering homage to the Buddha's relics

326
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,280
and the Chulamani Chedi.

327
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,000
May all of Khem's misfortunes
and karmic debts

328
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,040
drift away from his life tonight.

329
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,520
Sadhu.

330
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,480
Focus your mind.

331
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,260
If you want to say a prayer,
do so now.

332
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,640
If you can really hear us,

333
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,880
please show mercy

334
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,690
and protect the three of us.

335
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,900
And if anything happens,

336
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,620
please guide me as you have before.

337
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,680
Just two more hours until midnight.

338
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,700
Don't worry, Khem.

339
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,390
We're not letting our guard down.

340
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,910
We're going to recite the Itipiso
108 times tonight.

341
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,330
In the meantime, you should just rest

342
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,600
and wake up
for your birthday cake tomorrow.

343
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,410
Thank you.

344
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,500
Even when you're about to die,

345
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,560
you still won't say goodbye
to your friend, huh?

346
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,960
Khemjira...

347
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,440
I gave you time,

348
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,770
hoping to see a dramatic farewell.

349
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,920
But your friends don't even know

350
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
that I...

351
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,520
have been inside your mind all along.

352
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,720
I have a room
ready for you downstairs...

353
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,300
I've got an urgent matter

354
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,680
and need to go now.

355
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,010
Take care of yourself, Charn.

356
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,090
See you later.

357
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,160
Don't move!

358
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,840
Are you okay, Khem?

359
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,440
Keep your hope alive.

360
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,350
Cherish it until your final breath

361
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,760
before I shatter it completely.

362
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,590
Stay focused.

363
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,150
It's almost over.

364
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Khemjira...

365
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,490
Jet,

366
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,360
wake up now!

367
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,310
What?

368
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,410
Jet,

369
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,160
Khem's gone.

370
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,240
Shit!

371
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,640
Wait.

372
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,570
What?

373
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,960
He didn't leave the building.

374
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,200
What? Where is he?

375
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Up there.

376
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,160
- Khem!
- Khem!

377
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,450
Khem!

378
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,110
Khem...

379
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,880
Khem...

380
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Khem,

381
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,020
get a hold of yourself.

382
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,990
Let my friend go,

383
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,360
or I'll end you.

384
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,070
Khem...

385
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,280
Khem...

386
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Khem, hey.

387
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,280
Khem...

388
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,570
No...

389
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,840
I'm taking him with me.

390
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Khem...

391
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
Khem!

392
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,340
Khem!

393
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
Khem!

394
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,900
If you're still here,

395
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,280
please reveal yourself to me.

396
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,900
The vision I revealed to you

397
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,180
will come true tomorrow night.

398
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,660
For what reason

399
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,860
are you helping me, my lord?

400
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,490
I am repaying the debt I owe you.

401
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,030
I have done nothing to deserve it.

402
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,260
Not in this lifetime,

403
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,040
but you bestowed a deed of great virtue

404
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,780
over a thousand years ago.

405
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,000
Phuchong Nagaraja,

406
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,440
you have committed three transgressions.

407
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,880
You have stolen the sacred weapon
from the vault of treasures

408
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,520
and used it
to slay Chimphli, the Garuda.

409
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,400
Though he had slain your son first,

410
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,840
your retribution was far too great.

411
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,640
For that reason,

412
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,880
by the supreme power of that weapon,

413
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,760
your deed

414
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,400
troubled all that lives
within Himavanta

415
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,040
and brought about
the loss of countless lives.

416
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,940
I am ready to bear my guilt

417
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,440
and make amends across all lifetimes.

418
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,080
You shall no longer make amends
in any other lifetime.

419
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,200
Your soul shall be shattered

420
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,840
and forbidden from lingering
in any cycle of rebirth.

421
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,920
Be gone. Fade into the void.

422
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,240
Hold, mighty lord.

423
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,920
Phuchagin,

424
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,160
what brings you here?

425
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,230
Some truths have not yet been told.

426
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,320
Who are you?

427
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,360
I am Phuchagin.

428
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,640
I too guard the vault of treasures
of the Underworld,

429
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,340
and I am the cause of this matter.

430
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
What is it you say?

431
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,020
Do not lie.

432
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,860
I bore a personal grudge
against the Garuda.

433
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,640
When I saw my kin

434
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,360
driven mad
by the loss of his beloved son,

435
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,080
I devised a scheme,

436
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,980
urging him to steal the weapon
and use it

437
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,920
to wipe the Garuda from the world.

438
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,160
Why would you lie?

439
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,860
All that I have said is true.

440
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,160
I am deeply ashamed

441
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,820
to witness my elder kin

442
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,640
bear the punishment alone.

443
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,800
Please reconsider
his punishment once more.

444
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,400
Phuchong,

445
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,380
do not defend me.

446
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,070
What is it you intend?

447
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,720
Why involve yourself in this matter?

448
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,930
Your son had lived righteously,

449
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,640
and he has been reborn
in the Nimmanarati Heaven.

450
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,330
If your soul remains,

451
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,880
you shall meet your son again one day.

452
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,940
But if you do this,

453
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,880
you...

454
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,800
may be cast back
into the cycle of rebirth.

455
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,330
Then so be it.

456
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,520
I am tired of a life
spent only guarding these treasures.

457
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,400
Phuchagin,

458
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,840
do you swear
that what you have spoken is true?

459
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,390
I vow every word is so.

460
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,480
If that is so,

461
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,520
I shall review the punishment once more.

462
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,800
I will send the two of you
to the world of mortals.

463
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,600
Phuchong Nagaraja,
you shall dwell in the deep forest,

464
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,040
with nothing
but a cavern in which to coil.

465
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,200
Your powers shall be stripped.
You shall become a mere black serpent

466
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,440
and begin your cultivation anew.

467
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,360
And you, Phuchagin,

468
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,870
for you are the root of this matter,

469
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,760
in every lifetime henceforth

470
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,480
you shall be born a mere mortal,

471
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,120
destined to struggle and toil,

472
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,440
to sacrifice yourself
and do good for many,

473
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,080
that you may atone for the loss
you have wrought.

474
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,400
I will bear the punishment, mighty lord.

475
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,180
Farewell for now,

476
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
my kin.

477
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,760
I can't accept this, my lord.

478
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,940
This weapon belonged to you.

479
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,200
I merely returned it to you

480
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,160
as I believe it is time

481
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,200
for it to be returned to its owner.

482
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,870
You still worry for your kin, do you?

483
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,220
I...

484
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,120
I know his words were only to save you.

485
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,240
Who would not know
the fame of Phuchagin Nagaraja,

486
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,840
beloved by all?

487
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,680
How could he bear a grudge
against the Garuda?

488
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,440
If that is so,

489
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,700
why have you given him such punishment?

490
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,400
I could feel, deep within,

491
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,720
that he yearns for love,

492
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,120
the love that cannot be attained

493
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,200
should he remain merely a guardian
of the Underworld treasures.

494
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,920
Keep this.

495
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,280
Let it be your choice
what course to take.

496
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,650
As for Phuchagin,

497
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,900
for he gave his life to save you,

498
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,130
I have granted him a blessing:

499
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,840
in every lifetime,

500
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,080
he shall be cherished
by both mortals and gods.

501
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,530
If you are to use it, think carefully,

502
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,900
for it carries

503
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
the power of the sacred weapon,

504
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,540
belonging to the guardian
of the Underworld treasures.

505
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,320
The human body you inhabit

506
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,100
is not meant to endure such might.

507
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,600
This is all I can offer
in return for your deed.

508
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,940
Beyond this,

509
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,350
your fate depends upon your own karma.

510
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,750
I wish you luck.

511
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,120
Kachen,

512
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,160
I need your help.

513
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:07,560
And then our voices say:

514
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,570
May fortune come.
This is an auspicious day.

515
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,200
Together we gather, together we pray.

516
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:23,820
The venerable shaman
declares it a blessed day.

517
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,700
It's a day of fortune, a day of light.

518
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,060
With the offerings adorned with delight,

519
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:37,260
we now summon the vital force
through this rite:

520
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,400
May your vital force come forth.

521
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,960
May your vital force come forth.

522
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,760
May your 32 parts come together.

523
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,640
May your 92 parts gather.

524
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:00,780
May all reside within your body forever.

525
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,490
As you can see,

526
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,230
even without Grandma Si,

527
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,980
we, villagers,

528
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:10,100
can summon the vital force ourselves.

529
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,900
There's one thing

530
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,380
I want to tell you.

531
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:24,540
It's not just you who cares for us.

532
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,040
Everyone in the village

533
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,850
cares for you, too.

534
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,680
â™«May your vital force come to meâ™«

535
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,000
â™«In my arms, where you should be,â™«

536
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,520
â™«Come to the one who loves you tenderlyâ™«

537
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,090
May you be safe, Master.

538
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,550
- Have a safe trip.
- Wishing you a safe journey, Master.

539
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,640
May you always be protected.

540
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,160
- Stay strong and healthy.
- We love you, Master.

541
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,840
The apartment you're going to

542
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,760
is quite old
and in poor condition, Master.

543
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,340
If you need to be around there,

544
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,710
we have a VIP suite in our hotel chain

545
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,630
ready for you, Master.

546
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:11,810
That's not necessary.

547
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,720
But Young Master asked me
to give you the best accommodation.

548
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,020
This is enough.

549
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,430
Tell him to come to me
as soon as he arrives.

550
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,340
Yes, Master.

551
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,440
Khem!

552
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,000
Khem!

553
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,240
Khem!

554
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,320
Khem...

555
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,840
Khem...

556
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,560
Khem!

557
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,640
Are you tired yet?

558
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,290
Ready to give up now?

559
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,900
The longer you linger,

560
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,780
the more you'll suffer.

561
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,020
I wonder how much more you can endure.

562
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,970
Don't give up just yet.

563
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,960
I'll take you back, Khem.

564
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,140
Khem!

565
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:51,960
Khem,

566
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,500
can you hear me?

567
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,540
Peem!

568
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,260
Where are you?

569
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:58,720
Don't give up now.

570
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,560
Come.

571
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,840
The more, the merrier.

572
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,350
No need to wait for tomorrow.

573
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,180
Tonight can be your end.

574
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,120
Have you seen
the full extent of my power?

575
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,940
By day, disaster will follow you.

576
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,980
By night,
nightmares will haunt you endlessly.

577
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,430
Staying on will bring only suffering.

578
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,900
Not only you,

579
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,380
but everyone around you

580
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,700
will suffer.

581
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,380
Decide, Khemjira.

582
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,790
Choose.

583
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,120
You can end everything here,
in this dream,

584
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,740
and leave peacefully

585
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,700
without ever facing loss again.

586
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,140
What do you say?

587
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,160
What is your choice?

588
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,880
I've...

589
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,350
given up.

590
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,420
Don't give up, Khem.

591
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,880
You finally came.

592
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,890
You don't know when to quit, do you?

593
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,660
This is your dream.

594
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,770
You can stop it anytime.

595
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,960
Focus.

596
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,280
Cast out everything
you did not let in.

597
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,360
I offered you an easy way,
yet you did not take it.

598
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,210
From now on,

599
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,320
you'll find no mercy from me.

600
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,340
Khem...

601
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,370
Are you hurt?

602
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,400
Why did you come after me?

603
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,900
Please let me go.

604
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,680
I've given up.

605
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,040
No, you can't.

606
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,390
I don't wanna live anymore.

607
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,840
No, Khem.

608
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,680
You need to live,

609
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,640
for your friends,

610
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,600
for your parents,

611
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,580
and for me.

612
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,680
We must stay together in this life.

613
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,780
Trust me, Khem.

614
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,860
No matter what happens,

615
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:40,010
we'll find our way back to each other.

616
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:56,760
â™«Just one glance, and I could feelâ™«

617
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,800
â™«A vow long hidden, suddenly revealed,â™«

618
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,540
â™«Leading our souls in a destined appealâ™«

619
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:09,580
â™«To meet once more with a bond to sealâ™«

620
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,260
â™«It's more than love at first sight,â™«

621
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,500
â™«But a bond through every lifeâ™«

622
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,940
â™«Our destinies cross again in this lifeâ™«

623
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,080
â™«You'll be my last, my eternal light,â™«

624
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,920
â™«From now until the end of timeâ™«

625
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,860
â™«Whether it's a dream or it's true,â™«

626
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,330
â™«My heart forever stays with youâ™«

627
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:39,600
â™«No force shall tear our souls in twoâ™«

628
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,880
â™«I love you through and throughâ™«

629
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,120
â™«Even if the world ceases to move,â™«

630
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,440
â™«These words will still be true,â™«

631
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,080
â™«I love youâ™«

632
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,700
â™«It's more than love at first sight,â™«

633
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,840
â™«But a bond through every lifeâ™«

634
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,460
â™«Our destinies cross again in this lifeâ™«

635
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,460
â™«You'll be my last, my eternal light,â™«

636
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,570
â™«From now until the end of timeâ™«

637
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,250
â™«Whether it's a dream or it's true,â™«

638
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,640
â™«My heart forever stays with youâ™«

639
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,050
â™«No force shall tear our souls in twoâ™«

640
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:28,090
â™«I love you through and throughâ™«

641
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,500
â™«Even if the world ceases to move,â™«

642
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,840
â™«These words will still be true,â™«

643
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,280
â™«I love youâ™«

644
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,160
Khem...

645
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,070
Jet!

646
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,550
Let's...

647
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,600
go for a walk...

648
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,360
again, shall we?

649
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,570
No deities dwell in this shrine,

650
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,440
so it's not a spirit shrine

651
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,440
but rather a gate
linking to Ramphueng's realm.

652
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,530
She hid through this gate,

653
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,380
so you couldn't sense her presence.

654
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,780
She's been inside Khem's mind all along.

655
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,700
I didn't want to worry you.

656
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,400
I've seen the vision.

657
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,230
If I hadn't come here today,

658
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:07,770
tonight, Khem...

659
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,890
But you're here now.

660
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,980
Perhaps we can rest easy now, right?

661
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,200
We can't yet.

662
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,580
Ramphueng will do something.

663
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,780
Until now,
we've only been defending ourselves,

664
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,400
but we won't do that again from now on.

665
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,010
Do you have a plan, Master?

666
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,560
What's your plan?

667
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:51,970
Tell us now.

668
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,100
We can do anything.

669
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,790
Let's wait until everyone's here.

670
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,250
Wait, so it's not everyone yet?

671
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,440
Who's left?

672
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,160
You've got a phone, Master?

673
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,440
If that's your phone,

674
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,200
that means...

675
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,560
Yeah.

676
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,000
Come in.

677
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,520
Why this one, of all people, Master?

678
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,320
Kachen!

679
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,680
Anything you need,

680
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,480
just tell me, bro.

681
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,400
Ramphueng won't hear anything

682
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,120
we say in this room.

683
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,320
I'll go over the whole plan just once.

684
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,680
I was hoping you'd have a plan.

685
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,640
Don't fail me,

686
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
or every last one of you

687
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,720
will be wiped out tonight.

688
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,280
You don't need to
bear all of this alone anymore.

689
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,640
No, Charn.

690
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Come, Ramphueng.

691
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,240
Let's end this.

692
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,080
Soon, you will see what I can do.

693
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:16,350
â™«The one who makes my dreams come true,â™«

694
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:20,280
â™«The one in my heart, baby, it's youâ™«

695
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,960
â™«It's you I've been longing for,â™«

696
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:29,150
â™«The one I've always adoredâ™«

697
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:33,610
â™«Right by my side, it's truly youâ™«

698
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:37,320
â™«Clearly, my heart beats just for youâ™«

699
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:42,120
â™«It's you I want, nothing moreâ™«

700
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:48,480
â™«From now on, you'll be my allâ™«
