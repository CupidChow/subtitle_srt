Your Highness.

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,400
Thank you for giving me a lift.

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,479
Please stop here.

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
I’ll go inside myself.

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,960
Alright, as you please.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
If you need anything,

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,880
just let me know.

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,200
Mmm.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,775
Your Highness,

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
it was a golden opportunity.

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,640
Why didn’t you go inside with her?

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,600
What do you know?

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,640
I can’t push her too hard.

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
If I did, she’d run away.

42
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,925
Oh.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,360
Go get Jin Haitao here.

44
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,040
Ask him to gather the men.

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,040
We’ll have a meeting.

46
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,210
Yes.

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,160
Your Highness.

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,800
Your Highness.

49
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,720
My lords, please sit.

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,800
Yes.

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
Li Qian entered the palace
without being summoned,

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,720
and didn’t organize any
attack on Yongqing State.

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,360
He’s up to something.

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
He’s a latent threat to our state.

55
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,360
You are all aware that

56
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,200
His Majesty is young,

57
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,840
and I’m a member of the Zhao Clan,

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,760
so it is my duty to
share His Majesty’s burdens.

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,920
I invited you here tonight

60
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,280
to discuss the session tomorrow.

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,960
I’m still young and callow.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,840
Please be generous with
your instructions, my lords.

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,200
Your Highness.

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,440
Your Highness, it’s very modest of you.

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,960
You sacrifice all
for the good of our state.

66
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
Your contributions are commendable.

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,320
In my humble opinion,

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
in order to get his wife back,

69
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,320
Li Qian’s unsolicited
entry into the palace

70
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,325
can be the death of him.

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
We just prosecute him

72
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,600
for this one felony,

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
and he will never rise again.

74
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,080
I’m afraid Princess Jia’nan will
take counter measures.

75
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,080
If they join hands,

76
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,440
it won’t be easy.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,840
Don’t worry about that.

78
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,560
However, Li Qian is cunning

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,640
and sophisticated.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,680
Even if Princess Jia’nan
doesn’t do anything,

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,960
one charge alone isn’t
going to be enough.

82
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,360
Fortunately, we have the joint petition

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,480
of Jinxi lords and officials,

84
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,480
which shall certainly bring him down.

85
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,200
Indeed.

86
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,920
It won’t be easy to
make Li Qian give in.

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,640
Like now,

88
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,880
as our discussion proceeds,

89
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,520
he is busy making his preparations.

90
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,800
It’s obvious that Marquis Jinghai’s
action is targeted at Lord Xin.

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,040
Once Lord Xin falls,

92
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
no one is a threat to him anymore.

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
The emperor is young.

94
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,640
When he controls him and arrogates the
imperial authority to command the lords,

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,560
Mu’an will experience a major turnover.

96
00:04:58,725 --> 00:04:59,265
Yes.

97
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,320
And this is why

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,400
we’re here to seek the peace of Mu’an

99
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,320
instead of scheming
against Marquis Jinghai.

100
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,360
Our action is guiltless.

101
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
What we need to consider is

102
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,560
how to cope at the session tomorrow.

103
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
Don’t know what Marquis Jinghai will do.

104
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,680
For tomorrow’s session,

105
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,800
what is your plan, Your Highness?

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,120
Relocation of the capital city.

107
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,680
What? Relocate the capital city?

108
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,960
This is...

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,440
Worry not, my lords.

110
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,600
Without thorough preparations,

111
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,120
I wouldn’t put forward the proposal.

112
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Ever since ancient times,

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
every emperor has guarded
the gate of the state.

114
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,950
The capital city is in the north,

115
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
not far away from Yongqing State.

116
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,520
The defense of the capital city

117
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,800
depends on the garrison in Jinxi,
which locates between the two states.

118
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,880
I have nowhere to go as Lord Xin.

119
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,920
If the capital city is relocated,

120
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,160
the need for Jinxi will
be largely decreased.

121
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,240
This way,

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,320
my importance as Lord Xin will diminish,

123
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,200
and I’ll become an easy opponent.

124
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,720
But how do you know that he plans
to relocate the capital city?

125
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,520
He has been busy

126
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
visiting officials of the Ministry
of Construction or Revenue.

127
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,920
Think about it. What can possibly

128
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,640
set me at a disadvantage

129
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,560
while costing money and labor?

130
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,720
Plus, he made an appointment
with Master Peng.

131
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,320
What does his action mean?

132
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,840
Master Peng is a renowned
and respectable scholar

133
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,680
who is known for his stubbornness.

134
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,320
Now, he’s old,

135
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,800
but he becomes pedantic.

136
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,800
He doesn’t manage
governmental expense or construction.

137
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,200
What did Marquis Jinghai
approach him for?

138
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
It’s because he wanted him
to speak for him,

139
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
to openly support his relocation scheme.

140
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,520
The relocation isn’t a small matter.

141
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,440
Given the rising prices
and financial strain,

142
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,120
I’m afraid the state doesn’t have
that much money.

143
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,600
You’re right, Mr. Li.

144
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,880
In recent years,

145
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,840
there have been floods and earthquakes
across the state,

146
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,160
and the capital city has yet to recover

147
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
from the catastrophe.

148
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,480
But forget not,

149
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
one place is rich

150
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
and abounds in resources.

151
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,725
I’m willing to turn in 80% of the tax
collected to the national treasury.

152
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,880
I wish for the support of the Ministry
of Revenue and Construction in return.

153
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,360
When the relocation is done,

154
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,160
the Ministry of Revenue won’t need to
worry about national revenue anymore.

155
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,880
I have a thorough plan.

156
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:35,275
What plan?

157
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,425
Right.

158
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
It’s a matter of great importance.

159
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,160
Tomorrow,

160
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,040
I wish you all to support me

161
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,040
for a clean court of Mu’an,

162
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,590
and the benefits of our people.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,160
For Mu’an,

164
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,320
for our people,

165
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,040
we shall do our best.

166
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,200
We shall excuse ourselves,
Your Highness.

167
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,640
What concerns me most

168
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,480
is Li Qian’s ace card.

169
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,520
You mean the Grand Empress Dowager?

170
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,040
Correct.

171
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,000
Her Highness has lived
through four generations.

172
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,360
Her words do work better than anyone.

173
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,480
However, she’s been in poor health.

174
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,919
I don’t want too much trouble for her.

175
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,440
Plus, if any accident happens,

176
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
it’ll break Baoning’s heart.

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
So this is about Princess.

178
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,160
But it’ll just

179
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,320
make things harder
for you at the session.

180
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,800
Let it be that way.

181
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,200
I, Li Qian, am not a coward.

182
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,120
For real?

183
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,760
For real.

184
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
Lord Xin and Marquis Jinghai are both
making preparations tensely.

185
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,080
Hurry.

186
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,760
Ask my wife to prepare my uniform

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,000
and the carriage.
I’m going into the palace.

188
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,120
Master, it’s late.

189
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,240
The palace gates are locked.

190
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,040
You weren’t summoned.

191
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,440
If you do it, you’ll leave a bad name.

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
It’s urgent. Never mind that.

193
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,240
Hurry! Hurry!

194
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,960
Yes.

195
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,280
Mr. Zuo.

196
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,160
The imperial palace can’t be entered
without notice.

197
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,840
I need to see Princess Jia’nan
about an urgency.

198
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,920
Mr. Zuo.

199
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
The gates are locked.

200
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,080
Asking to see Princess now

201
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,000
is putting us in a difficult position.

202
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,040
I ask to see Princess Jia’nan
about a national affair.

203
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,520
If it’s impeded,

204
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,960
the consequence will
range from decapitation

205
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,840
to the turnover of the state.

206
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,760
Can you two be responsible for it?

207
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,360
Princess.

208
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,965
Hmm?

209
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,320
Mr. Zuo asks to see you.

210
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
He’s a vassal official.

211
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,200
What does he see Princess for

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,520
in the middle of the night?

213
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,760
Grand Mentor Xiong mentioned
in his letter that

214
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,760
when he’s gone,

215
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,440
I can count on Mr. Zuo’s verdict.

216
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,200
He’s a dependable man.

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,920
Let him in.

218
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,920
Yes.

219
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,920
Greetings, Princess.

220
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,880
I came in late night
regardless of etiquette

221
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,920
because it is important and pressing.

222
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,880
For days,

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,000
Lord Xin and Marquis Jinghai both
have been contacting and gathering

224
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,960
officials to hold secret meetings.

225
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,800
According to my source of information,

226
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,640
they have been discussing...

227
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,320
Mr. Zuo,

228
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,200
I’m a woman.

229
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,440
It’s inappropriate for me to
step into politics.

230
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,360
Princess,

231
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,040
it is the late emperor’s will that
you are to see to the state.

232
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,240
How can you be indifferent to
the national affairs?

233
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,200
If it hadn’t been for you, Princess,

234
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,400
Mu’an would have fallen.

235
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,440
Mu’an was saved by you.

236
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,280
And tomorrow,

237
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,000
you’ll be the only one who is able
to turn the tide.

238
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,160
Do Your Grace know
what they have been discussing?

239
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,600
They intend
to relocate the capital city!

240
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,880
Relocate the capital city?

241
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:49,920
Princess,

242
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,000
Township Mistress Qinghui is here.

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,600
Baoning,

244
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,150
do you know what happened recently?

245
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,120
Cao Xuan has been so busy that
he was nowhere to be found.

246
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
I asked him,
but he didn’t tell me anything.

247
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,360
He just told me not to worry.

248
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,880
But how can I not be worried?

249
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,200
There is a big matter.

250
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,040
What is it about?

251
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,840
It concerns our state

252
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,280
and our people.

253
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,360
His Majesty arrives.

254
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,320
Long live Your Majesty.

255
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,880
Rise, dear lords.

256
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,920
Your Majesty.

257
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,360
I, Jin Haitao, Superintendent of the
Border Battalion, request to speak.

258
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,040
Your Majesty.

259
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,440
I prosecute Li Qian, Lord Xin,

260
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,440
for dereliction of duty and entering
the palace without being summoned

261
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,160
to chase his wife.

262
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,320
His action was in defiance of the law
and the imperial authority.

263
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,440
I request heavy punishment on him

264
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
to enforce the state law.

265
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,960
Your Majesty.

266
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
Li Qian is a vassal lord,

267
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,520
who controls strong armies.
His unsolicited entry into the palace

268
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,760
is an act of rebellion.

269
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Please punish him without mercy

270
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,120
to set an example.

271
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,600
I second that.

272
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,760
I second that.

273
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,850
I second that.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,480
How dare you, Lord Xin!

275
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,520
You are being prosecuted
in front of His Majesty,

276
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,480
but you show no sign of remorse.

277
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,320
Do you have respect for His Majesty?

278
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,040
My respect is only for you,
Your Majesty.

279
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,160
I care only about your words.

280
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,240
The negligible slander is like
the buzz of a fly,

281
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,320
which I choose to ignore.

282
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,840
Your unsolicited entry into the palace

283
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,240
is no slander.

284
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,080
You accuse me of unsolicited entry
into the palace.

285
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,520
Where is your evidence?

286
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,000
You upset Princess Jia’nan,

287
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,920
so Princess returned to the palace
in anger.

288
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,040
You feared that Princess

289
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,680
might speak ill of you to
the Grand Empress Dowager,

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,040
so you rushed here.

291
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,840
The entire world knows of it.

292
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,350
Who are you trying to fool with?

293
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,760
Lord Xin,

294
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,040
I advise you to plead guilty

295
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,560
so that you won’t be regarded spineless,

296
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,160
and as a laughing stock of the state.

297
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,680
Chief Councilor Wang,

298
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,360
Superintendent Jin,

299
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,120
you’re both senior officials
in the imperial court.

300
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Doesn’t the persecution in court

301
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,675
require a check on the approved
memorials to the throne beforehand?

302
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,480
You...

303
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,520
What do you mean by that?

304
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,560
Let’s be prepared.

305
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,960
We shouldn’t attract

306
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,680
too much attention in the capital city.

307
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
I’m going alone.

308
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,040
You send the memorial to His Majesty
at top speed.

309
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,200
Other men go back for now.

310
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,120
Yes.

311
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,160
You’ve made a mistake, dear lords.

312
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,000
Lord Xin’s memorial was delivered
to me many days ago.

313
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,640
He came to the palace to
express his gratitude.

314
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,120
Thus, the unsolicited entry into
the palace is a false charge.

315
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,800
It is not what happened.

316
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,360
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for the clarification.

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,840
It is my duty to garrison Jinxi

318
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,640
and feed the civilians.

319
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,280
You have always had trust in me,

320
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,720
and furthermore,
you bestowed lordship on me,

321
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,400
which I’m deeply grateful for.

322
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,520
I came to express my gratitude.

323
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,880
Your diligent service
on the border is a merit.

324
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,080
You deserve the title of Lord Xin.

325
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,080
Rise. Quickly.

326
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

327
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,000
Your Majesty, I’ll raise yet another
charge against him.

328
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,440
Lord Xin has been a coward for years.

329
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,840
Every time Yongqing State provokes him,
he seals the gates and hides inside,

330
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,320
putting Mu’an to shame and
causing the enemy to laugh at us.

331
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,760
If it goes on, how do we show our might?

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
How do we intimidate the enemy?

333
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,240
Jinxi soldiers and folks
sigh with discontent,

334
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
so a join petition has been written.

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,960
I beg you to save
Jinxi people from distress.

336
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,560
There are

337
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,960
one hundred and thirty-one
people in total

338
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,960
ranging from fourth-level officials

339
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,480
to refined local gentlemen.

340
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
They all wrote down their names
with sincerity.

341
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,800
I wish for your wise verdict.

342
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,200
Jinxi men are hot-blooded men.

343
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,079
We can’t stand the humiliation

344
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,920
because of Lord Xin’s
dereliction of duty.

345
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
Lord Xin, how do you justify yourself?

346
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,079
Your Majesty.

347
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,480
When Yongqing State invaded us,

348
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,720
Jinxi soldiers fought on the front line.

349
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,625
The enemy trampled over the city,

350
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,920
leaving misery and empty houses.

351
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,320
Mothers cried for their sons.

352
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,360
Children cried for their parents.

353
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,080
Jinxi people sacrificed too much

354
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,240
for the war.

355
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,200
If there was another war,

356
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,560
numerous families would be ruined.

357
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,920
So over the years,
I’ve kept the gates closed,

358
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,160
wasting no energy or money

359
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,280
in order for the people
to rebuild their families,

360
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,200
and for us to conserve the energies.

361
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,200
Some day in the future,

362
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
we will battle
Yongqing soldiers bravely.

363
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,080
Lord Xin is glib-tongued.

364
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,920
Only by safeguarding our state

365
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,840
can the folks live in peace.

366
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
Fighting the enemy and rebuilding
families aren’t contradictory.

367
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,040
For example, Marquis Jinghai,

368
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,480
the governor of Nanmin,

369
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,840
fights against pirates on sea while
protecting civilians on land.

370
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,680
He demonstrates the might of Mu’an,

371
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,560
and safeguards his fief.

372
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,640
This is how a vassal performs his duty.

373
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,760
But Lord Xin, you

374
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,680
fear the enemy, and
put our state to shame

375
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,800
while justifying yourself
with fancy words.

376
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,120
Your Majesty,

377
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,120
Marquis Jinghai drafted commoners

378
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
into the army regardless of their lives,

379
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,760
and sold the grains that he stockpiled
for high prices.

380
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,320
Nanmin folks pay the highest taxes

381
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,720
across the world.

382
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,500
Everybody knows it.

383
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,960
Anyone who once lived there complains.

384
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,920
How come
Superintendent Jin describes Nanmin

385
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,800
as a paradise on Earth?

386
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,680
Hearsay is not trustworthy.

387
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,360
Be careful with your words.

388
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,360
Indeed.

389
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,000
Chit-chats of commoners

390
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,320
have no credentials like
the written joint petition.

391
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,400
Lord Xin fears the enemy,

392
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,960
and brings humiliation to our state.
These are both capital crimes.

393
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,440
Please punish him sternly.

394
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,040
The join petition may be forged, too.

395
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,000
But the civilians’ groan comes
from the bottom of their heart.

396
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,360
Lord Cao, are you saying
that the joint petition is forged?

397
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,280
I second Mr. Jin’s plea.

398
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,840
I second Mr. Jin’s plea.

399
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,520
I second Mr. Jin’s plea.

400
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,500
I second Mr. Jin’s plea.

401
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,040
I second Mr. Jin’s plea.

402
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:46,875
(Convince with Morality and Courtesy)

403
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,080
I’m covered with scars.

404
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,960
I got every scar

405
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,600
on the battleground.

406
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,040
If I did fear the enemy,

407
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,440
would I have these scars?

408
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,400
I wonder if Superintendent Jin dares
to remove your top

409
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,800
to show us

410
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,080
how you lead the charge.

411
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,920
This is sheer discourtesy.

412
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,800
Put on your clothes.

413
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,240
Fighting the enemy in war

414
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,720
isn’t lip service.

415
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,600
Allegiance and patriotism

416
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,440
aren’t lip service.

417
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,040
I, Li Qian, fought the enemy
with my life.

418
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,560
I performed patriotism with my life.

419
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,200
Every scar on me

420
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,300
shows my strong love for our state.

421
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
It is my fault for being discourteous
before His Majesty,

422
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,600
and I own my mistake.

423
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,080
However, the accusation
of fearing the enemy,

424
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,640
I disown it.

425
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,160
Lord Xin’s allegiance to me

426
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,640
shouldn’t be questioned.

427
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,160
When the late emperor died,
I was still young.

428
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,720
Everybody saw what happened.

429
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,440
If Lord Xin was rebellious,

430
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,480
I wouldn’t be sitting here
on the throne.

431
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,680
Your Majesty, the joint petition...

432
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,120
I’ll have my verdict
on the joint petition.

433
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
If there’s nothing else,

434
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,920
today’s session is over.

435
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Your Majesty,

436
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,080
I have yet another matter.

437
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,480
Do tell, Master Peng.

438
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,680
Your Majesty,

439
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,120
in the first half year, Jiangnan area
suffered from constant downpour.

440
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,240
There were two major floods.

441
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,640
The imperial court
dismissed two directors.

442
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,200
In August,

443
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,560
the bank of the canal was destroyed
by another flood.

444
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,160
Water transportation was terminated.

445
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,560
And Guanzhong Section of
the Yellow River hasn’t been repaired.

446
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,840
As water transportation stopped,

447
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,800
the grain price increased drastically.

448
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,480
Now, a bucket of rice is at the price
of thirty taels of silver.

449
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,500
What?

450
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,440
Many locals have been forced to
relocate up north or down south.

451
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,000
Refugees roam across the state.

452
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,760
Master Peng,

453
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,960
what is your point?

454
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,480
The capital city can’t last any longer.

455
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,960
Your Majesty.

456
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,240
Ever since Yongqing State
conquered the capital city,

457
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,175
and your father and Grand Mentor Xiong
died for our state,

458
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,640
disasters have never ceased to
distress Mu’an.

459
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,720
Now, the national treasury is
experiencing financial strain.

460
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,160
Citizens in the capital city moan

461
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,840
and complain.

462
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,760
If it goes on,

463
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,400
I’m afraid before Yongqing invades us,

464
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:49,200
Mu’an will fall.

465
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,440
The only solution right now

466
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,880
is to relocate the capital city.

467
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,280
There he said it at last.

468
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,440
Master Peng!

469
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,175
Emperor Gaozu chose here
as the capital city.

470
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,320
We can’t relocate
just because you say so.

471
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Master Peng,

472
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,425
the capital city is
the heart of the state.

473
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,560
Relocation costs money and labor.

474
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,160
It requires careful deliberation.

475
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,720
The capital city is
too close to Yongqing State.

476
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,480
When Emperor Gaozu was alive,

477
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,720
our state had many great warriors.

478
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,800
Every one of them could
make the enemies fear.

479
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,360
But now,

480
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,360
the armies have insufficient provisions.

481
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,000
Provinces have to raise money
to feed the soldiers on their own.

482
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,600
Dare I ask,

483
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,680
if Yongqing State invades us again,

484
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,250
how do we defend ourselves?

485
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,640
Who is going to defend us?

486
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,520
Chief Councilor Wang,

487
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,520
will you die for the state like

488
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,800
Chief Councilor Xiong did?

489
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,080
Master Peng is about to retire,

490
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,160
yet he still worries for the state.

491
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,440
It’s really admirable.

492
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,520
Pray tell, Master Peng,

493
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,640
where should the capital city
be relocated?

494
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,240
Pingchuan.

495
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:38,875
Pingchuan?

496
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,040
Baoning,

497
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,800
will it really work?

498
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,480
It’s the ultimate solution.

499
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,560
It’ll take some days for it to work.

500
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,200
So the sooner, the better.

501
00:25:59,317 --> 00:26:01,475
(Move rice to the capital city to stabilize
the price and appease the civilians.)

502
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Xiaoman, rush this to Shanhu.

503
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,320
Yes.

504
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,440
You go home for now.

505
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,200
And wait for my message.

506
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,475
Hmm.

507
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,480
Pingchuan is a famous city
in Jiangnan area,

508
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,960
and a town of fish and rice.

509
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,240
It’s an abundant place.

510
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,080
It would be quite ideal
to relocate to Pingchuan.

511
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,680
Also, since Lord Xin fears the enemy,

512
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,600
Yongqing people breaking into the palace

513
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,280
may reoccur.

514
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,040
For the sake of your safety,
Your Majesty,

515
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,400
Pingchuan does seem the optimal option.

516
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,400
Yongqing State in the north,
and pirates in the south.

517
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,200
We’re always threatened
from both sides.

518
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,960
The relocation won’t make a difference.

519
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,160
I beg to differ.

520
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,320
Marquis Jinghai’s endeavor of fighting
the pirates is effective.

521
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,280
The south is safe.

522
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,720
You can be reassured, Your Majesty.

523
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,440
And there are many aristocratic
families in the south.

524
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,200
Good talents can be
selected from them.

525
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
The people are rich,

526
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,560
and taxes are satisfying.

527
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,240
The pressure on the national
treasury can be relieved to some extent.

528
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,000
And the armies can be provided
with sufficient provisions.

529
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,100
If we ever have to fight
Yongqing State again,

530
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,040
we’ll stand a better chance.

531
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,800
I entreat for the relocation
of the capital city.

532
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,520
We second that.

533
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,200
Who proposed the relocation
of the capital city?

534
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,360
Let me see your faces.

535
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,120
Great Grandmother!

536
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,320
Great Grandmother.

537
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,320
Now, now, good boy.

538
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Emperor,

539
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,400
most of the officials are good,

540
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,960
but certain people

541
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,600
seek personal gains

542
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,000
disguised as ones who are loyal
to our state and its people.

543
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,225
It’s necessary for you to meet

544
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,450
some of them today

545
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,680
to train your insight in human nature.

546
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,560
Dear lords,

547
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,800
most previous dynasties fell

548
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,560
after the relocation
of their capital city.

549
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,480
Only few succeeded

550
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,680
when their states were prosperous

551
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,760
and their people were stabilized.

552
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,575
Mu’an is still in recovery,

553
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,600
and our people just start to enjoy life.

554
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,960
Relocation at this point
only causes harm to our people.

555
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,760
What’s more,

556
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,200
Yongqing State isn’t coming over,

557
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,840
and you’ve already gotten scared.

558
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,160
Escaping in fear

559
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,240
is the real humiliation to our state.

560
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,350
Even if we do relocate,

561
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
and make this city a second capital,

562
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,240
who goes to the new capital city,

563
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,625
and who stays in the old one?

564
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,640
How do we arrange the old officials
in the new capital city?

565
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,080
How do we co-exist with
the aristocrats in Jiangnan?

566
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,175
Pingchuan is close to Nanmin.

567
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,040
By then,

568
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,320
Yongqing will be far away, but
the pirates will become a new problem.

569
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,440
If His Majesty is
captured by the pirates,

570
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,425
my dear lords, how do you face
the late emperor who died for our state?

571
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,593
Precisely.

572
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,400
Princess Jia’nan is right.

573
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,120
The capital city was built with
the blessings of the dragon.

574
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,760
The dragon power will disappear
once we relocate.

575
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,000
And it’s definitely bad for
the future of our state.

576
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,720
Master Peng,

577
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,040
Jin Haitao,

578
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,840
how are you going to be responsible
for the consequences?

579
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,880
Your Majesty,

580
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,760
Your Highness,

581
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,950
Your Grace,

582
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,525
please listen to me.

583
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,400
We have to relocate!

584
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,760
Master Peng,

585
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,600
you’re not young.

586
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,440
Instead of stopping the madness,

587
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,080
you’re serving as someone’s tool
to escalate it.

588
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,160
You...

589
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,840
I think the older you are,
the more foolish you become.

590
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,800
You can relocate,

591
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,720
but I won’t.

592
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,880
My husband’s mausoleum is here.

593
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,720
Yong’an’s mausoleum is here.

594
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,200
The people are here.

595
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,700
I’m not going anywhere.

596
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,280
Right. I’m not going anywhere, either.

597
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,480
I’m staying here
at Great Grandmother’s side.

598
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,000
Your Highness, Your Majesty.

599
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,360
The relocation is

600
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,320
for the long-term benefit of Mu’an.

601
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,040
If we don’t relocate,

602
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,600
what happened before will reoccur,

603
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,120
and that will be too much for everybody.

604
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,880
Shut up!

605
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,825
I thought you were a good person,

606
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,960
but I’m shocked to hear
these crazy talks from you.

607
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,880
The enemy is upon us,

608
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,800
so we should come up with some
solutions to defeat them.

609
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,240
Instead of working out ideas
to fight Yongqing,

610
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,200
you choose to move to Pingchuan
like a bunch of cowards.

611
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,875
If things go down in Pingchuan,

612
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,680
are we supposed to move to Nanmin?

613
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,680
I wouldn’t dare, Your Highness.

614
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,440
Let’s put the topic of relocation
aside for now.

615
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,560
Marquis Jinghai,

616
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,120
Superintendent Jin,

617
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,440
let’s talk about Jinxi, shall we?

618
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,240
What’s your plan, Lord Xin?

619
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,760
I’m responsible for

620
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,950
what’s written on the joint petition.

621
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,880
I’m willing
to transfer my military power.

622
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,520
To Superintendent Jin, who will be the
temporary commander of Jinxi soldiers.

623
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,080
Fine. I approve it.

624
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you, Your Highness.

625
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,320
The session is over if that’s all.

626
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,760
Good day to you, Your Majesty.

627
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,550
Good day to you, Your Highness.

628
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,520
Good day to you, Your Grace.

629
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,520
Your Highness, about the relocation...

630
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,639
Minister Mei,

631
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,159
the purpose of the relocation
is to weaken Li Qian’s power.

632
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,639
Now that he’s given up
his military power,

633
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,000
it’s not important

634
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
if the relocation is approved or not.

635
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,600
No.

636
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,760
The relocation has to happen.

637
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,000
But the Grand Empress Dowager
just rejected it,

638
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,800
so we mustn’t be hasty.

639
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,400
Superintendent Jin, you take control
over Jinxi troops first.

640
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,320
Master Peng,

641
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,480
I’ll be needing further help from you.

642
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,239
No problem, Your Highness.

643
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,600
Once it’s done,

644
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,000
my effort will be worthwhile.

645
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,920
Good day to you.

646
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,560
Goodbye.

647
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,120
Please.

648
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,800
Mr. Zuo,

649
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,160
what’s your opinion on the relocation
of the capital city?

650
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,200
Li,

651
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
you decided long ago to

652
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
trade the military power for
the rescission of the relocation, right?

653
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,920
If a big bone wasn’t thrown out,

654
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,240
how would I stop the dog from barking?

655
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,440
You gave up the military power to
keep the capital city.

656
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,600
It’s really admirable.

657
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,600
Yes.

658
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,240
The military power is real power,

659
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,680
but you just gave it up.

660
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,880
You’re indeed a great man.

661
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,040
I didn’t have any other choice, did I?

662
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,200
Sorry if I amused you.

663
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Come. Please.

664
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,700
Please.

665
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,120
Useless! Useless! They’re all useless!

666
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,000
Marquis Jinghai promised me that

667
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,600
he’d bring Li Qian down.

668
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,840
Liar!

669
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,375
Please calm down.

670
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,920
It’s bad for your health.

671
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,560
Get lost!

672
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:08,960
Your Highness,

673
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,600
please calm down.

674
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Who would have thought

675
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,520
the Grand Empress Dowager
would go there?

676
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,760
One foot of

677
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,840
the old hag is in the grave,

678
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,480
and still, she has to get in my way.

679
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,225
(Three Abodes of the East)

680
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,240
What are you doing here?

681
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,640
Thank you for your help

682
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,200
at the session.

683
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:47,520
I wasn’t helping you.

684
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,400
I did it for our people.

685
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,720
Stand down.

686
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,040
I have something to say to Princess.

687
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,280
Don’t leave.

688
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,280
Stay here.

689
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
I have nothing to say to him.

690
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,840
Say what you want to say, Lord Xin.

691
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,040
I’d like to talk to you about
the relocation of the capital city.

692
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,175
Since you’re talking business,

693
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,960
please continue.

694
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Giving up the military power
is but an expedient measure.

695
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,120
Zhao Xiao may be silenced today,

696
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,680
but they’ll bring it up again
anytime in the future.

697
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
I’ve written a letter to Miss Dong,

698
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,760
asking her to have some people deliver
a batch of rice to the capital city

699
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,280
to stabilize the price.

700
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,880
The rice price is only one aspect.

701
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,760
The main reason why Zhao Xiao

702
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,960
wants to relocate
the capital city is that

703
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,280
he means to bring me down.

704
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,160
Zhao Xiao does feel
different from before.

705
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,200
Not really.

706
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,800
It’s because we have all changed.

707
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,280
Baoning,

708
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,160
my love for you

709
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,040
never changed.

710
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

711
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,200
Grandmother.

712
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,725
Hmm.

713
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,320
I didn’t disturb you, did I?

714
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,920
Of course not.

715
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,720
Greetings, Grandmother.

716
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,640
Fine, fine.

717
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
I saw your door closed and I knew

718
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,280
you were talking business.

719
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,720
The relocation mustn’t happen.

720
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
I guess

721
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,280
I have to take radical
and shameless measures

722
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,040
to kill their thoughts.

723
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,600
No.

724
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,480
I won’t allow you to do it.

725
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,920
You know what I am going to do?

726
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,720
It doesn’t matter if I know or not.

727
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,750
I just don’t want you to exert yourself.

728
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,120
You just enjoy your days in the palace.

729
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,120
We’ll deal with the rest.

730
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:16,675
Yeah.

731
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,480
As long as things are good
between you two,

732
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,440
I feel reassured.

733
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,280
How much longer do I get to live?

734
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,480
Being able to help you

735
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,920
makes me happy.

736
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,440
Not just for you, though.

737
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,720
I’m doing it for Mu’an and its people.

738
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,900
Even when I’m dead,

739
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,720
along with my husband in Heaven,

740
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,120
I won’t stand aside and do nothing.

741
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,200
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother.

742
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:04,475
(East Market)

743
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,320
Where is
the Grand Empress Dowager going?

744
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,920
Do you see the white sheets?

745
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,320
I think they’re heading to
the Imperial Mausoleums.

746
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,520
A distant relative of mine told me that

747
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,840
some officials in the imperial palace
proposed to relocate the capital city,

748
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,800
but the proposal was rejected
by the Grand Empress Dowager.

749
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,880
They insisted,

750
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,440
so the Grand Empress Dowager
got so mad

751
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,880
that she said she was going to
talk to her late husband.

752
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,080
If the capital city is relocated,

753
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,960
no one will take care of

754
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,040
the citizens like us
in the city anymore.

755
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,440
Yeah.

756
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,160
- Right.
- Yeah.

757
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,480
- No. Come on.
- How do we live our lives?

758
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,560
Let’s follow the Grand Empress Dowager.

759
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,600
Come on, let’s follow them.

760
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,160
Let’s go.

761
00:40:40,825 --> 00:40:43,100
(East Market)

762
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,400
Grandmother,

763
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,240
more and more people have joined us.

764
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,680
We just do what we have to do.

765
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,880
The civilians have their own judgment.

766
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,600
They know what they should do.

767
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,880
Yes.

768
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,240
The Grand Empress Dowager has taken
Princess Jia’nan to the Mausoleums.

769
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,600
What?

770
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,680
Pay respects to the Imperial Mausoleums?

771
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,520
The entire capital city is stirred.

772
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,400
The civilians, both the young and the old,
are following the carriage.

773
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,000
Good.

774
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,400
Excellent.

775
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,960
Applaud the Grand Empress Dowager.

776
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,680
The older, the wiser.

777
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,480
Go fetch my daily clothes,

778
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,400
and inform the others.

779
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,640
We have to catch up with their carriage.

780
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,720
Hurry.

781
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,680
From the emperor to common people,

782
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,000
one is to put moral-cultivation
above anything else.

783
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,200
Those who are immoral and don’t intend
to amend are to be negated.

784
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,280
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

785
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,920
I came with an urgent report.

786
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,760
What is it?

787
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,900
Your Majesty,

788
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,440
the Grand Empress Dowager has left
the palace in a carriage

789
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,500
to pay respects to
the Imperial Mausoleums.

790
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,600
Not only is Princess Jia’nan is with her

791
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,550
but Lord Xin also went.

792
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,920
I guess this is Aunt’s idea.

793
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,800
With such a fine couple seeing to Mu’an,

794
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,250
you can grow at ease, Your Majesty.

795
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,275
Please study this passage
through and through.

796
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,600
I’ll excuse myself, Your Majesty.

797
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,150
I bet Mr. Zuo will go to
the Mausoleums, too.

798
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,660
Do you know

799
00:42:59,660 --> 00:42:59,680
Do you know

800
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,240
why the Grand Empress Dowager
went to pay respects to the Mausoleums

801
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,560
without you?

802
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:05,420
Why Princess Jia’nan
went along

803
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,975
Why Princess Jia’nan
went along

804
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:10,525
without letting you know?

805
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,060
And why Mr. Zuo left you

806
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,440
for the Mausoleums alone?

807
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,000
Because I’m still a child.

808
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,000
No.

809
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,680
Your Majesty.

810
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:31,275
It’s because they all want you
to be safe.

811
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,075
They are fighting a war

812
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,760
without bloodshed for you.

813
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,600
They are charging to
the battlefield for you.

814
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,440
They are shielding you from the attacks.

815
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,760
Their sole wish is

816
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,800
to make it easier for you to
take over the state.

817
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,200
I understand.

818
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,200
I will study hard

819
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,200
and be a good emperor.

820
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,950
(Efficient and Harmonious East Market)

821
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,625
Get lost!

822
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,000
Are you all walking dead?

823
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,920
You didn’t notice any movement
in Shoukang Palace?

824
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,920
You came to inform me
after they left the palace?

825
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,280
What’s the point?

826
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,680
Go find Marquis Jinghai now!

827
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,280
Yes.

828
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:37,920
Your Highness,

829
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,680
I’m afraid Marquis Jinghai
had known it early on.

830
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,920
He’s got informants inside
and outside the palace.

831
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,520
He’s more well-informed than us.

832
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,040
So I’m just supposed to sit here

833
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,600
and wait for his message, huh?

834
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,000
Help me work out a solution

835
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,600
that can stop all this.

836
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,120
Your Highness,

837
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,750
no one has the authority to forbid

838
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,040
the Grand Empress Dowager from
paying respects to the late emperor.

839
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,760
Certainly not Marquis Jinghai.

840
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,440
Your Highness,

841
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,640
you’re the Empress Dowager.

842
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,920
If you can go there

843
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,680
and do whatever you can

844
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,560
to talk the Grand Empress Dowager
out of it,

845
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,760
this is how it gets sorted.

846
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,800
I go?

847
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,600
If I go,

848
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,475
she’ll just tell me to go away.

849
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,480
How can she be nice to me?

850
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,760
Your Highness,

851
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,160
endure the temporary humiliation,

852
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,520
and there may be hope for
another discussion of the relocation.

853
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,680
If you don’t,

854
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,240
the relocation

855
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,520
will never happen.

856
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,040
My love!

857
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,320
(Anling Mausoleum)
Open your eyes and look!

858
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,720
This is the capital city
that you once ruled.

859
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,320
Jinxi can defend it from
the enemy from the west.

860
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,480
Nanmin in the south administrates
thousands of acres of fertile land.

861
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
The Weihe River in the east
makes traveling convenient for people.

862
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,375
This capital city is hundreds of years

863
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,720
of endeavor of Mu’an people.

864
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:34,360
It is a golden city, a heavenly kingdom.

865
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
Your Majesty,

866
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,680
when you were on the throne,

867
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,600
the capital city was
in peace and harmony.

868
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,440
Every household had extra food,
and the nation was prosperous.

869
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,680
It was the ultimate grandeur.

870
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,280
But now,

871
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,600
some courtiers
of cowardice and treachery

872
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:06,040
propose to relocate the capital city
to Pingchuan for personal gains.

873
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,520
Is the capital city really going
to be relocated?

874
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,000
Which fool proposed it?

875
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,920
What an idiot!

876
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,360
- Right.
- Look how mad

877
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,200
the Grand Empress Dowager is.

878
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,920
Right.

879
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,320
Yeah, yeah.

880
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,560
How about I get

881
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,080
Minister Mei and Master Peng here?

882
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,440
The Grand Empress Dowager came here

883
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,200
to complain to her late husband.

884
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,920
What’s the point of them being here?

885
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,775
It’s a political issue

886
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,160
that cannot be dealt with
political measures.

887
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,400
Oh, god!

888
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,800
My dear!

889
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,120
My dear!

890
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,640
Your Majesty!

891
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,760
Your Majesty!

892
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,160
Grandmother.

893
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,600
Greetings, Grandmother.

894
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,800
It’s windy out here in the suburbs.

895
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,720
You can’t catch a cold.

896
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,960
I’m here to take you home.

897
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,200
In the palace,

898
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,120
you never hailed to me.

899
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,200
But now, you came to hail to me

900
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,800
at the Mausoleums in the suburbs.

901
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,450
This is too much for me.

902
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,840
Grandmother,

903
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,840
it’s not that I didn’t want
to hail to you.

904
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,280
It’s you who said no formality.

905
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,975
Do you do what I tell you to do?

906
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,680
Fine.

907
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,240
If I tell you not to
relocate the capital city,

908
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,160
will you comply?

909
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,480
Since you can’t,

910
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,920
just don’t be a hypocrite.

911
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,200
The people are watching.

912
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,440
I feel ashamed for you.

913
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,920
Get away!

914
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,160
Your Majesty,

915
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,840
you see it?

916
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,840
Your people have
lived here for generations.

917
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,200
This is their home.

918
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,120
This is where they root.

919
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:15,750
How can the capital be relocated?

920
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,320
Relocate the capital.

921
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,960
Relocate the capital.

922
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,520
If it does happen,

923
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,080
what about the people?

924
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,360
I’m old.

925
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,360
I’ll soon be dead anyway.

926
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,520
I... I even want to
kill myself right here

927
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,160
by hitting my head against a stone

928
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,280
so that I can be with you, my dear.

929
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,520
I’d rather live with
my late husband underground

930
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,320
than die in Pingchuan.

931
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,800
Grandmother, please calm down.

932
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,200
Watch your health.

933
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,280
Please calm down, Your Highness.

934
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,575
Our lives for the capital.

935
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,200
We swear, no relocation!

936
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,520
Our lives for the capital.
We swear, no relocation.

937
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,560
Our lives for the capital.
We swear, no relocation.

938
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,560
Our lives for the capital.
We swear, no relocation.

939
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,480
Our lives for the capital.
We swear, no relocation.

940
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,400
Your Highness.

941
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,720
What do we do next

942
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,560
about the relocation?

943
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,200
It has come this far.

944
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,600
There’s nothing we can do anymore.

945
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,200
Your Highness?

946
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,850
Easy.

947
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,500
Your Highness.

948
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,200
Her Grace worries about your health,

949
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,720
so she cooked the figwort soup
in the morning before she went out.

950
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,080
Drink some to relieve your fatigue.

951
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,480
It’s the figwort

952
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,475
that Qian sent over, right?

953
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,760
Yes.

954
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,720
Good kids.

955
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,925
You’re both filial kids.

956
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,040
This is my duty.

957
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,560
Thanks to you,
the capital city is preserved.

958
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,520
We have won the people’s hearts.

959
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,950
Neither Empress Dowager
nor Marquis Jinghai

960
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,560
will bring up the relocation again.

961
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,120
I meant to shut them up.

962
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,825
Come to me, Baoning.

963
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,560
Don’t feel bad.

964
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,200
It was just some yelling.

965
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,320
That was nothing.

966
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,600
I’m fine.

967
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,720
I

968
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,160
intentionally put on a show.

969
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,925
I hate myself for my helplessness.

970
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,760
I shouldn’t have
put you in such a hardship.

971
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,480
This is no hardship.

972
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,625
I’ve been living
in the palace for decades.

973
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,040
I’ve experienced all kinds of stuff.

974
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,280
This is hardly a hardship.

975
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,360
Don’t feel bad.

976
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,300
Hmm.

977
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,440
Baoning,

978
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,480
Grandmother exerted herself
in the morning.

979
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,880
Just let her rest.

980
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,040
Sure.

981
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,440
Grandmother, you get some sleep.

982
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,880
I’ll come to see you after you wake up.

983
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,520
Alright.

984
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,450
No more tears.

985
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,075
Hmm.

986
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,080
Grandmother,

987
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,680
I’m going back to Jinxi

988
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,080
to complete the transfer
of military power.

989
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,760
I may set out this afternoon,

990
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,640
so here I bid you farewell in advance.

991
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,480
Alright.

992
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,080
You have your own judgment.

993
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,360
I won’t give you any advice.

994
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,200
Just be safe.

995
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,360
Thank you, Grandmother.

996
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,120
Baoning,

997
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,600
will you see me off?

998
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,750
Yes.

999
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,360
You’ll be separated for some time.

1000
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,760
Baoning,

1001
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,840
go see him off.

1002
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:36,550
Hmm.

1003
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,200
Are you alright, Your Highness?

1004
00:53:54,225 --> 00:53:55,040
Too bad.

1005
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,760
The ten-thousand-year-old nourishment
isn’t working.

1006
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,050
Give me the life-maintaining soup.

1007
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,920
That’s what keeps me alive.

1008
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,200
Your Highness,

1009
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,040
that soup uses strong ingredients.

1010
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,800
Your core will be damaged
if you keep drinking it.

1011
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,600
I’m well aware.

1012
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,920
The longer it keeps me alive,

1013
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,000
the more days I get to be with Baoning.

1014
00:54:24,575 --> 00:54:26,200
And it contents me.

1015
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,160
Remember,

1016
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,900
don’t mention it before the kids.

1017
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,000
Yes, I understand.

1018
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,240
Go fetch it.

1019
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,520
Yes.

1020
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,840
I’m here to fetch the tonic herbs
for Empress Dowager.

1021
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,760
This is a-thousand-year-old figwort,
ganoderma and astragalus.

1022
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,840
How come there’s a strong herb
in the palace?

1023
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,280
I... I’m not allowed to say anything.

1024
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,120
You aren’t allowed?

1025
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,760
Do you think I don’t
know the toxicity of it?

1026
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,000
I’ll tell Her Highness at once.

1027
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,600
You mustn’t.

1028
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,200
I’m forbidden by Shoukang Palace.

1029
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,760
Forbidden by Shoukang Palace?

1030
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,800
It is about the Grand Empress Dowager?

1031
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,280
Another prescription is used

1032
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,375
to balance the toxicity.

1033
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,760
That’s her
life-maintaining prescription.

1034
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,200
It’s been three months.

1035
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,480
Three months?

1036
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,880
She’s been drinking it for three months.

1037
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,800
In this case,

1038
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,000
she hasn’t got many days to live.
