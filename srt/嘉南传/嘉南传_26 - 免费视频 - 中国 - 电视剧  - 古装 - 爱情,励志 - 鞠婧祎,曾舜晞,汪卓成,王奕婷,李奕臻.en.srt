00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,040
Cai Shuang,

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,279
look at you.

29
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,759
You’re the Officer Accountant
of the Border Battalion

30
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,240
and take care of the military supplies.

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,919
But you did such a dirty thing.

32
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,559
If you refuse to confess,

33
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:24,160
I’ll take my time with you.

34
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,919
This is Bingzhou,
the territory of the Li Family.

35
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,320
No one can save you.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,360
Junior General Jin,

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,399
we’re never enemies.

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,559
Please let me go.

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,559
If I do, how will I explain to my buddy?

40
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,880
In case of suspicion,

41
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,839
Li Qian asked me to interrogate you.

42
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,360
How about this?

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,080
Today,

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,360
let me show you how I torture people.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,080
Junior General Jin, I’ll confess!

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,759
I’ll confess!

47
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,520
I’ll confess everything!

48
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,320
I will.

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,600
Confess, then.

50
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,279
Mother!

51
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:24,800
Go!

52
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,759
- Ridiculous!
- Mother!

53
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,000
- Let go of me!
- Go!

54
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:27,960
Behave yourself!

55
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,080
What are you doing?

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
- Get in.
- Go.

57
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,960
Mother.

58
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,600
I’m warning you.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,399
Do you know who we are?

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,160
I don’t care.

61
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,279
I’ve caught you, anyway.

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Close the door!

63
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,160
- Don’t!
- You devil!

64
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,759
You devils!

65
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,759
Cai Shuang abused his power,

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,520
diverted the military pay,

67
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,800
and ganged up for exorbitant profits

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,160
so that Xuanjia Battalion has no food

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,440
or clothes.

70
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,399
He undermined the morale
and can’t be forgiven.

71
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:01,000
He’ll be flogged a hundred times,

72
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,559
expelled from the army,

73
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,800
and never hired again.

74
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,279
Do it immediately!

75
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:10,800
Get down.

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,399
(Li’s Mansion)
I was away for only a few days.

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,720
But such terrible things
happened in Bingzhou.

78
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,320
78 members of the Zhuang Family
were put in prison.

79
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,760
Half of their stores were sealed up
by the government.

80
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,679
A refugee ate some moldy rice

81
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,519
and died in the charity house.

82
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,359
Winter clothes sent to the Battalion

83
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,440
were made of cotton with so much sand.

84
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,399
All these things are said
to be related to our family.

85
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,480
Hu Yiliang only gave me three days.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,440
I must reply to him in three days.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,640
Tell me.

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
What exactly happened?

89
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,359
Uncle,

90
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,799
this is all my fault.

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
I take all the blame.

92
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,119
Li Qian.

93
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,399
May I have a word with you?

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,239
What do you want to say?

95
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,760
When Cai Shuang was interrogated,

96
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,920
he must have confessed
many other people.

97
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,640
I want to know

98
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,040
if Miaorong is also involved.

99
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,640
Gao Miaorong sent you, didn’t she?

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
Don’t you worry about yourself?

101
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,959
I’m a man.

102
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,119
When I make a mistake,

103
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,720
I should take responsibility.

104
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
But she’s a girl.

105
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,239
If she has a bad reputation,

106
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,559
she may not manage

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,200
to find a good husband.

108
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,640
For the sake

109
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,440
that you grew up with her,

110
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,720
please let her go.

111
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,320
I know you’ve always been
caring for her.

112
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:11,119
But care is care.

113
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,440
Rules are rules.

114
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,880
Over so many years,

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,480
I’ve never begged you.

116
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,320
I’m begging you for this once.

117
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,959
For the sake that we’re cousins,

118
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
help her this time.

119
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,519
Do you think Gao Miaorong
can get away

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,160
simply when I let go of her?

121
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,839
As long as you do,

122
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,119
I’ll take care

123
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,880
of the rest.

124
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,600
You?

125
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,359
You treat me as your own son, Uncle.

126
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,519
But for selfish desire,

127
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,600
I let you down.

128
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,359
Instead of helping the charity house

129
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,720
as you told me,

130
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,600
I diverted the circulating fund
for personal use.

131
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,839
To make it up,

132
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,279
I spent the remaining money

133
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,239
buying moldy rice for the charity house.

134
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,440
As for the cotton with sand,

135
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,760
I deliberately bought it

136
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,000
to explain to you.

137
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,119
I made a terrible mistake.

138
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,600
I’d like to take all the punishment.

139
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,720
Li Lin,

140
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,239
how muddled you were!

141
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,880
Lin, why did you do that?

142
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,239
Tell us.

143
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,760
Tell us what trouble you have.

144
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,839
We can solve the problem with you.

145
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,119
Why did you betray your conscience

146
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,799
and do such evil things?

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,839
Do you know that boy

148
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,079
is even less than six years old?

149
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,559
However daring Li Lin is,

150
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,519
he only manages the family business.

151
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,119
How could he do as he wished

152
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,399
in Bingzhou’s government
and business circles?

153
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,600
Without Father’s private seal
as the pass,

154
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,359
why would officials and merchants
cooperate with him?

155
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,839
But once this case
is further investigated,

156
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:48,760
our family can’t get away.

157
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,000
It has very a bad impact locally.

158
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,119
Once our family is tracked down,

159
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,399
I’m afraid

160
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
we’ll be exterminated.

161
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,160
What?

162
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,959
Our family will be exterminated?

163
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,519
Oh my God.

164
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,079
It took us great trouble

165
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,279
to develop our family up to this day.

166
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,519
If we’re involved in this case...

167
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,440
Master, say something.

168
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,839
Say something.

169
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,920
In our family, who dared

170
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,279
to steal my private seal?

171
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,080
Yeah, who stole it?

172
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:18,000
I stole the private seal.

173
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,200
What?

174
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,679
What did you say?

175
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,280
Right.

176
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,000
It was me.

177
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,200
Gao Fuyu,

178
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,119
we’ve been friends for years.

179
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,080
Why did you harm me like that?

180
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,559
Since Her Grace married Young Master,

181
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,599
the Li Family is getting higher status.

182
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,559
You and I,

183
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,599
the so-called adviser,

184
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,000
have grown further apart.

185
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,400
Everyone is selfish.

186
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,599
So am I.

187
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,799
For future long-term interests,

188
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,919
I sneaked into your study

189
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,080
and stole your private seal
for my own use.

190
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
You gave Li Lin some money

191
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,359
for capital turnover.

192
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,799
I also persuaded him to divert it.

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,679
He didn’t have a choice,

194
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,679
but to make such a big mistake.

195
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,880
You’re saying you’re also involved

196
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,760
in the illegal money house?

197
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,159
Yes.

198
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,520
Come on, Gao Fuyu.

199
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,599
Don’t you know you’ll get executed?

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,000
What were you thinking of?

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
Under such circumstances,

202
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,679
I’m at your disposal.

203
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,359
Somebody!

204
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,200
Take Gao Fuyu to the government office

205
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,080
for his punishment.

206
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,679
Uncle Li,

207
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
please spare my uncle,

208
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,719
for the sake of the old days.

209
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,520
My uncle has no wife or children.

210
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,960
He risked his life to collude
with the illegal money house,

211
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,200
for the good of the whole family.

212
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,159
Once the case gets worse,

213
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,760
he isn’t the only one

214
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,599
who colludes
with the illegal money house.

215
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,119
Madam, if the trouble gets bigger,

216
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,159
I’m afraid you can’t get away, either.

217
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,400
What does that mean?

218
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,880
How am I involved?

219
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,880
Madam,

220
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,280
you don’t get the usury every month

221
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,440
out of nowhere.

222
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,039
But...

223
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,119
I...

224
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,599
Mother,

225
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,000
you really do the usury?

226
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,880
What else can I do?

227
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,320
It’s...

228
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,119
Like she said,

229
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,760
to get your brother to marry Her Grace,

230
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,440
we spent a lot of money.

231
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,320
Didn’t your father know that?

232
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,359
He Cuihua!

233
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Why do I have
such a stupid wife like you?

234
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,880
Mother, tell us.

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
Did you really do the usury?

236
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,840
Stop... stop asking!

237
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,760
Now that you all don’t trust me,

238
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,479
I can’t live anymore.

239
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,919
Mother! Mother!

240
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,880
Did you really do that?

241
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,320
Mother!

242
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,000
What’s done is done.

243
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,640
There’s no point
in assessing blame.

244
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,919
The illegal money house is extensive.

245
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,320
Even if we caught Cai Shuang

246
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,239
and got back some money,

247
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,520
some of the pension

248
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:50,479
to the Battalion hasn’t been found yet.

249
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,840
All we can do now

250
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,080
is to minimize the losses.

251
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,919
I’m willing to use my dowry

252
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,119
to cover the deficit.

253
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,719
After the case is solved,

254
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:03,840
let’s get the money back slowly.

255
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,880
Baoning.

256
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,960
Let’s do it.

257
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,599
Father.

258
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:11,320
Your Grace,

259
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:13,359
I keep in mind

260
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,280
how you’re trying to help.

261
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,599
Father,

262
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,239
even if Baoning covers the deficit
with her private money,

263
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,760
this case has already brought

264
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,239
a large impact on our family.

265
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,000
Either to the court or the government,

266
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,280
we have to give
a reasonable explanation.

267
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,159
Master,

268
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,799
let me take the blame.

269
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,559
Uncle! Uncle!

270
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,280
Uncle!

271
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,880
(Self-cultivation for Long-term Stability)
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

272
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,200
My birthday is in five days.

273
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,640
Thank you for your recent hard work.

274
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,119
But I decide

275
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,239
not to hold the birthday banquet.

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,960
But everything is ready for that.

277
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,760
Please think carefully.

278
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,599
Think carefully, Your Highness.

279
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,799
I just knew that
the disaster relief was hard.

280
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,440
I shouldn’t hold
a grand birthday banquet

281
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,200
at such a critical moment.

282
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,599
So, I’ve decided

283
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,400
to save the money

284
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,559
and use it for disaster relief.

285
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,960
As for the transferred
and purchased things,

286
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,479
please handle them properly.

287
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,320
Your Highness, it’s so kind of you

288
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,760
and you’re quite a model.

289
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,320
Your Highness, it’s generous of you.

290
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,719
I really admire that.

291
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,479
We’ll go get it done.

292
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:55,200
Your Highness,

293
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,799
why did you cancel the banquet?

294
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,640
Many preparations will be wasted.

295
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,679
The Grand Empress Dowager is right.

296
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,200
I’m not only Yi’s wife,

297
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,359
but also the Empress of Mu’an.

298
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,880
Zhuang Li, kneel

299
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,320
and plead with His Majesty.

300
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,200
Please show some mercy, Your Majesty.

301
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,320
Your Majesty,

302
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,000
my brother Zhuang Shu
has worked in Jinxi for over ten years.

303
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,320
He deserves credit for hard work.

304
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,880
Now, he’s framed up by villains,

305
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,559
put in prison
on the charge of taking bribes,

306
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,719
and waits to be executed.

307
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,119
78 members of his family

308
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,280
aren’t spared.

309
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,520
Your Majesty.

310
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,599
Your Majesty, please check the case

311
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,119
and bring justice

312
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,200
to our family, Your Majesty.

313
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,880
Do you mean Commandery Princess Jia’nan?

314
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,599
Zhuang Li.

315
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,760
Your Majesty.

316
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,400
How dare you talk nonsense to me!

317
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,679
Who harmed the civilians?

318
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,200
I’m asking you the last time!

319
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:18,919
Fine.

320
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,760
You don’t want to say it.

321
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:22,320
Then read it.

322
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,359
These are crimes

323
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,679
your brother has done over the years.

324
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,719
Every crime

325
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,200
is a capital crime to get him beheaded.

326
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,400
Why would this happen?

327
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:38,039
Why would this happen?

328
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,599
Your Excellency, Your Excellency,

329
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,119
you know me best.

330
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,239
My family and I

331
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:46,280
wouldn’t do such dirty things.

332
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,080
Your Excellency.

333
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,159
Your Excellency!

334
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,760
Your Majesty,

335
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,919
Zhuang Li is my apprentice.

336
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,719
I recommended him to the court

337
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,200
with an important post.

338
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,439
But I never expected him

339
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,280
to play the bully
and hurt people in Jinxi

340
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:11,880
with my favor.

341
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,119
Zhuang Li.

342
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,640
Your Excellency.

343
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,719
From this day on,

344
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,119
you’re no longer

345
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,800
my apprentice.

346
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,319
Your Excellency.

347
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,599
Your family received favor for years.

348
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,800
Instead of being grateful,

349
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,119
you used your jobs to set
an illegal money house in Jinxi

350
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,560
and hurt local people.

351
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,800
If your crimes hadn’t been sent

352
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,839
to me at top speed,

353
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,880
I would still have been kept
in the dark.

354
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Your Majesty,

355
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,719
I... I’m sorry.

356
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:04,400
Somebody.

357
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,520
Your Majesty.

358
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,319
Your Majesty, I’m sorry. Your Majesty!

359
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,479
Zhuang Li sheltered his family,
framed the Commandery Princess,

360
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,760
and despised the court.

361
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,000
As of today,

362
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,319
he’s no longer an official,
but a civilian.

363
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,040
Put him to the Ministry of Punishments
for interrogation.

364
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,800
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

365
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,839
I’m sorry, Your Majesty.

366
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,959
I know I was wrong!

367
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,239
Wang Jidao.

368
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,680
You’re the Chief Councilor,

369
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:32,839
but you let your apprentice
do evil everywhere.

370
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,760
I’ll dock your pay for six months.

371
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,079
From this day on,

372
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,199
you’ll be grounded for half a month.

373
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,199
Thank you, Your Majesty.

374
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,439
I take this punishment.

375
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:44,839
Off you go.

376
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,160
Why isn’t the recovered pension

377
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,599
returned to the Commissariat?

378
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,520
The Commissariat?

379
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:08,439
So that you can use them privately?

380
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,800
Li Qian, don’t talk nonsense!

381
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
I did everything for Huben Battalion

382
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,560
and Xuanjia Battalion.

383
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,160
For them?

384
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,880
Then you let Cai Shuang lavishly spend

385
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,599
the pension from the court?

386
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:28,920
Li Qian,

387
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,479
we both know that

388
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,640
the pension from the court

389
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,560
is insufficient.

390
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,599
We’ve lost a lot in the war
against Yongqing State.

391
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,839
I’ve tried my best

392
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,719
to make up for my mistake.

393
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,079
Then hoodwinked by Cai Shuang,

394
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,439
I had the pension sent
to the illegal money house

395
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,000
because only when I got the most rewards

396
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,479
in a short period

397
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,839
could I guarantee the food and clothing
of our soldiers.

398
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,479
It’s not you who feed the soldiers,

399
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,160
but my wife Jiang Baoning!

400
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,520
To make up for your mistake,

401
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,680
she even used her dowry.

402
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,000
I don’t expect you to be grateful.

403
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,880
I just want you
to be aware of your stand

404
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,079
and not to do stupid things again.

405
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,760
You were lucky enough

406
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,079
when you weren’t involved in this case.

407
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,040
But if the same thing happens again,

408
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,520
you know the consequences.

409
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,199
You’re leaving?

410
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,680
After everything that has happened,

411
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,079
I’m too ashamed to stay.

412
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:47,880
Miaorong,

413
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,280
will you leave with me?

414
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,560
Instead of staying and waiting

415
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,959
for someone who will never love you,

416
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,359
why not free yourself

417
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,800
and start a new life?

418
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:07,959
I still don’t want to leave.

419
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,719
Why do you insist?

420
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:19,760
In this case,

421
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,880
I won’t force you.

422
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,160
He’s over there.

423
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,400
Take a look and leave soon.

424
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,079
Thank you.

425
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,199
You have a quarter at most.

426
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,319
Go ahead.

427
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,959
Uncle.

428
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,880
Uncle.

429
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,239
Miaorong?

430
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,319
You shouldn’t have come.

431
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:11,760
Uncle, what happened to you?

432
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,599
Why do you look so pale?

433
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,880
Give me your hand.
Let me feel your pulse.

434
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,280
In three days,

435
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,439
I’ll be exiled to the borderland.

436
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,640
Let fate decide

437
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,400
whether I live or die.

438
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,839
Uncle,

439
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:33,400
I shouldn’t have done that.

440
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,280
It’s my fault.

441
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,239
Beat me.

442
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,040
Blame me, Uncle.

443
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:46,000
It doesn’t matter who to blame.

444
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,160
After we part,

445
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,920
I’m afraid we won’t
see each other again.

446
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,920
Miaorong,

447
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,599
from this day on,

448
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,359
behave yourself.

449
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,200
(Li’s Mansion)

450
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,719
Qian.

451
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,680
Your uncle is sentenced to exile.

452
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,880
What would you like to say?

453
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,119
I saw him off in the cell.

454
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,640
Is this your answer?

455
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,680
I don’t understand.

456
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,719
What role did you play in this case?

457
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,239
You and I both know that.
Don’t try to cover it.

458
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:46,359
To protect you,

459
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,719
your uncle sacrificed his future.

460
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,319
All he wants

461
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:53,520
is to make you safe
for the rest of your life.

462
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,239
And Li Lin...

463
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,640
He was forced to leave because of you.

464
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,959
You owed them quite a lot.

465
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,479
If someone owes it,

466
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,920
you owe me.

467
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
I don’t owe anyone.

468
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,800
Since you married Jiang Baoning,

469
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,479
you’re no longer the man

470
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:18,479
I used to know.

471
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Qian,

472
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,160
I don’t want this.

473
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,199
I really don’t want this.

474
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,760
We grew up together.

475
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,400
We’re childhood sweethearts.

476
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,520
I thought we would marry no one,

477
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,680
but each other.

478
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,880
But why?

479
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,280
Why did you

480
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:49,319
marry Jiang Baoning?

481
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,160
We’re not pre-destined to get married.

482
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,319
Are we not pre-destined

483
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:01,280
or do I have no luck?

484
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,520
Qian,

485
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,640
without Jiang Baoning,

486
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,800
would you like me?

487
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,199
Without her,

488
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:15,800
I would have been your wife.

489
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,760
Even without Baoning,

490
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,680
you and I

491
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,160
would never get married.

492
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,760
I don’t believe that.

493
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,520
It’s impossible.

494
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,119
I don’t believe that.

495
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,000
I don’t.

496
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:42,800
(Bamboo Sways in Wind)
Master.

497
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,560
(Bamboo Sways in Wind)
What?

498
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,640
Master, Madam,

499
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,560
a messenger came from the capital city,

500
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:50,319
saying His Majesty would promote
Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

501
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,599
Master,

502
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,079
- it’s a happy event.
- Good news.

503
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,959
Go gather them to meet the messenger.

504
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,079
Yes.

505
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,599
Be very careful.

506
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,760
Put everything in good order.

507
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,680
Put all the things in.

508
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,000
Don’t break any.

509
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,520
These are all from the Palace.

510
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,680
All right.

511
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,839
Move a little bit.

512
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,800
Jiang Baoning,

513
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,800
one day,

514
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,439
I’ll make everything you have now

515
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,599
come to naught.

516
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:31,479
Gao Fuyu has served my father
for several decades.

517
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,560
He’s always loyal and never greedy.

518
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,719
But at such an old age,

519
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,560
he’s unexpectedly exiled.

520
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,160
I wonder if he can return to Bingzhou

521
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,560
before he dies.

522
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,359
Anyway,

523
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,079
if you hadn’t caught Cai Shuang

524
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,239
at the critical moment,

525
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,680
things wouldn’t have gone so smoothly.

526
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,560
Baoning,

527
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,119
are you feeling unwell?

528
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,719
Who annoyed my dear wife?

529
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:10,400
Tell me.

530
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,839
I’ll give him a lesson.

531
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:19,280
Do the things from the Palace

532
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,520
not satisfy you?

533
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,160
Go away. I don’t want to talk to you.

534
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,839
Shouldn’t you have a reason
to execute a criminal?

535
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,199
Stop laughing.

536
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:38,719
Tell me.

537
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,800
Before marrying me,

538
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,000
did you like any other girl?

539
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,920
No.

540
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,439
Without me,

541
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,280
who would you marry?

542
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:50,880
What do you mean without you?

543
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,520
You’re right in front of me.

544
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,959
I mean if.

545
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,560
There’s no if.

546
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,680
But...

547
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,560
Fine, then.

548
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,839
Why are you sure you could marry me?

549
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:04,959
What if you didn’t even have a chance
to go to the capital city?

550
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,880
Or what if

551
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,079
when you met me,

552
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,400
I had married someone else?

553
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,479
If we missed each other,

554
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,439
we would have another kind of life.

555
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,920
Once we met,

556
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,199
you only belonged to me.

557
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,920
I care for no one, but you.

558
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,880
Don’t beat around the bush.

559
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,640
Don’t change the topic.

560
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:26,239
Who can be sure about fate?

561
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,400
Think about it.

562
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,839
Many couples fail to get married.

563
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,199
Many even pretend to be happy.

564
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,760
Common people like us

565
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,359
can’t control such things.

566
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,599
Are you being jealous?

567
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,199
What?

568
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,479
There’s a smell on you.

569
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,800
Let me smell it.

570
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,079
Why do you smell sour?

571
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,719
I said no.

572
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,839
Am I so mean?

573
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,839
I won’t be jealous
of such a small thing.

574
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:08,520
No matter who you like or care for,

575
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,800
it’s your own business.

576
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:11,959
Even if you lose your judgment

577
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,640
for her,

578
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,400
it’s your choice.

579
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,760
Why did you say “her”?

580
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,760
Why didn’t you just say Gao Miaorong?

581
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,079
I’m not a fool.

582
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,839
I know she’s involved

583
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
in recent problems.

584
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,280
If possible,

585
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,439
I also want her to pay the price

586
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,359
for what she has done.

587
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,239
But Baoning,

588
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,439
my cousin

589
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,000
hasn’t ever begged me before.

590
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,280
For Gao Miaorong,

591
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:38,359
he knelt to me and begged me,
regardless of his dignity.

592
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,479
He was even forced to leave home.

593
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:42,959
Gao Fuyu was exiled, too.

594
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,119
If you were me,

595
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,920
what would you do?

596
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,680
Li Lin knelt to you for Gao Miaorong?

597
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,239
I don’t want to hurt the feelings
between him and me.

598
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,239
For his sake, I had to
spare Gao Miaorong.

599
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,880
Whether in the past or at present,

600
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,000
Gao Miaorong is only my younger sister.

601
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,920
Always a sister.

602
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,760
Are you sure?

603
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,479
Yes, forever.

604
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,280
Are you satisfied now?

605
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,560
It depends on your behavior.

606
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,680
Yes, Your Grace.

607
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,400
(Bamboo Sways in Wind)

608
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,239
Where’s Dongdong?

609
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,000
She’s gone out of town for a mission.

610
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:42,560
Catch up.

611
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,280
All right.

612
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,599
Dismiss.

613
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,119
Don’t be afraid. I’m here to save you.

614
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:57,239
Who are you?

615
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,520
Why did you save me?

616
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
He’s dead.

617
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:14,239
Before leaving Bingzhou,

618
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,800
the Second Prince went to see you
in Qinfang Pavilion.

619
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,760
He escorted you to the pharmacy house
in Sanyuan Town.

620
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,199
My mother said,

621
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:26,640
if you keep thinking
of the man you like,

622
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,239
you’ll realize that he’s behind you

623
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,880
and protecting you secretly.

624
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,760
Your mother must have deceived you.

625
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,359
She never deceives me.

626
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
You don’t see him
because you’re stupid.

627
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,920
Young Master,

628
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,239
you left your purse on your table.

629
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:47,680
What happened to your face?

630
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,040
I... I fell just now.

631
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:53,400
So, he was always there for me.

632
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,839
His Highness never meant
to deceive you.

633
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,439
He did business
between Yongqing and Mu’an

634
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:05,079
in case Qing Tai was suspicious of him

635
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,560
and also to look for his mother.

636
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,000
He wasn’t a scout of Yongqing.

637
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,080
He didn’t deliberately
approach you, either.

638
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,639
He had a true love for you.

639
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,000
How did he die?

640
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,919
After Yongqing took the throne,

641
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,199
he remained a despotic rule

642
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,760
and wanted to start a war
between two states.

643
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
His Highness then summoned

644
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,639
the Dark Force his father left him.

645
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:40,639
He collaborated with generals
against Qing Tai

646
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,320
and tried to overthrow Qing Tai.

647
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,080
Unexpectedly...

648
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,760
Qing An,

649
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,239
without Father,

650
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,479
you’ll be nothing, but a useless dog.

651
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,639
Without my permission,

652
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,159
who do you think wants to
pledge loyalty to you?

653
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,159
Do me a favor.

654
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:24,800
Take this to Dongzhi.

655
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,120
Tell her

656
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,760
I’ve never betrayed her.

657
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,000
I completed his mission.

658
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,919
Before he died, he said

659
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,399
he had never betrayed you.

660
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
You can

661
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,679

waiting until Young Master comes back.

683
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,000
I don’t think
you want to do anything else.

684
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,080
What’s this?

685
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,280
I’m reading the book.

686
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,600
You’re holding it upside down.

687
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,399
As calculated,

688
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,360
Young Master has left the Battalion.

689
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:14,800
He’s arriving home soon.

690
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,439
Your Grace.

691
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,760
Make way.

692
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,760
Your Grace,

693
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,000
Young Master had a message sent.

694
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,959
He’s too busy with work

695
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,159
to come back these days.

696
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,040
He asked you to take a rest early
instead of waiting for him.

697
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,320
So, you’re waiting for him, Your Grace?

698
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:43,399
Qingke. Qingke.

699
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,360
- You two!
- Qingke.

700
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,600
Let’s go fly the kite.

701
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,439
Wait for me. Wait.

702
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:48,959
Wait for me. I’m going, too.

703
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:56,959
Your Grace,

704
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,360
I hear there’s a fair
in the east of Bingzhou.

705
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:00,399
Shall we go have a look?

706
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:02,000
Go.

707
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,520
Miss, how about some lotus cake?

708
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:07,879
- Smells good.
- No. Don’t bother.

709
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:08,800
Thanks.

710
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,199
Let me buy you a dress.

711
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:13,239
How about this?

712
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:14,199
Look.

713
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,040
It’s too ugly.

714
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,280
Ugly?

715
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:21,800
Fine.

716
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,399
How about this?

717
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:25,040
It’s simple. How do you like it?

718
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,840
The sleeves don’t look good.

719
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,159
You’re quite demanding.

720
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:29,560
I think it’s good.

721
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,280
Don’t touch it unless you buy it.

722
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,959
If you stain it, how can I sell it?

723
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,320
Take it back.

724
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,080
Without checking it,

725
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,800
how do we know if it suits?

726
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,280
Besides, you’re
the Commandery Princess.

727
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,840
Dresses made in the Palace

728
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,320
or Li’s Mansion

729
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:46,800
are far better than his goods.

730
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,280
Don’t be angry.

731
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,479
Miss, try it on if you like.

732
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:51,959
I won’t charge if it looks bad on you.

733
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,120
Have a look.

734
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
Looks good.

735
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,719
It looks beautiful on you.

736
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,040
You have good taste.

737
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,360
Son, don’t run about.
It’s very crowded here.

738
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,360
Be a good boy.

739
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,679
I don’t know if he will like it.

740
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,679
Anyway, I picked the best ones.

741
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:14,199
Miss, have a look at the bracelet.

742
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,679
- It looks beautiful.
- No, thanks.

743
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,000
Take it.

744
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,199
Your Grace, we’ve bought
so many things.

745
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,399
Even if we wear a new one every day,

746
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,760
it’ll take nearly half a month.

747
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,679
Mother!

748
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:28,320
If it really takes...

749
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:32,239
Your Grace?

750
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,120
Miss!

751
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,560
Stop crying!

752
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,800
- Put him down!
- Mother.

753
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,320
What are you talking about?

754
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,520
He’s my son.

755
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,479
He’s not!

756
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,760
I know him. Put him down.

757
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,560
(Zuixian Teahouse)
Why can you say he’s not my son?

758
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,959
I warn you not to interfere with me!

759
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:57,320
Go away!

760
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,000
Or you’ll be sorry!

761
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,959
Someone is abducting a boy!

762
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,399
- Somebody come!
- Abducting a boy?

763
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,679
What are you doing?

764
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:14,719
Stop running! Stop! After him.

765
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,000
Are you all right, son?

766
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,320
Why did you run away?

767
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:19,080
Why didn’t you stay with me?

768
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,560
Miss, where are you? Miss.

769
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,399
Stop!

770
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,040
Stop running! Stop!

771
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:26,199
Stop!

772
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:27,360
Miss.

773
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,879
- Miss.
- Keep an eye on him.

774
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:29,399
Miss.

775
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,239
Thank you, Miss.

776
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,520
Why did you come here alone?

777
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,040
I was looking for you.

778
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,199
- Mother.
- I was so worried.

779
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,280
Keep an eye on him.

780
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,959
I will. I will.

781
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:36,879
Thank you, Miss.

782
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:38,679
Don’t worry. I’m alive.

783
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:39,919
- I won’t get lost.
- I was so worried.

784
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,399
Your Grace,

785
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:43,639
what happened to your hand?

786
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,080
The man you just saw...

787
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:47,000
He was abducting the boy.

788
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,399
The man who bumped into me

789
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:50,919
was the terrible trafficker?

790
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,320
Don’t let Li Qian know it.

791
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,520
Your Highness, would you like
to have lunch?

792
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,040
Don’t bother.

793
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,120
I don’t have an appetite.

794
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:19,120
It’s time for lunch already.

795
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,000
To celebrate your birthday,

796
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,560
cooks have made many cuisines.

797
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,399
Have some.

798
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,840
I’m just one year older.

799
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,360
What’s the point of celebrating it?

800
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,120
Your Highness, don’t think like that.

801
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,239
You’re just not accustomed

802
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,760
to having no birthday banquet this year.

803
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,199
How about taking a walk?

804
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,719
Good idea.

805
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,399
Let’s go.

806
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,239
Yi.

807
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:20,760
You’ve kept me waiting.

808
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:23,360
I nearly asked someone to summon you.

809
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:32,360
Be seated.

810
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,280
Get the dishes to us.

811
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:42,520
Bring the dishes.

812
00:43:57,879 --> 00:44:00,639
These are your favorite dishes.

813
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,719
Yi,

814
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:29,560
why are you so nice to me today?

815
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:31,600
Today is your birthday.

816
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:34,320
Hope everything goes well with you.

817
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,639
Thank you, Yi.

818
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:49,399
Enjoy the meal.

819
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:38,280
You’re a liar.

820
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:40,520
You always ignore me.

821
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,320
I want to ignore you, too.

822
00:45:46,399 --> 00:45:47,719
Why would I ignore you?

823
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,320
You canceled your birthday banquet

824
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:52,199
though you didn’t want to

825
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,760
and spent the money on disaster relief.

826
00:45:57,239 --> 00:45:58,479
I knew that.

827
00:46:06,479 --> 00:46:08,879
Then where were you recently?

828
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:11,360
Why didn’t you talk to me?

829
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,000
(Li’s Mansion)

830
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,000
Your Grace, the wound recovers well.

831
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,760
Luckily, it’s not serious.

832
00:46:40,919 --> 00:46:42,320
It’ll be all right in two days, I guess.

833
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,040
Or Li Qian would be worried.

834
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,439
What would I be worried about?

835
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,120
You’re back?

836
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:56,679
I couldn’t have come back today.

837
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,439
But in case you miss me too much,

838
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,600
I completed my work and rushed back.

839
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,520
You... you came back quite early.

840
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:03,800
What?

841
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,199
You don’t want me to come back?

842
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,159
No.

843
00:47:08,919 --> 00:47:11,199
What would I be worried about again?

844
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:15,159
You would...

845
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,959
You would be missing me a lot.

846
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,000
I indeed miss you.

847
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,479
Your Grace, Young Master,

848
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:27,320
Young Master rushed back quickly

849
00:47:27,439 --> 00:47:29,320
and I’ve made some tea for him.

850
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,639
It’s thoughtful of you, Qingke.

851
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:43,560
What?

852
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,560
Uncomfortable with your shoulder?

853
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:46,800
A little bit.

854
00:47:46,919 --> 00:47:48,080
Let me massage you.

855
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,639
I... I have little strength of the hand.

856
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:54,120
Qingke has a lot of strength.

857
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,040
I’ll have her massage you.

858
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,959
Here.

859
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,199
Qian,

860
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,360
try the red bean cake.

861
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,280
I just asked the cooks to make some.

862
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,560
All right.

863
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:13,399
There seems a problem
with the red bean cake.

864
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:15,239
It can’t be.

865
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,320
I tasted it.

866
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,800
I’ll ask the cooks to remake some.

867
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:20,919
Don’t.

868
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,040
Let me taste it.

869
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,760
Baoning, you...

870
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:26,560
No.

871
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,719
Let me check your hand.

872
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,919
Let me see.

873
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,959
I was just playing
with the little things

874
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:35,520
and then I cut my hand.

875
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,760
It’s okay. I’ll be all right soon.

876
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:38,199
Why didn’t you tell me?

877
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:40,199
I didn’t want you to worry about me.

878
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,800
That’s why you didn’t tell me?

879
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:43,479
But you’re making me more worried.

880
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,120
Fine.

881
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:47,080
I’ll tell you everything later.

882
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:47,919
Does it hurt?

883
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,159
Qian,

884
00:48:49,479 --> 00:48:51,439
I’ll leave you alone.

885
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,520
It looks like it was cut
by something sharp.

886
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,479
How were you hurt?

887
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,000
It hurts!

888
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:00,239
Go get some medicine for me.

889
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,040
Fine. Wait a minute.

890
00:49:05,919 --> 00:49:06,560
Young Master.

891
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,879
Your Grace, Your Grace,

892
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,439
guess what I saw on the street.

893
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:10,760
What?

894
00:49:10,879 --> 00:49:11,760
Qingke told me

895
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,080
a trafficker hurt you.

896
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,280
He was caught by the government.

897
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,959
That’s great.

898
00:49:17,879 --> 00:49:18,879
Trafficker?

899
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,399
So quickly?

900
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,479
Still keeping it from me?

901
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,320
You heard us?

902
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,959
So, a trafficker hurt you?

903
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
Where did you meet him?

904
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:41,760
It was a coincidence. Coincidence.

905
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,719
Baoning.

906
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,439
You’re bullying me.

907
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:47,399
I’m bullying you?

908
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,479
You kept it from me.

909
00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:49,199
Well,

910
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:51,800
why do you think I kept it from you?

911
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,239
I...

912
00:49:55,919 --> 00:49:57,360
I’ll tell you what happened that day.

913
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,520
Don’t be angry anymore.

914
00:49:58,639 --> 00:49:59,919
Fine. Tell me what happened

915
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:01,120
and see if I will be angry.

916
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:03,719
I went to the fair with Qingke that day.

917
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,919
Then I met a trafficker.

918
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,479
But at last, I defeated him.

919
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,399
Looks like you insisted on
being a heroine

920
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,159
no matter whether you had martial arts.

921
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,239
I’m a real good girl by helping others.

922
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:22,280
Looks like

923
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,760
I should teach you
some self-protection techniques.

924
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,560
Young Master has been doing this
every day.

925
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:42,879
After he wakes up, he comes
to the drill ground with his spear.

926
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:45,600
When everyone else is back to the dorm,

927
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,040
only he stays

928
00:50:47,439 --> 00:50:50,159
and doesn’t leave.

929
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,639
If things continue this way,

930
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,320
he can’t hold out any longer.

931
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,679
Your Highness!

932
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:23,080
Father.

933
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,879
You’ve spent quite a long time here.

934
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,879
Get packed

935
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:29,800
and go with me.

936
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:31,280
Go?

937
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,719
Where are we going?

938
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,000
To Nanmin, of course.

939
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,639
That’s the only place

940
00:51:37,879 --> 00:51:39,959
where you belong to.

941
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:41,199
No, I’m not going back there.

942
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,080
Look at you.

943
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:48,479
For a girl,

944
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,679
you’re torturing yourself like this!

945
00:51:51,919 --> 00:51:54,439
No wonder Jiang Baoning
picked Li Qian,

946
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,120
instead of you.

947
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,040
In case of any problem,

948
00:51:58,439 --> 00:51:59,919
all you can do is to abandon yourself

949
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,639
and give up all confidence.

950
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Son!

951
00:52:19,439 --> 00:52:21,360
When will you

952
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:24,399
truly grow up?

953
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:38,280
Son,

954
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,760
you will live a life

955
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,040
with frustrations and setbacks.

956
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:51,239
Without my protection,

957
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,679
you have to go through them alone.

958
00:52:56,879 --> 00:52:58,159
I’m getting old.

959
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:03,760
I can’t protect you for a long time.

960
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:08,040
If you keep behaving willfully,

961
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:10,919
after I die,

962
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,040
how can I

963
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,959
explain to our ancestors?

964
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,239
Your Highness.

965
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:41,840
Father,

966
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,080
I’ll prove to you

967
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,719
that one day

968
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,000
I will defeat Li Qian.
