will be arrested!

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,119
Qian.

31
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,559
You must be freaked out.

32
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,479
Let’s get back.

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,160
Don’t move.

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
It’ll be done. It will.

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,160
It’s done. It’s done.

36
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,720
Don’t get your wound wet.

37
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,119
Don’t scratch the scab.

38
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,240
It’s just a flesh wound.

39
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,360
It’ll recover soon.

40
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,320
Aren’t you supposed to be on duty?

41
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,839
Why did you come back?

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Dongdong wrote to me.

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,199
In case of any emergency,

44
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,440
I rushed back.

45
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,039
I didn’t know anything

46
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,520
about moldy rice or cotton.

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,639
Sorry to have caused trouble to you.

48
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,960
Don’t say that.

49
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,559
Others don’t know you,

50
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,800
but I do.

51
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,679
You helped the refugees wholeheartedly.

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,960
Instead of being grateful,

53
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,679
after the incident,

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,520
they blamed you indiscriminately.

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,119
Their disturbance looks simple,

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,000
but I think someone instigated them.

57
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,600
Baoning,

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,360
stay at home for recovery these days

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,240
and don’t go out.

60
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,520
I’ll find out the truth.

61
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,639
That’s true. I’m not kidding.

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,919
Now that it’s such a fun place,

63
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,119
when will you take me there?

64
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,919
Whenever you want it,

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,839
I’ll take you there.

66
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,800
How about tonight?

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,800
Anytime you want.

68
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,639
All right.

69
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,440
This...

70
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,080
I’ll leave you alone for some emergency.

71
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,359
Young Master.

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,720
How is it going?

73
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,920
Don’t worry.

74
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,480
I promise the military pay...

75
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,440
Who’s there?

76
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,959
Are you sure Cai Shuang mentioned
the military pay?

77
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,119
I’m not very sure.

78
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,880
I thought Cai Shuang

79
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,040
looked a bit weird.

80
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,040
I followed him up, then.

81
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,079
They were talking inside the room

82
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,799
while I didn’t hear them clearly.

83
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,119
Zhao Xiao is the Quartermaster.

84
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,559
Cai Shuang is under his control.

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,000
When they talked about the military pay,

86
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,359
it didn’t sound inappropriate.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,839
Wrong.

88
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,040
Zhao Xiao is

89
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,359
proud and arrogant.

90
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,720
Why does he have close contact
with someone like Cai Shuang?

91
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,119
Besides, Cai Shuang looked furtive.

92
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,160
He must’ve been keeping something

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,239
from others.

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,279
Also,

95
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,079
Zhao Xiao’s room

96
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,559
wasn’t guarded.

97
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,799
I may be oversensitive,

98
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
but I indeed think

99
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,959
they two are keeping a dark secret.

100
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,679
The military pay
hasn’t been received yet.

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,359
If it continues, soldiers will certainly
be disillusioned.

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,959
Zhao Xiao is keeping an eye

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,359
on the soldiers of Xuanjia Battalion.

104
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,119
Once they take any action,

105
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,239
they’ll alert him.

106
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,720
Jin Xiao.

107
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,040
I get it.

108
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,799
You want to get to the bottom
of Cai Shuang, right?

109
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,079
I’ve had a lot of spare time lately.

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
Count on me.

111
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,440
Cai Shuang is spending

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,679
(Fengtai Draper)
so much money on clothes?

113
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,000
(Fengtai Draper)

114
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,359
Go.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,519
Spy on him.

116
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,920
If anything happens,
tell me without delay.

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,559
Yes.

118
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,959
Shanhu, you’ve come at last.

119
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,279
Have you heard about that?

120
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,799
The charity house is in trouble.

121
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,320
It was inconsiderate of me.

122
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,440
I promised to run it with you.

123
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,200
But for my family business,

124
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,720
I had to collect the debt
in the neighboring county.

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,399
I didn’t return until last night.

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,640
I hear you were even wounded.

127
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,959
Where were you hurt?

128
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,079
Is it serious?

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,920
I’m all right.

130
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,720
It’s just a flesh wound. No big deal.

131
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,519
Those refugees are quite annoying.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,519
We helped them with goodwill.

133
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,399
Instead of being grateful,

134
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,040
they blamed us.

135
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,079
The dead child was
less than six years old.

136
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:26,000
The mother suddenly lost her child.

137
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,720
I could understand her feelings.

138
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,239
Since the charity house was built,

139
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,799
it’s been doing well.

140
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,720
Why was there moldy rice

141
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,559
and cotton with sand?

142
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,440
I was so thoughtless

143
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,040
that I neglected the rear service.

144
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,040
Some supplies were bought

145
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,640
while some were donated.

146
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,720
Now that they would be used together,

147
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,679
they were mixed without being separated.

148
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,519
I asked Dongdong
to check the account book,

149
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,440
but she didn’t get an expecting result.

150
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,480
There’re too many donators on the list.

151
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,679
We can’t be sure

152
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,440
whether the cotton with sand
and moldy rice

153
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,880
were from the same donator.

154
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,679
Shanhu,

155
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,679
you know I’m in trouble

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
and I’d better not go out.

157
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,239
So, I want to ask you

158
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,920
to take care of the charity house.

159
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,399
Don’t worry. Count on me.

160
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,200
By the way,

161
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,480
pay attention to something else.

162
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,399
When I rectified the family situation

163
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,279
and caught Nanny Tian stealing,

164
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,399
she confided to me

165
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,519
that some merchants
and officials in Jinxi

166
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,799
did usury in money houses secretly.

167
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,480
You’ve been doing business for years.

168
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,079
Could you start from this

169
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:32,559
and find out the power behind the case?

170
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,679
Your Grace,

171
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,159
you think such cases are related?

172
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,000
Honestly speaking,

173
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,119
I’ve heard about such evildoing.

174
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,320
These money houses break the rules

175
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,559
and harm the interests
of many law-abiding merchants.

176
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,400
I’ve got on with some evidence,

177
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,440
but I don’t dare to alert them.

178
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,559
Go investigate it without concern.

179
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:54,880
I’ll support you.

180
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,239
Yes.

181
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,440
You’re taking my words
like a passing wind.

182
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,559
Father, this is a famine year.

183
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,239
It’s quite an achievement

184
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,280
to have such a fruit.

185
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,559
I shouldn’t waste it, should I?

186
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,919
Father, Father!

187
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,039
Father!

188
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,119
Father, calm down.

189
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,039
Calm down.

190
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,640
I’ve considered what you said.

191
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,520
But I think I’m too young

192
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,119
to get married
or have children hurriedly.

193
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:50,840
How about this?

194
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,760
If you think Miss Chen

195
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,200
has a good family background
and appearance,

196
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,799
marry her

197
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,119
and make her your eighth concubine.

198
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:57,919
What do you think?

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,280
Naughty son, come back!

200
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:01,799
Come back!

201
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,119
Father, I won’t fight with you
for a girl.

202
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,200
Just go enjoy her.

203
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,679
Watch where you’re walking!

204
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
Junior General Jin, it’s me.

205
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,559
I’ve got information

206
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,479
for what you asked me to check.

207
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,479
What did Cai Shuang do?

208
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,159
Cai Shuang didn’t do anything.

209
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,559
But during the investigation,
I found that

210
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:29,679
someone set an illegal money house
in Jinxi.

211
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,119
Many merchants invested for benefits.

212
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,080
It’s said that

213
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,559
the real owner
of the illegal money house

214
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,919
is a powerful woman.

215
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,200
The draper is indeed suspicious.

216
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,280
Take your men and go with me.

217
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

218
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,760
Stop!

219
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:52,400
Arrest her.

220
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,479
Yes.

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,159
Why?

222
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,880
Don’t play the fool.

223
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,440
You don’t know why I arrest you?

224
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,359
You set an illegal money house
and harm the civilians.

225
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,320
Now you’re trying to destroy the proof.

226
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,119
This isn’t my account book.

227
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,559
The one who burned the account book

228
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,760
just sneaked out through the back door.

229
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
It’s not too late
if you go after her now.

230
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,520
You want to lure us away
and then escape?

231
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,239
You’re caught in the act.

232
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,119
No more excuses.

233
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,719
Take her away.

234
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,200
Yes.

235
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,760
You!

236
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,719
Junior General Jin, she’s quite stubborn

237
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,919
and doesn’t confess anything.

238
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,840
Junior General Jin, right?

239
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,640
Now that you treat me like a criminal

240
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,039
without finding out the truth,

241
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,479
you’ll certainly take the job

242
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,359
to interrogate me.

243
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,479
Come and talk to me.

244
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,320
You’re a prisoner,

245
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,520
but you still sound so arrogant.

246
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,719
I’m a prisoner?

247
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,679
What evidence do you have?

248
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,239
I’m the witness.

249
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,919
The burned account book is the proof.

250
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,119
Under such circumstances,

251
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,599
what else can you argue?

252
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,559
Before knowing what really happened,

253
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,760
you brought me here as a prisoner.

254
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,039
Which law did I break?

255
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,559
Which rule did I disobey?

256
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,080
Dong Shanhu.

257
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,000
The eldest daughter of the Dong Family.

258
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,440
You’ve been traveling with your father
since you were 12.

259
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,599
At a young age, you’re doing a great job

260
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,159
in the business circle.

261
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,880
You’ve contributed a lot
to the wealth and status

262
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:42,440
of Dong’s Trading House.

263
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,840
Get to the point.

264
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,000
The point is

265
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,479
I was told that

266
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,919
someone set an illegal money house
in Bingzhou

267
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,320
and acquired many properties.

268
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,919
It’s an experienced businesswoman

269
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,359
behind the money house.

270
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,159
Throughout Jinxi,

271
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,239
what other businesswoman

272
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,520
can be as good as you?

273
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,840
I’ll just take this

274
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,400
as your compliment.

275
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,679
However,

276
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,479
I must make something clear.

277
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:12,359
Since I did business,

278
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,679
I’ve never handled
any illegal money house.

279
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,359
You’ve caught the wrong person.

280
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,159
This is exactly the truth,

281
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:26,280
but you still want to argue?

282
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,880
How silly you are!

283
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,159
What you saw

284
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,000
may not be the truth.

285
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,799
I’ve told you many times.

286
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,479
I was in that draper,

287
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:41,520
because I had the desire for beauty

288
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,159
just like all the other girls.

289
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,239
When I saw a new store
at the street corner,

290
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,119
I went in for some shopping,

291
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,239
in hope of buying some suitable fabrics.

292
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:53,080
You claim you were a customer.

293
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Where was the shopkeeper, then?

294
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,719
In such a big store,

295
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,840
I didn’t see the shopkeeper!

296
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,000
She ran away!

297
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,719
Before that, she even burned
the account book!

298
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:03,559
Dong Shanhu,

299
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,280
do you think I’m a fool?

300
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,080
If you’re not,

301
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,359
let me go immediately!

302
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,239
Instead of wasting time arguing with me,

303
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,239
why don’t you go with your men

304
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,520
to catch the real criminal?

305
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,000
How... How dare you!

306
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,359
Getting shy?

307
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,119
You! You...

308
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,679
Now that she doesn’t cooperate,

309
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,320
let her experience

310
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,679
the rules of our prison!

311
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,799
Yes.

312
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:46,039
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
asked us to release her?

313
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:46,719
Yes.

314
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,520
(Shanhu House)

315
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:05,039
You indeed misunderstood Shanhu.

316
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,080
After the moldy rice case,

317
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,479
I promised refugees in the charity house

318
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,679
that I would find out the truth.

319
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,359
But it’s not convenient for me
to go out lately.

320
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,280
Then I asked Shanhu to help me.

321
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,960
I didn’t expect you

322
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,239
to have such a misunderstanding.

323
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,239
Did you hear her?

324
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,679
Misunderstanding.

325
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,000
I didn’t expect such a coincidence.

326
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,719
You went to that draper

327
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
exactly when I arrived with my men.

328
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,280
I would certainly misunderstand you.

329
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:29,320
Who else could I catch but you?

330
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,440
You caught the wrong person by mistake.

331
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,880
Instead of apologizing,

332
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,239
you’re even complaining about me?

333
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,479
What do you want, then?

334
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,960
All right, Jin Xiao.

335
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,760
It was inconsiderate of you.

336
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,840
You owe an apology to Miss Dong.

337
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:45,919
Apologize to her and it doesn’t matter.

338
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:46,960
A real man

339
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,640
knows when to yield.

340
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,239
Quickly. Stop dawdling.

341
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,159
Well, in this case,

342
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,760
I was indeed thoughtless.

343
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,320
I’m sorry.

344
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,400
Now that the misunderstanding is gone,

345
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,679
let’s drink.

346
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah. Let’s drink.

347
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,039
Your Grace, Young Master,
thank you for saving me.

348
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,239
Otherwise,

349
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:24,039
I would really be kept as a criminal.

350
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,320
Are you done complaining?

351
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,440
Didn’t I just apologize to you?

352
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,200
What else do you want?

353
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,719
You made such an insincere apology.

354
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,119
I don’t accept that.

355
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,159
How can I be sincere, then?

356
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,280
Will you not find me sincere

357
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,919
until I kneel

358
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,200
and get some tea for you?

359
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,760
We know you’re quarreling.

360
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,479
But unknowing people

361
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,280
would think you’re flirting
with each other.

362
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:45,919
- With her?
- With him?

363
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,280
-Flirting?
-Flirting?

364
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,719
- They make a perfect match.
- A perfect match.

365
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,239
Could you stop imitating me?

366
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,520
You imitated me, didn’t you?

367
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,359
What are you talking about?

368
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,080
Stop. Friendship grows from conflicts.

369
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:03,960
Shanhu,

370
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,479
this is Jin Xiao,

371
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,439
the eldest lineal son
of General Jin Haitao.

372
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,160
No matter what happened before,

373
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,640
we take the same stand, anyway.

374
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,680
We want to find out the real criminal.

375
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,839
In this way,

376
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,839
why don’t we cooperate?

377
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,560
Right.

378
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,680
Jin Xiao,

379
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,880
you said

380
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,119
someone set an illegal money house
in Bingzhou.

381
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:21,920
Is that true?

382
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,959
So far, I’ve only got
some superficial information.

383
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,359
All I know is that a woman
is behind the money house.

384
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,239
Your Grace, when you lived
in the capital city,

385
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,680
did you know a store

386
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,319
named Fengtai Draper?

387
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,199
I didn’t.

388
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,359
That shopkeeper is indeed suspicious.

389
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,319
I was just passing by that day.

390
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,160
(Fengtai Draper)
I saw the new store

391
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,280
and wanted to browse around.

392
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,000
After I went in,

393
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:51,040
I saw a female shopkeeper
calculating something.

394
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,800
Miss, browse around.

395
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,000
Our store is newly open.

396
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,719
If you settle on something,

397
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,560
I’ll give you 40% off.

398
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,800
So, it’s a new store.

399
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,119
No wonder I’ve never seen it before.

400
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,199
Our store is newly open.

401
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,719
But we’ve got the experience
of weaving and embroidering

402
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,400
for more than ten years.

403
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,439
We’ve done such a good business

404
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,839
that we have opened many branches
in different towns.

405
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,359
Miss, you’re visiting

406
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,239
our sixth branch.

407
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,239
So many branches?

408
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,280
Where’s your head office, then?

409
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,079
In the capital city, of course.

410
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,000
Even noble women in the Palace

411
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,640
praise our silk fabrics.

412
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,599
The embroidery

413
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,000
looks quite informal.

414
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,640
For official embroidery,
very thin silk threads and needles

415
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,800
that are as thin as hair are used.

416
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,479
The trace of needlework

417
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
also would be perfectly concealed.

418
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,119
But look at this.

419
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,959
It’s so roughly embroidered.

420
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,160
Miss, don’t mind
if it’s real official embroidery.

421
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,160
Don’t you buy silk

422
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,560
for the pattern and fabric?

423
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:15,880
You’re wrong.

424
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,760
Pattern and fabric are small factors.

425
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,599
Embroidery and needling matter most.

426
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,880
If you don’t want to buy anything,

427
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,199
please leave.

428
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,880
Don’t disturb my business.

429
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,800
Madam, it’s not the way to do business.

430
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
I just complained a little,

431
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,000
and you got so excited.

432
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,319
Can this be

433
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,599
an illegal store

434
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,160
where we can’t touch or ask anything?

435
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,560
Leave if you don’t do any shopping.

436
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,359
Stop!

437
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,800
Stop!

438
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,400
This is what happened.

439
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,520
By the way,

440
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,479
this is the account book

441
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:36,479
the shopkeeper left when she ran away.

442
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,359
When I arrived,

443
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,760
it had been mostly burned.

444
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,640
After you asked her a few questions,

445
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,199
she was so scared
that she burned the account book.

446
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,520
There must be something fishy with it.

447
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,119
It’s my fault.

448
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,800
If I had arrived earlier,

449
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,760
it wouldn’t have happened.

450
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,920
The account book is ruined

451
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,359
and the shopkeeper is gone.

452
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,640
I’m afraid we have to start
all over again.

453
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,920
I don’t think so.

454
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,680
Look at this.

455
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,680
15 bolts of brocades purchased
on the tenth day of March.

456
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,359
30,000 taels of silver.

457
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,000
According to the market price,

458
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,560
15 bolts of brocades cost
200 taels at most.

459
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,199
But the shopkeeper spent 30,000 taels

460
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,880
on such cheap things.

461
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,160
What does that mean?

462
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,239
It means she made
false accounting records.

463
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,319
No wonder she burned
the account book hurriedly.

464
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,520
She was destroying the evidence.

465
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,839
It’s been mostly burned,

466
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,719
but we can still find out

467
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,400
some fishy problems left.

468
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,479
Then, we can track them down

469
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,719
to the source of the supplies.

470
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,040
You make sense.

471
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,119
Jin Xiao, go arrest some managers

472
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,839
and interrogate them separately.

473
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:44,880
Then ask them to identify each other.

474
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,680
When some of them get too scared,

475
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,199
they’ll tell the truth.

476
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,839
Good idea. When we make use
of their suspicion

477
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,959
and find out the evidence,

478
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,640
we can track down to the real criminal.

479
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,920
Anything usual
in Xuanjia Battalion lately?

480
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,199
For your information,

481
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,880
since they were punished

482
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,199
for helping Supervisor Li
to suppress refugees in his mansion,

483
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,640
they’ve been behaving themselves

484
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,520
and haven’t made trouble.

485
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,359
That’s good.

486
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,920
But Junior General Jin

487
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,719
often goes out with some soldiers.

488
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,959
I don’t know what he’s doing.

489
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,239
Jin Xiao?

490
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,560
He’s very close to Li Qian.

491
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,160
Spy on Jin Xiao secretly

492
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,199
and find out what they’re up to.

493
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:26,160
Yes.

494
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,439
Look what a situation we’re in.

495
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,880
Why are you still in the mood
of drinking tea?

496
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,400
I had planned to stop earlier.

497
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,880
If you hadn’t persuaded me to continue,

498
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,920
things wouldn’t have been so terrible.

499
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,000
Gao Miaorong,

500
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
you must understand

501
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:04,319
that we’re a package deal now.

502
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,439
If I’m in trouble,

503
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,520
you won’t keep out of it.

504
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,160
Madam,

505
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,839
you should be calm.

506
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,920
So far,

507
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:17,400
nothing has happened, has it?

508
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,000
Something happened to Lu Wan.

509
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,280
Fengtai Draper has been closed down.

510
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,719
Why are you still calm?

511
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,119
For safety concerns,

512
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,119
we’ve never had

513
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,959
any direct contact with Lu Wan.

514
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,079
She knows little about us.

515
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,280
Even when she’s caught,
she can’t sell us out.

516
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,479
You make sense,

517
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,599
but we can’t let down our guard.

518
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:46,760
The Money House has been
in Bingzhou for so many years.

519
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,319
Everything has been all right

520
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,359
and nothing has ever gone wrong.

521
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,680
Why did the government suddenly tail it?

522
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,079
When they keep investigating,

523
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,439
they may possibly track down to us.

524
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,439
Our deal was suddenly destroyed.

525
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,000
We should

526
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,640
be quite grateful
to Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

527
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,599
Don’t underestimate her.

528
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:15,040
She’s young,

529
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:17,359
but she’s rather scheming.

530
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,839
During the coup in the capital city,

531
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,880
she played a decisive role.

532
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:23,640
Now,

533
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,000
she hasn’t suspected us yet.

534
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,599
But once the case gets serious,

535
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,520
they’ll find out the person behind it.

536
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,439
By then, you and I

537
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,400
will really be hopeless.

538
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,439
What do we do, then?

539
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,839
For this problem,

540
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:45,359
there is a solution.

541
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,959
It depends on whether you cooperate.

542
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,319
What solution?

543
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,359
I hear

544
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,760
your husband’s brother,

545
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,599
Zhuang Li,

546
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,760
is one of the best students
of Chief Councilor Wang Jidao.

547
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,319
Wang Jidao has the ear

548
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,719
of His Majesty.

549
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,479
In case of anything worse,

550
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:11,839
madam,

551
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,040
write a letter
to Lord Zhuang immediately

552
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,640
and ask him

553
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:22,479
to impeach Commandery Princess Jia’nan
with the Chief Councilor

554
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,359
before we’re exposed.

555
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,760
You’re impeaching Baoning?

556
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,400
Your Majesty, we know

557
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,359
you always defend Her Grace.

558
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,920
However, in Bingzhou,

559
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
she took advantage of her identity

560
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:00,800
to have set a charity house privately
and taken bribes.

561
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,560
She even bought a lot of moldy rice
at a low price

562
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,959
for refugees.

563
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:08,959
She disgraced the imperial family
and that’s unforgivable.

564
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,520
Your Majesty,
please investigate the case seriously

565
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,479
to keep our state incorrupt.

566
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
The Grand Empress Dowager has arrived.

567
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:16,959
Your Majesty.

568
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:17,880
What brings you here, Grandmother?

569
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,160
I hear

570
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,359
someone’s impeaching
Commandery Princess Jia’nan

571
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:26,359
and trying to put her to death!

572
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,800
Don’t trust such rumors, Grandmother.

573
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
Baoning is my favorite cousin.

574
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,199
If someone wants to put her to death,

575
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,000
he has to ask me if I allow him.

576
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:39,280
Zhuang Li,

577
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,959
what punishment do you think you deserve
when you slander someone else?

578
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,079
Your Highness,

579
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,319
I don’t dare to talk nonsense.

580
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,800
Everything in the report

581
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
is true.

582
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,719
True?

583
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,680
- Exactly.
- Did you see it with your eyes

584
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,160
or did you hear it with your ears?

585
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,160
She’s in Bingzhou of Jinxi.

586
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,920
You’re in the capital city.

587
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,400
The two places are
thousands of miles away!

588
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,079
But you want to convict Baoning
with your one-sided statement?

589
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,280
I think you don’t have
the measure of yourself

590
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,160
simply because you are
Wang Jidao’s favorite student.

591
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,680
Wang Jidao.

592
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:24,520
Here.

593
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,400
When Qing Tai

594
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,560
asked to marry Baoning
in the name of making peace,

595
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:32,800
he actually wanted to invade our state!

596
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:36,160
You didn’t offer any advice
to His Majesty at that time.

597
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,000
But now, you believe rumors,

598
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,800
list the charges

599
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,359
and try to put Baoning to death.

600
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,280
What exactly do you want?

601
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,800
I don’t mean that, Your Highness.

602
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:54,119
I think you just mean that!

603
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,400
The Empress has arrived.

604
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

605
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,599
Greetings, Your Highness.

606
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,839
Tongxin,

607
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,520
why did you come without being summoned?

608
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:08,800
Grandmother,

609
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,319
Jiang Baoning takes advantage
of her identity

610
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,359
and abuses her power in Bingzhou.

611
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,959
Now, people there hate her

612
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,239
and everyone knows what she has done.

613
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,680
Instead of considering

614
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,479
for our people,

615
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:21,880
you show partiality for Jiang Baoning

616
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,680
who has made a big mistake.

617
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,280
Which matters more, our people

618
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:29,199
or Commandery Princess Jia’nan?

619
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:30,280
Evidence.

620
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,680
Evidence matters more to me!

621
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:37,439
You can’t frame Baoning up
without evidence!

622
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,880
I’m the Empress of Mu’an

623
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,199
and the first lady.

624
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:44,640
I’m qualified to judge her.

625
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,400
Tongxin,

626
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,599
you’re not wanted here.

627
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,959
Leave us.

628
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,640
Your Majesty, why are you
still defending her?

629
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,319
Jiang Baoning has married another man.

630
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,839
Your dear grandmother

631
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,800
married her to him.

632
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,839
Han Tongxin!

633
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,079
How daring!

634
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,839
How dare you be rude to Grandmother!

635
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,040
You both show partiality
for Jiang Baoning.

636
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Grandmother,

637
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,760
you’re old

638
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,800
and always ill.

639
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,000
You’d better not interfere
with political affairs.

640
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:44,199
Just enjoy your own life.

641
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:46,760
You! You!

642
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,800
Your Highness!

643
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,160
Grandmother. Grandmother.

644
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,719
Grandmother.

645
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,680
Du Sheng, go get the chief physician.

646
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,319
Yes.

647
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,040
Your Highness.

648
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,479
It’s because of Jiang Baoning again!

649
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,959
She always haunts!

650
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
It’s all her fault!

651
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,680
All her fault.

652
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,959
If it weren’t for her,

653
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,439
I wouldn’t have been rude
to the Grand Empress Dowager.

654
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,920
I’m afraid I totally annoyed Yi.

655
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,160
His Majesty and you
haven’t spoken to each other

656
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,800
for quite a long while.

657
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,119
What happened today made it worse.

658
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,319
Your Highness,
why don’t you yield first?

659
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,520
Why are you here?

660
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,880
Grandmother,

661
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:53,359
I came to apologize to you.

662
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,599
Today, I trusted the rumors,

663
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,160
talked irresponsibly,

664
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,040
and offended you.

665
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:01,439
Please forgive me, Grandmother.

666
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,680
I...

667
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,920
I won’t hate my granddaughter-in-law.

668
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,920
His Majesty sent you, didn’t he?

669
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,760
If you want him to trust and love you,

670
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,479
you need to be a competent empress.

671
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,480
(Li’s Mansion)

672
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,160
What, Your Grace?

673
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,719
Stewardess Meng said,

674
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,479
Grandmother was so annoyed
by Han Tongxin

675
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,719
that she remained ill in bed.

676
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,719
Why would this happen?

677
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
When we visited Her Highness
a couple of months ago,

678
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,280
she was all right, wasn’t she?

679
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,319
Zhuang Li wrote

680
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,839
a memorial to the throne to impeach me

681
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:07,119
and reported it to His Majesty.

682
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,079
He blamed all incidents in Bingzhou

683
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,400
on me.

684
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,839
He even accused me

685
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,479
of taking bribes and harming refugees.

686
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,400
In a fit of anger,

687
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,199
Grandmother defended me
in front of His Majesty.

688
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,640
Then Han Tongxin

689
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,839
censured her for shielding me.

690
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,640
Grandmother fell sick.

691
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,520
Zhuang Li?

692
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,280
Is he the brother
of Mrs. Zhuang’s husband?

693
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:30,160
Exactly.

694
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,280
But as far as I know,

695
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:35,680
Lord Zhuang and you
had no problems before.

696
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,680
Without a reason,

697
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,319
why did he accuse you
in front of His Majesty?

698
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,199
I know.

699
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,199
Is Mrs. Zhuang involved?

700
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,359
At Senior Mrs. Dong’s birthday banquet,

701
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,479
you defended Miss Li,

702
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,680
and then Mrs. Zhuang and her daughter
made a fool of themselves in public.

703
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,359
Mrs. Zhuang hated you,

704
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,079
and then she made an issue of it

705
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:58,359
when the charity house was in trouble

706
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,079
so that she could take revenge.

707
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,560
For such little problems,

708
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Mrs. Zhuang doesn’t need
to make such a big issue.

709
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:09,520
She’s eager to put me to death.

710
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,959
There must be something else

711
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,959
that makes her desperate

712
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:14,959
and makes her want to get rid of me.

713
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,919
Baoning,

714
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,879
I hear the Grand Empress Dowager is ill.

715
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,959
Grandmother remains in poor health.

716
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,000
Han Tongxin always talks irresponsibly.

717
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:28,479
Now that Grandmother is sick,

718
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:30,199
I don’t know when she can recover.

719
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,040
But I don’t want to get back hurriedly,

720
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,199
or she will worry about me.

721
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,000
Besides, I’m in trouble.

722
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,239
I shouldn’t bring trouble back
to the capital city.

723
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,399
So, you’ve written the letter
to tell her you’re all right

724
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,959
so that she won’t worry about you?

725
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,280
Wei Shu.

726
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,959
Yes, Young Master?

727
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,679
Have it sent to the capital city
at top speed.

728
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,399
Do it quickly.

729
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,399
Yes.

730
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,239
Baoning,

731
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,000
among the shop managers
we arrested secretly,

732
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,800
one named Sun Laosan

733
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,080
couldn’t stand the interrogation

734
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,280
and confessed something.

735
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,479
The shopkeeper of Fengtai Draper

736
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,520
is Lu Wan.

737
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
She used to run some stores.

738
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,800
Some sell antiques and paintings.

739
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,159
Some sell jewels.

740
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,000
But there’s something in common.

741
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,280
The stores are very small.

742
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,800
There aren’t enough goods in the stores,

743
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:21,760
and they’re often closed.

744
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:23,600
Later, Sun Laosan

745
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:26,199
got in contact with Lu Wan
through his friend

746
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:29,439
and then he knew Lu Wan’s real business

747
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,600
was to set an illegal money house

748
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,399
and do usury and cast illegal coins

749
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,919
for money laundering

750
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,320
through different stores.

751
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
But Lu Wan

752
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:41,399
is overcautious

753
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,040
and very defensive.

754
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,280
Without the introduction
of close friends,

755
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,959
she seldom meets anyone.

756
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,879
That explains.

757
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,719
Dong Shanhu does business
throughout Bingzhou,

758
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,919
but she knows nothing about Lu Wan.

759
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:58,479
Did Sun Laosan confess

760
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,159
where Lu Wan was staying?

761
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,560
Fortune Inn in the west of the town.

762
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,239
I’m about to arrest her.

763
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,919
Lu Wan has no power,

764
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,639
but runs an illegal money house
in Jinxi.

765
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,360
Do you believe

766
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,120
she has no supporters?

767
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:19,360
It’s easy to check it out.

768
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,439
When we catch Lu Wan,

769
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,280
we can force her
to confess her supporters.

770
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:24,120
No way.

771
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,120
You’ll alert them.

772
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:28,560
The secret manipulator

773
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,639
manages to run the illegal money house

774
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,120
without anybody knowing it.

775
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,560
It means he’s clear-headed and cautious.

776
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,320
If you go arrest her rashly,

777
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,800
you’ll alert him and get nothing useful.

778
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:40,199
But time is pressing.

779
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,199
After Zhuang Li impeached you,

780
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,520
many people are keeping an eye on you.

781
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,959
I don’t want you to be defamed.

782
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,840
I must solve the problem immediately.

783
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,520
Then I’ll use myself as bait

784
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,840
and lure this man out.

785
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,800
You can’t!

786
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,199
I know you respect me, love me,

787
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,360
and want to protect me.

788
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,280
But,

789
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,959
I also want to protect my family
and those I love.

790
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,120
Trust me. I know what I’m doing.

791
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:09,760
Fine.

792
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,679
I’ll go with you, then.

793
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,639
Here. Be seated, madam.

794
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:47,919
What are you waiting for?

795
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,040
Come over!

796
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,360
Madam, will you have a snack
or a check-in?

797
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:58,399
Do you have any tea?

798
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,399
What kind of tea do you want?

799
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,000
Silver Needle Tea.

800
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,280
My lady is asking you.

801
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,120
Do you have Silver Needle Tea?

802
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,600
Yes,

803
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:11,639
but...

804
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,439
I’d like a pot of that, then.

805
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,239
Make it with rootless water

806
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:16,520
in the clay teapot.

807
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:18,959
Ask your shopkeeper to make it.

808
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:22,719
Madam, this is not an easy request.

809
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,719
A pot of tea costs at least

810
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,840
880 taels.

811
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,120
Xiaoman, give him a thousand taels.

812
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,760
Yes.

813
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,040
Here’s a thousand.

814
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,439
If the tea tastes good,

815
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,760
I’ll give you another thousand.

816
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,840
Looks like you came here

817
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:41,199
for something else.

818
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:43,600
Wait, please.
I’ll go tell the shopkeeper.

819
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,080
You’re Commandery Princess Jia’nan?

820
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,239
You know me, Ms. Lu?

821
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:00,280
You enjoy a widespread reputation.

822
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Everyone in Jinxi knows you.

823
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,239
I just wonder

824
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,959
what has brought you

825
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,879
to my place.

826
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,560
Someone introduced you to me

827
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,320
and I want to make a deal with you.

828
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:19,199
You flatter me.

829
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,840
You’re the Commandery Princess

830
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:22,800
of noble birth.

831
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:23,919
Civilians like me

832
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
aren’t qualified
to make a deal with you.

833
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,399
Your Silver Needle Tea costs
880 taels for a pot.

834
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,399
Other stores won’t charge so much.

835
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,479
I paid exactly the amount.

836
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,399
But now you’re turning me down?

837
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,439
If people hear about it,

838
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,879
how disgraced I’ll be!

839
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,879
We both want money, don’t we?

840
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,600
Take a seat and let’s negotiate.

841
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,879
Ms. Lu,

842
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,000
Her Grace found your inn

843
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,360
and said your code words right.

844
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,199
You shouldn’t suspect our sincerity.

845
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,320
Ms. Lu,

846
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:23,120
if you really want to cooperate with us,

847
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,800
show us your sincerity, too.

848
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,040
What do you want, Your Grace?

849
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,520
I want to make a deal
with your supervisor.

850
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:06,639
Accountant Cai.

851
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,439
Look.

852
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,719
I’ve brought a big client to you.

853
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,520
It’s really you.

854
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:14,600
What...?

855
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,080
What’s going on?

856
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:20,040
How dare you betray me!

857
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,239
Surrender yourself!

858
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,439
Want to arrest me?

859
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:29,719
It’s not that easy.

860
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,760
Make way. Make way.

861
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,719
Stop running!

862
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,919
What’s wrong with you?

863
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,959
- Watch out!
- Be careful.

864
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,600
Zhao Xiao, get out of the way!

865
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:12,360
Li Qian,

866
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,800
Cai Shuang is under my jurisdiction.

867
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,760
Mind your own business.

868
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,320
Why are you two fighting?

869
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,120
Catch him!

870
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,000
Your Grace, I was looking for you.

871
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,600
You...

872
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,479
Go get helpers.

873
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,080
All right.

874
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,399
Cai Shuang!

875
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,159
Run. Keep running.

876
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,560
Now that you keep running after me,

877
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,199
why not elope with me today

878
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,840
and go traveling around the world?

879
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,560
Your Grace!

880
00:44:01,399 --> 00:44:03,360
Your Grace, are you all right?

881
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,439
I’m fine.

882
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:06,479
Rogue! How dare you bully Her Grace!

883
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:08,320
I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!
