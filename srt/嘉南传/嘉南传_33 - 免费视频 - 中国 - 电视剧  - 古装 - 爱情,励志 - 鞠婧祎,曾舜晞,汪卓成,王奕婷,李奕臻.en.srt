27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,920
Uncle Li,

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,320
I’ve tracked down

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
that perpetrator.

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,720
Who is it?

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,360
It’s none other
but Princess Jia’nan’s father,

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,880
Jiang Zhenying.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,400
Gao Miaorong,

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,440
it’s been years.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,400
You don’t need

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
to hate Princess Jia’nan anymore.

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,480
Uncle Li, you think I only mean to

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,680
hurt the feelings
between Her Grace and Lord Xin?

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,640
Without any evidence,

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,920
you’re just slandering her.

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
Fine.

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,120
Let me introduce someone to you.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
When you see her,

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,560
the mystery will be cleared.

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,080
Who’s this?

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
This is Abbess Jing’an.

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,880
She practiced Buddhism at Fanhua Hall.

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,480
Before that,

49
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,680
she worked for Empress Dowager Cao.

50
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,960
Empress Dowager Cao?

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,960
Exactly.

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,400
This is the story.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
I didn’t mean to tell anyone about it.

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,440
Today, I’ll leave the Palace.

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,720
I don’t care if you believe me.

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,600
I’ll leave you alone.

57
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,560
In this case,

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
it only proves that Jiang Zhenying

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,560
got The Book of Supreme Weapons
for Empress Dowager Cao.

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,080
It doesn’t mean he’s the murderer.

61
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,960
Uncle Li,

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
I’ve been away from your family
for years.

63
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,600
This doesn’t concern me.

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,760
But I know

65
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,320
you and Qian have been

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,120
looking for the murderer.

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,480
I can’t just watch and do nothing.

68
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,840
I checked the records in the Palace.

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,840
Empress Dowager Cao offered
The Book of Supreme Weapons

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,279
very close to the date
when the Li Village was massacred.

71
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,800
If you don’t believe me,
have your men check on it.

72
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,360
There are so many coincidences
in this case.

73
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,280
But are they simply coincidences?

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,680
Either for revenge

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,520
or for gratitude,

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,600
it’s time to put an end

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
to the issues
between your family and me.

78
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,920
Steamed stuffed buns.

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,160
- Hot steamed stuffed buns.
- It looks so nice.

80
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Steamed stuffed buns.

81
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
Hot steamed stuffed buns.

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,000
Here it is.

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,240
Here’s your dish, sir.

84
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
I haven’t ordered it.

85
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,480
That lady ordered it for you.

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,800
You stalked me?

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,440
Your Highness,

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,600
I didn’t stalk you.

89
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,120
I just met you by chance.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,280
You’ve met the little prince, I guess.

91
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
You’re well-informed, Miss Gao.

92
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,680
Why did you bother to ask?

93
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,160
You flattered me, Your Highness.

94
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,800
I don’t have too much patience.

95
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,240
Just get to your point.

96
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,480
The little prince looks alike
the late emperor.

97
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,160
He’s clever and hard-working,

98
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
just like the late emperor.

99
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,800
Did you pretend to run into me

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
simply because

101
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
you wanted to discuss

102
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
about the little prince’s appearance
and culture?

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,040
I heard

104
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,080
you’re interested
in The Book of Supreme Weapons

105
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,680
kept in the Treasure House.

106
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,440
How did you know that?

107
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,320
It doesn’t matter.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,720
The Empress Dowager
isn’t interested in it.

109
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,640
She wants to help you.

110
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,360
I’m afraid Her Highness

111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,760
doesn’t even know where the Book is.

112
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,720
I’ll find it out.

113
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
What if it concerns Jiang Baoning?

114
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,000
When Li Changqing knows

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,480
his son married the daughter
of his enemy,

116
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,680
he’ll ask Li Qian to divorce her.

117
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
When Li Qian and Jiang Baoning
become enemy,

118
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,240
Marquis,

119
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,680
you’ll have a chance, won’t you?

120
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,480
You must be kidding, Your Highness.

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,960
You don’t need to conceal your feelings
in front of me.

122
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,280
You loved Princess Jia’nan

123
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,480
and everybody knew that.

124
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,000
Unfortunately, Li Qian took her
away from you.

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,960
This is a great chance

126
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,800
where you can take revenge.

127
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,480
Marquis,

128
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,120
if you want to do something
in the Palace,

129
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
just do it.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,480
I’ll support you.

131
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

132
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,840
Marquis,

133
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,040
what’s your plan?

134
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,720
I’m going to Bingzhou secretly.

135
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Bingzhou?

136
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,400
To visit Jiang Baoning?

137
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,440
You’re indeed romantic and loyal.

138
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,440
In the capital city,

139
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,640
please cover my traces for me.

140
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,960
I will, of course.

141
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,800
When you go to Bingzhou,

142
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,920
I’d recommend someone to you.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Your Highness.

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,760
Marquis, this is Xie Jianfeng.

145
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,000
He was a secret guard
for Empress Dowager Cao.

146
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,360
After Empress Dowager Cao
passed away for our state,

147
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,760
he pledged loyalty to me.

148
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,480
He’s decisive with great martial arts.

149
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
He’s also very loyal.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,480
He’ll be at your service.

151
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,760
I’d like to work for you, Your Highness.

152
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,720
I’ll accept

153
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,679
your gift, then.

154
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,840
(Yanfu House)

155
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,360
Your Highness,

156
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,440
who’s this?

157
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,520
Commander Xie
Her Highness recommended to me.

158
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,240
He’s talented with great martial arts.

159
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,560
He’ll work with you.

160
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,280
I’ll be loyal to you, Your Highness.

161
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,440
Your Highness,

162
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,240
is Xie Jianfeng trustworthy?

163
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
He’s just a spy for Empress Dowager.

164
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,360
Guard against him when you do missions.

165
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
I’ll get rid of him when possible.

166
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,480
It’s wise of you, Your Highness.

167
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
How’s the preparation going?

168
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,640
Everything is ready.

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,920
You can set out tomorrow morning.

170
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,760
And the Book...

171
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,120
It’s nowhere to be found.

172
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,360
We...

173
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,920
I’ve got a plan for that.

174
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,440
Now that The Book of Supreme Weapons
isn’t in the Palace,

175
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,800
it may really be kept by Baoning.

176
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,840
If the Empress Dowager told the truth,

177
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,800
the Li Family won’t tolerate Baoning.

178
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,080
This is a heaven-sent chance to me.

179
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
It’s been two days,
but he isn’t back yet.

180
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,160
What happened to Li Qian?

181
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
My lord, Her Grace has left.

182
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,960
I think you’re being unfair

183
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,440
to Her Grace.

184
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,440
Secret guards have brought back

185
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,360
clear intel about that case.

186
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,400
20 years ago,

187
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,520
Jiang Zhenying went to the Li Village.

188
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,120
I didn’t expect that

189
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,440
it was Baoning’s father

190
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,760
who quarreled with my mother.

191
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,880
If you were me,

192
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,280
what would you do?

193
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,080
My lord,

194
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,320
you can’t always get away from her.

195
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,680
You will

196
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,960
have to face it sooner or later.

197
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,039
(Changle Inn)

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,760
Wait here and don’t follow me.

199
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,320
(Changle Inn)

200
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,320
Your Highness.

201
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,720
You’re just in time, Mr. Jin.

202
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,200
Taste the tea. How do you feel?

203
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,720
Tastes good.

204
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,280
The simple tea offered by the inn

205
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,600
can’t be good.

206
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,800
The quality of the tea doesn’t matter.

207
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,240
As long as you make the tea carefully,

208
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,800
you will also

209
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
find the simple tea very sweet.

210
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,680
It’s been years.

211
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,960
You’re talking more beautifully.

212
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,400
I have to, as an official.

213
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,640
Does anyone else know

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,280
I’ve come to Bingzhou?

215
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,840
You asked me to keep a secret.

216
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
I don’t dare to tell anyone else.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,800
You’ve been working hard for the court,

218
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,960
and done meritorious military services.

219
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
When the new emperor took the throne,

220
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
he awarded many officials.

221
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,000
Even Li Changqing got
a high post in the capital city.

222
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,720
But no one remembered your credit.

223
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,680
I don’t have a good son.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,480
Li Qian married Princess Jia’nan.

225
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,600
So, Mr. Jin,

226
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,440
are you going to stay here
until you retire?

227
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,000
Any advice, Your Highness?

228
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,560
I want you to do me a favor.

229
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,360
You’re an influential man of our state.

230
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,000
I certainly want to help you.

231
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,920
I want to deal with a man.

232
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,840
Who?

233
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,760
Li Qian.

234
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
Don’t rush to reply.

235
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
You can go home and think more about it.

236
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,520
Fine. I’ll leave you alone, then.

237
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,720
Commander Xie.

238
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:46,920
Your Highness.

239
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,000
Do you think

240
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,360
Jin Haitao is trustworthy?

241
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,000
Your Highness,

242
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,000
you’re very influential now.

243
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,640
Everyone is honored to work for you.

244
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,480
Do you think so, too?

245
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,520
Your Highness,

246
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,800
since the Empress Dowager
gave me to you,

247
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,520
you’ve been my only master.

248
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,920
In this case,

249
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,720
do something for me.

250
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,280
Yes, Your Highness.

251
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,520
I came to Bingzhou secretly

252
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,320
and I can’t stay for a long time.

253
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,440
I heard

254
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,760
a magic weapon was found in Bingzhou

255
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,200
which is quite powerful.

256
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,960
After I leave in a couple of days,

257
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,840
are you willing to stay in Bingzhou

258
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,880
and check if the weapon is real?

259
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,640
I won’t let you down, Your Highness.

260
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,040
Want to spy on me?

261
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,000
Stay in Bingzhou and keep investigating.

262
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,600
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

263
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,480
Tell me, what’s wrong?

264
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,080
Your Grace.

265
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,920
Nothing.

266
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,880
Just some maids and nannies

267
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,080
are gossiping.

268
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,160
You don’t need to listen.

269
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,080
If it were true,

270
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,720
why did you hesitate to tell me?

271
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,760
Someone said that

272
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,840
Lord Xin hasn’t come back home lately

273
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,360
because he visits prostitutes
in Qinfang Pavilion.

274
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,839
Don’t follow up.

275
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,160
Li,

276
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,920
look at the singing girl.

277
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,839
Doesn’t she look like

278
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,000
Princess Jia’nan?

279
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,880
In this world,

280
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,160
no one can be compared with Baoning!

281
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,360
Just kidding. Don’t be angry.

282
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
Don’t make fun of that again.

283
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,720
Sorry for that.

284
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,680
You’re quite lucky.

285
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,400
You’re greatly promoted
with a bright future.

286
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,920
A promising life is waiting for you.

287
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,280
But I’m screwed.

288
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,120
After I’m back, my father forces me
to have blind dates.

289
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,680
I have to date

290
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,280
pretty girls from wealthy families.

291
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,840
I don’t mean they’re not good.

292
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,080
But a couple should love each other.

293
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,280
When two strangers are forced
to get married

294
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,800
and realize they don’t fit each other,

295
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,280
it’ll be really hard

296
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,880
to live the rest of their lives.

297
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
I was transferred to Bingzhou
and would work with you.

298
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,400
You promised to drink with me

299
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,560
and welcome me back.

300
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,120
But now you don’t say anything.

301
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,720
Li Qian, what a friend you are!

302
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
What? Feeling bad?

303
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,040
Having not seen each other for years,

304
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,400
am I even no longer your friend?

305
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,960
You’re always my best friend.

306
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,720
Now that we’re best friends,

307
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,240
you should complain to me.

308
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,280
What’s the fun of drinking alone?

309
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,680
Come on.

310
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,440
Tell me about it.

311
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,400
It took me great trouble

312
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,480
to get a priceless treasure.

313
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,920
It’s a good thing, isn’t it?

314
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,880
What makes you worried?

315
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,600
Later I know

316
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,840
this priceless treasure

317
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,920
is from my enemy.

318
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
That’s easy.

319
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,240
Now that it’s from your enemy,

320
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,280
after you take revenge,

321
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,040
you can keep the treasure frankly.

322
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,240
The enemy is dead.

323
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,440
Without the enemy,

324
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,680
you can keep the treasure

325
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,360
without concern.

326
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,640
The treasure always reminds me
of my enemy.

327
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,720
In this case,

328
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
destroy the treasure, then.

329
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,160
I don’t want that.

330
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,480
Then,

331
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,640
let go of the hatred
and accept the treasure.

332
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,360
I don’t want to destroy it.

333
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,400
I can’t let it go.

334
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
I can’t leave, either.

335
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,880
My lord,

336
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,240
let me fill your cup.

337
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,080
Baoning,

338
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,360
what should I do?

339
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,360
My lord.

340
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
You’re indeed here.

341
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,160
Your Grace,

342
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,160
actually...

343
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,600
So what?

344
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,000
My lord, do you want the drink?

345
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,240
Yes.

346
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,720
Enjoy yourself.

347
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,600
I’ll leave you alone.

348
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,920
Wait, Your Grace! Don’t leave!

349
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,160
Go away!

350
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,480
What are you two doing?

351
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,680
Go after her.

352
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,000
Go!

353
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,000
You must remember.

354
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,800
Yes, I do.

355
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,600
I’ll bring you

356
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,560
more boxes of the rouge.

357
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,240
All right.

358
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Come in, please.

359
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,560
Thank you, sir.

360
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,640
It’s been a long time
since you last visited me.

361
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,000
Come in, please. Come in.

362
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,400
Come on. You’ve finally come.

363
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,760
Zhao Xiao?

364
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,000
Baoning, I’m back.

365
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,600
It’s been years.
How are you doing, Your Highness?

366
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,760
Thank you for saving me that year.

367
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,040
Now, I live a simple life in Nanmin.

368
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,080
Don’t say that.

369
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,440
Everyone knows that

370
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
after you went back to Nanmin,
you moved on

371
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,640
and had excellent
political achievements.

372
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,840
You’ve contributed a lot

373
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,360
to the prosperity of our state.

374
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,480
Speaking of kinship,

375
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,160
we’re cousins.

376
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,520
Speaking of friendship,

377
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,960
we went through dangers.

378
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
After some disturbances,

379
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,360
I’m treating you as my close friend.

380
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,680
Don’t call me Your Highness.

381
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,400
Why not call me Cousin

382
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,680
or just Zhao Xiao?

383
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,240
I must be polite.

384
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,080
As you wish.

385
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,840
You’ve settled in Nanmin.

386
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,600
What brings you to Bingzhou?

387
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,160
I have to come for some business.

388
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,600
I can visit my friends by the way.

389
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,000
Baoning,

390
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
are you in a bad mood?

391
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,280
No.

392
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,320
Every time you’re in a bad mood,

393
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,040
you look worried.

394
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
You’re overthinking, Your Highness.

395
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,040
Fine.

396
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
If you don’t want to tell me,

397
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,400
I won’t force you.

398
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,160
Baoning,

399
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,720
I came to Bingzhou,

400
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,000
to ask you for a favor.

401
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,600
River bandits are rampant
in recent years.

402
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,560
They’ve done a lot of harm
to the court and our people.

403
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,000
We never slack off
in fighting river bandits.

404
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
Several days ago,
we captured some bandits.

405
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,000
During the interrogation,
one bandit said

406
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,480
when he sneaked into Jinxi that year,

407
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,840
he saw a magic weapon,

408
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,360
which had great power.

409
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,360
I think

410
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,400
if I can get the weapon,

411
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,000
I can fight the bandits with it.

412
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,440
Baoning,

413
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
you’ve always been proficient
in weapons.

414
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,960
Have you heard of such a weapon?

415
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,320
I haven’t.

416
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,280
Fine.

417
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,720
Please keep an eye on it.

418
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,600
If you get any intel,

419
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
come to me in Changle Inn
in the west of town.

420
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,000
I’ll try my best to help you.

421
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,320
I caught a cold the other day

422
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,560
and I don’t feel very well.

423
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,920
I’m going back for a rest.

424
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,040
Fine. Go back home.

425
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,200
Health matters most.

426
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,240
Please stay.

(The Book of Supreme Weapons)

429
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,560
Why did Zhao Xiao ask me

430
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,240
about The Book of Supreme Weapons?

431
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,680
I must tell Li Qian about it.

432
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,640
Look what Mr. Jin has done.

433
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,200
He knew you couldn’t drink much,
but he got you piled with the drink.

434
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,120
My lord,

435
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,400
seeking solace in drink
only makes you sadder.

436
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,920
Where’s the wine?

437
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,960
Get some to me!

438
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
I’m stopping you for your own good.

439
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,160
Your Grace.

440
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
I’ll leave you alone.

441
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,280
You’re avoiding me?

442
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,800
I’ve been so busy.

443
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,200
You’ve been so busy

444
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,200
that you visited Qinfang Pavilion?

445
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,440
Your Grace.

446
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,040
Master is back.

447
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,360

(Keep Good Moral Character)

449
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,880
Father,

450
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,680
what happened?

451
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,680
Let me tell you

452
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,360
what happened.

453
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
That year,

454
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,520
hundreds of people
in my village were killed.

455
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,680
My wife died in the fire.

456
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,960
Do you want to know

457
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,200
who did that?

458
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,520
Father.

459
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,680
What?

460
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,440
You knew the truth?

461
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,160
I didn’t.

462
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,920
In the past years,

463
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,440
I’ve been tracking down the murderer.

464
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,560
However,

465
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,160
I never expected that

466
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,640
the daughter of the murderer

467
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,560
married my son

468
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,040
with such a right reason!

469
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
So,

470
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
you’ve been avoiding me,

471
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
being cold to me,

472
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,280
and even getting close
to singing girls in Qinfang Pavilion

473
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,360
just because you think
my father is the murderer?

474
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,800
Jiang Baoning,

475
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,160
your father ruined my family.

476
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,680
We’re enemies.

477
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,000
Our family

478
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,480
can no longer let you stay.

479
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,920
My father was always frank.

480
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,920
He had never done anything

481
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,240
to hurt people.

482
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,120
Now he’s dead.

483
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,160
But you accuse him
of such a great crime.

484
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,400
What about the evidence?

485
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,200
Without evidence,

486
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,960
I wouldn’t come all the way

487
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,200
back to Bingzhou.

488
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,480
There’s an old nun in the Palace

489
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,920
who served Empress Dowager Cao.

490
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,080
She personally told me

491
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,960
that your father Jiang Zhenying

492
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,840
was sent to the Li Village,

493
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,200
looking for The Book of Supreme Weapons!

494
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,520
The day Jiang Zhenying went
to the Li Village,

495
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,400
all villagers were massacred.

496
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,640
Tell me.

497
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Why were there

498
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,400
so many coincidences?

499
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,320
Li Qian,

500
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,880
do you also think so?

501
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,720
The jade pendant you gave me

502
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,920
reminded me of my childhood.

503
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,800
Before the Li Village was massacred,

504
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,720
I saw a man carrying this jade pendant

505
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,560
quarrel fiercely with my mother.

506
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,600
After that,

507
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,760
our village was destroyed.

508
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
So, you’ve been cold to me,

509
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,280
because of this jade pendant?

510
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,840
Because of a jade pendant

511
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,200
and the testimony of a nun,

512
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,480
you think my father is the murderer?

513
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,360
All the evidence points to your father.

514
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,080
Any confusion?

515
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,520
Li Qian, tell me.

516
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,200
If I tell you

517
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,120
my father wouldn’t ever do that,

518
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
will you believe me?

519
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,360
We can’t buy your saying.

520
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,240
Qian,

521
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,680
he killed your mother.

522
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,320
It’s a family feud.

523
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,440
You can’t be immersed in love anymore!

524
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,440
You said that

525
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,040
you would believe me

526
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,200
and love me.

527
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,080
But you failed to keep your promise.

528
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Jiang Baoning,

529
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,040
you can

530
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,160
no longer stay with Li Qian.

531
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,480
Fine.

532
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,280
- Baoning.
- Stop!

533
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,640
Write a Letter of Divorce
and kick her out.

534
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,240
She can’t stay in our family.

535
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,120
This is between Baoning and me!

536
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,560
Could you leave us alone?

537
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Leave you alone?
What do you want then?

538
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,240
Even this jade pendant
is from the Jiang Family,

539
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,840
it doesn’t mean
Jiang Zhenying is the murderer.

540
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,200
Are you still trying to protect her?

541
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,480
Please let us be together, Father.

542
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,640
Come on, Li Qian.

543
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,120
I never expected you

544
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,920
to let go of your mother’s death

545
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,160
for this woman!

546
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,000
I don’t have
such an unfilial son like you!

547
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,120
What are you doing?

548
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,440
Going back to the capital city.

549
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
You can’t!

550
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,080
Now that you’re sure

551
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,400
my father killed your mother,

552
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,640
don’t you hate

553
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,640
his daughter?

554
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
I won’t let you leave.

555
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,199
I won’t let you leave.

556
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,840
- Li Qian.
- I won’t let you leave.

557
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,159
Now that you’re sure about that,

558
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,159
let go of me!

559
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,080
I won’t let you leave.

560
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,320
Let go of me.

561
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,880
I won’t let you leave.

562
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,320
Let go...

563
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,880
Let go of me!

564
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
No matter what,

565
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,760
I won’t let you leave.

566
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,800
Get more men

567
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
to guard the door.

568
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,719
Without my permission,

569
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,440
Her Grace can’t leave the room.

570
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
After you’re back,

571
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,040
have you met Li Qian?

572
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,280
I met him yesterday.

573
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,720
Don’t meet him too often.

574
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,320
Why?

575
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,040
Just listen to me.

576
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,680
I’m doing it for your own good.

577
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,160
When have I ever listened to you?

578
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,440
You bad boy.

579
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,160
Are you going to piss me off?

580
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,920
Come on, Father.

581
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,280
Li Qian and I are friends.

582
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,080
You know we’re close friends.

583
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,760
Without a special reason,

584
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,440
why will I become estranged from him?

585
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,080
He’s the Commandery Prince.

586
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
But what are you?

587
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,120
Why do you always meet him?

588
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,400
What does it concern his identity?

589
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,040
If you’re brilliant enough,

590
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,920
marry a noble girl, too.

591
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,640
Look at Li Qian.

592
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,720
Since he married Princess Jia’nan,

593
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,360
he’s got quickly promoted.

594
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,480
What about you?

595
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,240
Why don’t you

596
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,640
have any plans for your future?

597
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,920
Tell me.

598
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,960
The fourth daughter of Minister Cao

599
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,040
and the cousin of General Huaihua.

600
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,960
Why don’t you like them?

601
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,200
Their families are better than yours.

602
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
They can help you.

603
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,240
Come on, Father.

604
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,760
Why are you so dissatisfied
with our family?

605
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,760
Even if

606
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,640
I marry a girl from a better family,

607
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,920
she’s not a fool.

608
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
She’ll know what we’re up to.

609
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,960
After I marry her,

610
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,080
she won’t be nice to me.

611
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,240
Father,

612
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,120
how about this?

613
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,360
If you’re really jealous of Li Qian,

614
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,240
go marry a noble girl yourself.

615
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,560
I...

616
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,160
Father, I was just kidding.

617
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,040
Father, be seated.

618
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Come on.

619
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,680
Be seated.

620
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,400
Be seated, please.

621
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,200
Father,

622
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,400
Li Qian has achieved so much,

623
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,280
not because he married a princess.

624
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,120
With his courage and capability,

625
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,280
he has made his own achievements.

626
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,200
You only see Li Qian married a princess
and became a lord.

627
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,840
Why can’t you see
that they attract each other

628
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,000
and love each other?

629
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,320
I know.

630
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,720
Because

631
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
you never know about love.

632
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,720
What?

633
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,680
You’re not my son.

634
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,680
You’re exactly my jinx!

635
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,560
Father.

636
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,400
I heard about it.

637
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,240
Why would this happen?

638
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,440
Why do I have such an unfilial son

639
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,880
like your brother?

640
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,760
But when you make sure

641
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,040
Baoning’s father killed your dead wife

642
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,480
simply with the testimony of a nun,

643
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,360
you’re unfair to her.

644
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
Why do you defend an outsider?

645
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,840
No.

646
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,440
Father,

647
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,960
since she married my brother,

648
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,160
she’s one of our family.

649
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,960
How can you treat her as an outsider?

650
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,600
Besides, my brother treasures her.

651
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,160
In this case,

652
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,040
he’ll be in the biggest dilemma.

653
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,720
You’re indeed brother and sister.

654
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,760
I think you’re born

655
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,560
just to annoy me.

656
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,880
Instead of doing business,

657
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
you always make trouble!

658
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:02,880
Get out!

659
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,520
Father.

660
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,360
Get out!

661
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,560
Fine, fine.

662
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,960
There’s something wrong
with the accounts last month.

663
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,960
Check it again

664
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,920
and have it sent to my home.

665
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,240
Yes, Miss.

666
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,560
See you, Miss.

667
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,120
Leave me.

668
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,760
Mr. Jin.

669
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,440
Do you mind my sitting
and drinking with you?

670
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,840
Miss Dong, long time no see.

671
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,480
You’re just in time.

672
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,840
I want someone to drink with me
and make me happy.

673
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,520
Mr. Jin,

674
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,760
I thought after the expiration,

675
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,960
you returned to Bingzhou with honors

676
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,280
and you should be happy.

677
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,400
What happened? What worries you?

678
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,960
I’m not returning with honors.

679
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,480
The situation is far worse
than I imagined.

680
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,840
Besides...

681
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,200
Besides what?

682
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,160
My father cursed me all the way,

683
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,640
thinking I’m too disappointing.

684
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,920
It’s been five years.

685
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,600
You’re just like what you were.

686
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,880
What do you mean?

687
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,360
Speaking of it,

688
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,160
it’s been five years since we last met.

689
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,720
Didn’t you say

690
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,280
you also had stores in the capital city?

691
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,240
You once said

692
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,480
if I didn’t come back,
you would go there.

693
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,280
Are you blaming me?

694
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,840
I don’t dare to.

695
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,880
Forget it.

696
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,920
Sir,

697
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,000
do you know
where Deputy Commander Jin Xiao

698
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,120
works?

699
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,480
How do I know?

700
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,560
He’s very popular in town.

701
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,080
He just sometimes passes by.

702
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,520
I’m so tired after a day’s work.

703
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,120
Cheer up.

704
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,160
Go.

705
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,400
(Unifon)

706
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,360
Commander Jin, what’s wrong?

707
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,560
Nothing. I’m just browsing around.

708
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,840
Commander,

709
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,600
if you don’t go, you’ll be late.

710
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,720
I see. How nagging!

711
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,240
I don’t dare to visit you.

712
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,560
You’re a young hero.

713
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,160
In Bingzhou,

714
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,240
many girls adore you.

715
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,040
They do?

716
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,400
Yes, for sure.

717
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,880
I wonder

718
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,280
if you also adore me

719
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,560
like other girls.

720
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,760
You’re young and promising.

721
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
And you’re handsome.

722
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,680
I certainly admire you.

723
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,440
Well,

724
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,080
are you saying

725
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,760
you like me?

726
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,880
Can’t I like you?

727
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,440
I... I...

728
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,120
I treat you as my good friend,

729
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,520
but you teased me like this.

730
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,160
Miss Dong, we haven’t met for years.

731
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,680
Why did you make fun of me?

732
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,800
Come on. Cheers.

733
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,960
No matter if I made fun of you,

734
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,880
I’m glad you smiled.

735
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,000
So much for the wine.

736
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,160
See you.

737
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,320
For three meals,

738
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,800
Her Grace hasn’t had anything
to eat or drink.

739
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,320
If she still doesn’t eat,

740
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,880
she’ll die.

741
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,400
Have something to eat.

742
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,600
Eat something or I’ll feed you.

743
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Li Qian, tell me.

744
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,480
Do you believe me?

745
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,880
Do you believe my family?

746
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,720
If you don’t want porridge,

747
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,000
I’ll get something else for you.

748
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
Answer me, first.

749
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,200
Have something to eat.

750
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,560
Or your stomach will be hurt.

751
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,560
You still don’t believe me!

752
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,120
Because of a jade pendant

753
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,320
and a testimony of a nun,

754
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,320
you no longer believe me or my family!

755
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,680
A jade pendant...

756
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,040
A testimony...

757
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,040
You think so little of them?

758
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,840
Do you know

759
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,000
hundreds of people of my clan were dead?

760
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,440
That’s the feud of my mother!

761
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,480
You know?

762
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,400
You and your father are sure
my father massacred your village.

763
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,080
You keep me here

764
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,920
because you want to torture me

765
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,320
and avenge your clan?

766
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
I hate you!

767
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,800
If hating me

768
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,520
makes you feel better,

769
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,400
just hate me.

770
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,840
Baoning,

771
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,440
I’m sorry.

772
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,200
I’ve sent men to find the nun
for confrontation.

773
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,160
The truth will be clear.

774
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,960
These days,

775
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,080
sorry to keep you here.

776
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,240
Your Grace, what do you want?

777
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,560
He sent so many guards to spy on me?

778
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,760
You get him wrong.

779
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,440
The town remains uneasy.

780
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,080
Lord Xin is caring for you.

781
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,400
Your Grace, you want to go out?

782
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,600
I’m depressed today.

783
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,440
I’m going out for some songs
to divert myself from boredom.

784
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,200
I’m afraid you can’t leave.

785
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,040
Lord Xin said

786
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,040
you can’t leave without his permission.

787
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,560
What?

788
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,360
Treating me as a prisoner?

789
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,680
I don’t dare to.

790
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,840
Fine. I won’t force you.

791
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,320
How about this?

792
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,040
Send for some singing girls

793
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,880
and that’ll do, too.

794
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,560
Fine. I’ll go get it done.

795
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:26,760
My lord,

796
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,960
if you don’t want to go to the banquet,

797
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,920
you can stay at home,
saying you’re sick.

798
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,680
Hu Yiliang invited me.

799
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,360
If I don’t go,
they’ll have a reason to complain.

800
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,360
My lord,

801
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,680
I’m afraid they’ll collude
and embarrass you.

802
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,680
It’s the trick they usually use.

803
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,280
I can deal with them.

804
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:54,480
(Li’s Mansion)

805
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,400
Miss, what are you doing here?

806
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,880
I came to sing songs,
under the command of Princess Jia’nan.

807
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,679
Come in, please.

808
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:18,000
(Li’s Mansion)

809
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,120
Mr. Jin.

810
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
Mr. Jin.

811
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,600
Are you listening to me?

812
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,520
Miss Li, go on, please.

813
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,520
I’m listening.

814
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,800
I’m Miss Xu, not Miss Li.

815
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,080
You know, I...

816
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,920
I have a poor memory.

817
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,640
Miss Xu, forgive me.

818
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,240
When Uncle Jin visited my family

819
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,800
and mentioned you,

820
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,360
I didn’t want to come and see you.

821
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,400
You shouldn’t have come!

822
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,440
After all,

823
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,520
countless matchmakers go to my family

824
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,640
and propose marriage to me.

825
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,400
For example, Mr. Zhang
in the east of town,

826
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,440
and Mr. Liu in the west of town.

827
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,880
They both are outstanding men.

828
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,120
Outstanding men?

829
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,360
You think I don’t know?

830
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,760
Mr. Zhang is lame.

831
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,120
Mr. Liu has a prolonged illness.

832
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,600
I came to see you,

833
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,040
for the sake of the friendship
between our fathers over years.

834
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,200
Thank you, then.

835
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,200
I’m the single child of my family.

836
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,280
Our first son,

837
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,800
regardless of the ranking,

838
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,400
must have my family name

839
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,480
so that my family will be inherited.

840
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,480
You’re now a deputy commander

841
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,880
of third level.

842
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,200
If I marry you,
I’ll be marrying an inferior man.

843
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,200
My father is
the cavalry commander of third level.

844
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,720
After we get married,

845
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,880
I’ll ask my father to promote you.

846
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,200
You should work hard, too.

847
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,520
Try to reach the first level
in three years.

848
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,440
Come on, Miss Liu.

849
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,680
I’m Miss Xu, not Miss Liu.

850
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,040
But...

851
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,320
I hate it most when someone interrupts

852
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,360
as I speak.

853
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,040
For the sake that
you’re young and innocent,

854
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,160
I’ll forgive you for this once.

855
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,480
After we get married,

856
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,760
you must obey 88 family rules.

857
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,600
Mr. Zhou, I never expected you
to have such a literary talent.

858
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,320
You made poems at the age of three,
and painted at the age of five.

859
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,880
You took exams at the age of seven.

860
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,560
You’re young
but have such achievements.

861
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,160
I’m really jealous.

862
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,840
The poem you just read

863
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,120
sounded excellent and meaningful.

864
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,600
It’s the best poem I’ve ever heard.

865
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,760
If you don’t mind,

866
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,720
I can make a poem for you.

867
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,440
You flattered me.

868
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,280
You’re beautiful and talented.

869
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,720
It’s my honor to make a poem for you.

870
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,120
I’ll be waiting, then.

871
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,960
First, you mustn’t cheat on me.

872
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,320
Second, you mustn’t have a concubine.

873
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,920
Third, hand in your salary.

874
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,480
Mr. Zhou.

875
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,760
You mustn’t peek at any other girls,

876
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,520
including the maids.

877
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,720
We’re done with the meal.

878
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,640
How about listening to a song
to help digestion?

879
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,520
Also...

880
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,440
Miss Sun, I’ve got something else.

881
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,360
I have to go.

882
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,200
I...

883
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,560
I’m Miss Xu, not Miss Sun.

884
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,960
As you wish, Miss Dong.

885
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,680
You’re Mr. Zhou, right?

886
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,520
The meal is on me.

887
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,640
As for the song, forget it.

888
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,440
Miss Dong, what’s going on?

889
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,520
Don’t get it wrong, Mr. Zhou.

890
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,640
I don’t know him.

891
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,840
Shanhu,

892
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,280
several days ago in this place,

893
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,520
you just confessed your love to me.

894
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,280
Why are you denying it now?

895
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,920
When did I confess my love to you?

896
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,720
Several days ago in this place,

897
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,080
I asked if you liked me.

898
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:32,760
You said yes.

899
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,000
I thought about it carefully
and I think

900
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,560
we two make a perfect couple.

901
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,280
You!

902
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,840
Shanhu,

903
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,760
some of my friends from the capital city

904
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,160
passed Bingzhou yesterday
and had a drink with me.

905
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,560
They told me

906
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,280
you often looked for me
in the capital city.

907
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,440
Is that true?

908
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,000
No.

909
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,560
I didn’t.

910
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,840
Don’t get it wrong, Mr. Zhou.

911
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,040
He’s just a rascal.

912
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,760
Shanhu, I’m serious.

913
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,120
Who is this woman?

914
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,120
Miss Zhao, what woman do you mean?

915
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,200
This is my fiancée.

916
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,560
You mustn’t yell at her.

917
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,800
I’m Miss Xu, not Miss Zhao!

918
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,040
I don’t care.

919
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,120
It has nothing to do with me.

920
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,440
You! You!

921
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,080
Mr. Zhou!

922
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,160
Sir. Sir.

923
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:19,960
Run!

924
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,760
Are you all right?

925
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,240
I’m fine.

926
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,480
Sugar-coated haws.

927
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,120
What are you doing?

928
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,440
Why did you take me here?

929
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,280
I just wanted you to do me a favor.

930
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,400
You saw that.

931
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,120
My father forced me

932
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,920
to see Miss Zhang.

933
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,240
I don’t like her at all.

934
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,680
Well,

935
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,880
after what I did,

936
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,120
she’ll cry to my father.

937
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,000
It couldn’t be better

938
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,920
if my father will no longer

939
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,320
force me to have any blind dates.

940
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,120
You should tell her
if you don’t want to marry her.

941
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,080
Why did you use me as the shield?

942
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,560
Were you also having a blind date

943
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,280
with Mr. Zhou?

944
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,080
You just realized that?

945
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,920
Wait.

946
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,440
Why do you like

947
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,040
such a weak man like him?

948
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,440
He’s well-educated and intelligent.

949
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,320
He’s in a state of utter poverty.

950
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,800
Do I need any money from him?

951
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,320
You made sense.

952
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,560
But he... he...

953
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,720
He’s ugly!

954
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,520
You!

955
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,120
You’re being ridiculous.

956
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,520
What exactly do you want?

957
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,120
I...

958
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,160
I want you to have a good husband.

959
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,920
Don’t get such a husband

960
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,200
as weak as a cat.

961
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
He isn’t as handsome as me.

962
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,800
He wants your money, too.

963
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,960
I can’t stand that.

964
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,600
You can’t stand that?

965
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,200
So?

966
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,040
So...

967
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,720
So, I...

968
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,280
I...

969
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,000
I...

970
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,120
I...

971
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,320
Mr. Jin Xiao,

972
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,840
I just want to marry the man I like
and have babies with him.

973
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,840
When I’m sad,

974
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,360
I want him to wipe my tears.

975
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,000
When I’m lonely,

976
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,400
I want him to divert me from boredom.

977
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,600
When I’m helpless,

978
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,800
I can rely on him.

979
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,440
I thought

980
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,080
I had found that man.

981
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,960
However,

982
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,080
you’ve ruined everything.

983
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,680
I...

984
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,440
I...

985
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,320
Bad man!

986
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,640
I don’t want to see you anymore!

987
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,640
Why am I so clumsy of speech?

988
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,200
Why...?

989
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,000
Why can’t I just confess to her?

990
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,599
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

991
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,080
Miss Qingke,

992
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,440
is Her Grace satisfied?

993
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,200
After listening to several songs,

994
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,840
Her Grace is much happier.

995
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,640
Steward Li,

996
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,160
under the command of Her Grace,

997
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,120
Xiaoman and I are walking her out.

998
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,160
Fine. Fine.

999
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,400
Am I having poor eyesight?

1000
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,040
Why does the singing girl

1001
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,720
look like Her Grace?

1002
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,840
Wait, Miss Qingke!

1003
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:44,760
Quickly.

1004
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,519
Go.

1005
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:02,039
(Li’s Mansion)

1006
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:02,840
Put it here.

1007
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,880
Somebody! Stop that carriage!

1008
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,520
Quickly!

1009
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,200
Go!

1010
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,680
Your Grace.

1011
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,880
Your Grace.

1012
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,040
Your Grace.

1013
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,880
Your Grace?

1014
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,600
Go to Mr. Hu’s mansion and tell Lord Xin

1015
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,680
that Her Grace is missing.

1016
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

1017
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,280
Go!

1018
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,960
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

1019

My lord.

1021
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,160
My lord, something happened!

1022
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,240
Her Grace ran away!

1023
