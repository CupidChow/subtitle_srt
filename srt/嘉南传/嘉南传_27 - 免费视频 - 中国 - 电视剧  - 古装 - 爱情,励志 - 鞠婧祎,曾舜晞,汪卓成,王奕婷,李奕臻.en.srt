27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Sleepyhead.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,520
It’s five o’clock in the morning.
Time to get up.

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,560
I have decided to teach you

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
martial arts in the morning from today.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,960
Why should I learn martial arts?

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
I have my own secret weapon.

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,040
I don’t want to go. I want to sleep.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,240
Practicing martial arts in the morning

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,800
can promote your physical fitness.

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,600
Baoning,

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,480
you are too weak.

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,600
What if you meet a bad person again

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,280
when I’m not by your side?

40
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,640
I’m not going.

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,240
Come on, get up.

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
- Don’t grab me.
- Get up.

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,040
I’m not going.

44
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,080
Get up.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,440
I’m not going.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,320
You have to go.

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,160
You signed the family rules
in person last night

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,640
that I’ll teach you martial arts
in the morning.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
If you don’t go,

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
you will be punished
according to the family rules.

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,320
Did that happen?

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,760
(Xiyuan Family Rules)

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,600
If you make a mistake,
you will be given ten lashes.

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,320
Why is there corporal punishment?

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,840
There are laws in a country
and rules in a family.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,280
Nothing can be accomplished
without rules.

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,280
Did you forget

58
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,080
what you said before?

59
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,440
I’m a princess.

60
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,760
No one is above the law.

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,040
I won’t sign it.

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
It’s not fair to me.

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,520
How is it not fair?

64
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
The contract is binding me

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,400
as well as you.

66
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,240
Either of us will be punished
according to the family rules

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,760
if we make a mistake.

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,600
Your skin is thick. I’m not like you.

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,000
How about this?

70
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,720
You take double punishment
if you make a mistake.

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,960
If you agree, I’ll sign it.

72
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,440
That’s shameless.

73
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
You are scared?

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,960
It’s okay.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I won’t laugh at you if you are scared.

76
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,080
(Li)

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,080
You really signed it.

78
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,280
Come on.

79
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Slow down.

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,680
It’s hot.

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,920
I’m not running.

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,040
I can’t do it.

83
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,120
Hurry up.

84
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,600
I’m not running.

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,680
- I can’t.
- Hurry.

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,760
- I can’t.
- Come on.

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,200
I really can’t.

88
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,800
Let’s go.

89
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,000
I really don’t want to run.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
You have to run.

91
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,960
Come on.

92
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,600
It’s your turn.

93
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,800
Seems that you can’t use a sword now.

94
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,920
With your physical fitness,

95
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
you have to start from scratch.

96
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Do squats now.

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,200
No way. Can’t you give me a break?

98
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
You’ve only practiced for 15 minutes
and you wanna take a break?

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,680
No.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,880
Lift your hands.

101
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,880
On the same level.

102
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,960
Open your legs.

103
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,760
Doing squats

104
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,760
is the basic skill of martial arts,

105
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,800
also the most important step
to keep fit.

106
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,280
Doing squats in the right way
can promote fitness, invigorate kidney

107
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
and regulate your energy.

108
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,160
As the saying goes,

109
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,480
practicing martial arts
is about practicing Kungfu,

110
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,720
and waist is essential to Kungfu.

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,720
Li Qian is simply a devil.

112
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,280
He dragged me to do morning exercise.

113
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,800
I feel like I didn’t have breakfast.

114
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
There is nothing.

115
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,480
What time is it now?

116
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,520
There is no food.

117
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
Right.

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,680
I was out just for a while.

119
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Why are you here?

120
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,160
I’m here to see if lunch is ready.

121
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,080
Are you trying to slack off?

122
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,800
You dragged me to do morning exercise.

123
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,720
I had breakfast,
but I feel like I didn’t.

124
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,280
I’m hungry and I’m here
to find something to eat.

125
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,240
And you said I’m slacking off.

126
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,160
Fine.

127
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,320
Stop.

128
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,680
Turn around.

129
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,960
Come on.

130
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,360
Here come the noodles.

131
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,560
Where is garlic?

132
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,080
Garlic?

133
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
We eat noodles with garlic in Jinxi.

134
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,920
After my mother passed away,

135
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,320
no one made me
longevity noodles anymore.

136
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,640
In Jinxi,

137
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,360
we eat noodles with garlic.

138
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,320
Here.

139
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,240
Don’t push it.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,040
That’s dirty!

141
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,360
No problem. Wait.

142
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,680
No! It hurts too much!

143
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,640
- Let me off!
- Keep it straight.

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
- Then you can stretch your muscles.
- Let me off!

145
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,400
Well...

146
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,080
Easy. Easy.

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,040
That’s because you don’t do exercise.

148
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,200
Stop talking!

149
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,080
It won’t hurt if you do exercise.

150
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,400
It’s...

151
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,160
Your Grace. Master Li.

152
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,880
Is it about the camp?

153
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,680
Yes.

154
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,960
Baoning.

155
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,520
You need to exercise more.

156
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,640
It won’t hurt
if you stretch a few more times.

157
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,400
Keep practicing. I’ll be back soon.

158
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,559
Go ahead.

159
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,520
Don’t slack off.

160
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,240
He should be gone now.

161
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,400
Your Grace.

162
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,920
Master Li has something

163
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,200
to deal with in the camp.

164
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,720
I know.

165
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,400
All right, you can leave.

166
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:04,960
I know.

167
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,440
Your Grace, Master Li asked me to stay

168
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,480
and attend on you.

169
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,640
To attend on me?

170
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,200
He sent you to supervise me.

171
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,600
Your Grace, do you need...?

172
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,080
I know. I know.

173
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,600
You are back, Your Grace.

174
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,600
Your Grace.

175
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,360
What’s wrong with you?

176
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,200
I’m fine. I’m fine.

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,240
Are you hurt?

178
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,560
No. No.

179
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,160
Get me some water.

180
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,600
This is...

181
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,080
Fill it up, too.

182
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,880
Okay. Okay.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800
Drink slowly, Your Grace.

184
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,840
Hurry.

185
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,280
Slow down.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,640
What happened to you?

187
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
That demon Li Qian

188
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,320
made me practice for a whole day.

189
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
Let’s tell Commandery Prince

190
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,080
that we won’t practice anymore.

191
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,080
(Xiyuan Family Rules)

192
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,880
If you make a mistake,
you will be given ten lashes.

193
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,440
Why is there corporal punishment?

194
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,880
There are laws in a country
and rules in a family.

195
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,320
Nothing can be accomplished
without rules.

196
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,320
Did you forget

197
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,120
what you said before?

198
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,960
No.

199
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,640
I can’t go back on my word.

200
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,000
What to do then?

201
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,000
Are you good in health?

202
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,280
Of course.

203
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,520
I’ve been strong since...

204
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,080
Your Grace.

205
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Do you want me to...?

206
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,000
You know me best, Qingke.

207
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,280
No way. Commandery Prince
will find it out.

208
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
No. He is in the camp now.

209
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,280
He asked Wei Shu
to keep an eye on me every day.

210
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,880
That Wei Shu doesn’t dare
to get too close to me.

211
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,800
Come on.

212
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,680
You leave early tomorrow morning.

213
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,520
When Wei Shu arrives,

214
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,760
he will see me there practicing.

215
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Me...?

216
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,160
Yes, you.

217
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,240
Have a try.

218
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,400
Like this.

219
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Lower.

220
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
That’s right.

221
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,360
Play with me?

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
Scare me with the family rules?

223
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,520
I won’t practice. What can you do?

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You are good.

225
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,960
You can be in two places at once.

226
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,160
(Yuxuan)

227
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,720
Master Li, I failed in my duty.

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Just punish me.

229
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,640
There is no need

230
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,880
to treat Qingke like this.

231
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Yeah, Your Highness.

232
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,640
Punish Her Grace if you want.

233
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,720
She made me do it.

234
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,080
But she is weak.

235
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,480
Give her a lighter punishment.

236
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Look, they work together
to go against me.

237
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,200
You will be treated equally.

238
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,920
The three of you
do squats for four hours.

239
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,960
The person who spills the water first

240
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,920
will do squats for four more hours.

241
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,240
Do it well.

242
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:19,320
(Yuxuan)

243
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,560
Hasn’t Li Qian come back yet?

244
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,080
No.

245
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
After he went to the camp
in the afternoon,

246
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
he sent a message back

247
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,440
that he got tied up
with military affairs.

248
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,640
I guess he will be back later.

249
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,200
He won’t train me tomorrow, will he?

250
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,440
I have to write a letter
to my grandmother

251
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,600
to punish him.

252
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,360
He made me practice
martial arts every day.

253
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,080
Yes. Yes.

254
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,480
Well, Qingke.

255
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,240
Go find more girls to try it.

256
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,640
You stand beside her

257
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,000
and they won’t suspect you.

258
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,480
Your Grace.

259
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
Everyone in the mansion knows about it.

260
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,160
Who would dare to go against
Commandery Prince?

261
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,560
Not to mention
the intensity of the training.

262
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,080
Not many girls can take it.

263
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,920
Your Grace, why don’t you...?

264
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,600
My silly princess.

265
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,360
You always couldn’t sleep well,

266
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,520
but you have slept soundly every night
since you practiced martial arts.

267
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,720
I should let Wei Shu urge you
to practice martial arts well.

268
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,200
(Yuxuan)

269
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,920
You are finally back.

270
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,280
You are good today.

271
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Of course. I’m changed.

272
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,640
I have official affairs to deal with.

273
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,720
I’ll go back to the study first.

274
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,920
Just a little of diarrhea grass.

275
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,240
He won’t be back for a while, right?

276
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,720
What a coincidence.

277
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,440
I’m just going to see you.

278
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,880
It’s really a coincidence.

279
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,480
I’m here to tell you

280
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,440
there will be a test

281
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,400
three days later.

282
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,760
Thanks for your cooperation.

283
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,160
(Li’s Mansion)

284
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
My stomach really hurts.

285
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,320
What’s wrong?

286
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
It really hurts.

287
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,080
Your Grace, are you all right?

288
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,720
My stomach really hurts.

289
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,320
What’s wrong?

290
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,560
What to do then?

291
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,240
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)
I don’t know. It just hurts.

292
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,720
I can’t practice martial arts anymore.

293
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,800
From tomorrow,

294
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
you don’t need to stay by her side.

295
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,160
I just want her

296
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,560
to acquire some self-defense skills

297
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,800
and to keep fit.

298
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,280
Don’t overdo it.

299
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,920
Yes.

300
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,360
By the way,

301
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,480
you mentioned there is a pastry shop

302
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,720
in the suburbs that is really good.

303
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,400
It provided pastry
to the capital back then.

304
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,880
Do you remember exactly where it is?

305
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,800
Of course.

306
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,840
Let’s go there
before we go back to the camp tomorrow.

307
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,240
But Master Li.

308
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,240
We need to be at the camp
early in the morning.

309
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,520
I am afraid...

310
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,680
We will go there no matter how early.

311
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,720
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

312
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,160
You came just right.

313
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,359
I couldn’t sleep

314
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,480
last night.

315
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,280
So I opened the shop earlier today.

316
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,160
Otherwise, you won’t be able to get any.

317
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,800
Granny.

318
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,839
You look healthy.

319
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,880
If you don’t sleep well in autumn,

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,480
I suggest you have some jujube soup.

321
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,720
You even know that?

322
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,240
You don’t look like a physician.

323
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
My wife doesn’t sleep well.

324
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,080
I often ask the servants
to prepare some for her.

325
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,760
Are these pastries

326
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,960
for your wife?

327
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,400
Your wife is really lucky.

328
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,520
I’m leaving. I’ll come again next time.

329
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,960
Okay, take care.

330
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,080
Wei Shu.

331
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,400
Take this back.

332
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,120
You got up early today.

333
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,520
You don’t need to watch the Princess
after you go back.

334
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,440
Take a good rest.

335
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,400
Yes.

336
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,320
Hold on.

337
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,240
Take this back

338
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,720
and plant it in the west yard.

339
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,600
The Princess might feel better
seeing this

340
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,160
when she practices martial arts.

341
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,120
Why did you take the whole plant?

342
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,960
The flower will die fast
if you pluck it.

343
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,160
Maybe it will bloom next year.

344
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,680
Let’s go.

345
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,800
Your Grace, time to get up.

346
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
Qingke.

347
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,800
Where did you get the pastries?

348
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,680
It tastes like
what I ate in the capital.

349
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,600
Try it.

350
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,280
The Commandery Prince went
to the outskirts early this morning

351
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,120
to buy them for you.

352
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,240
They said the pastries in this shop

353
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,480
used to be only supplied to the capital.

354
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,560
That’s why

355
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,000
it tastes familiar to you.

356
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,160
Li Qian bought them?

357
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,240
This one.

358
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,400
Eat this, it’s also delicious.

359
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,000
I tried it before.

360
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,560
Thank you, Your Grace.

361
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,840
You’re welcome.

362
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,560
Why isn’t Wei Shu here yet?

363
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,440
Does Li Qian give up on me?

364
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,920
Great.

365
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
I want to skip it anyway.

366
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,200
How do I feel

367
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,560
that the flowers are here
to supervise me?

368
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,920
Fine.

369
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,160
I’ll just practice for a little while.

370
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,800
Your Grace!

371
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,000
- It hurts.
- What happened?

372
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,840
I’m asking you.

373
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,960
Seriously?

374
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,400
I’m like this now.
You still want to train me?

375
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,080
You...

376
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,680
I just want you
to be able to defend yourself.

377
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,040
Now you are limping.

378
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,600
You Grace, time to take medicine.

379
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,280
Give it to me.

380
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,480
It’s hot. Be careful.

381
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,520
(Li’s Mansion)

382
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,000
According to your requirements,

383
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,120
the money collected

384
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,400
has been distributed as pensions.

385
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,160
The wounded soldiers’ family members
were also compensated.

386
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,120
The shelter’s moldy rice
and cotton mixed with sand

387
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,240
were also selected
and burned outside the city.

388
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,480
In addition,

389
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,040
those victims who made trouble

390
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,400
were also expelled from the shelter.

391
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,440
They left Bingzhou’s government office
with their tails between their legs.

392
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
Thank you for what you did these days.

393
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,120
You finally took a few days off.

394
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,480
You should stay at home

395
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,040
to be with your princess.

396
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,160
Just leave

397
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,200
these chores to me.

398
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,200
Speaking of this,
you’ve been married for a while.

399
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,480
Why is there no good news
from the Princess?

400
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,880
Well,

401
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,520
are you sticking your nose
into my business like my father?

402
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
I’m just worried about you.

403
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,920
Li.

404
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,080
You don’t have

405
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,680
any problem, do you?

406
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,480
Screw you.

407
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,000
Baoning is weak.

408
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,760
She needs time to recuperate.

409
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,320
It will take some time.

410
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,920
It can’t be rushed.

411
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,440
Li.

412
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,760
Only when you have a child

413
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,400
can you increase your status
through your child

414
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,880
and keep your position
as the Commandery Prince.

415
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,560
Jin Xiao.

416
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,040
Seems that

417
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,120
we haven’t fought for some time.

418
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,080
No. No.

419
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,720
I care about you.

420
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,160
It’s fine if you don’t appreciate it.

421
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,760
Don’t try to fight with me all day.

422
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,600
It’s rude.

423
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,720
By the way,

424
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,200
I heard

425
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,760
that Daxiangguo Temple
holds a temple fair recently.

426
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,680
The Maiden Who Brings Children
works well.

427
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,680
For your future,

428
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
you should think about it.

429
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,880
You are sick.

430
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,000
Go by yourself.

431
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,840
It’s the Maiden Who Brings Children
at the Daxiangguo Temple!

432
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,920
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

433
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,880
I know you are awake.

434
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,120
Don’t fake sleep.

435
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,200
Get up now.

436
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,120
My chest hurts badly these days.

437
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,040
I’ll practice martial arts
a few days later.

438
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,720
- No.
- You’ve used this excuse six times.

439
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,120
You think I’m stupid and know nothing?

440
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,760
Will I be fooled by you again?

441
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,160
I’m not lying this time.

442
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,840
Fine.

443
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,640
I won’t train you today.

444
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
I’ll take you to a place.

445
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,720
- Come on.
- Let’s go.

446
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,200
Let’s go!

447
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,840
I’m Li Qian

448
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,400
from Jinxi.

449
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,360
What I ask for today

450
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,800
is not money or status.

451
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,560
May the Maiden Who Brings Children

452
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,720
grant me a pair of children.

453
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,280
Let my honor be increased
through my children

454
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,000
and let me be favored
by the Princess for my lifetime.

455
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,360
What is that?

456
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,040
Increase your honor
and be favored by me?

457
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,720
Don’t laugh

458
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,480
in front of the Buddhism Goddess.

459
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,600
Are you serious?

460
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,040
May you grant me

461
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,800
what I want as soon as possible.

462
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,840
Get up.

463
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,080
Is it funny?

464
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,160
Look at me.

465
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,240
Is it really that funny?

466
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,320
It’s a little bit funny.

467
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,440
Baoning.

468
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,600
I really want

469
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,560
to stay by your side forever

470
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,680
and never leave you.

471
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,720
But you are too strong,

472
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,880
too smart, and too independent.

473
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,240
I’m worried that you will find me
boring one day

474
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
and leave me.

475
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,120
What makes you think that?

476
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,160
I’m not that kind of people
who are irresponsible.

477
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,000
Why should I leave you for no reason?

478
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,760
Unless you do something awful to me

479
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,880
and break my heart.

480
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,240
I swear in front of the Buddhism Goddess

481
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,680
that I will never do that to you.

482
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,120
All right. That’s right.

483
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,360
What are you afraid of?

484
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,920
It’s a place of tranquility here.

485
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
Stop imagining
these unreasonable things.

486
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,240
Come on. Let’s draw straws.

487
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,680
See if I’m lucky.

488
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,160
It’s the eighth sign.

489
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,960
What does it mean?

490
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,080
A broken boat on the beach.

491
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,000
It’s a short straw.

492
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,680
There is a poem.

493
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,280
A lonely boat in the shallow waters.

494
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,680
The wind is cold
and the horse won’t come forward.

495
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,680
(Short Straw)
Bid farewell to old friends.

496
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,200
(Short Straw)
Sing a song of Partridges in the Sky.

497
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,120
It doesn’t count.

498
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,840
Draw another one.

499
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,080
Sir.

500
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,800
You can only draw once
since ancient times.

501
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,680
You can’t draw it again.

502
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,720
We control our own lives.

503
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,360
Why should we let a bamboo stick

504
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,200
decide our future?

505
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,040
Let’s go.

506
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,560
Freshly baked pastries. Have a taste.

507
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,480
It’s just a stick.

508
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,080
Why are you so gloomy?

509
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,080
It’s a bad sign.

510
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,320
Grandmother got sick
because of Han Tongxin.

511
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,120
I don’t know if she gets any better now.

512
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,640
The capital is thousands of miles
away from Jinxi.

513
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,680
I don’t know how long it takes
to go there and come back.

514
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,040
Are you worried about
the Grant Empress Dowager?

515
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,120
Of course.

516
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,760
I haven’t received a letter from her.

517
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,440
I always feel
something bad is going to happen.

518
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Come on, have some tea and take a break.

519
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,840
Please enjoy.

520
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,200
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

521
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,720
You just

522
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
worry too much all the time.

523
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,200
You are burdening yourself for nothing.

524
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,560
After what happened
at the underground bank,

525
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,680
Zhuang Li’s false accusation
against you fell apart.

526
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,720
The Grand Empress Dowager
loves you most.

527
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
If she knows you are not guilty,

528
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,280
maybe she will be happy and recover
without medical help.

529
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,480
As for the letter,

530
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,360
let’s wait for a few days.

531
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,840
If there is still no news,

532
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,840
I’ll send someone
to the capital to ask about it.

533
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,960
Can you send someone tomorrow?

534
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay, I’ll do it tomorrow.

535
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,320
Thanks.

536
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,640
If you really want to thank me,

537
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
don’t just talk about it.

538
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,880
You should show some sincerity.

539
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,280
What kind of sincerity?

540
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,920
You are clever and foresighted.

541
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,040
How can you not know what I want?

542
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,920
May the Maiden Who Brings Children

543
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,040
grant me a pair of children.

544
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,400
Let my honor be increased
through my children

545
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,720
and let me be favored
by the Princess for my lifetime.

546
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,240
I see.

547
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,520
Miss, see if there is anything you like.

548
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,480
Except for these two,

549
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,360
I’ll take the rest.

550
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,160
Take them all.

551
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,520
They’re all yours now.

552
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
- See. They’re all for you.
- You can also have the cart.

553
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,120
What do you mean?

554
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,640
Didn’t you make a wish
in front of the Buddhism Goddess

555
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,960
that you want to be favored by me
for your lifetime?

556
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,440
I...

557
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,360
I’m fulfilling your wishes
for the Buddhism Goddess.

558
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,360
You’re welcome.

559
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,760
My wish is to increase my honor
through my children.

560
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,040
My husband is small-minded.

561
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,640
He gets angry easily

562
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,920
and gives me that attitude.

563
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,080
I indulge him too much.

564
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,080
Don’t be mad.

565
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,960
Young man, you are lucky

566
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,160
to marry such a wife.

567
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,880
Yeah, young man.

568
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,160
You must cherish her.

569
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,840
Listen.

570
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,600
Excuse me. Please make way.

571
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,040
Be careful.

572
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,520
Are you happy?

573
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,840
I’m happy if you are happy.

574
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,920
Be careful. Watch it.

575
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,640
- Be careful.
- Move.

576
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,840
Excuse me.

577
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,720
You can just let me

578
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,200
donate the money for you.

579
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,360
Why bother to come in person?

580
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,000
Yesterday, I came here
with Li Qian to pray.

581
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,600
I drew a short straw

582
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
and feel distressed after I went back,

583
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,880
so I decided to come to the temple
and donate some money.

584
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
Hope I can make eliminate disasters
and get rid of bad luck.

585
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
It’s better to do
this kind of thing in person.

586
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,840
You are thoughtful indeed.

587
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,320
(Wine)

588
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,200
Sir, please enjoy.

589
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,880
Okay.

590
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,880
Waiter.

591
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,280
- Yes.
- Two more pots.

592
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,200
Sir.

593
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,080
You’ve had seven pots of wine.

594
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,960
Well...

595
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,560
You haven’t paid yet.

596
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,520
What’s that attitude?

597
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,880
You think I can’t afford a drink?

598
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,880
Do you really have no money?

599
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,680
You had seven pots of wine.

600
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,360
A total of three taels of silver.

601
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,480
I’ll see you at the government office
if you give me one penny less!

602
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,280
- Why are you so drunk?
- He even wanted to make trouble.

603
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,360
What do you want to do?

604
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,840
- He...
- I’ll get you arrested.

605
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,000
Am I dreaming?

606
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,800
- Don’t drink if you have no money.
- I’ll pay for it.

607
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,400
Baoning.

608
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,960
- Baoning, is it really you?
- Zhao Xiao, you are drunk.

609
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,720
I’m not drunk.

610
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,520
I’m sober.

611
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,800
Since the Grand Empress Dowager

612
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,360
betrothed you to me,

613
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,000
Baoning, I knew

614
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,200
you will be my wife.

615
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,400
- Baoning.
- Master Zhao, please behave yourself.

616
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,640
Go away!

617
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,800
Don’t take Baoning away from me.

618
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,760
Zhao Xiao!

619
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,000
It’s in public. Behave yourself.

620
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,280
Behave myself?

621
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,080
How should I behave myself?

622
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,760
You are supposed to be my wife.

623
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,280
But Li Qian took you away from me.

624
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,080
Everyone told me to give in.

625
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,600
Why should I?

626
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,240
Go with me, Baoning.

627
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,280
Why are you here?

628
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,440
If I come later,

629
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,440
my wife will be stolen from me.

630
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,120
He’s drunk.

631
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,920
Get up!

632
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,960
Are you okay?

633
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,000
You stole my wife from me. I hate you.

634
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
Let’s settle

635
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,760
what’s between us today.

636
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,960
I’ll play along.

637
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,000
Stop. Stop.

638
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,840
Stop it.

639
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,320
Your Grace!

640
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,680
- Baoning!
- Baoning!

641
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,160
Okay.

642
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,360
Baoning, are you seriously injured?

643
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,520
Open the door.

644
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,639
Let me in and take a look.

645
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,520
Go away.

646
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,880
I don’t want to see you.

647
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,920
Come on.

648
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,920
How can you forgive me?

649
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,920
Forget it.

650
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,239
Baoning.

651
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,040
Baoning!

652
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,680
Your Grace.

653
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,240
How about I invite His Highness in?

654
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,040
Why let him in?

655
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,120
To piss me off?

656
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,440
He didn’t hurt you intentionally.

657
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,080
Just meet him.

658
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,320
Don’t speak for him.

659
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,280
His apology is insincere.

660
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,600
I don’t want to see him.

661
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,120
You should leave, too.

662
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,120
I want to be alone.

663
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,880
Your Highness, you are...

664
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,120
Your Grace.

665
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:39,960
You...

666
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,680
What are you doing?

667
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,920
Rule number two,

668
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,600
don’t make the Princess angry
because of anyone or anything.

669
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,760
I broke the family rules.

670
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,840
I’m unforgivable.

671
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,160
Please punish me.

672
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,080
It’s cold outside.

673
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,120
You took off your clothes.
Aren’t you afraid to freeze to death?

674
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,360
I made a big mistake.

675
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,920
I deserve it.

676
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,480
What’s your mistake?

677
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,240
First,

678
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,520
I shouldn’t fight
with Zhao Xiao on the street.

679
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,480
Second,

680
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,440
I shouldn’t
accidentally hurt Your Grace.

681
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,520
Third,

682
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,160
I shouldn’t speak arrogantly in public.

683
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,240
You fought with Zhao Xiao on impulse.

684
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,240
Doesn’t it mean

685
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,560
you have no faith in me?

686
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,440
I’m afraid to lose you.

687
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,280
It’s cold. Just get in.

688
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,880
Thank you, Your Grace.

689
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,520
Dear, here comes the water.

690
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,760
I’ve been serving you all the time.

691
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,520
It’s your turn to serve me today.

692
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,720
This is what I should do.

693
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,360
I’ll do it every day from now on.

694
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,440
He Cuihua.

695
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,080
Why are you giggling?

696
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
What?

697
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,840
I serve you every day.

698
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,280
It’s your turn to serve me today.

699
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,120
Come on.

700
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,600
Go outside and get me some water
to wash my feet.

701
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,400
If you don’t serve me well,

702
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,760
don’t go to my bed tonight.

703
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,960
How dare you!

704
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,960
Your surname
and your son’s surname are both Li.

705
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,640
Why are you two so different?

706
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,240
Your son offended the Princess

707
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,160
and he knelt in the yard naked.

708
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,160
Look at you.

709
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,200
You just yell at me every day.

710
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,600
I don’t care.

711
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
You must be gentle to me

712
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,240
like the way

713
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Qian treats the Princess.

714
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,280
(Keep Good Moral Character)
He Cuihua.

715
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,000
(Keep Good Moral Character)
If you keep being unreasonable,

716
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,920
(Keep Good Moral Character)
just sleep outside.

717
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,720
I am being unreasonable.

718
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,640
What can you do?

719
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,680
Li Changqing, you...

720
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,680
Father, you want to see me?

721
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
Qian.

722
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,960
You are my only son.

723
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,360
I’ve been disciplining you strictly
over these years.

724
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,520
I hope you can excel yourself sooner

725
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,760
and bring honor

726
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,040
to the Li Family.

727
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,880
I understand.

728
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,280
You don’t understand.

729
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,680
Father, just tell me
what you want to say.

730
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,120
Husband and wife.

731
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,280
Why is husband ahead of wife?

732
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,160
It means that after
the wife marries her husband,

733
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,760
she has to listen to her husband.

734
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,200
How can you let your wife

735
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,160
act like a tyrant at home?

736
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,040
And a man,

737
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,560
you seek career and fame out there,

738
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,920
but you should also know
how to deal with family affairs.

739
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,240
How can my son be afraid of his wife?

740
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
If anyone else hears that,

741
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,840
what would that make me look?

742
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,160
Therefore,

743
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,760
you should

744
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,280
act like a man

745
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
at the right time.

746
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,960
What a domineering and unreasonable man.

747
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,680
How did I fall in love with you
in the first place?

748
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,440
Father.

749
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
I have a different point of view

750
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,680
about what you said.

751
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,480
Husband and wife are inseparable.

752
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,920
They are indispensable for each other.

753
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,480
Since ancient times,

754
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,880
whether for a common man,
an emperor or a general,

755
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,920
there is no exception.

756
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,000
I think

757
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,960
the real way for couples to get along

758
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,960
shouldn’t resort to fear.

759
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,480
If we love and support each other,

760
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,920
and praise each other more,

761
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,440
this kind of relationship
is long-lasting.

762
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,400
Not to mention a man

763
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,360
is supposed to be tolerant.

764
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,280
We shouldn’t bother about the trifles.

765
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,720
I love what Qian said.

766
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,280
Not bad.

767
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
Who is out there?

768
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,240
Well,

769
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,360
your mother is getting bolder now.

770
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,760
She dared to eavesdrop on us.

771
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,480
Father.

772
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,280
Actually, Mother did a lot

773
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,080
for the Li Family.

774
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,120
You should treat her better.

775
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,160
A man and his wife
are companions when they are old.

776
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,040
To support each other
and stay with each other

777
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,400
is the right way
to maintain a relationship.

778
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,320
You got the nerve

779
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,480
to teach me a lesson now.

780
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,400
Father.

781
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,680
Just think about it.

782
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,920
I’ll leave then.

783
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,360
Master Zhao, Her Grace invites you in.

784
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,200
Baoning.

785
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,480
I heard that you want to see me?

786
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,800
I got drunk in the street that day

787
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
and I was being a jerk.

788
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,320
After I got sober, I remembered

789
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
that I accidentally injured you
in a dispute.

790
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,000
I’m here today

791
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,280
to apologize to you in person.

792
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,960
It’s just a minor injury. I’m fine now.

793
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,520
Don’t worry too much about it,
Master Zhao.

794
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,280
I wonder if I can see you

795
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,600
so that I’ll know if you are doing well.

796
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,040
I said I’m fine.

797
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,960
Baoning.

798
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,760
I didn’t know

799
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
you despise me so much already.

800
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,640
Since you are fine,

801
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
I won’t bother you.

802
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,800
Hold on.

803
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,600
Qingke.

804
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,400
You gave

805
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,040
this jade pendant to me
as a wedding gift.

806
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,600
But it’s too expensive.

807
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,720
I hope you can give it to someone
who deserves it,

808
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,920
so that it won’t be wasted.

809
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,600
I also hope

810
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,080
you can meet someone you love one day.

811
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,600
Someone I love.

812
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,160
Do you know

813
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,400
I won’t love anyone else

814
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,200
after I lost you?

815
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,200
Don’t you have eyes?

816
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,240
Go away!

817
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,160
Just go.

818
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,600
Stop!

819
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,800
Slow down.

820
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,320
Watch it.

821
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,760
Master Zhao, mercy!

822
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,520
How dare you ask for mercy?

823
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,440
You got the nerve to rip me off.

824
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,640
You are seeking for your death!

825
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,160
Master Zhao, I was also deceived
by someone else

826
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,600
to make such a terrible mistake.

827
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,960
Look at me now.

828
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,240
I was given 100 floggings,

829
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,040
and my legs are broken now.

830
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,760
I’m disabled for the rest of my life.

831
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,960
I beg you.

832
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,000
Just treat me like a dog.

833
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,920
Let me go.

834
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,040
Piss off!

835
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,480
From now on,

836
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
don’t let me see you again!

837
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,320
Thank you, Master Zhao.

838
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,240
That’s strange.

839
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,080
It’s made according to the drawing,

840
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,760
but I always feel
there is something missing.

841
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,960
Grand Mentor Xiong is knowledgeable.

842
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,320
Why don’t I ask him for help?

843
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,320
See if he knows any capable people

844
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,680
who might know something about it.

845
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,080
Qingke, get me a brush and ink.

846
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,520
I want to write to Grand Mentor Xiong.

847
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,320
Coming.

848
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,600
Get someone to send it
to the capital as soon as possible.

849
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,680
Ask the messenger

850
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,200
to give it to Grand Mentor Xiong
in person.

851
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,160
Yes.

852
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,000
Baoning, time to eat.

853
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,280
Baoning?

854
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,840
What are you busy with?

855
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,800
Come on.

856
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,760
Have more.

857
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,400
After recuperating for so long,
you are still skinny.

858
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,960
Don’t be picky.

859
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,160
It’s bad for your health.

860
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,000
Try this.

861
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,280
Delicious and hot ribs.

862
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,280
Try it.

863
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,240
Is it unappetizing?

864
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,560
What are you thinking about?

865
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,240
Do you have any good weapon designers
in your camp?

866
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,320
Weapon designers?

867
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,520
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

868
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,720
I would like to borrow a few
if you have.
