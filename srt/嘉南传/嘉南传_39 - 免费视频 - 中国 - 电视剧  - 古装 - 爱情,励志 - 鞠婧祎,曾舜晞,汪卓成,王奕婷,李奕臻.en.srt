Lord Cao.

28
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:00,960
Hmm?

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,400
I have one more thing
to discuss with you.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,680
Lord Xin, please feel free

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,040
to say it.

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,560
The Grand Empress Dowager’s spirit tablet
will enter the Ancestral Hall tomorrow.

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,160
I wonder if you could

34
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,240
put Wei Shu on guard

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
at the hall?

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Why?

37
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
Baoning has a grievance against me.

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,200
She doesn’t want to see me.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,920
I won’t show up tomorrow to annoy her.

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,600
But the Grand Empress Dowager’s death

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,800
was a shock for her.

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
She even passed out because of it.

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,040
If Wei Shu can stay by her side,

44
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,240
then I can rest assured.

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,875
Sure.

46
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,000
But I hope

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,960
you won’t tell
the Township Mistress about this.

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,880
After all, they are best friends.

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,200
If she knows it,

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,520
I’m worried it will irritate her again.

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,200
You have a point.

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,320
I promise you.

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,800
Thank you a lot.

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Tomorrow you will be
at Lord Cao’s command.

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,680
You must protect the Princess well.

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,840
Rest assured, my lord.

57
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,440
- Come on.
- Come on.

58
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:08,850
(Qinzheng Hall)

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
The Grand Empress Dowager
died with anger because of Lord Xin?

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,120
That’s right.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,280
Princess Jia’nan has found out.

62
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,960
Grief took a toll on her health.

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
She couldn’t come here
to ask Your Majesty for justice.

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,640
That’s why she asked me to come

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,160
and beg Your Majesty

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
to order Li Qian’s arrest.

67
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,960
But why would Lord Xin
offend the Grand Empress Dowager?

68
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,120
Princess Jia’nan had broken up
with Lord Xin a long time ago.

69
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,000
She didn’t want
the Grand Empress Dowager to worry,

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,440
so their marriage remained in name only.

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,440
The Grand Empress Dowager
learned about it,

72
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,920
and questioned Li Qian
at Shoukang Palace.

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,480
Unexpectedly, Li Qian was offensive

74
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,400
and irritated the Grand Empress Dowager

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,160
who died of shortness of breath
in the end.

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,480
That’s outrageous.

77
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,160
I’ll issue an order now
to arrest Li Qian.

78
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,160
Your Majesty.

79
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,280
This matter is too important.

80
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,080
Li Qian has a lot of power

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,960
and great prestige at court now.

82
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,960
It needs to be settled secretly

83
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
in case Li Qian would hear the news

84
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,520
and flee.

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,839
Your Majesty, please issue an edict

86
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,360
and I’ll have Li Qian arrested tonight.

87
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,960
Okay.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,700
(Li’s Mansion)

89
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,760
The gilding ball has broken.

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,280
It’s over between us.

91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,640
We will be strangers when we meet again.

92
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,640
Who are you?

93
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,320
Get down.

94
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,360
(Learning to be Good is Difficult)

95
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,680
Li Qian, the offender,
come out to receive the edict.

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,120
Li Qian, the offender,
come out to receive the edict!

97
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,440
Li Qian, the offender,

98
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,320
come out to receive the edict!

99
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,890
What am I guilty of?

100
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,850
Kneel to receive the edict now.

101
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,800
Lord Xin, Li Qian,
murdered the Grand Empress Dowager.

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,160
He committed a towering crime.

103
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,000
As appealed by Princess Jia’nan,

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,240
I hereby order Marquis Jinghai,
Zhao Xiao, to arrest him.

105
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Respect this.

106
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,880
Did Baoning request

107
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,400
the imperial edict?

108
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,800
Take him down.

109
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,880
Li Qian.

110
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,440
Which one

111
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,720
do you prefer among these tools?

112
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,360
We’ve known each other for some time.

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,880
I’ll use the one you like best.

114
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,320
Well, am I a good friend?

115
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,120
It wasn’t Baoning
who requested that imperial edict.

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,520
I’m correct, right?

117
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,680
Didn’t you hear

118
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,600
what the edict said?

119
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,560
I don’t know what you did.

120
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,360
But if it was Baoning

121
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,400
who requested the edict
to get back at me,

122
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,080
she doesn’t have to wait until today.

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,960
The wound ruptured so easily.

124
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
I guess Baoning

125
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,480
did it to you.

126
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,360
Didn’t Baoning go to Qingshan Camp
that day

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
to break up with you?

128
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,160
Since you broke up,

129
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,125
what difference does it make

130
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,920
whether she requested the edict or not?

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
Of course there is a difference.

132
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,600
Even Baoning misunderstood me,

133
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,240
if she didn’t request an imperial edict
to get back at me,

134
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,280
it means she still cares about me,

135
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,800
and only me.

136
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,320
Well, Li Qian.

137
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,240
You’ve been a smart guy.

138
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,320
Now you are at death’s door

139
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,280
and you start to lie to yourself.

140
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,679
Fine.

141
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,720
I’ll be honest with you.

142
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,480
Baoning

143
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,600
not only requested the edict,

144
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,720
she also repeated to me

145
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,240
that she will never forget to avenge
the Grand Empress Dowager’s death.

146
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,400
She will never see you again.

147
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
She also asked me to exile you

148
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
to the farthest and coldest place

149
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,800
to suffer for the rest of your life.

150
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Don’t waste your time.

151
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,240
I’m not gonna believe a word you said.

152
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,520
Good.

153
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,560
Your Grace, if you still
care about Lord Xin,

154
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,240
why don’t you give him a chance?

155
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,160
Early tomorrow morning,

156
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,440
the Grand Empress Dowager’s spirit tablet
will enter the Ancestral Hall.

157
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,040
Rest early, Your Grace.

158
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,640
Right.

159
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,320
I need to get Grandmother back properly.

160
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,600
I didn’t expect Miss Gao
to be so skillful

161
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,520
at making incense.

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,400
The soothing incense
you made

163
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,400
really cheers me up lately.

164
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,200
I’m flattered, Your Highness.

165
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,440
Report.

166
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,040
Your Highness, something happened.

167
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,760
Lord Xin was put in the Celestial Prison
by Marquis Jinghai

168
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,640
and heavily tortured.

169
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,920
Forgive me, Your Highness.

170
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,080
Never mind.

171
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,960
God is helping me.

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,280
Li Qian is imprisoned at this time.

173
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,520
No one will dare
to question me tomorrow.

174
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,440
You can leave. Good job.

175
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,760
Go to receive your reward.

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

177
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,240
Baihe.

178
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,640
Is everything arranged for tomorrow?

179
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,600
I’m looking forward to a good show.

180
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,680
Your Highness, rest assured.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,680
Your Highness.

182
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
All you need is a good rest now.

183
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,920
It will succeed tomorrow.

184
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
I’m gonna leave first

185
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,640
and let Your Highness rest.

186
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,880
Go ahead.

187
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,480
Make it quick.

188
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,120
Qian.

189
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,760
Qian.

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Qian.

191
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
Are you all right?

192
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,600
Qian.

193
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,920
Baoning.

194
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,920
Baoning.

195
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Qian.

196
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,720
Baoning.

197
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,480
- It’s me.
- Baoning.

198
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,320
Why are you here?

199
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,800
I was on duty at Cining Palace

200
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,920
and heard you were imprisoned and hurt.

201
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,200
I hurried here

202
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,520
before Han Tongxin’s informer
comes back.

203
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,800
There isn’t much time to talk.

204
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,800
Take the medicine first.

205
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Miaorong.

206
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,840
I need you to do me a favor.

207
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,680
I need to talk to Baoning.

208
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:27,080
Qian.

209
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,760
I know what you want to say to her.

210
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,080
But now you are the only one

211
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,075
who can prove that you are innocent.

212
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,000
Listen to me.

213
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
Be good.

214
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,560
Take the medicine first.

215
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,040
Keep yourself alive, all right?

216
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,200
I’ll try to find a chance

217
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,720
to talk to her tomorrow.

218
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,480
Han Tongxin’s informer
will be back soon.

219
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,560
I must leave now.

220
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,760
Qian.

221
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,560
Miaorong.

222
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,240
Thank you.

223
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Qian.

224
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,000
Take care.

225
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,080
Zhao Zhong! Zhao Zhong!

226
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,040
Yes.

227
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,640
Your Highness.

228
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,640
I’m still worried.

229
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
A long delay may cause trouble.

230
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,200
Exile Li Qian tonight.

231
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,320
Don’t let anyone treat him on the way.

232
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
Why don’t you...?

233
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,120
Li Qian can’t die in my hands.

234
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,400
If Baoning finds out,

235
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,480
there won’t be any chance between us.

236
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,680
I’ll do it cleanly.

237
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,840
The Princess won’t find out.

238
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,160
Don’t make your own decisions.

239
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,920
I won’t allow any risk

240
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,840
as long as it’s about Baoning.

241
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Yes, Your Highness.

242
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,000
Wake up.

243
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,000
We’re here to get a prisoner.

244
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,320
Yes.

245
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,200
Go.

246
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
An order was made

247
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,840
that Li from Bingzhou
shall be exiled tonight.

248
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,280
Sorry about it.

249
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,640
Come on.

250
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,920
Go.

251
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,760
(Respect and Virtue)
Saint Grand Empress Dowager

252
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,000
passed away on April 13th,
the seventh year of Shengzhen.

253
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,720
Saint Grand Empress Dowager

254
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,520
(Grand Empress Dowager’s Spirit Tablet)
Shoukang and Zhangqing’s

255
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,440
holy remains have been
moved into the mausoleum.

256
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,520
Today the spirit tablet will enter
the royal ancestral hall.

257
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,880
Kowtow.

258
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,200
Rise.

259
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,560
Kowtow again.

260
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,200
Up.

261
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,960
Kowtow again.

262
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,880
Up.

263
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:00,650
Ceremony Completed. Rise.

264
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,960
Saint Empress Dowager’s calligraphy
is powerful and graceful.

265
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,319
We should select one of her works
and put it into the ancestral hall

266
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,520
to nourish later generations.

267
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,280
That would be great.

268
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,480
Present it.

269
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,800
I’m familiar with
Grandmother’s calligraphy.

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,080
Can I choose it?

271
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,720
I also want to see
the works of the Grand Empress Dowager.

272
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Why don’t we start with this one?

273
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,040
This is...

274
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
A testamentary edict?

275
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,480
Her Highness granted
Princess Jia’nan and Lord Xin a divorce?

276
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:54,550
Well...

277
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,440
It’s the testamentary edict
of the Grand Empress Dowager

278
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,360
written on paper.

279
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,920
As her descendants,
we shouldn’t disobey her.

280
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
The spirit tablet is about
to enter the ancestral hall.

281
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
We should fulfill her last wish
as soon as possible.

282
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,280
May Your Majesty make an order now?

283
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,000
Mother.

284
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,560
This is too sudden.

285
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Let’s discuss it later.

286
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,410
Mr. Wang.

287
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,080
Well...

288
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,320
How should we deal with this matter
under the law?

289
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,240
This is supposed to be
the Princess’s family affair.

290
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,000
We should not interfere.

291
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,640
But if the Grand Empress Dowager
left a testamentary edict,

292
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
it becomes a political affair then.

293
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,440
It should be discussed in court.

294
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,920
There are laws in a country
and rules in a family.

295
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,680
If the testamentary edict
cannot be carried out,

296
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,520
what should the officials act on?

297
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,360
And what should they honor?

298
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,560
We follow the imperial orders.

299
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
It’s still Aunt’s family affair.

300
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,240
What do you think, Aunt?

301
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,840
Princess Jia’nan is a heroine,
the Guardian of Mu’an.

302
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,640
She is sensible indeed.

303
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,800
She won’t make it difficult
for His Majesty,

304
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,160
right?

305
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,120
The laws and regulations
are the foundation of a country.

306
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,720
I’m willing to comply,

307
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,800
but only when

308
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,120
the testamentary edict is real.

309
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,280
Qingke.

310
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,560
What do you mean by that,
Princess Jia’nan?

311
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,280
I’m not lucky enough to see

312
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,560
the Grand Empress Dowager’s
works many times.

313
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,760
But this testamentary edict
was written by Her Highness.

314
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,560
If you don’t believe it,

315
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,240
you can compare it with other originals.

316
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,040
That won’t be necessary.

317
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,400
It was Grandmother’s handwriting.

318
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,720
Aunt...

319
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,320
I would like to know

320
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,200
if Your Highness has seen
this edict before.

321
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,320
What do you mean by that?

322
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,560
Just like you,

323
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,760
it’s also my first time
to see this edict today.

324
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,680
You did a good job
copying Grandmother’s handwriting.

325
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,200
But you overlooked one thing.

326
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,280
Stewardess Meng, smell it.

327
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,760
What does this fragrance have in common

328
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,760
with the fragrance
in Grandmother’s palace?

329
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,160
Your Grace.

330
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,960
I’m familiar with the incense
in the Palace.

331
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,720
This handkerchief is my personal stuff.

332
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,080
I’ve been staying in Shoukang Palace

333
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
and am lucky
to get some fragrance there.

334
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,200
We can compare it with my handkerchief.

335
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,800
The fragrance of these two is similar,

336
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,480
but there’s something else

337
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,080
different from
what the Grand Empress Dowager used.

338
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,300
Your Majesty.

339
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,600
Stewardess Meng is totally right.

340
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,520
So what?

341
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,200
What does it have anything
to do with me?

342
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,850
This is the ancestral hall.

343
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,075
Please watch your tongue,
Princess Jia’nan.

344
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,440
Don’t defame me.

345
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,320
That would be disrespectful.

346
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,600
We can summon the Chief Physician

347
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,160
on duty in the Imperial Hospital,

348
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,520
then we will know
what it has to do with you.

349
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,680
Summon him.

350
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,600
Summon the Chief Physician on duty
in the Imperial Hospital.

351
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,360
Greetings to Your Majesty,

352
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,200
Your Highness,

353
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,240
and Princess Jia’nan.

354
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,840
The three of us are Chief Physicians
on duty in the Imperial Hospital.

355
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,360
We are in charge of the herbs
and incenses in the Palace.

356
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,800
This handkerchief has the smell
of the most common soothing incense.

357
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,360
The scroll has the smell
of ambergris in addition.

358
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
Ambergris is extremely valuable.

359
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,160
Not everyone can get it.

360
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,280
Present the recent application records.

361
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,560
Cining Palace

362
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,960
applied for ambergris
and other soothing incense

363
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,640
one week ago according to the records.

364
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,280
How do you explain that?

365
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,800
Baihe.

366
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,680
Why don’t I remember

367
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,600
we applied for any ambergris?

368
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,240
Your Highness, we didn’t.

369
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,240
I see.

370
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,840
Who was on duty that day?

371
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,280
Well...

372
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,680
Looks like it’s you in the middle.

373
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,520
Mercy, Your Majesty.

374
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,640
Mercy, Your Grace.

375
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,120
It was me who gave out the ambergris.

376
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,160
Then tell us

377
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,240
which palace’s servant
picked it up that day.

378
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,480
I’m here. Tell the truth.

379
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,920
If you lie,

380
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,400
I’ll punish you
for deceiving the emperor.

381
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,360
It’s Miss Gao from Cining Palace.

382
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,640
Think again.

383
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,480
Don’t slander us.

384
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
Your Highness, don’t be mad.

385
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,080
Let him finish. His Majesty will decide.

386
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,840
Are you sure it was her who you saw?

387
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,520
I was impressed by her.

388
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,920
There is no way to make a mistake.

389
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,480
I was hesitating

390
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,600
if she could take the ambergris
without an imperial order.

391
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,360
But Miss Gao was unruly and fierce.

392
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
She threw a temper

393
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,200
and threatened me
with Empress Dowager.

394
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,080
I didn’t know what to do.

395
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,040
I thought she was close to Her Highness,

396
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,440
it shouldn’t be fake.

397
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,520
So I gave it to her.

398
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,640
I never did such a thing.

399
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,120
Besides, you can’t plant it on me

400
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,640
just by the nonsense

401
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,840
made up by this little Chief Physician.

402
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,720
Well...

403
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,160
I think I’ve been abiding by the law
and behaving myself.

404
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,040
Why does Princess Jia’nan
have to push me?

405
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,200
You just wouldn’t admit it
until I lay bare what you did.

406
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,240
Fine. Just be patient.

407
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,360
Search it!

408
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,720
Your Majesty, Your Grace.

409
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,520
We found it in Cining Palace.

410
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,800
Jiang Baoning.

411
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,200
How dare you send people
to search my Cining Palace?

412
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,000
This is... the seal
of the Grand Empress Dowager?

413
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,800
There’s all the evidence.

414
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,400
What else can you explain?

415
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,200
It’s Gao Miaorong.

416
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,440
Send the Empress Dowager
back to Cining Palace

417
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,200
to wait for the sentence.

418
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

419
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
And you must find Gao Miaorong.

420
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,280
Guards!

421
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,920
Xiaoman.

422
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
Have you found Gao Miaorong?

423
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,840
Your Grace.

424
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,360
I’ve sent people to search for her,

425
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,520
but we didn’t find her.

426
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,200
I’m afraid she has escaped.

427
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,300
Mm-hmm.

428
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,120
Ah.

429
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,400
Miss. Young Master.

430
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,880
We’re finally out of the capital.

431
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,360
From now on, we will travel around

432
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,440
and live a free life.

433
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,760
Miaorong.

434
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
I’ve been waiting for this day
for so long.

435
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,920
Now there is no reason

436
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,960
not to marry me.

437
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,120
Lin.

438
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,120
I’ve also been looking forward
to this day.

439
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,480
After we find a quiet place
to settle down,

440
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,560
let’s...

441
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,520
Let’s get married.

442
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,760
But...

443
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
What’s wrong, Lin?

444
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,600
We need to live under aliases

445
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,920
and keep a low profile.

446
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,040
The big wedding I promised you

447
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,720
is impossible.

448
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,360
I don’t care about those things.

449
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,640
I’ll be content as long as I can

450
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,960
spend the rest of my life with you.

451
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,720
Okay.

452
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,440
Have you taken care of things
in the capital?

453
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,720
I left Jiang Baoning a note
before I left.

454
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,800
Thanks to her,

455
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,920
we’re able to make it out this time.

456
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,240
Well, courtesy calls for reciprocity.

457
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,560
(Saint Grand Empress Dowager
Shoukang and Zhangqing’s Spirit Tablet)

458
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,450
Grandmother.

459
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,120
Baoning is here to take you home.

460
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,960
Your Grace, there is one more thing.

461
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,560
This is the note left by Miss Gao
before she left.

462
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,200
An order was made last night

463
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,560
to put Li Qian in jail.

464
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,880
But the death
of the Grand Empress Dowager

465
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,520
was caused by long-term use
of the health-nurturing drug.

466
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,520
Li Qian has nothing to do with it.

467
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
I’m leaving and moving on.

468
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
I’ve found my happiness.

469
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,640
May you leave no regrets.

470
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,920
Your Grace, are you all right?

471
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,200
Your Majesty. Have some tea.

472
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,720
Take a break, please.

473
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,360
Lord Min.

474
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,400
Do you think I did it
in too much of a hurry?

475
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,000
Lord Xin rendered great service
defending our country.

476
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,520
He’s been loyal these years.

477
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
I made an order to put him in jail

478
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,360
without seeing any evidence.

479
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,120
I dare not to make comments
on political affairs.

480
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,080
But this is between Princess Jia’nan
and her husband.

481
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Your Majesty should be prudent.

482
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,320
After all, even an upright official
finds it hard to settle family troubles.

483
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,960
And the whole fake edict thing today.

484
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,000
I’m embattled now.

485
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,600
Princess Jia’nan has arrived.

486
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,280
Aunt, what happened?

487
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,720
Your Majesty, did you order
Li Qian to be put in Celestial Prison?

488
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,080
Didn’t you request an imperial edict

489
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,240
to arrest Lord Xin
for Grand Empress Dowager’s death?

490
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,280
I requested an edict?

491
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,960
How bold is Marquis Jinghai!

492
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,600
He requested the edict in your name
to meet his personal goal.

493
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,320
Well, Zhao Xiao.

494
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,040
And you, Your Majesty.

495
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,600
How could you believe him so easily?

496
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,950
If I want to request an edict,

497
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,325
why would I do it through him?

498
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:06,950
Don’t be angry, Aunt.
It was my negligence.

499
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,920
Oh, no.

500
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,280
I got a message from Marquis Jinghai
this morning

501
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,680
that Lord Xin was exiled

502
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,440
last night.

503
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,160
What?

504
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,400
Your Majesty, issue an order now
to recall him.

505
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,680
I’ll do it now.

506
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,320
I guess they haven’t gone far away yet.

507
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,920
After Lord Xin comes back,

508
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,280
I’ll make amends to him in person.

509
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,680
Li Qian, you must stay safe.

510
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,650
(Withdraw the exile)

511
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,040
Min Zhou.

512
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,760
Summon Marquis Jinghai.

513
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,480
I’m gonna punish him hard.

514
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,560
Hold on.

515
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,440
Your Majesty.

516
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,360
Nanmin is flourishing
and Jinxi is prosperous.

517
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,560
They are two areas
of strategic priority for Mu’an.

518
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,275
If it gets out
that the two commanders are at odds,

519
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:11,925
it will damage the national reputation.

520
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,160
Not to mention Yongqing State
is eyeing us covetously.

521
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,360
Let’s not make a big deal out of it.

522
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Leave this matter to me.

523
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,480
All right, I’ll listen to Aunt.

524
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,240
There is one more thing that bothers me.

525
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,850
The Empress Dowager forged the edict.

526
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,150
She should be sentenced to death
according to the law.

527
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,360
But it would make me a callous man,

528
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,600
and hurt the feelings
of the royal family members.

529
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,000
But the officials saw it in public.

530
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,375
If she is lightly punished,

531
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,775
it’s not enough
to set the record straight.

532
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,720
If I make an exception for her,
it’ll lead to endless trouble.

533
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,760
Your Majesty is merciful.

534
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
In that case,

535
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,275
then imprison the Empress Dowager

536
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,850
on Longevity Hill
for the rest of her life.

537
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,800
It’s a royal residence.

538
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,600
The life there won’t be too bad.

539
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,920
She can repent there.

540
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,320
In this way,

541
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,520
you can convince the officials in public

542
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,840
without

543
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,520
losing the grace of Your Majesty
in private.

544
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,680
Thanks to your advice, Aunt.

545
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,240
You came to my rescue.

546
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,720
If there is nothing else,

547
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,200
I’ll be on my way to see Zhao Xiao.

548
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,720
Thank you, Aunt.

549
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,600
Mm-hmm.

550
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,480
Empress Dowager Xiaoci, Han,

551
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,320
deceived the emperor

552
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,400
and forged a testamentary edict
of the Grand Empress Dowager.

553
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,920
She committed an unforgivable sin.

554
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,400
For the sake of kinship,

555
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,880
her title is removed and honor canceled.

556
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,960
She will receive a salary
as the servants

557
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,120
and be held on Longevity Hill.

558
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,440
She shall not leave without an order.

559
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,840
Your Highness.

560
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,480
Your Highness.

561
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,520
When did I ask you to arrest Li Qian?

562
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,240
Zhao Xiao, do you know

563
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,720
the crime of deceiving the emperor
is enough to get you killed?

564
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,080
The facts are clear.

565
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,760
Li Qian is the culprit.

566
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,360
Since you are in a dilemma,

567
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,800
I just made the decision for you.

568
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,560
It was for your good.

569
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,800
This is between me and Li Qian.

570
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,040
Don’t bother.

571
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,880
I’m here to tell you

572
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,680
that I’ll let you go this time

573
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,800
in the interest of the country

574
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,560
and for the sake of Nanmin.

575
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,240
If you do it again,

576
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,840
you won’t get away with it.

577
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,280
Baoning!

578
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,160
These are the late emperor’s belongings.

579
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,680
Take them with us.

580
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,440
I can have some reminders at least.

581
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,160
Yes.

582
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,840
The Lyuqi Zither?

583
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,679
Wasn’t the Lyuqi Zither broken?

584
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,400
Why is it here?

585
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,280
I think it has always been here.

586
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,400
You ordered me to empty this room

587
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,960
and put all the stuff
of the late emperor here.

588
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,239
The servants were not allowed
to touch them.

589
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,800
Nothing in this room

590
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,600
has been counted since.

591
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,679
I really liked this zither back then.

592
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,440
I found a lot of skilled craftsmen
to fix it.

593
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,199
But they all failed.

594
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,700
Later,

595
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,775
I have no idea where it was.

596
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,880
Are you saying that

597
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,239
the late emperor had been keeping it?

598
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,760
Wait a moment, Your Highness.

599
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,480
I’ll get the eunuch on duty.

600
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,679
We’ll know after we ask him.

601
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,880
Go ahead.

602
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,750
Mm-hmm.

603
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,680
Your Highness.

604
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,800
Your Highness.

605
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,800
This is Eunuch Chen.

606
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,720
He’s been taking inventory
of the late emperor’s old things,

607
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,680
sending them over,

608
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,920
and attending to them.

609
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,240
Let me ask you.

610
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,425
Does this Lyuqi Zither

611
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,025
belong to the late emperor?

612
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,080
Yes.

613
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,760
Your Highness.

614
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,875
I had the honor of serving
the late emperor.

615
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,880
A few years ago,

616
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,920
the late emperor asked
a master of instruments

617
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,840
to repair this broken zither.

618
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,360
But the material was rare

619
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,880
and it took many years.

620
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,480
When it was sent back,
the late emperor had passed away.

621
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,700
So I put it among other stuff

622
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:42,825
and brought them together.

623
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,360
Do you know

624
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
why the late emperor
would repair the old zither?

625
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,640
Sorry, I don’t.

626
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Do you think

627
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,080
for a moment

628
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,120
he did care about me?

629
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,400
A day together as husband and wife
establishes timeless affections.

630
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Your Highness and the late emperor
spent years together.

631
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,200
A man is not like grass.
He has feelings.

632
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,480
Unfortunately, Yi is no longer here.

633
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,600
No one can answer my question.

634
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,840
I guess it’s the punishment
for what I did.

635
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
Yi.

636
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,120
I’ve been going against Jiang Baoning
for most of my life.

637
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,480
And I lost in the end.

638
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,960
I’m tired.

639
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,520
I just want to stay with you

640
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,320
and watch over you

641
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,640
for the rest of my life.

642
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,720
All right?

643
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,900
Mother.

644
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,960
What are you doing
with all these dirty clothes?

645
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,840
I’m going to the river
to wash them for you.

646
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,160
Give them to me.

647
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,280
You’re just getting better.

648
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,680
You can’t get tired.

649
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,525
I’m used to doing it.

650
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:18,575
I won’t be tired.

651
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,200
I’ve owed you too much over these years.

652
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,120
I won’t feel good

653
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,880
unless I do something for you.

654
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,840
Mother.

655
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,840
Go to stay with Dongdong.

656
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,480
She did so much for you.

657
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,240
You must return the favor.

658
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,880
I’m leaving.

659
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
Take care, Mother.

660
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
There are no parents
who don’t love their children.

661
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,480
You meet again after a long separation.

662
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,720
Your mother must want
to make amends to you

663
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,560
for what she didn’t give you.

664
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,120
Qing An.

665
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,080
You must be good to your mother.

666
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,480
I think it has been too hard for her.

667
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:31,875
Mm-hmm.

668
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:33,125
Mm-hmm.

669
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,120
Dongdong.

670
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,700
Hmm?

671
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,960
Are you willing

672
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,400
to take care of my mother with me?

673
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,560
You fool.

674
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,960
What do you think?

675
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,360
Dongdong.

676
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,275
Hmm?

677
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,400
That’s very kind of you.

678
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,280
Alright.

679
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,040
Let’s go to the river to see Aunt Qin.

680
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:04,625
Um.

681
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,840
Mother!

682
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,080
Qing An.

683
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,125
Hmm?

684
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,440
Keep running.

685
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,160
Why do you stop?

686
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,280
You are really lucky

687
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,800
to have lived so many more years.

688
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Today is the day you die!

689
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Mother!

690
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,320
Mother!

691
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,200
Mother!

692
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:38,960
Mother...

693
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,680
Are you all right?

694
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,800
Mother.

695
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,360
I’m sorry.

696
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,080
It’s my fault.

697
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,840
I’m late.

698
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,520
I’m fine.

699
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,680
Don’t worry, An.

700
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,200
Mother.

701
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,240
I’m already content

702
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,000
to see you again.

703
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,320
I’m here.

704
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,520
I’ll always be here for you.

705
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:36,975
(Tomb of Zhang Yuqing)

706
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,640
Dongzhi.

707
00:45:10,725 --> 00:45:11,360
Hmm?

708
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,440
I’m going back.

709
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,725
Back to Yongqing?

710
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,480
Yes.

711
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,560
I’ve ordered the Dark Force
to gather at Yunyang.

712
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,240
I’ll go with you.

713
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,600
Dongzhi.

714
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,280
I don’t want you to take risks for me.

715
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,640
If you were me,

716
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,800
how would you choose?

717
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,400
No matter how dangerous it is,

718
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,280
I will fight along with you
with my life.

719
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,480
So do I.

720
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,400
But there’s one more thing to do
before we leave.

721
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,360
What is it?

722
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,520
The Li Village.

723
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,760
It concerns my brother
and Baoning’s marriage.

724
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,560
I hope they don’t miss out
on each other.

725
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,000
Old man.

726
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,560
Stop resisting.

727
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,120
I’m just asking you
to make some hidden weapons

728
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,000
in the walls for better protection.

729
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,320
There’s no need to make it so hard.

730
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,560
Don’t be so violent.

731
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,640
This man in front of you

732
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,200
is the best master of weapons

733
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,440
in Yongqing, even in the whole world.

734
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,560
Be respectful.

735
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,120
Don’t waste your breath.

736
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,640
Just kill me

737
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,400
or do whatever you want.

738
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,000
I think you’re pretty lonely here
by yourself.

739
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,560
Well,

740
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
shall I invite your old friends

741
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,120
in Yongqing to this place

742
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,040
so that you guys can be united?

743
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,760
Maybe it’ll make you feel better.

744
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,200
Qing Tai!

745
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,320
Don’t go too far.

746
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,080
That’s why

747
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,280
one must be sensible.

748
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,240
These things

749
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,840
are really easy for you.

750
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,760
I feel unworthy

751
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,920
to implicate your old friends
for such trifles.

752
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,600
Just make the hidden weapons for me.

753
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,360
I will

754
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,200
take good care of you

755
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,040
and I won’t bother your old friends.

756
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,480
You are sinful.

757
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,080
You will get retribution one day.

758
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,920
I advise you to start soon.

759
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,160
If you delay on purpose again,

760
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,240
I will kill everyone you know.

761
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,080
I will deal with my sins.

762
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,400
Don’t worry about it.

763
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,150
Your Majesty.

764
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,750
We found the Book of Supreme Weapons.

765
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,250
Mm-hmm.

766
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,360
I advise you not to waste any time.

767
00:48:37,675 --> 00:48:38,920
I’m impatient.

768
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,680
You know it.

769
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,040
Your Majesty.

770
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,800
According to our scout,

771
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,200
the Book of Supreme Weapons
is most likely

772
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,160
in the hands of Princess Jiang Baoning,
the Guardian of Mu’an.

773
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,520
Jiang Baoning?

774
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,040
Looks like it’s time for a trip
to the capital of Mu’an.

775
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:15,275
(Qinzheng Hall)

776
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,280
The Grand Empress Dowager
died with anger because of Lord Xin?

777
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:25,080
That’s right.

778
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,320
Princess Jia’nan has found out.

779
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,720
Grief took a toll on her health.

780
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,080
She couldn’t come here
to ask Your Majesty for justice.

781
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,400
That’s why she asked me to come

782
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,120
and beg Your Majesty

783
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,720
to order Li Qian’s arrest.

784
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,280
What is Marquis Jinghai up to?

785
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,720
Your Majesty.

786
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,440
It’s getting late.

787
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,400
Maybe you should rest early.

788
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,400
Get Lord Cao here.

789
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,520
Right now?

790
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,920
Yes.

791
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,480
Greetings to Your Majesty.

792
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,480
Rise.

793
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,880
Are you and your wife

794
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,200
close to Princess Jia’nan and Lord Xin?

795
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,400
Your Majesty.

796
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,600
Yes.

797
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,520
My wife, Township Mistress Qinghui,

798
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,400
grew up together with Princess Jia’nan.

799
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,880
I also get along well with Lord Xin.

800
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,040
Lord Cao.

801
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,080
I need you to do me a favor.

802
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,600
At your service, Your Majesty.

803
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,840
Lord Xin was exiled for some reason,

804
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,040
there is something strange.

805
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,800
I have ordered to get Lord Xin
back to the capital.

806
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,200
Just in case, I’d like to ask you

807
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,160
to join Marquis Jinghai’s men

808
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,000
to make sure Lord Xin gets back safely.

809
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

810
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,680
Your Grace.

811
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,760
What’s wrong, Your Grace?

812
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,520
I dreamed about Li Qian.

813
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,480
Your Grace.

814
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,280
Don’t worry too much about Lord Xin.

815
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,320
He’ll be back soon.

816
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,160
I also dreamed

817
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,760
that my father
slaughtered the Li Village.

818
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,800
But that’s just impossible.

819
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,000
My father was not that kind of person.

820
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,680
But the dream was so vivid.

821
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,000
What if...

822
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,760
It won’t be true.

823
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,960
It won’t, Your Grace.

824
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,960
It’s just a dream.

825
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,320
I have to find it out.

826
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,520
Oh, right. Your Grace.

827
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,120
I found this outside the window.

828
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,000
What’s the matter?

829
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,280
It’s a letter from Dongdong.

830
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,200
She said

831
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,240
they found Qing An’s birth mother

832
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,560
who has been living in the shelter
under the alias of Qin Yu.

833
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,160
She also said

834
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,320
she was a junior sister apprentice
of my father.

835
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,700
She said she was also there

836
00:52:22,975 --> 00:52:23,800
on the night of the slaughter.

837
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,280
She said that my father
didn’t slaughter the Li Village.

838
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,240
That’s great, Your Grace.

839
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,480
Mr. Jiang is proved innocent.

840
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,975
But

841
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:36,425
who killed the Li family?

842
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,480
Aunt Qin is dead.

843
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,240
There is no way to verify it.

844
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,280
Doesn’t it mean
we’re right back where we started?

845
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,320
Everything will work out.

846
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,560
In this way,

847
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,600
is that why you fell out?

848
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,360
This is very important to us.

849
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,680
I hope Your Majesty can help me.

850
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,240
I’m certainly willing to help.

851
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,480
But I don’t know
the Book of Supreme Weapons, either.

852
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,760
I deserve death.

853
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,920
Mercy, Your Grace.

854
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,600
What’s the matter with you?

855
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,800
Can’t you even hold a teacup?

856
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,920
Mercy, Your Majesty.

857
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,080
Mercy, Your Grace.

858
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,360
It’s fine.

859
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,560
It didn’t splash much on me.

860
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,920
We were talking about
the Book of Supreme Weapons.

861
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,040
It came to me

862
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,560
that there is an insider here.

863
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,000
That’s right.

864
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,720
I overlooked it.

865
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,000
Lord Min once served
the late Empress Dowager Cao.

866
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,560
Since the book was presented
by the late Empress Dowager,

867
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,720
Lord Min would know something about it.

868
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,520
Lord Min.

869
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,760
Where did the book come from?

870
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,200
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

871
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,075
It’s such a confidential matter.

872
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,350
I know nothing about it.

873
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,960
Recall carefully.

874
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,640
You will remember something.

875
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,640
Your Majesty, don’t make it hard
for Lord Min.

876
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,760
The late Empress Dowager
wasn’t a talkative person.

877
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,360
I’ll think of another way.

878
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,440
All right.

879
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,640
You can leave.

880
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,400
Excuse me.

881
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,240
Are you sure Min Zhou will come later?

882
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,240
I stole a glance at Lord Min’s rota.

883
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,560
It won’t be wrong.

884
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,280
Okay. Go ahead.

885
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,200
Be smart.

886
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,900
Yes.

887
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,120
All of you, gather around.

888
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:52,575
- Sir.
- Sir.

889
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,350
Sir.

890
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,160
The late Empress Dowager Cao once presented
the Book of Supreme Weapons.

891
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,825
It disappeared after the Treasure House
on Longevity Hill caught fire.

892
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,400
Any of you who can find this book

893
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,800
or provide a clue

894
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,520
will be rewarded handsomely.

895
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:04,800
Sir.

896
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,560
What’s that book about?

897
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,160
Yeah, what does it look like?

898
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,640
Which master in the Palace wants it?

899
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,720
Come on, let me tell you in detail.

900
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,520
Where would this book be?

901
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,600
Who knows?

902
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,600
If we can find this book,

903
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,160
then we will…

904
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,960
we’ll be better off.

905
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,600
We might even be promoted to stewards.

906
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,150
Exactly.

907
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,360
Lord Min.

908
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,680
Lord Min.

909
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,560
Have you finished
sweeping the courtyard?

910
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,800
Lord Min.

911
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,520
Please sit down.

912
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,520
Lord Min is giving us a lecture.

913
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,520
We are not afraid to be seen by others.

914
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,280
Right, right.

915
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:48,680
Please sit down.

916
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,525
Lord Min.

917
00:55:53,775 --> 00:55:55,680
Have some tea and rinse your mouth.

918
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,375
Lord Min.

919
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,040
We’re just curious.

920
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,440
It’s said that the late Empress Dowager
once presented

921
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,760
the Book of Supreme Weapons.

922
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,160
What is that about?

923
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,650
Right.

924
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,720
You had served
the late Empress Dowager for long.

925
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,500
Do you know something?

926
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,275
How do you know
about the Book of Supreme Weapons?

927
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,760
We also heard it from someone else.

928
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,520
Didn’t His Majesty

929
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,720
try to find it several times?

930
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,280
The Palace and Longevity Hill

931
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,280
have been turned inside out.

932
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,200
What does it have to do with you?

933
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,680
- Forgive us.
- Forgive us.

934
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,160
We just want

935
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,640
to find the book
and present it to His Majesty,

936
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,480
- then we don’t need to clean anymore.
- Yes, yes.

937
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,400
- Lord Min, pardon us.
- Lord Min.

938
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,440
- We’re sorry.
- Lord Min.

939
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,100
- I’m sorry.
- All right.

940
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:39,920
- All right.
- Forgive us.

941
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,700
Get up.

942
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:41,625
Yes.

943
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,160
Don’t mention
the Book of Supreme Weapons again.

944
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:50,960
Yes, yes.

945
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,560
It’s too complicated.

946
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:53,600
Yes.

947
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,080
You won’t be able to handle it.

948
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,800
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

949
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,800
Lord Min, you are right.

950
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,320
- We’ve learned our lesson.
- Just leave.

951
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,280
Let’s go.

952
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,520
Min Zhou must know something about it.

953
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,400
Let’s go.

954
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,200
He didn’t make any achievements
in seven years,

955
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,680
and he was promoted.
There must be something strange.

956
00:58:11,025 --> 00:58:15,275
(The Years of Wenxing)

957
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:17,975
(The 17th year of Wenxing Cao presented
the book and was made empress)

958
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,625
(The 17th year of Wenxing)

959
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,800
(Empress Cao made Min Zhou steward)
She was made empress,

960
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,160
and Min Zhou was made steward.

961
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,720
It happened at the same time.

962
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,560
How could it be such a coincidence?

963
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,040
Your Grace, someone is coming.

964
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,760
Your Grace, someone is coming.

965
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,400
Your Grace.

966
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:48,025
(Three Abodes of the East)

967
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Go and get Min Zhou here.

968
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,800
Are you gonna ask him
about the Book of Supreme Weapons?

969
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:54,640
Smart.

970
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,280
But Lord Min has been slick.

971
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,640
I’m afraid he won’t say anything.

972
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,640
I’ll count on you then.

973
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:06,250
Mm-hmm.

974
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,160
Hurry.

975
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,360
It’s uncomfortable to sit here.

976
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,440
Greetings to Your Grace.

977
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,100
Um.

978
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,960
I’d like to ask Lord Min

979
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,280
if you remembered anything

980
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,760
about the Book of Supreme Weapons.

981
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,760
I’m useless.

982
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,680
I can’t help Your Grace.

983
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,040
Lord Min, you were

984
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,120
the late Empress Dowager’s favorite.

985
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,200
You must have heard something.

986
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,760
I had the honor
of serving the late Empress Dowager.

987
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,880
I also heard about

988
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,120
the Book of Supreme Weapons.

989
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,360
But I’m lowly.

990
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,880
I really don’t know
the secret of this book.

991
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,160
- Xiaoman.
- Yes.

992
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,880
Bring a chair and some tea for Lord Min.

993
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,480
Yes.

994
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,120
Please, Lord Min.

995
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,000
Your Grace, this is...

996
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,920
Lord Min.

997
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,440
After all, you are old.

998
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,760
It’s understandable

999
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,320
that you can’t remember a lot.

1000
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,680
(Register in the Palace)
But it’s fine.

1001
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,040
(Register in the Palace)
I have plenty of time.

1002
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,280
Lord Min.

1003
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,960
Just sit right here today,

1004
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,640
have some tea and think things over.

1005
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,720
You can keep doing this
in the next few days.

1006
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,040
I will tell His Majesty about it.

1007
01:00:48,475 --> 01:00:49,440
Your Grace.

1008
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,160
Please let me go.

1009
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,760
I really don’t know.

1010
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,775
(Register in the Palace)

1011
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,760
Take a good look.

1012
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,975
In the first seven years in the Palace,

1013
01:01:04,975 --> 01:01:06,150
you made no achievement.

1014
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,440
In the 17th year of Wenxing,

1015
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,120
Empress Dowager Cao
presented the book and was made empress,

1016
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,320
and you were made steward.

1017
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,520
Now you are telling me

1018
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,600
you don’t know where the book came from.

1019
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,440
You think I’m a fool?

1020
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,160
Your Grace.

1021
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,680
I also think

1022
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,200
it was too much of a coincidence.

1023
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,400
All right.

1024
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,520
Let me tell you.

1025
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,400
The Book of Supreme Weapons

1026
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,960
was in the hands of a woman
in the Li Village.

1027
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,720
After the Yongqing people
slaughtered the village,

1028
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,200
Empress Dowager Cao got the book.

1029
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,840
There are only two possibilities.

1030
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,720
Either the book changed hands
many times,

1031
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,175
or

1032
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,375
she traded for it
with the Yongqing people.

1033
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,360
What did she offer

1034
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,960
that made the Yongqing people

1035
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,680
give away the treasure they got
by slaughtering the village?

1036
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,920
It’s scary to think about it.

1037
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:09,400
Hey.

1038
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,920
Colluding with the enemy
is a serious crime, right?

1039
01:02:12,175 --> 01:02:13,000
Mm-hmm.

1040
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:14,050
Hmm.

1041
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,960
What do you think, Lord Min?

1042
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:19,360
Your Grace.

1043
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,320
Your Grace.

1044
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,640
I dare not talk about

1045
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,520
my previous mistress.

1046
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,160
Lord Min, you are experienced indeed.

1047
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,520
You are disciplined.

1048
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,640
Zhang Yuqing.

1049
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,640
Does that name ring a bell?

1050
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,920
This person was the only one

1051
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,800
who survived that night.

1052
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,520
Fortunately,

1053
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,400
my sister-in-law Li Dongzhi
found her for me.

1054
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,560
They are on the way to the capital.

1055
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,120
Whether you say it or not,

1056
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,640
I’ll know it soon anyway.

1057
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,760
I’m not a patient person.

1058
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,680
If I know it from you,

1059
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,520
I will be less concerned about it.

1060
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,920
If I learn what you did
from someone else,

1061
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,640
I won’t let you get away with it.
