Shanhu.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,160
Your Grace.

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360
Have a seat.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,400
Qingke, serve tea.

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,520
What happened to you, Your Grace?

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Don’t mention it.

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,000
I’ve been developing new weapons

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
with some weapon designers these days.

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
I’m too busy to eat.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,280
But you want to see me in such a hurry.

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,760
Did anything go wrong
with the charity house?

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
Everything is fine in the charity house.

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,040
No need to worry about it,
Your Grace.

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,200
Three days later, the Villa Mingyue
run by Dong’s Trading House

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,960
in the west of the city
will officially open.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,240
You are the most distinguished guest
in Jinxi.

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,360
I wonder if I could ask you
for the honor of your presence.

44
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,480
What kind of business
is Villa Mingyue doing?

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,600
In addition to providing
accommodation and catering,

46
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,960
we also arranged
a lot of interesting events,

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,720
like storytelling, opera,

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,080
poems reciting and painting.

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,160
Exclusively for officials,
businessmen, and nobles

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,360
to enjoy and have fun
when they are bored

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,600
or on holiday.

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,480
Sounds interesting.

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:00,840
Okay.

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,440
I’ll be there three days later.

55
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:02,920
Okay.

56
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,480
Drink this.

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,560
Humanity

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
always disappoints you.

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,960
Those who tried
to benefit from the Li family

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,880
used to fawn over you

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,920
with smiles.

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
Only a few days later,

63
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,040
they don’t even mention about you

64
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,520
or talk about you anymore.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,520
Most people in the world
flatter the rich and despise the poor.

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,080
Before the Zhuang family was convicted,

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,560
everyone knows
that I’m close with Mrs. Zhuang.

68
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,840
Now they want nothing to do with me.

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,160
It’s human nature.

70
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,400
They are just a bunch of clowns.

71
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,280
We don’t need to care about them.

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,200
You are right, Miss.

73
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
The Dong family
is a group of profiteers.

74
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,120
We don’t need to get close to them.

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,520
What does this have anything
to do with the Dong family?

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Miss.

77
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,800
You don’t know it?

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,360
Villa Mingyue which was newly built
by the Dong family in the west of the city

79
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,280
will officially open three days later.

80
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Miss Dong invited

81
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
a lot of dignitaries,

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,800
including Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

83
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
Villa Mingyue?

84
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,800
This morning,

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,040
Miss Dong came in person
to send the invitation.

86
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,040
I heard that Her Grace
has agreed to come.

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,600
Miss, if you don’t want to go,

88
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,160
we can tell them you are sick.

89
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,760
It’s an interesting place.

90
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,440
Why not go there?

91
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,160
Guanju.

92
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,920
I need you to do something.

93
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,080
Villa Mingyue?

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
I think it has nothing to do with me.

95
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,280
It’s not our Li family’s business.

96
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,400
I don’t bother to be there.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
When Dong Shanhu

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,360
came to send the invitation,

99
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,200
she just passed me

100
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,880
and sent the invitation
to Princess Jia’nan.

101
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,400
I mean, considering the way she did it,

102
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,080
obviously she doesn’t respect me.

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Madam.

104
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Why are you angry

105
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,440
about such trifles?

106
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,840
She is a businessperson.

107
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,000
Interests first.

108
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,840
That’s why she must have
thought of Her Grace first.

109
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,800
I didn’t want to go first.

110
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,800
But I heard

111
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
that the Villa Mingyue
will open tomorrow,

112
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,600
and they invited
many influential people in Jinxi.

113
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,800
Madam.

114
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,120
You are Her Grace’s mother-in-law.

115
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,640
If you don’t go,

116
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,560
I’m afraid they will think
you are at odds.

117
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,040
What’s more...

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,080
Oh right,

119
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,400
I heard that the Dong family

120
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,920
spent a lot of money

121
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
to hire the famous Yongfu Troupe

122
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,720
for the opening
of Villa Mingyue tomorrow.

123
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,480
Don’t you really like the troupe leader,

124
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
Cheng Xiaoyun?

125
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Why don’t we take this chance
to enjoy some opera

126
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,560
and please our ears?

127
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,840
Are you sure
Cheng Xiaoyun will be there?

128
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
Yes.

129
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,840
The Dong family is rich and powerful.

130
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,080
Sure they will invite him to come.

131
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,760
Okay.

132
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,040
I’ll go.

133
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,680
Okay.

134
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,400
(Villa Mingyue)

135
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,440
Why is she so sleepy?

136
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
In order to develop new weapons,
Her Grace has been

137
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,280
amending the drawings
with the weapon designers day and night.

138
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,440
She sleeps less than six hours a day.

139
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I think she is too tired.

140
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,480
Why don’t I send you home first?

141
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,040
No.

142
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
Everyone is here.

143
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,920
If I leave early,
they will talk about it.

144
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,840
There is still some time
before the banquet starts.

145
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
Look at you.

146
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
You are too sleepy.

147
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,360
Qingke.

148
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,240
Ask Miss Dong to come over.

149
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,680
Is Her Grace uncomfortable?

150
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,640
I’ll ask someone to get a physician.

151
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,680
You are busy today.
I won’t cause you trouble.

152
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,480
Miss Dong, I wonder

153
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,480
if there is a guest room

154
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,840
where Baoning can take a rest?

155
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,480
This is easy.

156
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,560
There is no shortage of guest rooms
at Villa Mingyue.

157
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,400
Lian’er, Zhu’er.

158
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,960
Take Her Grace to Room 1 for a rest.

159
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,400
Hurry.

160
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,040
Yes.

161
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,040
Thank you.

162
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,400
Your Grace.

163
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,800
Room 1

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,160
is the best guest room in Villa Mingyue.

165
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,520
Miss Dong sent me and Zhu’er

166
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,560
to serve you.

167
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,240
Your Grace, please.

168
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,440
How dare you

169
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,680
bump into the Princess!

170
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,360
I’m a handyman from Yongfu.

171
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,040
The mansion is too big.

172
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,960
I accidentally got lost

173
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,000
and bumped into
this distinguished guest.

174
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
Mercy, please.

175
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,320
Well...

176
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,160
Let him go.

177
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,840
Thanks! Thanks!

178
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,200
Your Grace, please.

179
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,800
Go to see the opera.

180
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
You don’t need to be here.

181
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,760
I’ll be where you are.

182
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,160
I don’t know

183
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,920
how long I will sleep.

184
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,280
The Yongfu Troupe

185
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,000
rarely comes to Jinxi.

186
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,040
If you miss it,

187
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,840
no one knows
when you can see it next time.

188
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,600
They are staying outside.
What are you worried about?

189
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
Just go.

190
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,560
Yes.

191
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Let me know if anything happens.

192
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,600
Yes.

193
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,240
Li.

194
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,840
Did you really

195
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,400
go to the Daxiangguo Temple to pray?

196
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,520
How is it possible?

197
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,840
What a pity.

198
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
A relative of mine

199
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,360
went to pray at the Daxiangguo Temple
on the day of the temple fair.

200
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
Next day,

201
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,200
there was good news
that his wife was pregnant.

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,960
Does that really work?

203
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,240
Looks like you did go there?

204
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,440
Are you fishing?

205
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,520
Yes, I am.

206
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,480
Be a man and admit what you did.

207
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,040
Of course I will laugh at you.

208
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,600
Come on.

209
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,960
Go away. I won’t drink with you.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,880
Li Qian is here.

211
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,920
Why don’t I see Baoning?

212
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
Does she get ill

213
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,400
because of the cold weather today?

214
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,080
Cai Shuang?

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,560
Why is he at Villa Mingyue?

216
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,640
It’s amazing.

217
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,640
Let’s go.

218
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,280
Sisters, where are you going?

219
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,280
You don’t know it?

220
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,240
For luck,

221
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,360
Yongfu’s head
is giving out money out there.

222
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,920
Everyone has a share.

223
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Just for good luck.

224
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,160
This is a golden opportunity.

225
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
It would be a big loss if you miss it.

226
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,920
Let’s go.

227
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,280
Maybe we should also
go to get some money.

228
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,840
But the Princess is still asleep.

229
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,840
She is really sleepy.

230
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,560
I think she is not
gonna wake up for a while.

231
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,920
Let’s be quick.

232
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,400
Nothing will happen.

233
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,680
Let’s go, my good sister.

234
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,640
Master Zhao?

235
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,720
Was there a crippled man

236
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,320
who broke in?

237
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,680
A crippled man?

238
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,480
No.

239
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
As you can see,

240
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
I’m alone in the tearoom.

241
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,920
But I just saw him walk in.

242
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,080
Master Zhao.

243
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,400
There are some things
you can’t joke about.

244
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,320
I’m not married yet.

245
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,880
If my reputation is ruined,

246
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,280
it will be hard for me to live my life.

247
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,720
Master Zhao, please don’t ruin

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,320
an unmarried girl’s reputation
because of your momentary mistake.

249
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,640
I hope you are not lying.

250
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,520
The window is not open.

251
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,120
The scent of the incense is too strong.

252
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,240
Is it you, Qingke?

253
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,400
Continue.

254
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,720
Bingo.

255
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,400
You lost, drink it.

256
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,520
Continue, come on.

257
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,400
We fought on the street last time.

258
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,240
I was being rude first.

259
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,000
I drink this glass of wine

260
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,840
as my apology to you.

261
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,880
One.

262
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,560
You lost again. Drink it.

263
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,440
What’s the matter with you?

264
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,800
Li Qian.

265
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,920
Miaorong.

266
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,640
Did you see the juggling?

267
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
How interesting it is.

268
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,320
Miaorong.

269
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
There are many maids in Villa Mingyue.

270
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,200
Why do you still make tea yourself?

271
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,720
Of course I should, Madam.

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,800
This is your favorite fruit tea.

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,720
It contains a dozen raw ingredients.

274
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,240
The taste will be different if the ratio
of the ingredients is not right.

275
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,680
I’m worried

276
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,920
you are not used to the tea
made by the maids.

277
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,200
So I went to the tearoom in person

278
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,640
and made you a pot
according to your taste.

279
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,520
I know

280
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,480
you are the most thoughtful girl.

281
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Does Miss Gao who lives in your mansion

282
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,520
have any personal relationship
with Cai Shuang?

283
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
What do you mean, Master Zhao?

284
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,880
I think I saw

285
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,960
him sneak into the tearoom,

286
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,160
but when I got there, he disappeared.

287
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,040
Only Miss Gao was there.

288
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,680
Did Cai Shuang
also come to Villa Mingyue?

289
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,840
I’m not sure if it’s him.

290
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,480
But judging from the figure,

291
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,640
that person looks a lot like him.

292
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,360
Thanks.

293
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,320
Li Qian, where are you going?

294
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,680
Come on. Sit next to me.

295
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,440
Li Qian.

296
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,480
Was that Qian who passed by?

297
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Why is he in such a hurry?

298
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,120
Does anything go wrong?

299
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,480
Guanju.

300
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,280
Find out
if anything happened out there.

301
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,160
Yes.

302
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,720
Yes.

303
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,560
Hurry up and check it out.

304
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,960
Miaorong, come here and take a seat.

305
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,920
Qingke!

306
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,080
Qingke!

307
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,000
Stop yelling.

308
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,320
No one will save you
no matter how loud you are.

309
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,320
There will be no one else here

310
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,600
but you and me!

311
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,600
What are you going to do?

312
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,040
Your Grace, you are smart.

313
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,840
Don’t you know what I’m going to do?

314
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,040
Is there something wrong
with the incense?

315
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,600
You’d better not do anything stupid.

316
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,680
If you leave now,

317
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,320
I can pretend nothing happened.

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,680
If you dare to do anything to me,

319
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,079
it will cost you.

320
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,800
If it wasn’t for you
to plan the arrest that day,

321
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,520
would I end up being like this?

322
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,160
One hundred floggings.

323
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,240
I lost one leg on the spot!

324
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,119
My life becomes like this

325
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,960
all because of Li Qian.

326
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,640
What you and your husband did to me,

327
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,280
I will give it back to you
ten times, even a hundred times.

328
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,560
Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

329
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,640
Go away!

330
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
Just take it!

331
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,520
Go away!

332
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,240
Your Grace.

333
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,280
Don’t waste your energy.

334
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,480
You are despicable.

335
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,400
Despicable?

336
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,200
If I’m despicable,

337
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,600
how would I be able

338
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
to have a taste of Your Grace?

339
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,560
Calm down.

340
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,280
I must be calm right now.

341
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,000
Doing squats

342
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,120
is the basic skill of martial arts,

343
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,520
also the most important step
to keep fit.

344
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,760
Concentrate all your strength
on your legs.

345
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,040
Miss. Madam!

346
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Something bad happened.

347
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,400
Something happened
to Her Grace in the guest room!

348
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,480
Her Grace?

349
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,760
What happened to Her Grace?

350
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,080
A strange man broke into her room.

351
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,880
What are you talking about?

352
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,840
How dare you a maid

353
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,600
defame Her Grace?

354
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,480
Zip it.

355
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,680
Is it not humiliating enough?

356
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,480
For God’s sake.

357
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,800
Come with me and see what happened.

358
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,480
Madam.

359
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,600
I’ve been practicing martial arts
for a while.

360
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
I can’t panic.

361
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,840
Li Qian taught me a lot.

362
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,720
I can do it.

363
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,880
I’m coming.

364
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,160
Be good.

365
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,000
Baoning, are you okay?

366
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,160
Did he hurt you in any way?

367
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,080
Of course I’m okay.

368
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,640
Didn’t you see my punch fly him out?

369
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,920
I saw it.

370
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
You are the best.

371
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,240
Go away.

372
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,800
All right.

373
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,120
Are you coaxing me?

374
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,920
I’m not.

375
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,280
I’m telling the truth.

376
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,400
You protected yourself well.

377
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,840
It’s my fault.

378
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,720
I wasn’t there to protect you.

379
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,600
All right, just go.

380
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,240
I got a headache because of the drug.

381
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,960
I want water.

382
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,480
Got it.

383
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,120
Madam.

384
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,360
I heard that something happened
to the Princess.

385
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
What’s going on?

386
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,080
Her Grace is not feeling well.

387
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,000
She is resting in the room.

388
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,360
Li Qian is with her inside.

389
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,880
Madam, don’t worry.

390
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,800
Does Her Grace feel uncomfortable?

391
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
I need to see her.

392
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,160
Madam, well...

393
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Please go back.

394
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,320
You got me.

395
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,800
I...

396
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,440
Madam.

397
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,400
It’s okay. There is nothing serious.

398
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,440
Let’s wait in the banquet room.

399
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,960
I need to see her
whether it’s serious or not.

400
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,360
Her Grace feels uncomfortable.
I should see her.

401
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,880
Madam.

402
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,240
The guests are all here.
They are waiting for you.

403
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,600
Let’s go to the banquet room
for the meal.

404
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,080
Madam.

405
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:29,640
Please.

406
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,760
You must let me know

407
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,040
if anything happens to Her Grace.

408
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,320
Okay.

409
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,400
I’m worried sick.

410
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,440
It’s nothing serious.

411
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
You can leave.

412
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,520
What are you doing here?

413
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,400
Is Her Grace doing well?

414
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,160
What can happen to her?

415
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,960
She has a sudden illness.

416
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,960
It’s not convenient for her
to meet guests now.

417
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,480
Li Qian is with her inside.

418
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,600
And the outsiders

419
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,840
shouldn’t bother them now.

420
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,640
Please, Master Zhao.

421
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,240
What exactly happened?

422
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,480
I mean, how did you throw the banquet?

423
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,600
Cai Shuang slipped in.

424
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
He tried to hurt the Princess.

425
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,960
Fortunately, Li Qian arrived in time.

426
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,840
Where is that bastard now?

427
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,200
He escaped
in the middle of the mess.

428
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,360
I think

429
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,600
your top priority now

430
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,120
is to find out

431
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,200
what exactly happened.

432
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,200
Otherwise, considering how much
Li Qian loves the Princess,

433
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
if your family
doesn’t give him an explanation,

434
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,080
I’m afraid it will cost you a lot.

435
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,560
What are you doing?

436
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:46,760
Go.

437
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,640
Get off me!

438
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Get off me!

439
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,960
Uncle Li.

440
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,640
What does this mean?

441
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,120
Are you

442
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,800
still playing dumb now?

443
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,880
I really don’t know what’s this about.

444
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,760
Her Grace nearly got hurt.

445
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,240
Does it have anything to do with you?

446
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,240
Her Grace nearly got hurt?

447
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,760
What happened to Her Grace?

448
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,200
I’ll give you one last chance.

449
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,600
If you don’t tell the truth,

450
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,520
don’t blame us for being ruthless.

451
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,880
If she won’t say,

452
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,200
you say it.

453
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,920
I don’t know anything.

454
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,600
If I die, I’ll die unjustly.

455
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,320
Qian.

456
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,400
We arrived at Villa Mingyue
in the morning

457
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,520
and came back to Li’s mansion
in the evening.

458
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,560
During this time, the two of us

459
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,400
have been with Madam.

460
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,680
You framed me
for plotting against Her Grace,

461
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,480
does it mean Madam is also implicated?

462
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

463
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,520
What does it have to do with me?

464
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,160
Madam.

465
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,400
We were with you

466
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,480
from morning till night yesterday.

467
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,080
It’s an unquestionable fact.

468
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,380
You must testify to my innocence.

469
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,200
Well,

470
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,200
what she said is true.

471
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,160
They had been with me
during the banquet.

472
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,600
She only went out

473
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,440
to make me a pot of fruit tea
during that time.

474
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,960
It took her

475
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,280
less than 15 minutes.

476
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,680
It’s not enough to do anything, right?

477
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,080
Do you think

478
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,200
staying out of it

479
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,920
can get you off the hook?

480
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,800
I...

481
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
It didn’t take long

482
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,560
to get water in the tearoom.

483
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,640
But it’s enough for you
to lead Cai Shuang.

484
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Qian.

485
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,840
I don’t understand
what you are talking about.

486
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,240
Marquis Jinghai’s son saw it
with his own eyes

487
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,440
that Cai Shuang went into the tearoom
and disappeared.

488
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,600
You were the only one
in the tearoom at that time.

489
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
Even if it wasn’t Cai Shuang
who broke in,

490
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,000
it was still an alive man.

491
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,920
Why did you say no one came in

492
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,280
when Master Zhao asked you?

493
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,520
What are you trying to hide?

494
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,160
Qian.

495
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,960
Marquis Jinghai’s son
goes against you all the time.

496
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,280
You believe him but...

497
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,120
Gao Miaorong.

498
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,760
Now you’re still playing dumb?

499
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Bring them in!

500
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,240
Hurry!

501
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,480
Go!

502
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,320
Since the Dong family sent you here,

503
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,440
explain clearly what you know

504
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,320
and what you have done.

505
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,440
It’s her.

506
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,280
She gave me banknotes
of five hundred taels of silver

507
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,040
and asked me

508
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,360
to put a man into the Yongfu troupe,

509
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,960
so he can enter Villa Mingyue.

510
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,360
Hurry.

511
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,200
Come on.

512
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,040
(Yongfu)

513
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,040
(Villa Mingyue)
Then she asked me to go to Room 1

514
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,080
and light the poisonous incense.

515
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,960
Here are the banknotes.

516
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,080
She asked me to do it.

517
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,840
Miss Dong detained our head.

518
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,480
She said she will get us arrested.

519
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,800
I dare not lie.

520
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,280
Please show mercy to the troupe.

521
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,840
It’s all my fault.

522
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,200
Miss, save me!

523
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,640
Guanju.

524
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,040
Miss!

525
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,440
Don’t sling mud at me.

526
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Here are the witnesses
and the physical evidence.

527
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,520
Miss!

528
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,680
Are you still trying
to justify yourself?

529
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,520
Gao Miaorong.

530
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,240
I thought you are a gentle, virtuous

531
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,400
and kind girl.

532
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,240
I didn’t know you faked it!

533
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,680
You...

534
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,040
I...

535
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,840
Enough!

536
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,960
I’ve had enough of you!

537
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,440
If you were not

538
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
Li Qian’s mother,

539
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,680
I wouldn’t spend time with

540
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,320
such a vulgar woman like you.

541
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,360
How dare you!

542
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,960
Gao Miaorong!

543
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,640
You’ve gone too far!

544
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,720
How dare you!

545
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,080
And you!

546
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,400
My uncle cared for you
and valued your relationship,

547
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,480
but you turned your back on him

548
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,040
and pushed him into the abyss
with your own hands step by step.

549
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,720
Everyone in the Li family

550
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,040
is a villain in disguise.

551
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,520
I thought

552
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,120
if I give my youth

553
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,640
to this family,

554
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,960
you will be moved by my sincerity

555
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,960
and what I did

556
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,160
will be rewarded one day.

557
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,080
But you...

558
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,480
You are ruthless executioners!

559
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,240
You can’t wait to cut me into pieces

560
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,280
and get rid of me!

561
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,720
Yes.

562
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,360
I asked Cai Shuang
to defile Jiang Baoning.

563
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,200
So what?

564
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,480
Jiang Baoning...

565
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,440
Jiang Baoning stole the man
who was supposed to be mine.

566
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,720
Everything in the Li family

567
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,760
is mine!

568
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,760
Jiang Baoning is a shameless woman.

569
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,920
She took everything from me.

570
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,320
She ruined me.

571
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,960
Why can’t I ruin her?

572
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Gao Miaorong!

573
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,560
You hate me?

574
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,920
You want to avenge Jiang Baoning?

575
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,760
Miss!

576
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,640
You are awake.

577
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Thank God you are fine.

578
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,120
Come on, slowly.

579
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,200
Are you sad?

580
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,600
It’s normal if you are sad.

581
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,080
She is your childhood sweetheart
after all,

582
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,880
but she becomes vicious now.

583
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,840
Although she is hateful,

584
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,360
it’s still hard to forget
what you had before.

585
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,600
The reason I’m sad

586
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,600
is because I didn’t protect you well.

587
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,720
How is she now?

588
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,680
Father spared her life
for the sake of her uncle.

589
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,880
She still wanted
to stay in Li’s mansion,

590
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,640
but we can’t keep
such a vicious woman here.

591
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,720
She cut off one of her fingers.

592
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,360
An hour ago,

593
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,640
she packed up and left Li’s mansion.

594
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,320
Baoning.

595
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,760
It is my fault.

596
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,920
I didn’t protect you well.

597
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,840
I put you in danger.

598
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,320
Sorry.

599
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,160
Are you okay?

600
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,600
(Yongshun Dyehouse)

601
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,080
Cai Shuang.

602
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,680
What do you want to do?

603
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,200
It’s you.

604
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,040
Because of you,

605
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,080
I ended up like this.

606
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,760
I lost my job in the government,

607
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,680
and my legs are broken!

608
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,440
I’m useless now!

609
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,120
What does this have to do with me?

610
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,400
You must make up for me.

611
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,920
What are you going to do?

612
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,160
Don’t come near me.

613
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,960
Don’t come near me!

614
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,440
Stay away!

615
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Don’t come near me.

616
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,040
Go away!

617
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,640
Go away!

618
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,440
Go away!

619
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,680
Go away!

620
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,880
Go away!

621
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,720
Come on.

622
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,640
Help!

623
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,640
Don’t move!

624
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Qian.

625
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,400
The doll is so cute.

626
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,600
This is the first doll I carved.
I just finished it.

627
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
If you like it,

628
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,560
I can give it to you.

629
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,840
Great.

630
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,720
Thank you, Qian.

631
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,640
Rong.

632
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,760
Don’t worry.

633
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,960
I’ll avenge you.

634
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,639
From today,

635
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,000
I won’t let anyone hurt you again.

636
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,760
I’m a sinful person.

637
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,199
That’s why I ended up like this.

638
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,239
Don’t do anything for me.
I’m not worth it.

639
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,440
Don’t do anything for me.
I’m not worth it.

640
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,120
I don’t deserve it.

641
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:47,880
Rong.

642
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,040
I don’t deserve it.

643
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,159
Let’s forget

644
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,680
the past.

645
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
From now on,

646
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
from this moment,

647
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,440
let’s have a new start.

648
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,640
We are refreshed now.

649
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,200
It’s time to show Zhao Yi

650
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,960
what I can do.

651
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,080
Pass down my order.

652
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Prepare the armies.

653
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,480
We will leave immediately.

654
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,400
Yes.

655
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,520
This time, I will make Zhao Yi

656
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
completely surrender to me.

657
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,320
Congratulations to Your Majesty.

658
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,360
I also have good news for you.

659
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,040
(Yunlin Pass)

660
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,640
You.

661
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,800
Stop.

662
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,120
Stop.

663
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,080
Take a look.

664
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,360
What are these?

665
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,360
Open it and let me see.

666
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,320
Master An.

667
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
These are your goods.

668
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,160
I haven’t seen Master An for some time.

669
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,080
Sir, do us a favor.

670
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,200
These goods

671
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,640
are for Dong’s Trading House.

672
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,600
Since these are Master An’s goods,

673
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,400
I think I don’t need to check them.

674
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,160
Release!

675
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,560
Our men

676
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,280
have got through Yunlin Pass.

677
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Then our men will be divided into
two groups to distract them

678
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,680
and work with our men
on the other side of Yunlin Pass

679
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,400
to break through the barriers
and enter the capital.

680
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,080
Good.

681
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,640
Soldiers!

682
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,760
Yongqing State has been working hard
for generations.

683
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,840
Now we are ready
with strong soldiers and horses.

684
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,080
It’s the perfect time
to make our country great!

685
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:42,800
Your Majesty must win!

686
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,280
(Qing State Yunyang
Bingzhou Yunlin)

687
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,800
Why don’t you get inside?

688
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,040
What’s wrong?

689
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,920
Nothing.

690
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,360
When you lie to me,

691
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,760
you always keep your head down
and not look at me.

692
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,880
I don’t know what’s wrong.

693
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,720
I’m a little unsettled.

694
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,320
I feel something bad is going to happen.

695
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,200
Don’t worry too much.

696
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,440
Alright?

697
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,720
I’ll check it out.

698
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,880
It will be fine.

699
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,760
(Bingzhou)

700
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,400
Mr. Jin.

701
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,600
I think we should open the gate

702
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,520
and fight with them.

703
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,000
What if we lose?

704
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,280
Except for Zhao Xiao

705
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
who was sent out by me in the morning
to guard at Yunlin Pass,

706
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,280
all the other soldiers
in the Border Battalion

707
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,400
withdrew into the city.

708
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,120
Our army is not strong enough now.

709
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,000
What to do then?

710
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,000
Yongqing launched this attack
without any warning,

711
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,200
judging from the number
of their soldiers,

712
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,720
I’m afraid they come at us
in full strength.

713
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,600
Mr. Jin.

714
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,120
Please pass down the order immediately

715
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,120
to guard the pass strictly,

716
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,080
not let the enemy
break through the pass,

717
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,840
evacuate the people in the city
as soon as possible,

718
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,640
and establish multiple lines of defense
in the city.

719
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,000
I’ll willing to lead
my men of Xuanjia Battalion

720
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,560
to slow the enemy down.

721
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,720
Mr. Jin.

722
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,240
Why are you still hesitating?

723
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,040
Hurry up and do something.

724
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,560
Just do as you said.

725
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,520
Yes.

726
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,440
(Li’s Mansion)
It’s not like

727
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,720
(Li’s Mansion)
Yongqing State never attacked us before.

728
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,520
(Li’s Mansion)
Our lives still go on as usual.

729
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,320
Father worried about your safety.

730
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,000
Only when their families are safe

731
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,360
can they focus on defeating the enemy
on the front lines.

732
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,720
That’s true.

733
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,440
Slow down.

734
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,080
Hurry!

735
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,160
Hurry!

736
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,880
Block it now.

737
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,840
Hurry.

738
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

739
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,400
Run.

740
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,200
Stop!

741
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,200
Stop!

742
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,520
Soldiers!

743
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,680
Qing An.

744
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,120
Qing An, it’s me.

745
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,480
Qing An!

746
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,360
Open the gate!

747
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,360
(Bingzhou)

748
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:22,960
Send him for treatment.

749
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,280
Hurry.

750
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,720
How’s it going?

751
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,480
An army is coming.

752
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,120
How is it?

753
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,320
Go get ready.

754
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:36,720
Yes.

755
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,000
Go get ready now.

756
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,600
