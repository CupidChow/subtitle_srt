=Episode 36=

27
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,160
Baoning,

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,879
I need to tell you something
before I leave.

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,675
What is it?

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,400
I met Gao Miaorong in the capital.

31
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,040
She’s with Han Tongxin.

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,519
You must beware of her.

33
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,679
I don’t care who you met.

34
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,279
I didn’t go to her.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,160
Baoning, had you seen her already?

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,240
Why do you care?

37
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,559
No wonder Han Tongxin

38
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:29,919
is acting strange.

39
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,080
The old one I knew

40
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,520
would’ve jumped on things
like moving the capital

41
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,720
instead of
going to the Imperial Mausoleums

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,399
to see Grandmother.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,880
Turns out she has an advisor.

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,279
Advisor?

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
More like a snake

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,160
swept out by the Li Family.

47
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,960
This is the informer
I arranged in Cining Palace,

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,399
Chan.

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,600
Tell everything there

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,839
to Her Highness

51
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,039
and you’ll be rewarded handsomely.

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,350
Yes.

53
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:58,000
Is Empress Dowager with someone new?

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,800
Yes, Your Highness.

55
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,720
She came back to the palace

56
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,839
with a female physician

57
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,639
after the death of the late emperor

58
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,919
and had that woman study
medicine texts at Fanhua Hall.

59
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,199
She summoned her regularly

60
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,300
and trusted her a lot.

61
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,720
But I never saw her face

62
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,520
because she was always wearing a veil.

63
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,479
All I know is she’s surnamed Gao.

64
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:25,279
So Gao Miaorong
has been in the palace the whole time.

65
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,440
Idiot!

66
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,880
Did you have me embarrassed on purpose

67
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,320
as payback for not letting you go?

68
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,919
I listened to you
and went to the Imperial Mausoleums

69
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,399
but only got insulted by that old witch!

70
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Please calm down, Your Highness.

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,039
My wisdom might be lacking,

72
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,080
but my loyalty to you is unwavering.

73
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,720
Setting you up
wouldn’t benefit me at all.

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,150
Only if you succeed,

75
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,360
will I be able to enjoy the light again.

76
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,240
Do you know

77
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,039
that old witch

78
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,080
humiliated me in front of anyone?

79
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,520
I would’ve crawled into a hole
had there been one!

80
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,880
That old witch!

81
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,440
When will she kick the bucket?

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,720
Your Highness,

83
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,880
Marquis Jinghai is waiting
at the Imperial Garden

84
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,399
to speak to Miss Gao.

85
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,040
Go ahead then.

86
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,359
Yes, Your Highness.

87
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,350
Your Highness, isn’t it strange

88
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,799
that Marquis Jinghai
asks to see her

89
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,239
instead of you?

90
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,079
Has he hooked up with her

91
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,600
behind your back?

92
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,399
He wouldn’t dare!

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,839
I wonder

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,559
what dirty business

95
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,359
they’re doing in private.

96
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,679
Let’s go.

97
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,950
(Shoukang Palace)

98
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,959
You need more rest, Your Highness.

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,040
Why are you up so early?

100
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,399
The older I get, the less I sleep.

101
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,559
I can’t go back to bed.

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,679
Let’s go to the Imperial Garden.

103
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,799
Sure.

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,640
Have you found anything I need?

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,320
Yes, Your Highness.

106
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,119
I was going to get to that.

107
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,440
We’re almost at Shoukang Palace.

108
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,600
Where’s Marquis Jinghai?

109
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,880
Just right ahead.

110
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,559
Please.

111
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,440
Gao Miaorong.

112
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,640
I didn’t expect

113
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,600
you’d hide yourself here.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let go of me! Let go!

115
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,559
It really is you!

116
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,760
The past is the past.

117
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,559
I won’t hold you accountable,

118
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,079
but you cannot stay here.

119
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,679
Let me go!

120
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,650
- Stop!
- Back off!

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,640
Your Highness.

122
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:45,799
Your Highness.

123
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,239
What’s happening?

124
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
Rise.

125
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,550
Thank you, Your Highness.

126
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,480
Your Highness,

127
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,600
this woman is evil and vicious enough

128
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,239
to harm Princess.

129
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,760
A fugitive like her
cannot be in the palace.

130
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
Who do you think you are?

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,160
Since when did a lowly maid

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
have a say in front of me?

133
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,880
I don’t know

134
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,920
what she did before,

135
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,440
but I do know she saved me and An

136
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,399
when I was all alone outside the palace.

137
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,600
I don’t see the problem

138
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,839
keeping her here.

139
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,959
Leave her alone

140
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
unless you want to die!

141
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
Get up, Qingke.

142
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,480
Take her away.

143
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,679
Wait!

144
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
- Help, Your Highness!
- Nobody moves!

145
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,040
Jiang Baoning,

146
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:52,679
this is no longer your home
after you got married.

147
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,200
You don’t get to give the word.

148
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,959
You can have whoever you want,
but not her.

149
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,799
That’s my call to make,

150
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,200
not yours.

151
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,359
Try me.

152
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,640
Don’t interfere with others’ business

153
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,720
when you still have problems at home.

154
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,839
Who tucked her tail
between the legs on the way back?

155
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,119
I thought you’d behave yourself,

156
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,959
yet you’re throwing your weight around

157
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,440
to tell me what to do.

158
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,480
That’s crossed the line.

159
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,320
This is my place, not Jinxi!

160
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,760
Oh, right, you can’t go back there

161
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,960
because your man dumped you, didn’t he?

162
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,320
That’s not your concern.

163
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,440
Of course, it is.

164
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,000
After all, you were part of our family.

165
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
Your scandal
would still bring shame on me.

166
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,359
Nobody bought that show

167
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,440
you and Li Qian put on

168
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,000
except for Grand Empress Dowager
who didn’t know anything.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,475
That old fool...

170
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,919
Is what she said true?

171
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,479
So it is true.

172
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,320
Grandmother,

173
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,520
Jiang Baoning and Li Qian
fell out long ago.

174
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,159
Enough!

175
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,719
You know she’s our family member.

176
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,239
Her image affects ours, too.

177
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,679
How could you, Empress Dowager,
make such a scene?

178
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,320
Go back to your own place!

179
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,000
Grandmother, that woman

180
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,719
saved me and An,

181
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,475
so I...

182
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,400
You think I don’t know

183
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,840
she gave you all those bad ideas?

184
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,200
Get out of here!

185
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,700
Your Highness!

186
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:07,799
Your Highness!

187
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,919
Servants, take her away.

188
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,320
Your Highness! Help, Your Highness!

189
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,239
Help me, please, Your Highness!

190
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Your Highness!

191
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,359
(Speak and Behave Wonderfully)
Fangling.

192
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,359
(Speak and Behave Wonderfully)

193
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,575
(Speak and Behave Wonderfully)
Repeat your findings

194
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,640
to everyone.

195
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,039
Yes.

196
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,599
Gao Miaorong, right?

197
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,679
Empress Dowager figured
nobody would notice you

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,359
if you were at Fanhua Hall,

199
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,960
but it was strange enough

200
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,000
when a physician like you
visited Cining Palace regularly

201
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,000
instead of
staying at the Imperial Hospital.

202
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,239
Grand Empress Dowager had had people

203
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,520
look into you

204
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,559
and found that
you attempted to harm Princess.

205
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:56,799
After the Li Family drove you out,

206
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,640
you managed to sneak into the palace

207
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,599
and advised Empress Dowager
against Her Highness.

208
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,239
She poses a threat to everyone.

209
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,599
Take her out and flog her to death!

210
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,375
Yes.

211
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,359
Servants!

212
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,559
How could you keep me in the dark

213
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,200
about all your suffering?

214
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,080
All that is over, Grandmother.

215
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,320
I’m fine now.

216
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,559
It’s about dinnertime.

217
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,799
Inform the Kitchen

218
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,799
that I’ll have all greens.

219
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,159
Yes.

220
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,039
Qingke,

221
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,039
bring Princess to her room to eat.

222
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Yes.

223
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,840
Grandmother,

224
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,559
if Gao Miaorong was killed
behind Empress Dowager’s back,

225
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,359
she’d definitely complain about it.

226
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,440
If words got out,
it’d tarnish your image.

227
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,599
I’m not afraid of her.

228
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,320
And bad image or not,

229
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,919
I’d be too dead to worry about it then.

230
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,479
I can’t believe
Gao Miaorong did all that to you,

231
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,080
and interfered in
moving the capital, no less!

232
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,119
I want her dead!

233
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,350
Grandmother,

234
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,640
listen, she can barely make a sound.

235
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
If they don’t stop,

236
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,039
she will die at your palace.

237
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,840
Well, she does deserve it,

238
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,840
but

239
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,440
not now,

240
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:15,840
or here.

241
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,479
And she did save Han Tongxin’s life.

242
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,479
Without her,

243
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,359
we’d never see An.

244
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,000
The late emperor died for our state.

245
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,239
Gao Miaorong helped

246
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,559
carry on his bloodline, right?

247
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,880
Spare her life, please.

248
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,479
Fine.

249
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,320
Imprison her in the
Bureau of Judicial Investigation

250
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,679
for life.

251
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,200
No release.

252
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,799
Yes.

253
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,799
You’re too kind,

254
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,679
which will put yourself in danger.

255
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,520
You’ll protect me from it, right?

256
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:06,520
But not forever.

257
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,840
Tell me now.

258
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,359
What happened between you and Li Qian?

259
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,000
Tell me every detail.

260
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,599
Otherwise,

261
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,675
I will be mad.

262
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:29,440
It all goes back to
The Book of Supreme Weapons...

263
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,880
As per Grand Empress Dowager’s order,

264
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,400
you’ll serve life imprisonment here.

265
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,039
(Li’s Mansion)

266
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,000
Young Master Lin!

267
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,880
Open the door, Young Master Lin!

268
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,359
Young Master Lin!

269
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,440
Young Master Lin!

270
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,239
Miss Gao is in danger.

271
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:07,960
What happened to Miaorong?

272
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Follow me.

273
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,280
Come.

274
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,960
Young Master Lin,

275
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,640
Empress Dowager knew
how much you loved her

276
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,280
and asked me
to sneak you in to visit her.

277
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,000
You can only stay for a few minutes.

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,159
Hurry up,

279
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,799
or we’ll be doomed

280
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,119
if Grand Empress Dowager
finds out about this.

281
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,450
I see.

282
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,640
Go ahead.

283
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,520
She’s in the middle cell.

284
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,840
I’ll be on the lookout.

285
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,462
Thanks.

286
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,359
Miaorong!

287
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,080
Miaorong!

288
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,559
Miaorong!

289
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,400
Lin!

290
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,400
Grand Empress Dowager
is said to be benevolent,

291
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,320
but why is she doing this to you?

292
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
You can’t blame her.

293
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,359
It’s my fault.

294
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,880
I deserve it.

295
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,320
I was so obsessed with Li Qian

296
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,719
that I set him up,

297
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,559
and now...

298
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,799
Now, I’m complicit

299
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,679
with Empress Dowager.

300
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,640
I shall pay the price for all that.

301
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,080
You’ve paid your fair share.

302
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,400
Why are they still so cruel to you?

303
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:58,239
It has nothing to do with
Grand Empress Dowager.

304
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
I don’t blame her.

305
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,599
You know what?

306
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,280
The truth is,

307
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,040
I always envied Jiang Baoning

308
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:25,599
that she was surrounded
by love and care.

309
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,599
Unlike her,

310
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,319
I lost my parents

311
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,959
and grew up with my uncle.

312
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,800
But now, things have changed.

313
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,439
Because...

314
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,959
Now, I have you.

315
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,760
I’m just as lucky as her.

316
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,199
Lin,

317
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,479
I’m glad that
I could see you one last time...

318
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,319
Don’t say that, Miaorong!

319
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,920
I’ll get you out.

320
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,439
I know...

321
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,479
I know you cherish me,
love me and pity me.

322
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:17,520
And you’d do anything to free me.

323
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,079
Throughout my life,

324
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,920
my biggest regret is that

325
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,920
I waited so long to be with you.

326
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,319
If there was a next life,

327
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
then

328
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:53,400
I’d love you wholeheartedly.

329
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,119
Don’t wait until then, Miaorong.

330
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,800
I want to be with you now.

331
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,439
You cannot die.

332
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,599
I’ll get you out. Trust me.

333
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,560
I feel sorry for you two.

334
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,640
Empress Dowager wants to know

335
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,760
if you have other ways

336
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,280
to play Li Qian and Jiang Baoning
off against each other.

337
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,600
If you can do that,

338
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,800
she’ll get you out of here

339
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:46,880
by

340
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,040
replacing you

341
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,560
with a Jane Doe on death roll.

342
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,079
Then you and your man
can go wherever you want.

343
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:59,599
Will Her Highness do that?

344
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:04,560
It depends on what you can do for her.

345
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,560
Why is there such poison in the palace?

346
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,520
This one, together with other poison,

347
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,850
made a balanced prescription
to take lives.

348
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,375
It’s been used for three months.

349
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,079
Three months?

350
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,880
At this rate,

351
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,400
Grand Empress Dowager
is living on borrowed time.

352
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,479
I have a plan.

353
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,199
Tell me about it.

354
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,675
(Bingzhou Government Office)

355
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,500
Qian, you shouldn’t have
given up your leadership of the army.

356
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,079
Without it,
how would you continue guarding Jinxi?

357
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,839
Relax. I know what I’m doing.

358
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,680
Where’s Baoning?

359
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,719
Why isn’t she back with you?

360
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,359
I’m needed at the camp. Excuse me.

361
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,199
She must still be mad.

362
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,479
Useless!

363
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,800
Look, open the pod

364
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,500
and put peas in the bowl.

365
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,040
Then throw away the pod.

366
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:31,287
Oh.

367
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Throw that away. We don’t need it.

368
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,725
Auntie.

369
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:38,450
I’ll put it here.

370
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,199
Qing An, look!

371
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,174
- Careful.
- Coming through. Excuse me.

372
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,359
Good. Stop.

373
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,025
Unload the cart.

374
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:47,640
Be careful.

375
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,880
- Don’t kill me! Please!
- Wait.

376
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,000
Auntie!

377
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,150
- It’s her! She’s here!
- What’s wrong, Auntie?

378
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,800
- You’re fine. You’re safe.
- Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!

379
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,520
Don’t kill me!

380
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,359
What happened?

381
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,040
Don’t kill me!

382
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,199
I’m not sure.

383
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,239
I bumped her by accident.

384
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,520
- Is she startled?
- Don’t kill me!

385
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:10,975
- That’s true.
- Don’t kill me!

386
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,160
We all saw it.

387
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,199
It’s probably a panic attack.

388
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,520
Don’t kill me!

389
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,479
I see. Go back to work.

390
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,199
Yes.

391
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,680
Don’t kill me!

392
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,680
Don’t kill me!

393
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,400
See? She trusts you a lot.

394
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:32,000
I want you to protect her.

395
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,225
Sure.

396
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,760
I will.

397
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,000
Good boy.

398
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,880
Don’t kill me!

399
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:49,450
(Zhenning Gate)

400
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,599
Your Majesty.

401
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:01,959
Speak.

402
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,560
Scouts in Jinxi

403
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,959
reported that Li Qian had returned

404
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,560
from the capital

405
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,000
and handed over his military power.

406
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,275
Excellent!

407
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,040
He’s made Jinxi impenetrable

408
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,560
over the years.

409
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,479
No matter how hard I provoked him,

410
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:20,880
he turned a blind eye to me.

411
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,319
All my effort ended up in vain.

412
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,599
But now, without power,

413
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,880
he no longer poses a threat to me.

414
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,680
Your Majesty,

415
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,439
as powerless as he seems,

416
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,760
he has still held the post,

417
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,040
thus allowing himself to regain power.

418
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,280
Why don’t we take this chance to...?

419
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,680
Easier said than done.

420
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,959
It’s almost impossible

421
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,640
to kill a highly skilled man like him

422
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,640
on his own territory.

423
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,640
Your Majesty, if you trust me,

424
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,000
I’ll take care of it.

425
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,199
I’m sure my plan will work.

426
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,359
Very well. If you succeed,

427
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,640
promotion is the least you can expect.

428
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,319
I won’t let you down, Your Majesty.

429
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:20,000
Wait for my good news.

430
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,040
Hold on.

431
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,079
My bodyguards will go with you.

432
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,319
It’s better that I travel alone.

433
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,560
Don’t worry.

434
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,920
Do what you see fit.

435
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,439
If you get the job done,

436
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,800
they can be the vanguard

437
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,520
to take over Bingzhou in chaos.

438
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,760
If you fail, they’ll help you leave.

439
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:45,719
Listen, timing is everything.

440
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,439
But who will protect you

441
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,800
if your bodyguards leave

442
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:51,880
given that

443
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,079
rebels are out there eager to revolt?

444
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,160
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

445
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,319
Tell me,

446
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,680
in the State of Yongqing,

447
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,640
is there anyone who can touch me?

448
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,160
Or would anyone dare to?

449
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,400
Would you?

450
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,119
And you?

451
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:29,839
What about you?

452
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,640
Do it!

453
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,319
You’re supreme and mighty, Your Majesty!

454
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,560
Yongqing is under your feet!

455
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,079
See?

456
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,199
You see?

457
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,160
But that...

458
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,880
That lowly peasant in exile?

459
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,959
He’s practically brain-damaged

460
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:05,280
because of your hypnosis.

461
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,439
I don’t think

462
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,920
he’s able to stir up any trouble.

463
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,599
Absolutely not, Your Majesty.

464
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,680
I was thinking too much.

465
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,400
A toast to you

466
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,680
before you leave. To your victory!

467
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

468
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,680
What’s our next step, Commander?

469
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,160
Keep digging.

470
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,880
I’ll keep Prince An updated.

471
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,280
What’s the status

472
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,560
of your last assignment?

473
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,199
We’ve been in the dark all these years

474
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,160
lobbying patriots from all works of life

475
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,959
against Qing Tai’s tyranny

476
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,280
and we’ve gathered a sizable force,

477
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,800
awaiting Prince An’s orders.

478
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,680
I see.

479
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,839
Pork! Fresh pork!

480
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,479
Which part would you like, sir?

481
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,439
It’s all good.

482
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,719
Steward Li.

483
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:04,275
Yes?

484
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,199
You can

485
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,520
pick up groceries alone.

486
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,800
Why do you need me here?

487
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,000
Miss,

488
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,959
with your parents in the capital

489
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,000
and Princess in the palace,

490
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,040
we have no one

491
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,880
to take charge of the household.

492
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,319
As you grow year by year,

493
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,959
it’s time to familiarize yourself
with chores.

494
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,239
I’ll teach you all about meat.

495
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,839
If you’re making buns and dumplings,

496
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,160
there’s fat and lean meat...

497
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,000
Qing An?

498
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,719
Which one would you like?

499
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:24,839
This one is probably better.

500
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
I have to go, Steward Li.

501
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:32,359
She can’t do needlework or chores.

502
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,160
Who will marry her?

503
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,275
Haws on a stick!

504
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:36,280
I’ll show you next time.

505
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,920
Qing An!

506
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Excuse me, Miss?

507
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,975
Sorry, I made a mistake.

508
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,719
- Let’s go.
- Sure.

509
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,160
Dongdong, are you looking for me?

510
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,839
Qing An? What are you doing here?

511
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,575
I went to your house

512
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,839
and they said you went out.

513
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,479
So here I am.

514
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,520
Oh.

515
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,000
Come on. Let’s go back to the shelter.

516
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:10,425
I wish there was no war

517
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,800
and I was just an ordinary businessman

518
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,719
with my hand always held by you.

519
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,450
Buns! Meat buns!

520
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,680
Miss Dong! What a coincidence!

521
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,520
Mr. Jin, what brings you here?

522
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,880
Miss Dong,

523
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:37,000
where are you going?

524
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,560
To do business.

525
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,239
If you have a minute after that,

526
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,239
we can drink together.

527
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,750
I said I’d never be your drinking buddy.

528
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,239
Shanhu! Shanhu!

529
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,000
Shanhu!

530
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,520
What do you want?

531
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,479
You know, I stop doing blind dates.

532
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
I don’t care.

533
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,900
What about you?

534
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,959
Why do you care?

535
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:05,725
I...

536
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,719
I...

537
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,359
I...

538
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,900
I thought we were buddies!

539
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:18,319
I’m not your buddy, Jin Xiao!

540
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,920
Stop saying that! Enough is enough!

541
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,239
What was I thinking

542
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,760
to have a crush on that bonehead?

543
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,680
I could fight
but not tell a girl I like her.

544
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,839
I was with the Dark Force earlier.

545
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,520
They had spotted

546
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,319
Qing Tai’s men in Bingzhou

547
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,560
who must be here for an agenda.

548
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,599
We need to take precautions.

549
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,439
Prince An,

550
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,425
that’s what I came here for

551
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,280
from Yongqing.

552
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,160
Qing Tai wants Li Qian dead

553
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,920
and sends Wu Man
and his bodyguards to Bingzhou.

554
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,760
People of Yongqing

555
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,775
are boiling with resentment
because of his tyranny

556
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,199
while he has no clue about it.

557
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:34,749
Um.

558
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,680
We’ve contacted patriots

559
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,839
scattered all over the state
and agreed to

560
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,000
overthrow Qing Tai’s dictatorship

561
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,079
while he’s left alone.

562
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,920
Fine. Let’s do it.

563
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,640
But tread carefully.

564
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,520
Even if we fail this time,

565
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,280
there will be another chance

566
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,800
as long as we survive.

567
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,079
I’m in an award position

568
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,359
to give Li Qian a heads-up,

569
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:01,239
so I want our men
to guard outside his mansion.

570
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,400
Will do.

571
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,880
Dongdong almost caught me this morning.

572
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,880
From now on, we better meet at night

573
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,439
in case anyone sees us together.

574
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,079
With all due respect,

575
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,239
the truth will come out eventually.

576
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,119
When are you going to tell Miss Li

577
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,400
that you’ve recovered?

578
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:25,239
Not yet.

579
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,319
I need to continue
staying in the shelter undercover.

580
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,119
Once I regain my identity

581
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,599
as Prince An of Yongqing,

582
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,880
Dongdong and I

583
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,319
will be over for sure.

584
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,079
Miss Li is open-minded.

585
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,319
It’s probably safe to let her know.

586
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:41,599
Siqin,

587
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,239
I can’t afford to take any risks.

588
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:47,560
I understand.

589
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,400
Please, kind sir!

590
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,599
I beg you to take me in.

591
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,079
Look at me. I’m strong.

592
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,439
I can do anything for you.

593
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,839
Get out!

594
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,119
I’ve told you over and over

595
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,439
that we’re not hiring anyone.

596
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,760
We don’t need more people

597
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,880
with fewer members to serve.

598
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,560
Well, sir,

599
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,359
look,

600
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
I’m dying of thirst.

601
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,160
Could you let me have some water inside?

602
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,239
It’s scorching outside.

603
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,239
I’ll drink my water and leave, alright?

604
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,599
Fine, fine, fine. Come on in.

605
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:25,050
(Peace and Happiness)

606
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,760
Steward.

607
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,310
Yes?

608
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,760
You’re going to hire me.

609
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,160
Just look me in the eye.

610
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,079
What’s there to look?

611
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,040
While we’re battling disasters at home,

612
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,359
Qing Tai of Yongqing is lurking outside.

613
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,319
It’s only a matter of time
before he takes action.

614
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:53,079
I need you to guard Jinxi for me

615
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,719
and take him by the throat.

616
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,520
This place is the key

617
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:01,239
to offense and defense.

618
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,000
It’s of most strategic importance.

619
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,520
Now, I’m entrusting it to you.

620
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:05,959
Consider it done.

621
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,119
I’ll live and die with it.

622
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,680
You can count on me.

623
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:10,800
Thank you, man!

624
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,239
You’ve been going on and on
about state affairs all night.

625
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
How are things at home?

626
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,125
Why didn’t Princess come back with you?

627
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,839
Never mind.

628
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,079
You don’t need to tell me. I know.

629
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,359
Women are fickle.

630
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:36,800
They can easily get mad

631
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,520
and nothing will calm them down.

632
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,479
They’re so hard to please.

633
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,839
Can’t do it! Mission impossible!

634
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,080
Baoning,

635
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,280
you’re finally back.

636
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,159
Do you miss me?

637
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,450
Yes.

638
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,639
As cold as I was to you,

639
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,520
there wasn’t a day going by
that I didn’t miss you.

640
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,719
Despite all the obstacles between us,

641
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,719
I couldn’t allow myself

642
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:03,080
to let you go.

643
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,679
I love you.

644
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,679
I love you, too, Baoning.

645
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,199
So all that was a dream.

646
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,840
Now, I can only dream about you

647
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,439
being nice to me.

648
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,760
What is it that you want to show me?

649
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:51,080
You’ll see.

650
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,239
That’s it? A parrot?

651
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,159
“The moon shines bright.
My love’s snow-white.

652
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:12,000
She looks so cute.
It touches my heart.”

653
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,560
Baoning, do you still remember
that song Moonrise?

654
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:21,560
It’s been echoing in my head

655
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,719
ever since you played it for me.

656
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,275
You got it wrong.

657
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:28,479
I didn’t play it for you.

658
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,080
Stop running away from me, Baoning.

659
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,760
Grand Empress Dowager has found out

660
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,800
about your breakup with Li Qian.

661
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,239
Once your divorce completes,

662
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,639
I’ll marry you right away

663
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
and give you a grand wedding.

664
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,080
You’ll become Marquise Jinghai.

665
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,040
Zhao Xiao, is it possible

666
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,080
that you can’t forget about me

667
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:49,000
simply because I said no to you?

668
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,080
You can’t accept that,

669
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,879
hence the obsession.

670
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,679
Tons of better women are out there.

671
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,360
Trust me.

672
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,439
Let go of your obsession

673
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,360
and you’ll find the right one for you.

674
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,639
Baoning,

675
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,000
you are the right one by fate.

676
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,479
We come and go in each other’s life,

677
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,625
but as long as you say the word,

678
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,439
we’ll be back together.

679
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,919
Baoning, even if your love

680
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,439
is only 10 percent of mine for you,

681
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,520
I’ll bet 100 percent of my life
to be with you.

682
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:25,560
Baoning, I’ll wait for you

683
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,400
for as long as it takes.

684
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,320
Look back and I’m right here for you!

685
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,639
Speak! What are you here for?

686
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,800
To get The Book of Supreme Weapons.

687
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,719
Come again?

688
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:52,439
The Book of Supreme Weapons.

689
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,560
It can make the most powerful weapons

690
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,159
which are invincible.

691
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:00,080
Is there such a thing?

692
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,399
Where is it?

693
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,040
Steward Li,

694
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,399
Lord is on his way back.

695
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,639
Please open the West Courtyard.

696
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,800
Do it yourself.

697
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:11,919
You have the key.

698
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,719
Here you are.

699
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
What are you doing?

700
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,159
It’s dark. Don’t you need candles?

701
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:28,360
None of your business.

702
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:29,520
Go do your thing.

703
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,959
Young Master Qian,
something strange happened.

704
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:57,520
I need to speak to you in private.

705
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,320
You three wait for me at the study.

706
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:01,479
Sure.

707
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,560
Yes.

708
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
What’s the emergency?

709
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:12,120
My lord, I found a man in black

710
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:13,679
in your study earlier.

711
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:29,879
What’s that noise?

712
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:31,399
It’s Qian!

713
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:44,719
Who are you?

714
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000
A skin mask?

715
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,040
Surprise!

716
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:52,679
I’ve been waiting

717
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,399
for this chance to kill you.

718
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,439
Go die, Li Qian!

719
00:42:58,719 --> 00:42:59,320
Qian!

720
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,919
My lord!

721
00:43:02,919 --> 00:43:03,500
- Qian!
- My lord!

722
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:04,080
My lord!

723
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,760
Are you alright?

724
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,520
My lord!

725
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,919
I’m good. Nothing serious.

726
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:11,760
I’ll go get the physician.

727
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:18,600
Thank you for saving my life, sir.

728
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,719
May I know your name?

729
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,479
It’s not worth mentioning.

730
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:26,879
If you’ll excuse me, I need to go.

731
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,280
I owe you my life.

732
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,919
If you need help,
you know where to find me.

733
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,350
- Yun Lin.
- My lord.

734
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,360
Take care of my brother.

735
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,239
I’ll be right back, Qian.

736
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:47,879
How do you feel?

737
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:49,800
Yun Lin, where’s Steward Li?

738
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:51,159
Go find him.

739
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:51,840
Yes.

740
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,650
Move in!

741
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,760
Come and get me! Come on!

742
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:06,879
Catch me if you can, Your Majesty.

743
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,159
I’m right here.

744
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,520
Bad news, Your Majesty!

745
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,560

746

Bad news, Your Majesty!

748
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:14,120
What bad news?

749
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:16,560
I haven’t heard

750
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,550
anything bad in a long while.

751
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,919
Everyone is here.

752
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:24,080
Say it to surprise us.

753
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,439
Speak! Go ahead!

754
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:26,399
- Killers...
- Say it!

755
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,439
Killers are breaking in!

756
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,700
Killers?

757
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,600
What?

758
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:34,325
Who are they?

759
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,500
How many?

760
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:36,639
Where are they?

761
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,840
I didn’t get to count

762
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,760
but I saw a huge crowd

763
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:40,800
with familiar faces.

764
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,719
There are wanted criminals, too.

765
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:43,719
They’re all outside.

766
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:44,399
And...

767
00:45:44,919 --> 00:45:45,840
I also saw Siqin.

768
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,239
What... What should we do?

769
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:48,919
And Qing An?

770
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,159
No sign of him.

771
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:51,975
We’re outnumbered, Your Majesty.

772
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,080
They’re coming in as we speak.

773
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:54,159
Better leave now

00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:00,519

Follow me!

777
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:05,360
Yes!

778
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,159
Let’s go!

779
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,679
Off you go.

780
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,250
I’ll summon you again if necessary.

781
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,520
Yes!

782
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,159
Did she recognize me?

783
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:33,959
Qing An.

784
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,600

785
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:43,159

00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:34,159
He stood no chance in front of you.

853
00:50:35,959 --> 00:50:37,479
Lord, are you wounded?

854
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:39,639
Did that mob stab you?

855
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,159
Where’s his body?

856
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:42,800
I’ll make dozens of holes in him!

857
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,840
I’ve dumped him to the mass grave.

858
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:46,520
Dogs there will finish him for us.

859
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:48,959
That’d be great.

860
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:51,760
My lord, the physician is here.

861
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,360
That wound would be fatal

862
00:50:57,399 --> 00:50:59,120
if it had gone up half an inch

863
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,239
to the heart.

864
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,520
No one could do anything about it then.

865
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,600
I was too careless
to see through his trick

866
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,959
that got Lord stabbed.

867
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:13,919
We need more guards.

868
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,600
I have the skilled ones

869
00:51:15,879 --> 00:51:16,800
that Lord can use.

870
00:51:17,399 --> 00:51:18,040
No need.

871
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,280
I’m still breathing, right?

872
00:51:21,919 --> 00:51:22,760
Go back to rest.

873
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,320
Walk the physician out.

874
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

875
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,120
Qian!

876
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:50,199
Qian, we need to talk!

877
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,120
Was it you who saved me just now?

878
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,439
Yes. It was Qing An.

879
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,700
But that’s not the point.

880
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,840
The point is I want to be with him.

881
00:52:03,575 --> 00:52:07,200
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

882
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,520
Dongzhi,

883
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,399
what are you going to say to Father?

884
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,120
And you?

885
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,840
How are you going to handle it

886
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,239
when Mu’an and Yongqing
are at swords’ points?

887
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,600
Once we’re at war,

888
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,800
which side will you choose?

889
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,360
Dongdong and I are fully prepared.

890
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
No matter what happens

891
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,159
in the future,

892
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,439
we’ll never part.

893
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:57,150
That’s right. I know he’s the one.

894
00:52:57,879 --> 00:52:58,959
Nothing

895
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,600
will separate me from him.

896
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:14,200
Qian, if Father is against us,

897
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,439
you’ll have to speak for us.

898
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:22,560
I will.

899
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,280
You promise?

900
00:53:24,475 --> 00:53:25,050
I promise.

901
00:53:28,479 --> 00:53:30,925
See? I told you he’d help us!

902
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:33,525
He’s wounded.

903
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,040
Let him rest now.

904
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:36,775
Right.

905
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:38,000
Good night, Qian.

906
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,825
We’re leaving.

907
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:39,725
Hey.

908
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:43,120
Take good care of her.

909
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:45,900
I will.

910
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:49,120
Let’s go!

but you, Li Qian, can’t?

914
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,560
