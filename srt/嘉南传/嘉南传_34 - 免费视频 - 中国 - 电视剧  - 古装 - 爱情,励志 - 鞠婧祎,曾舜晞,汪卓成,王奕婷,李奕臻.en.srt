(Frank and Righteous)

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,160
It’s late now.

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,040
Why hasn’t he shown up?

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,880
Mr. Jin, don’t worry.

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,160
Come. Sit down.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,320
How can he treat us so disrespectfully?

33
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,360
Lord Xin attends
to a myriad of affairs daily.

34
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,160
It’s normal to delay

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,800
for a couple of hours.

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
He makes such a show of authority,

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,240
letting so many officials wait for him.

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,160
He was a little pawn in my charge.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,960
Marrying a princess

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,280
makes him so arrogant that
he wouldn’t treat us seriously again.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,480
Please be cautious with your words.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,440
You can’t just say whatever you want.

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,600
Why are you so afraid of him?

44
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,560
Over the years,
under the banner of helping the people,

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,400
he forced squires to donate grains.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
Other than that,

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,160
he also designs on the barracks.

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,040
Officers and men neither train
nor go to war.

49
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,400
They’re chained to a few mu of fields
to grow provisions and fodder,

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,840
yet he euphemistically calls it

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,120
self-sufficiency.

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,640
His decisions

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,200
have ruined many businessmen’s
chances of making profits.

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,160
We invited him over today

55
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,760
to ask a satisfactory explanation

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,520
from him.

57
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,160
- Yeah. Right.
- A satisfactory explanation.

58
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,760
Give us an explanation.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Definitely.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,160
Sir.

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,640
Lord Xin turned around and left

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,600
on arriving at the gate
of the government office.

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,480
What?

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,640
- Left?
- He left?

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,360
Well...

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,160
What does he want?

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,720
I heard from the guards at the gate
that Princess is missing.

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,800
He is going to look for his wife.

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,120
His wife?

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,600
At this moment?

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,880
At such a critical moment,

72
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,920
he keeps us waiting

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,920
just because of some domestic affairs.

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,240
Does he look down upon us or what?

75
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,920
We’ve been waiting for long.

76
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,680
Surely.

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,080
Do you come out yourself

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,760
or do I have to beg you?

79
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,360
Give me a little more time.

80
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,320
I’ll give you an explanation.

81
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,280
Where are they?

82
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,560
They got off when we arrived
at the entrance to the alley.

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,960
I don’t know where they went.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,920
Come.

85
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
You keep going.

86
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,480
Yes.

87
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,760
Go.

88
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,520
Come. Quick.

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,880
My lord.

90
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,040
Go to the capital city.

91
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,760
My lord.

92
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,000
Mr. Hu and Mr. Jin are waiting for you
at the government office.

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,880
I’m afraid it’s not a good time

94
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,720
to leave Bingzhou.

95
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,840
Send my orders.

96
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,400
Let Yun Lin take charge of
the military affairs

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,840
and Miss Dongzhi take charge of
the domestic affairs.

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,440
Wei Shu.

99
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,000
Take a troop

100
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,080
and go with me to get Princess back.

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,760
Yes.

102
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,760
We should leave now.

103
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
It’s inconvenient if you stay with me.

104
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,280
Go down two blocks and turn left.

105
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
When you arrive at Changle Inn,

106
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
there will be people to pick you up.

107
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,440
We have no time to lose.
I’ll see you, then.

108
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,040
- Go.
- Go.

109
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,200
(Unifon)

110
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,080
Sir, welcome to come again.

111
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,000
Thanks.

112
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Honored guests, please come in.

113
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,680
Come in and have a look.

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,640
(Anda Gate)

115
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,880
(Bingzhou City)

116
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,720
Where are they going?

117
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,760
What a powerful lineup!

118
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,880
Let me see the account books
of this month.

119
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,960
Yes, here you are.

120
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,840
Is that all?

121
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,720
Yes.

122
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,720
The business is booming recently.

123
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,160
Shanhu.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Can I help you?

125
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,880
I... I could use a drinking buddy.

126
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,200
Drinking buddy?

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,080
I’m just a drinking buddy?

128
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,040
Shall we have hot pot
if you don’t want to drink?

129
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,360
Find yourself a better buddy.

130
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,040
(Yunlai Inn)

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,160
Go to the carriage in the back.

132
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,760
There are many people here.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,360
Go to the carriage in the back.

134
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:32,800
Be careful.

135
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,560
Let me help.

136
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,400
Be careful.

137
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,440
Take care.

138
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,280
Slowly.

139
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,000
Be careful.

140
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,880
Why are there so many officers and men?

141
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,760
Excuse me, sir. What happened?

142
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,360
An important criminal wanted by the
imperial court escaped from prison.

143
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,360
I suspect

144
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,920
he is hiding

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,480
in your theatrical troupe.

146
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,280
My lord,

147
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,280
harboring criminals is a felony.

148
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,400
I dare not defy the law.

149
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,720
I won’t deliberately
find fault with you.

150
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,360
It’s easy to find out the truth.

151
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,360
Raise your head.

152
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,400
Baoning.

153
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Go home with me.

154
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,760
Come.

155
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Because of your help,

156
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,160
I left Bingzhou without a hitch.

157
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,360
It’s just a favor done at little cost.

158
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,800
You’re the one who

159
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,080
masterminded the scheme.

160
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,040
Now, Bingzhou is in Li Qian’s control.

161
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,280
Escaping under his nose

162
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,600
is not easy.

163
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
If you didn’t take every step
into account,

164
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,360
I’m afraid your trip wouldn’t be smooth.

165
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,360
The key is that you generously
allowed your men to help me.

166
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,920
Princess?

167
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,920
Princess?

168
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,000
Princess?

169
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,280
Go to Mr. Hu’s mansion

170
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,240
and tell Lord

171
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,280
that Princess is missing.

172
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,400
Go!

173
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,680
The singer, Qingke and Xiaoman

174
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,960
can only divert Li Qian’s attention
for a moment.

175
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,720
When he finds out he is cheated,

176
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
he’ll do all he can to chase me.

177
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,280
But he wouldn’t know

178
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
I didn’t go out of town at top speed.

179
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,400
Instead, I went back.

180
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,200
When he finds out
he falls into the trick,

181
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,640
it’s too late.

182
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
Li Qian is able enough and clever.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,320
He’s out of his wits only because

184
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
you’re the one he cares about most.

185
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,520
But I didn’t expect

186
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,360
the singer was yours.

187
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,360
It seems that the scene
which occurred at Qinfang Pavilion

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,640
was deliberately designed.

189
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,000
Baoning...

190
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,920
It doesn’t matter.

191
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,320
The collision between Li Qian and me

192
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,640
has nothing to do with the singer.

193
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,080
It’s about the resentments
between our former generation.

194
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,080
Whatever the truth is,

195
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
from the moment he ignored me,
questioned me,

196
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,440
and even imprisoned me,

197
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,320
we’ve had no future.

198
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
Uncle Jiang is of noble character
and high prestige.

199
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,480
I don’t think he would
massacre all the villagers.

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,640
Not everyone has the same
awareness as you do.

201
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,280
It’s not about awareness.

202
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,720
Baoning,

203
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,000
if you really love someone,

204
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,040
you’ll lose your way and all your sense.

205
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,920
Besides, it couldn’t be true.

206
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,840
Even if it was true,

207
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,640
he would leave all hatred behind.

208
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,720
It seems that

209
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,160
you’re not that important to Li Qian.

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,320
Qingke and Xiaoman...

211
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,480
I’ve sent my men to pick them up.

212
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,360
In a few days, you’ll reunite
in the capital city.

213
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,080
Thanks.

214
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,800
Sorry to trouble you
for the rest of the journey.

215
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,160
Let’s spare

216
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,680
the ceremony.

217
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,760
I’ll remember your kindness.

218
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,680
OK.

219
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,200
It’s getting late.

220
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,600
Let’s go.

221
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,720
Yes.

222
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,360
Tell me.

223
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,440
Who made you do this?

224
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,400
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,280
I’ll give you another chance.

226
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,400
Speak!

227
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,440
Who let you do this?

228
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,560
It’s...

229
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,680
It’s Princess.

230
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,680
I beg your pardon?

231
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,000
I said the truth. I dare not lie.

232
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,800
Princess said

233
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,880
as long as I followed her orders,

234
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,720
all the bank notes would be mine.

235
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,000
Where is she now?

236
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,400
I don’t know.

237
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,240
Miss, you can go now.

238
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,720
Thanks, my lord.

239
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,640
My lord,

240
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,560
Princess may be still in town.

241
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,040
Shall we go back to Bingzhou
and have a thorough search?

242
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,000
It’s too late.

243
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,400
She’s on the way back
to the capital city.

244
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,720
Are you sure?

245
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,280
We travel day and night.
We’re very fast.

246
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,560
I’ve thought it over and over,

247
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,360
but I still missed a step.

248
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,120
I don’t understand.

249
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,280
If you can figure it out,

250
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,800
you’ll be as smart

251
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,840
as to be the Lord Xin.

252
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,560
Let’s go to the capital city.

253
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,200
Hurry.

254
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,320
No.

255
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,240
No.

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,480
No.

257
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
I can’t go any further.

258
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,280
Get up.

259
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,960
If we get caught, we’re finished.

260
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
The pursuers have withdrawn.

261
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,400
We’ll be safe.

262
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,720
Everything goes as planned.

263
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,040
Hopefully,

264
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,000
Princess is out of town now.

265
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Changle Inn isn’t far away.

266
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,080
Let’s go.

267
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,160
(Qian, Father has left for the capital city.
He will arrive soon.)

268
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,720
My lord.

269
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,120
Is there an emergency?

270
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,520
No.

271
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,360
My father will arrive
in the capital city in a few days.

272
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,880
Master is coming, too?

273
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,400
He works in the capital city.

274
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,040
Surely he won’t
stay in Bingzhou for long.

275
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,840
We should accelerate the speed

276
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,120
and get to the capital city
before my father arrives.

277
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,520
Yes.

278
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,280
Do you have brush and ink?

279
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:11,880
Yes.

280
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,440
My lord.

281
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,840
Let’s be prepared.

282
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
We shouldn’t attract

283
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,760
too much attention in the capital city.

284
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,640
I’m going alone.

285
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,360
You send the memorial to His Majesty
at top speed.

286
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,440
Other men go back for now.

287
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,160
Yes.

288
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,240
Miss, you finally come back.

289
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,160
Does Empress Dowager say anything?

290
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,400
(Li Qian is back.)

291
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,160
If he’s meant to come,

292
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,520
he’ll come at last.

293
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,600
Sugar-coated haws.

294
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,840
Sugar-coated haws.

295
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,640
Sugar-coated haws.

296
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,880
Stop!

297
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,040
Stop!

298
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,119
Don’t run!

299
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:22,200
(Rain Sound Pavilion)

300
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,360
(Come in for a talk
if you want your moneybag.)

301
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,320
Who is it?

302
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,440
Gao Miaorong?

303
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,160
I didn’t expect you to remember me.

304
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,960
You racked your brains to lure me here,

305
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,520
just to prove whether I remember you?

306
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Qian,

307
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,680
how are you doing these years?

308
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
It’s none of

309
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,600
your business.

310
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,240
We grew up together.

311
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,160
Have you forgotten

312
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,000
our friendship from childhood?

313
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,840
You’ve been a stranger to me

314
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,000
since the day you were driven out
of the Li Family.

315
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,120
Aren’t you curious

316
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,320
how I’ve survived these years?

317
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,680
I’m not interested.

318
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,680
My moneybag.

319
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,680
You haven’t changed at all.

320
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,560
Is the moneybag

321
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,600
embroidered by her?

322
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,880
Give it back to me.

323
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
You love her so much,

324
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,080
yet she doesn’t love you back,

325
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,440
otherwise,
she won’t run out of Li’s Mansion.

326
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,800
Gao Miaorong,

327
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,040
don’t try to bewitch me

328
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,360
with your usual tricks.

329
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,640
They don’t work.

330
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,200
All right.

331
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,280
Let’s put our cards on the table.

332
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,320
I live in the palace now

333
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,280
and I’ve won the trust
of Empress Dowager.

334
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,240
If you want,

335
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,160
I’ll help you.

336
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,080
I won’t ask a tiger for its skin.

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,600
We’d better keep a distance.

338
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,760
Goodbye.

339
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,560
Qian.

340
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,440
I’m forced by Empress Dowager.

341
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,640
The storm is approaching.

342
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,720
No one can hide from it.

343
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,400
Baoning,

344
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,120
the attendants just picked these.

345
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,920
Would you like to try it?

346
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,240
Thanks.

347
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,160
What’s wrong?

348
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,480
It’s sour.

349
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,280
This one is sweet. Try this.

350
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,000
Never mind.

351
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,120
It’s a little sour,

352
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,520
but it’s fruity.

353
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,080
Sorry.

354
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,720
I forgot I had a bite of it.

355
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,240
The journey is hard.

356
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,480
It’s lucky to have

357
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,560
such fresh fruits,

358
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,320
no matter

359
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,440
they’re sour or sweet.

360
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,360
Why are you smiling?

361
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,840
You looked cute just now.

362
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,440
Don’t give me

363
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
another speech concerning etiquette.

364
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,120
If it hadn’t been for the accidents,

365
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,560
you’d have already been my wife.

366
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Things change.

367
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,760
We are both fooled by fate.

368
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,160
I’m not reconciled to it.

369
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,640
You’re just not reconciled.

370
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,760
No, I’m not.

371
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,080
You’re not happy with Li Qian.

372
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,560
It’s been years

373
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,160
but he still suspects you

374
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,920
just because of a jade pendant
or a few words.

375
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,360
Aren’t you sad?

376
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
Every time when you’re sad,

377
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,120
I want to go back to the past.

378
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,280
If I had tried harder

379
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,840
or tried my best in the first place,

380
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,080
would it be different now?

381
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,920
You really should let it go

382
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,520
and find your own happiness.

383
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,480
Baoning,

384
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,320
the happiness I’m seeking for
is close at hand.

385
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,320
Even though I can’t get it now,

386
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,480
I’ll keep waiting.

387
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,920
We’ll arrive in the capital city
in half an hour.

388
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,080
I’ll escort you to the palace gate.

389
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,840
After that, we have to go separate ways.

390
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,920
If you have any problems,

391
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
send someone for me at any time.

392
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,160
Baoning, remember,

393
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,680
no matter how long it takes,

394
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,160
I’ll be waiting for you.

395
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,880
I come back after so long.

396
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,440
I wonder how Grandmother is.

397
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,240
Your Highness.

398
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,320
Why is it so bitter?

399
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,800
I don’t want it.

400
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,240
How can you not take the medicine?

401
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,200
I won’t take it.

402
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,800
Stewardess Meng, wait for a minute

403
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,520
until Her Highness doesn’t cough.

404
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,240
You’re not getting better
after taking so much medicine.

405
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,840
Should I

406
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,280
ask Chief Physician Tian
to come over again?

407
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,480
Don’t bother.

408
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,360
It’s old disease.

409
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,560
Even god can’t help me.

410
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,200
I just wonder if I can see Baoning again

411
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,640
before I die.

412
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,000
I’m going to write a letter

413
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
and have it sent to Princess.

414
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,360
No!

415
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,120
They’ve just had a few quiet days.

416
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
Yes.

417
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,720
If you don’t want me to write,
I will not.

418
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,080
Baoning is back.

419
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,880
Su, don’t lie to me.

420
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,080
Princess is really back!

421
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,160
You both are...

422
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,440
Grandmother.

423
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,880
Baoning.

424
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,720
Baoning!

425
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,160
Is that you?

426
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Yes.

427
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,240
I’m not in a dream, am I?

428
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,840
No, you’re not.

429
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,000
How do you get sick?

430
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,440
It doesn’t matter.

431
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,280
Just an ailment.

432
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,680
Has the chief physician come to see you?

433
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,560
Yes. He prescribed a prescription.

434
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,800
We’re nursing her.

435
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,320
You come back so abruptly.

436
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,480
Why don’t you send us a word?

437
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,960
I wanted to surprise you,

438
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
not expecting I’m surprised.

439
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,560
Have you taken medicine?

440
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,240
Where’s the medicine?

441
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
She’s just taken half of it.

442
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,680
Bring me the medicine.

443
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,040
I’ll take it.

444
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,560
Yes.

445
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Princess is really the apple
of Her Highness’s eye.

446
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,400
- As soon as Princess comes back,
- Be careful.

447
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,040
Her Highness improves
in spirit immediately.

448
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,080
Come.

449
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,600
Tell me the truth.

450
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,960
How’s Grandmother these years?

451
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
Her health is unstable.

452
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,760
It’s hard to say.

453
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,440
Where’s Li Qian?

454
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,040
He...

455
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,760
Doesn’t he come back with you?

456
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:39,960
He...

457
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,920
Grandmother.

458
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,840
Baoning and I
arrived in the capital city together.

459
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,120
May Grandmother stay healthy.

460
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,280
Get up. Get up.

461
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,600
Baoning, what’s wrong?

462
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,920
Baoning was anxious to see Grandmother.

463
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,240
She made a hurried journey without stop.

464
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,600
I think she’s tired.

465
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,640
You silly girl.

466
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,040
You’re stubborn.

467
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,120
If you get sick because of tiredness,

468
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,400
all of us will worry about you.

469
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,280
Grandmother,

470
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,640
don’t worry.

471
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,960
Baoning has been well these years.

472
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,840
I assume her spirit will recover

473
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,080
after a few hours of resting.

474
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Okay. Okay.

475
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,720
Li Qian, take your wife back.

476
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,160
Have a good rest

477
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,800
before you come again to see me.

478
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,960
Go.

479
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,760
I’m not leaving.

480
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,960
Baoning.

481
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,000
Grandmother just took her medicine.

482
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,280
You’ll only disturb her

483
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,800
if you stay here.

484
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,400
Yes.

485
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I’m sick.

486
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,120
I don’t want you to be affected.

487
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,840
You’re frail.

488
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,360
Li Qian, take your wife back.

489
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,880
Come to see me when I get better.

490
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,800
Let’s go.

491
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,040
Go ahead.

492
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,360
Take care of yourself.

493
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,800
I’m waiting upon Her Highness.
Don’t worry.

494
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,560
Fangling.

495
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,080
Su.

496
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,920
What a pleasant surprise!

497
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,280
I finally saw Baoning.

498
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,200
(Shoukang Palace)

499
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,640
Enough.

500
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,200
What are you doing?

501
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,200
Jiang Baoning.

502
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,800
You left Bingzhou without a word.

503
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,560
Do you know how worried I am?

504
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,920
If by any chance you’re in danger,

505
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,000
tell me,

506
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,680
what are you going to do?

507
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,640
It’s none of your business.

508
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,920
None of my business?

509
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,920
You’re my wife.

510
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,040
I’m no longer your wife
since the moment I left Bingzhou.

511
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,160
Was it your own decision?

512
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Have you asked for my agreement?

513
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,640
Of course it’s my own decision.

514
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,160
Why should I ask you?

515
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,560
Do you have to be at odds with me?

516
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,040
Come on,

517
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,880
why don’t you leave me alone?

518
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,320
Fine.

519
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,920
Let’s go home and have a talk.

520
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
I’m not going with you.

521
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,040
Go home!

522
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,520
I...

523
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,040
Do you disgust me so much?

524
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,120
We would never be the same as before.

525
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,280
When you come down,

526
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,720
I’ll come to see you.

527
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,200
Don’t come again.

528
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,800
I must come.

529
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,400
Su.

530
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,520
What’s bothering you again?

531
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,640
Not knowing the details of
Baoning and Li Qian’s arguments,

532
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,400
I’d better not tell him,
lest he get worried.

533
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,800
Nothing.

534
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,840
I probably didn’t sleep well last night.

535
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
I feel sleepy.

536
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,760
You should go to sleep, then.

537
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,960
Wendie,

538
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,880
help madam go to bed.

539
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,720
What’s up?

540
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,600
Something is wrong at the charity house.

541
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,520
You should go and have a look.

542
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,520
Go.

543
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,080
Don’t kill me. Don’t kill me.

544
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,360
What’s wrong?

545
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,720
You finally come, Dongzhi.

546
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,840
What happened?

547
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,480
Aunt. Aunt.

548
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,880
- No. No one will kill you.
- Don’t kill me.

549
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,040
No one will kill you.

550
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,840
Don’t worry.

551
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,080
It’s all right. All right.

552
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,040
No one will kill you.

553
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,280
What happened?

554
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,000
The curtain caught fire
when she lit a candle.

555
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,280
She got crazy on seeing the fire.

556
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,120
Did you put out the fire?

557
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,080
Of course we did.

558
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,920
Was anyone hurt?

559
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,920
No, there wasn’t.

560
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,960
It’s all right. It’s all right.

561
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,960
Don’t kill me. Don’t kill me.

562
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,000
It’s all right.

563
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,080
Don’t kill me.

564
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,560
Dongdong.

565
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,480
Qing An. Come here.

566
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,560
You are strong.

567
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,520
Carry her back to her room.

568
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,520
Okay.

569
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,720
- Don’t kill me.
- It’s all right.

570
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,400
It’s all right.

571
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,480
Don’t kill me.

572
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,840
- Don’t be afraid.
- Everyone, go back to your room.

573
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,520
Don’t be afraid.

574
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
- Go back.
- Everyone, go back.

575
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,560
Go back.

576
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,280
It’s all right.

577
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,680
Fire.

578
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,120
Fire.

579
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,800
Come.

580
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,280
Come.

581
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,440
Aunt.

582
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:33,840
Come.

583
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,680
Get her!

584
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,200
Yes!

585
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,000
Go!

586
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,240
Stop!

587
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,400
Stop!

588
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,800
Help!

589
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,280
Don’t kill me!

590
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,440
Don’t kill me!

591
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,760
(Princess Yong’an’s Mansion)

592
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,120
Baoning.

593
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,160
Father, you’re home.

594
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,840
Have you been naughty?

595
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,320
No, father.

596
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Come on, let’s go inside.

597
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,280
Father, have you brought me gifts?

598
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,120
Of course.

599
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,680
Great.

600
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,360
Father, a little higher.

601
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,880
Baoning, why don’t you write
the other half of your name?

602
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,000
Father, it’s too difficult.

603
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,400
I don’t know how to write it.

604
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,360
You must learn it.

605
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,760
It’s your name.

606
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,440
Come on.

607
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,400
Father,

608
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,000
can you make me

609
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,120
another name that’s easy to write?

610
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,840
I have an idea.

611
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,240
What is it?

612
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Jiang Yi.

613
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,400
The character of Yi

614
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,560
only has one stroke.

615
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,480
Isn’t it great?

616
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,720
You’re such a lazy girl.

617
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,400
It’s easy to write.

618
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,440
Yes.

619
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,880
Silly girl.

620
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,800
I’m not silly at all.

621
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,920
Father.

622
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,040
I won’t let you suffer injustice.

623
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,880
Uncle, may you stay healthy.

624
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,120
I need your confirmation on one thing.

625
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,360
(Li’s Mansion)

626
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,200
Father.

627
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,960
Qian.

628
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,000
Why are you back?

629
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,760
Are you back by an imperial edict?

630
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,960
No.

631
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,560
Getting in the capital city without
an imperial edict is a capital offense.

632
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,440
You...

633
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,600
I come to get Baoning back.

634
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,800
Ridiculous!

635
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,320
How many stupid things

636
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,760
do you have to do for her?

637
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,680
Father.

638
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,800
What happened to Princess?

639
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
Get back to Bingzhou now.

640
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,800
Father.

641
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,120
Where are you going?

642
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,160
To the palace.

643
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,200
What do you want to do?

644
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,040
To seek justice.

645
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,520
Seek...

646
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,240
- What justice?
- Father.

647
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,120
You can’t go to the palace.

648
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,920
The grievance of our family

649
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,520
has been buried for 20 years.

650
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,440
I must go to the palace to seek justice.

651
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,440
You just said Jiang Baoning was back.

652
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,760
I’ll argue with her in the court.

653
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,240
I want justice for your late mother.

654
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,040
I want to know if the imperial family

655
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,920
will shield Jiang Baoning again.

656
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,240
Whatever the truth is,

657
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,840
I won’t let you hurt Baoning again.

658
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,360
Is your head crushed?

659
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,800
You’re such an unfilial son.

660
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,080
Beauty makes you blind.
You don’t know right from wrong.

661
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,200
For the daughter of our enemy,

662
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,800
you dare disobey your father.

663
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,560
Baoning and I have a
right and legal marriage.

664
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,200
Divorce her!

665
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,440
No!

666
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:37,920
You...

667
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,720
I know

668
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,120
you suspect Jiang Baoning’s father

669
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,160
was the murderer of Zhang Xiuhe.

670
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,840
You let Qian divorce Baoning.

671
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,800
You also want to make a scene
in the palace

672
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,720
to redress the grievance
for Zhang Xiuhe.

673
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,480
You are quite clever.

674
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,480
You’ve figured everything out.

675
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,080
Do you think I’m really stupid?

676
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,800
I’m telling you,

677
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,080
Zhang Xiuhe is important to you

678
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,200
and your mind is totally
set on avenging her.

679
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,920
- I can accept that.
- You...

680
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,640
But if you risk all the lives of
our family

681
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,560
to avenge her,

682
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,800
I won’t allow it.

683
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,440
What kind of the family
are you going to oppose?

684
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
It’s a noble family which
has made notable exploits.

685
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,000
Jiang Zhenying already
died for the country.

686
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,400
Even if he’s still alive,

687
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,840
how do you seek justice?

688
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,080
Use the jade pendant in your hand?

689
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,960
Your words are

690
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,400
shortsighted views.

691
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,920
What did you say?

692
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,280
Tell you what, Li Changqing.

693
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,360
- Even if Jiang Zhenying was a murderer,
- You...

694
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,400
what can you do?

695
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,720
He already died.

696
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,080
How do you seek justice from a dead man?

697
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,520
Are you going to dig out his body,

698
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,240
whip it, and dismember it?

699
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,120
Why not?

700
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,920
Of course you can’t.

701
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,200
He is Jiang Baoning’s father.

702
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,080
So what?

703
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,440
Jiang Baoning

704
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,360
is the apple of Qian’s eye.

705
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,720
To marry her took him a lot of trouble
and drained his property.

706
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,960
They love each other deeply.

707
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,120
You know that.

708
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,760
You’re talking about revenge
without rhyme or reason.

709
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,400
Have you considered their feelings?

710
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,720
He Cuihua.

711
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,360
I think you are reluctant to

712
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,000
drive your noble daughter-in-law away.

713
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,600
You’re afraid Grand Empress Dowager

714
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,600
will blame it on you.

715
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,520
It’s not you who are dead!

716
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,920
Father.

717
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,880
Li Changqing.

718
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,800
Could you say anything reasonable?

719
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,080
If I were the one who died,

720
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,440
as long as my children
are healthy and happy,

721
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,720
knowing that in the nether world,

722
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,320
I will never let the living

723
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,000
avenge me.

724
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,520
Father.

725
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,520
Mother.

726
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,680
Don’t thank me.

727
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,440
I just

728
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,800
don’t want our high position
and great wealth to be ruined

729
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,480
by those old stories.

730
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,800
Put it away.

731
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,040
Thank you.

732
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,800
(Shoukang Palace)

733
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,400
You precious darling.

734
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,040
Lord comes.

735
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,920
Grandmother.

736
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,840
Your Highness. Lord comes.

737
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,280
I’m honored to see Grandmother.

738
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,760
Grandmother.

739
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,120
This is figwort of Changbai Mountain.

740
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,840
It’s good for clearing heat
and nourishing.

741
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,840
I think it may help you to recover,

742
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,920
so I bring it to you.

743
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,720
Good.

744
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,920
It’s nice of you to think about me.

745
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,360
Take a seat.

746
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,440
Baoning.

747
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,200
It’s getting cold.

748
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,680
Why don’t you wear more clothes?

749
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,480
It’s warm in the room.

750
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,040
It doesn’t matter.

751
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
You may catch a cold.

752
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,440
Grandmother.

753
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,000
I won’t disturb you any longer.

754
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,440
Have a good rest.

755
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,400
Okay.

756
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,760
Baoning.

757
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,600
Put on more clothes.

758
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,040
I’m really

759
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,600
feeling my age now.

760
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,960
Usually at this time,

761
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,840
we can play a few rounds of cards.

762
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,520
Have a good sleep today.

763
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,480
Refresh yourself.

764
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,160
We can play as many rounds
as you want tomorrow.

765
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,160
Take care.

766
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,840
Sit, Baoning.

767
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,840
I have something to talk with you.

768
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,280
In our life,

769
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,280
we’ll suffer grievances unavoidably.

770
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,520
Sometimes, even if you’re right,

771
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,920
you have to swallow

772
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
some pain and grievance.

773
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,360
Seeking perfection in everything

774
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,560
and having everything as you wish

775
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,640
are impossible.

776
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Heaven will give you something

777
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,040
and also take something away from you.

778
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,440
After all, it’s fair.

779
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,960
I understand.

780
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,400
Grandmother’s health is no longer good.

781
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,800
After all, she’s getting old.

782
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,960
Come and see her more when you get time.

783
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,080
As soon as she sees you,

784
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,680
her spirit improves.

785
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,280
Baoning,

786
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,880
I have something to ask you.

787
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,320
You must tell me the truth.

788
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,640
Of course. Shoot.

789
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,560
The other day, you and Li Qian...

790
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,920
I saw you.

791
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,120
What’s going on between you?

792
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,880
Do you think

793
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,600
Grandmother noticed it, too?

794
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,880
I know you don’t want her to know

795
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,360
lest she’ll be worried.

796
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,320
Anyway, you should tell me.

797
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,080
Maybe I can give you some advice.

798
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,720
All right.

799
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,200
Let me tell you.

800
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,400
Miss. Miss.

801
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,320
Are you sure of it?

802
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,360
Everyone in Shoukang Palace saw it.

803
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,440
Princess Jia’nan and Lord Xin

804
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,600
were pleasing Grand Empress Dowager.

805
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,760
They are close.

806
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,120
I’m afraid Empress Dowager
won’t give up easily.

807
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,000
He really wronged you this time.

808
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,440
But he followed you here
regardless of everything.

809
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,840
He really cares about you.

810
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,840
Let bygones be bygones.

811
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,400
Your future matters more.

812
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,040
After all, you’ve been through
so many difficulties

813
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,440
to get together.

814
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,720
But what I mind most is

815
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,880
that he doesn’t believe me at all,

816
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,080
or my father, either.

817
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,960
Inside him, he thought

818
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,400
my father was that kind of man

819
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,280
who would slaughter the villagers.

820
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,640
Shall I ask Cao Xuan
to have a talk with Lord Xin?

821
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,880
No.

822
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,200
I don’t want to bother you.

823
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,000
You should go home now.

824
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,720
Cao Xuan is waiting for you.

825
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,360
I’m sorry to keep you waiting.

826
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,560
Lord Xin went to the Palace
this evening.

827
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,840
He and Baoning

828
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,760
talked with Grand Empress Dowager
for a while.

829
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,760
It doesn’t matter.

830
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,240
I haven’t read The Miscellany of Mu’an
for a long time.

831
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,280
I find it quite interesting

832
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,240
when I read it again today.

833
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,040
By the way,

834
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,040
how are Princess and Lord Xin?

835
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,640
It’s been years.

836
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,120
Are they fine?

837
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,680
There seems

838
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,200
to be something wrong with them.

839
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,720
We must find a way to help them.

840
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,520
Your Highness.

841
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,720
I’m privileged to see Your Highness.

842
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,120
What can I do for Your Highness?

843
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,560
What do you think you can do?

844
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,040
Of course it concerns Li Qian.

845
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,040
How is it going on your end?

846
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,440
When can we give him a heavy blow?

847
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,600
As a seignior,

848
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,360
Li Qian comes to the capital city

849
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,480
without an imperial edict,
which is a felony,

850
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,640
not to mention that I’ve got

851
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,160
the impeachment letters
from the officials of Bingzhou.

852
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,720
As long as
we present those to His Majesty,

853
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,360
he won’t get away with it.

854
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,360
Why don’t you do it, then?

855
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,720
Your Highness, don’t worry.

856
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,120
We’ll denounce his crimes
at the grand court session,

857
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,440
humiliating him
in front of all officials.

858
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,720
That would be much more fun.

859
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,200
I’ve been planning for a long time.

860
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,360
Even if he is infinitely resourceful,

861
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,160
it’s hard to reverse the case.

862
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,520
It’s up to you, then.

863
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,440
I’m looking forward to your good news.

864
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,600
- Cao.
- Li.

865
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,480
Long time no see.

866
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,320
Sure, we haven’t
seen each other for years.

867
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,440
Come on, take a seat.

868
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,560
No, thanks.

869
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,520
Cao.

870
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,680
Actually, I have

871
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,720
a very important thing

872
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,920
to discuss over with you.

873
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,160
About you and Princess,

874
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,440
Su told me.

875
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,600
That’s not why I’m here today.

876
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,120
Cao.

877
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,760
You know I haven’t
been in the capital city for long.

878
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,040
Besides, I’m a military officer.

879
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,600
Most civil officials

880
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,120
in the imperial court are unknown to me.

881
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,080
You’re born and raised here

882
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
in a noble family.

883
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,200
You’re very popular.

884
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,320
Could you introduce me to the officials?

885
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,760
It’s a piece of cake.

886
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:41,880
I’d love to help you out.

887
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,480
Come on.
Let’s sit down and have a good talk.

888
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,560
That’s great.

889
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,280
Come on.

890
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,880
(Li’s Mansion)

891
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,720
- Li.
- My lord.

892
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,760
Mr. Li.

893
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,560
Mr. Li.

894
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,280
Please.

895
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,160
Please.

896
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,400
(Mei’s Mansion)
We shall leave now.

897
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,400
See you again.

898
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:10,960
Mr. Yang,

899
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,760
I’ll resign myself to your guidance
from now on.

900
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,760
Me too, my lord.

901
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,160
(Changle Inn)
I’m sorry to bother you, Cao.

902
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,120
You helped us a lot before.

903
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,280
It’s my pleasure to return you a favor.

904
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,720
You’re both of quiet nature.

905
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,840
Your life must be peaceful.

906
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,160
We shouldn’t expect more than that.

907
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,040
A peaceful life is a blessing.

908
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,400
Many people desire such a life.

909
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,080
In fact, it’s the easiest thing.

910
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,520
If you both take a step back,

911
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,720
all the problems will be solved.

912
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,800
It’s not that easy.

913
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,080
Ahead is my mansion.

914
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,160
Have a cup of tea with me, will you?

915
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,120
I’d better accept your invitation.

916
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,120
Let’s go.

917
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,880
In the end, he was startled.

918
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,360
Had Lord Cao
done such a ridiculous thing?

919
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,240
I have to go.

920
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,560
Baoning.

921
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,400
You’re my guest.

922
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,800
He’s Cao Xuan’s guest.

923
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,200
Can you stay

924
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,440
a little longer for my sake?

925
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,080
Sit down.

926
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,640
It’s all right.

927
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,520
My lord.

928
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,960
Your gracious presence

929
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,720
has added glitters to our humble house.

930
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,840
I’m going to the kitchen
to get food prepared.

931
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,200
I’ll go with you.

932
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,440
Cao.

933
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,280
Li.

934
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,640
Let’s go, Su.

935
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,600
Hopefully, they’ll talk things through

936
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,440
and mend the rift.

937
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,520
Sit down, Su.

938
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,240
Baoning.

939
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,920
Don’t call me.

940
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
From now on,

941
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,400
let’s just act

942
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,200
in front of Grandmother.

943
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,680
Other times,

944
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,880
you don’t have to put on an act.

945
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,200
I have to go.

946
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,720
Wasn’t my father
the murderer of your mother?

947
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,720
Why do you pull me?

948
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,200
(Orchid’s Aroma Drifts in Wind)

949
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,000
She’s coming, Su.

950
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,240
Why did you come out alone?

951
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,000
Where’s Li Qian?

952
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,840
Don’t do such things again.

953
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,720
I’ve broken up with him.

954
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,800
I don’t want to see him again.

955
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,360
Walk Princess out.

956
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,080
I’m going to see Lord Xin.

957
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,080
Yes.

958
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:08,720
(Lord Cao’s Mansion)

959
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,960
It seems I came at the right time.

960
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,200
How do you know I’m here?

961
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,920
I didn’t see you in the palace.

962
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,240
Stewardess Meng told me.

963
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,240
Are you leaving?

964
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,360
Let me give you a ride.

965
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,640
