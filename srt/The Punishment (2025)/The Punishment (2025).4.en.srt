00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,070
demoted to my department

190
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,530
because you made mistakes?

191
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,790
-You made mistakes.
-Yes, I got demoted.

192
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,750
So,

193
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,750
control your temper.

194
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,070
Don't make any more mistakes,

195
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,000
or you might get demoted again.

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,060
That won't happen.

197
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,600
Tao,

198
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,630
keep an eye on him.

199
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,630
Don't worry. I can keep him in check.

200
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,050
Captain Zhong, take it easy.
Don't hurt yourself.

201
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,910
Captain Zhong.

202
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,480
Thank you.

203
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,910
You're in great shape.

204
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,620
Here, Captain Zhong.

205
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,260
Okay.

206
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Thank you.

207
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,660
How does it feel

208
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,300
on your first day back?

209
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,370
The atmosphere at the Municipal Bureau

210
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,360
is really great.

211
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,360
We were just talking about it.

212
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,550
I said, with such a good atmosphere,

213
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,940
you can tell at a glance it's a team
led by Captain Zhong.

214
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,400
Enough. Enough.

215
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,170
S-Stop flattering me.

216
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,500
Qin.

217
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,230
Since you're back now,

218
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,270
let me be frank with you.

219
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,720
From now on,

220
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,980
you need to forget
those police station methods.

221
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,090
Yes.

222
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,750
I want to make my position
clear to you, Captain Zhong.

223
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,870
Although

224
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,180
Director Ye transferred me here,

225
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,390
since I'm in your department now

226
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,670
and under your command,

227
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm your soldier.

228
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,260
I'll go wherever you point me.

229
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,750
I'll follow all your orders.

230
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,840
Good.

231
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,990
With that commitment,

232
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,670
I'll be completely
straightforward with you.

233
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,390
Come on.

234
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,030
-Sit down. Let's sit down and talk.
-Thank you, Captain Zhong.

235
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,550
Qin.

236
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,240
What do you think

237
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,120
about the case
Captain Hu discussed

238
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,270
with you earlier?

239
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,400
Captain Zhong,

240
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,640
honestly, I haven't figured out

241
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,380
how to handle this case yet.

242
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,840
Just tell me what you're thinking.

243
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,040
Actually, this case mainly depends on

244
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,440
the missing Wang Ming.

245
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,140
But I checked before

246
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,820
and he was taken away
by two police officers.

247
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,690
But there's something
complicated

248
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,650
about this.

249
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,980
Tell me about it.

250
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,270
Captain Zhong.

251
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,230
How about this?

252
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,400
This case is indeed quite significant.

253
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,260
I'll go back and investigate further.

254
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,660
I'll report to you
as soon as I have results.

255
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,170
Quite significant?

256
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,390
How significant is it?

257
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,600
This case, well...

258
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,650
Keep your voice down.

259
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,660
Well,

260
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,260
these two people...

261
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,290
They're fake police officers.

262
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:09,910
Yes.

263
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,350
What's so secretive about that?

264
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,090
This is a very serious offense.

265
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,050
How much evidence do you have?

266
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,310
We have some. Show it to Captain Zhong.

267
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,960
Here, Captain Zhong.

268
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,220
Captain Zhong, you see—

269
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,150
even the badge numbers are fake.

270
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,440
This matter must be
thoroughly investigated.

271
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
-Yes.
-You need to take this seriously.

272
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,300
Right, I'm investigating it now.

273
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,580
Well then.

274
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,430
I'll think about this carefully.

275
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,840
If you can

276
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,870
dig up more

277
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,390
valuable clues,

278
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,780
it'll be easier for me
to talk to the leadership.

279
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,840
-Thank you, Captain Zhong.
-You have to get to the bottom of it.

280
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,800
Yes, we will.

281
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,440
Okay. Alright.

282
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,270
I'll get back to work now.

283
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,070
Please go ahead, Captain Zhong.

284
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,220
Okay.

285
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,720
I never noticed
when we were at the station

286
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,150
that you, with your honest face,

287
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,480
were so good
at providing emotional support.

288
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,860
Are you managing up?

289
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,550
Managing up

290
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,390
is about the "up."

291
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,140
When I was at the station,
where was there any room to manage up?

292
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,930
Then later, give me
some emotional support

293
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,730
and manage me.

294
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,990
You don't need it.

295
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,250
Why wouldn't I need it?

296
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,480
What if I become a captain one day?

297
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,200
Right?

298
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,820
The way you exercise now
is very captain-like.

299
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,510
[Billiards Is a Way of Life.]

300
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,240
Sir.

301
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,420
Get me some tokens.

302
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,270
Coming.

303
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,020
Tianfei.

304
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Want more tokens?

305
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,810
You still owe me 80,000.

306
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,840
So,

307
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,870
are you going to keep playing?

308
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,200
Stop talking and hurry up.

309
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,390
Bring some tokens over.

310
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,360
Bring plenty.

311
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:49,580
[Billiards Is a Way of Life.]

312
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,490
Win more, okay?

313
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,270
Scar,

314
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,360
y-you're out!

315
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,120
Don't mention this to me.

316
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,390
Xiang took the blame.

317
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,700
He got locked up instead.

318
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,260
Tianfei?

319
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,510
Come with us.

320
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,020
[Rome Hotel]

321
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,770
Bo,

322
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,920
he's here.

323
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,210
You're here, Tianfei.

324
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
What's going on?

325
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,960
If you have business, talk to my brother.

326
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,290
Why are you grabbing me?

327
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,810
I don't owe you money.

328
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,840
How much does he owe you?

329
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,870
Mr. Luo, he's 80,000 short with me.

330
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,720
Go get 80,000.

331
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,830
Take it.

332
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,750
I'll take it then.

333
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,230
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

334
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,830
You can go.

335
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,040
Tianfei.

336
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,910
Now you owe me money.

337
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,930
My rule here is

338
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,440
10,000 yuan per finger.

339
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,910
Which two fingers do you want to keep?

340
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,600
Quite a temper you have.

341
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,600
You agree that paying debts
is only right, don't you?

342
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,260
Yes.

343
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,920
Nothing wrong with that.

344
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,620
But it's not that I don't
want to pay you back.

345
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,670
My money...

346
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,770
My money is tied up in the stock market.

347
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,580
How could you
get stuck in this bull market?

348
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,180
Did you buy high and sell low?

349
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,970
You know your stuff.

350
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,990
You trade stocks too?

351
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,640
Then

352
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,390
give me some tips.

353
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,540
Don't buy blindly anymore.

354
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,060
I'll give you tips on what to buy next.

355
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,470
Okay.

356
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,360
Let's get back to the 80,000 yuan.

357
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,620
Actually, we can still negotiate.

358
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,830
About the land,

359
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,890
help me figure something out.

360
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,880
The land...

361
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,860
Coming to me about land issues is useless.

362
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,620
I have no say in Longwan.

363
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,070
Madam Wen and Tianye are in charge there.

364
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,290
It's pointless to come to me.

365
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,160
I-I'm nobody.

366
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
Does he think I'm joking?

367
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,740
Is it because I don't look

368
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,850
tough enough?

369
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,000
Stop joking.

370
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,100
Go bring him.

371
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:44,810
Hurry up.

372
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,570
How much does he owe?

373
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,260
10,000.

374
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,820
Hold his hand here.

375
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,960

Did they find the culprit?

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,660
They made a sketch back then,

432

but it was too vague to identify anyone.

433
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,340
So the case was left unsolved.

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,120
That's a win?

563
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:10,870

The dealer here is too... well,

570
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,500
how about getting
a pretty female dealer next time?

571
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,110
Well...

572
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,940
That's a good point.

573
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,270
Come on.

574
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,830
Deal the cards and let's continue.

575
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,520
These mobile gambling operations
are hard to catch.

576

how to get us
inside to investigate.

578
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,210
This Ye Siyuan

579
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,610
is Ye Tianyou's nephew

580
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,640
and they're as close as father and son.

581
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,530
Ye Siyuan causes no major troubles

582
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,930
but plenty of minor ones.

583

585
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,690
to give him some leeway.

586
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,540
That means if we want to
keep Ye Tianyou stable,

587
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,040
this man is the key person.

590
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,080
After interacting
with this person, I found

591
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,740

592
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,890

593
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,910
It's impossible to get along with him.

594
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,160
Even if you can't get along with him,

595
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,020
you must try,

596
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,750
and become good friends, even brothers.

597
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,510
It's impossible to become brothers
with someone like him.

With Ye Siyuan,
you can play the long game.

The most important thing now

602
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,820
is to solve Longwan's problem first.

603

What else do you need me to do?

619
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,600
Longwan refuses to lease the land.

620
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,770
Many people must be unhappy about it.

It's one thing that Zhao Peng
won't cooperate with us,

but he's also helping Ma Jin against us.

we fear nothing.

I want to cooperate with Zhao Village.

763

makes me upset.

First, you need to prove
your loyalty to them.

Zhao Peng loves his son
more than anything.

905
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,000
Would he actually let his son
fall into Longwan's hands?

906
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,150
Their whole village
will deliberately come make trouble.

907
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,150
That will prove the two villages
can't work together.

908
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,960
Isn't that too high a price to pay
for this gesture of loyalty?

909
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,760
Is it worth it?

910
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,640
It's worth it.

911
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,900
This way,

912
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,070
Luo Bo will think
he's cut off our livelihood.

913
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,360
But he would never expect

914
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,630
that I'll eventually return Zhao Wenxuan.

915
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,670
I not only want you
to gain Luo Bo's trust,

916
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,740
but also to bring me

917
