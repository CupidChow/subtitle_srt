380
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,600
what would I gain from that?

381

411
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,760
He's a heinous criminal.

412

you were full of passion,

566
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,970
someone who would

567
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,960
risk their life for the police force.

568
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,160
Please stop, Director Ye.

569
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,760
I don't deserve such praise.

570
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,480
Actually, you know

571
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,350
my background well.

572
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,030
I've worked my way up

573
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,360
step by step to reach my current position.

574
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,360
I love my job.

575
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,280
I deeply cherish
the police uniform I wear.

576
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,270
It started with a mistake I made at work.

577
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,239
They used it to threaten me.

578
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,210
I was just hoping to get away with it.

579
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,290
But I got in deeper and deeper.

580
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,920
Actually,

581
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,620
when the incident with Xiong Chao
at the hospital happened, I knew

582
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,520
there was no turning back for me.

583
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,429
I'm finished.

584
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,250
I've betrayed the higher-ups' trust.

585
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,920
I've let my superiors down

586
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
after all these years they invested in me.

587
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,190
I've failed my family.

588
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,360
I've failed myself.

589
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,320
I plead guilty.

590
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,530
Peng Hanzhang,

591
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,920
the task force

592
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,150
had actually made a breakthrough
regarding Meng Yu,

593
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,950
but we have lost track of her now.

594
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
Over these years, Hong Mushou

595
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,620
has harmed so many innocent young women.

596
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,730
You must know this, too.

597
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,190
I hope you can use
what little conscience you have left

598
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,000
to actively cooperate
with our investigation

599
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
and provide us with valuable leads,

600
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,180
so we can find Meng Yu
as soon as possible.

601
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,400
Well.

602
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,230
They wanted to send Meng Yu away.

603
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,400
I was the one

604
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,160
who forged the identity.

605
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,000
I've already given you
Kang's contact information.

606
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,920
But I really don't know

607
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,190
where she actually is.

608
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,880
Director Ye.

609
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,000
The phone number Peng Hanzhang provided
has been turned off this whole time.

610
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,320
We can't locate it at the moment.

611
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,960
Keep looking.

612
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,440
Okay.

613
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,570
Captain Zhong.

614
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,230
Send Meng Yu's personal information

615
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,550
to all the stations
and docks immediately.

616
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,510
We must find her.

617
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,910
I'll do it right away.

618
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,950
[Mom]

619
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,470
[Mom]

620
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,810
Son.

621
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,620
Mom.

622
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,480
How are Ziyi and Baoying

623
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,210
doing?

624
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,710
They're fine.

625
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,370
Baoying went to bed early.
He was tired from playing today.

626
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,760
Ziyi

627
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,000
is also much better.

628
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,360
It's getting cold.

629
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,360
Don't...

630
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,840
catch a cold.

631
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:59,630
Don't try to save the thermal underwear
I bought you— just wear it.

632
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,660
I'm wearing it.

633
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,780
Mom.

634
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,150
I'm sorry, Mom.

635
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,810
[Peng is exposed.
Meng Yu must never be found.]

636
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,170
Peng is exposed.

637
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,780
Meng Yu must never be found.

638
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,410
Qin Feng.

639
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,670
He Kang's phone just turned on.

640
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,280
We've tracked the phone's location.

641
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,190
It's in Beishun Town
at the foot of the mountain.

642
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,020
[Pingsha Road parking lot] [Xingfu Road]

643
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,280
There are many residential areas
and commercial streets.

644
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,740
We need your help
to find the exact location.

645
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,020
I've sent you the location.

646
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,460
[Captain Qin]

647
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,030
Previously, Meng Yu was held in

648
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,560
the residential complex
developed by Ma Jin.

649
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,270
Next to that complex,

650
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,070
there are several
commercial office buildings.

651
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,140
They all belonged to Ma Jin.

652
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,510
I think Meng Yu might now be

653
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,280
held in one of those office buildings.

654
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,880
Well,

655
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,420
Mai and I

656
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,280
will go check it out first.

657
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,860
Qin Feng,

658
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,660
I agree with your assessment.

659
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,760
Send people immediately

660
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,480
to thoroughly search those

661
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,960
apartments and office buildings.

662
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,820
Captain Zhong,

663
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,960
notify the bureau immediately.

664
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,880
Locate the phone

665
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
and conduct a search immediately.

666
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,670
-Copy that!
-Copy that!
